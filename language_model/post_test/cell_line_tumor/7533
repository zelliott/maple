Drug resistance is an obstacle to the treatment of zzso zzso Using a unique cell model, we have proven previously that a zzso of zzso cancer cells is more resistant to zzso than are the original zzso zzso zzso small zzso zzso are involved in many biological events in cancer zzso In our study, we explored whether zzso are involved in zzso resistance of zzso cancer zzso zzso cells expressed a lower level of zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression modulated zzso sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso of zzso increased the ability of cells to escape zzso cell death partly through zzso of collagen type I alpha 1 zzso and increased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1/2 and zzso of zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso When combined with zzso treatment, zzso of zzso decreased the amount of the active form of zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso alone or in combination with zzso treatment zzso reduced the zzso of zzso cells in zzso Our data show that zzso of zzso increases zzso resistance in zzso cancer zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso of zzso is a potential zzso to zzso treatment that may have therapeutic zzso
