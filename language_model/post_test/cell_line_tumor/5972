zzso delivery of zzso zzso zzso to regulate gene expression holds a great therapeutic zzso We zzso that gene expression can be zzso with zzso zzso We used zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso as a gene model to test this zzso zzso zzso increased zzso in rat zzso smooth muscle cells and the zzso production from these zzso These increases were attenuated in cells zzso with plasmids containing code for zzso zzso whose expression was controlled by an zzso zzso The production of zzso was zzso zzso The zzso zzso expression in rat zzso zzso cells also was attenuated by zzso with plasmids containing the zzso zzso zzso These results provide zzso evidence for using zzso interference technique to achieve zzso of gene zzso
