zzso zzso heated by an alternating magnetic field could be used to treat zzso either alone or in combination with zzso or zzso However, direct zzso injections suffer from tumor zzso and zzso typically leaving zzso regions, which lead to cancer zzso zzso injection more faithfully loads tumors, but, so far, it has been difficult achieving the necessary concentration in tumors before systemic toxicity zzso Here, we describe use of a magnetic zzso that, with a zzso intravenous dose, achieved a tumor concentration of zzso zzso zzso tumor in a subcutaneous zzso cell zzso mouse model, with a tumor to zzso ratio zzso zzso With an applied field of 38 zzso at zzso zzso tumors could be heated to zzso in 2 minutes, zzso zzso them with zzso zzso precision, leaving surrounding tissue zzso
