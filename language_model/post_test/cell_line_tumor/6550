Studies involving zzso zzso or transient reduction of Group zzso zzso zzso zzso expression have suggested that it is a zzso zzso that regulates cell zzso zzso levels, rates of zzso incorporation into zzso and degradation of excess zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso and some other cells, in contrast, zzso signaling functions have been zzso Using zzso zzso we prepared zzso zzso zzso lines in which zzso expression is zzso suppressed by small interfering zzso Two such zzso zzso zzso cell lines express less than zzso of the zzso of control zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso cells exhibit impaired insulin zzso responses and reduced proliferation zzso zzso zzso mass zzso analyses of PC and zzso species that accumulate in zzso cells cultured with zzso acid suggest that zzso zzso synthesis involves zzso zzso to yield zzso and then zzso zzso via a zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso analyses also indicate that the PC and zzso content and composition of zzso and control zzso cells are nearly zzso as are the rates of zzso incorporation into PC and the composition and zzso of other zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso plays signaling or zzso roles in zzso zzso and proliferation but that stable suppression of its expression does not affect zzso zzso zzso content or composition even under conditions in which zzso is being actively consumed by conversion to zzso This calls into question the zzso of proposed zzso functions for zzso in PC zzso and zzso
