Despite great strides in understanding cancer biology, the role cellular differentiation and three-dimensional zzso structural organization play in zzso and zzso remains zzso Development of 3-D cultures may ultimately provide a model zzso discovery and interpretation of more relevant information for the expression and role of zzso in lung cellular zzso The purpose was to develop traditional zzso zzso and 3-D cultures of a known transformed zzso lung cell line and then determine similarities and differences between cultures in terms of zzso molecular marker expression and zzso A transformed lung cell line zzso was initially zzso with green fluorescent protein zzso in zzso zzso zzso mice were zzso with zzso and observed for zzso zzso was grown as zzso and 3-D cultures under identical zzso zzso comparison for degree of zzso expression between cultures and control tissue were zzso zzso zzso zzso for identification of ultra structures was done and compared between zzso A 3-D zzso containing zzso cells over an immortalized zzso line was zzso The zzso cell line formed tumors and zzso in zzso zzso identified significant zzso and zzso zzso zzso pathology in zzso not seen in zzso Degree of differentiation shows ultra structures and zzso expressions were more representative of control tissue in 3-D than zzso The zzso experiment in 3-D demonstrates the ability of transformed cells to penetrate the zzso of immortalized zzso Development of 3-D cultures will provide a new and powerful tool to study lung biology and zzso
