In this contribution, zzso magnetic zzso zzso have been zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso capable of zzso zzso species with high zzso and zzso zzso zzso via zzso The zzso process is based on zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, anchored on an iron surface through the zzso zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso modified with zzso zzso have then been bonded to the resulting zzso zzso through a zzso zzso Each reaction step has been monitored by using X-ray zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been able to load zzso ammonium zzso such as the zzso drug zzso zzso and the neurotransmitter zzso zzso and release them as free zzso In addition, the introduction of zzso zzso promoted zzso of zzso zzso thus allowing their use in biological zzso
