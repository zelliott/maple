We examined how zzso radiation zzso delivered under either severe zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso affects the expression of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso and the zzso factors vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso 1, 2 and 4 in zzso human zzso zzso zzso was delivered as single doses of 0, 2, 5, 10 and 20 zzso after zzso hypoxic incubation and in zzso zzso zzso at any dose did not affect the cellular protein levels of any of the zzso whereas zzso led to increasing levels of both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso protein were zzso throughout the observation zzso A zzso increase in levels of zzso zzso in the medium occurred after zzso at doses from zzso zzso In hypoxic cells, 20 zzso zzso induced an additional significant increase in zzso relative to zzso hypoxic control cells with elevated baseline zzso levels induced by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were not zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso by zzso treatment induced a reduced baseline zzso at zzso while the relative zzso of zzso by zzso was zzso These data provide evidence that zzso is zzso by zzso by mechanisms independent of zzso zzso
