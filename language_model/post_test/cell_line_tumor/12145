zzso nuclear bodies zzso are dynamic zzso structures harboring numerous zzso or permanently localized zzso zzso the zzso zzso is directly induced by zzso and its expression is critical for zzso host zzso We describe zzso the molecular events following zzso infection that lead to zzso zzso zzso and protection against virus zzso zzso infection zzso zzso zzso through the zzso zzso zzso pathway, increases zzso zzso and zzso its transfer from the zzso to the nuclear zzso These events result in the recruitment of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso of zzso target genes leading to the induction of zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso by small interfering zzso results in higher zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso in zzso zzso This effect, which requires the presence of zzso is transient since zzso targets zzso by inducing its degradation in a zzso and zzso zzso Our results provide evidence of how zzso zzso zzso zzso activity by regulating zzso and zzso thus leading to zzso zzso
