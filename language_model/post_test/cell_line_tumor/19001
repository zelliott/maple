The potent zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso has been demonstrated in a number of zzso studies, but their potency in zzso activity is still in zzso In this report, we demonstrate the potent zzso activity of a novel zzso zzso zzso in mouse zzso zzso colon 26 zzso mice treated with or without zzso zzso zzso Daily oral administration of zzso at doses of zzso zzso from the day of tumor zzso zzso zzso inhibited tumor growth zzso and the zzso zzso was zzso at a dose of 100 zzso In contrast, zzso a well-known zzso zzso did not inhibit tumor growth at doses up to 100 zzso Furthermore, zzso at a dose of 1 zzso or above markedly prolonged the survival time of zzso zzso Administration of 30 zzso zzso from Day 7 combined with a single intravenous treatment of 10 zzso zzso on Day 7 completely zzso the tumors in all zzso mice zzso whereas only in 1 of 10 mice tumor was zzso with zzso zzso Similar combination effects were observed with 10 zzso zzso and 60 zzso zzso zzso Moreover, 10 zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso induced by implanted chambers with colon 26 cells in a zzso air zzso zzso in zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso is a potent zzso agent, especially in combination with conventional zzso agents, and that the zzso activity of zzso may contribute at least in part to its marked zzso zzso
