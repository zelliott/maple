Two novel zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 and 4) have been prepared and examined for their zzso and biological zzso With two zzso zzso zzso linked to the silicon center through the zzso zzso chain, both compounds are highly soluble and remain zzso in zzso The zzso zzso 4 exhibits a weaker zzso zzso and higher efficiency to generate zzso oxygen compared with the zzso counterpart 3 as a result of the heavy atom zzso Both compounds are highly zzso against zzso human zzso zzso and zzso human zzso cells, particularly the zzso zzso 3, of which the zzso values are as low as 6 zzso The lower zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be attributed to its higher zzso tendency in the biological media, leading to a lower efficiency to generate zzso oxygen species inside the zzso Fluorescence microscopic studies have also revealed that compound 3 has a high and selective affinity to the zzso but not the zzso of zzso zzso
