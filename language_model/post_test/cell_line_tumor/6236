To investigate the protective effects of zzso zzso against the zzso toxicity induced by advanced zzso end products zzso and the underlying zzso 

zzso cell line zzso was zzso Cell viability and zzso were assessed using zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities were measured using zzso zzso zzso zzso oxygen species zzso were monitored using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso level was assessed by zzso The expression of zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso precursor protein zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and insulin degrading zzso zzso were measured using quantitative real-time zzso zzso and their protein levels were examined using Western zzso 

zzso zzso zzso significantly increased the cell viability that was reduced by zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso significantly ameliorated zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and production of zzso It also reversed zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression caused by zzso Moreover, it significantly attenuated zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso but induced zzso zzso which promoted degradation of zzso All the effects were blocked by the specific zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso 

zzso protects the zzso cells against zzso injury via its zzso zzso and zzso properties that seems to be zzso by zzso zzso The results suggest a beneficial role for zzso in the treatment of Alzheimer's zzso
