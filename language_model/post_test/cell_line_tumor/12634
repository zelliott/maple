The zzso zzso drug zzso zzso exhibits zzso zzso and zzso zzso properties in human zzso The present study was aimed at investigating whether the zzso acid substitution for the zzso acid group could enhance the in zzso zzso and zzso activities of zzso zzso tools used on this study included analyses of cell zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso and gene zzso Our findings demonstrate that the newly zzso zzso acid zzso of zzso and its zzso and zzso zzso were characterized by a good zzso activity on human pancreatic and colon cancer cells, both in terms of potency zzso mean values from 6 zzso zzso zzso to 64 zzso zzso zzso and efficacy zzso of zzso zzso acid derivatives trigger a higher degree of zzso than zzso acid counterparts, increase zzso expression ratio and induce zzso zzso zzso Most notably, these compounds significantly inhibit zzso growth zzso proliferation of vascular zzso cell zzso at zzso zzso Our data also provide evidence that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso acid were the most active of the series and selective zzso of zzso but not zzso can mimic its effects, suggesting that zzso zzso could only play a partial role in the mechanism of compound zzso In conclusion, these data demonstrate that substitution of the zzso acid group with the zzso acid zzso enhances in zzso zzso zzso and zzso properties of zzso therefore increasing the therapeutic potential of this zzso
