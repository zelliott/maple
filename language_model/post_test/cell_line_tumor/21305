The zzso complex is the major cell zzso responsible for protein zzso and zzso In this article, we show that zzso is a new gene expressed specifically in zzso and zzso zzso during zzso The corresponding human zzso was identified in our previous zzso zzso study and was shown to zzso to the zzso complex as an zzso zzso Furthermore, we show using in zzso zzso that zzso expression pattern is both restricted and zzso zzso It is specific in zzso ribs, and zzso and in the zzso area in zzso zzso and dental zzso In the zzso zzso expression decreases before final zzso zzso while in the zzso area expression is still observed in zzso zzso This is the first time a zzso membrane protein is shown to be expressed in a zzso regulated manner during zzso and cartilage development in zzso
