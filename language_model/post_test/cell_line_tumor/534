zzso of zzso zzso T cells with zzso in the absence of skewing zzso triggers their differentiation into zzso zzso which zzso death of target zzso We show that zzso T cells activated in the presence of the zzso zzso or zzso plus zzso similar to zzso T cells, develop into zzso zzso zzso These cells display greatly suppressed zzso function along with low levels of the zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso B and zzso Instead, these cells express hallmark molecules of zzso program including zzso acid zzso orphan zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The expression of the type 17 master regulator zzso is zzso linked to zzso generation, because its zzso stimulates production of zzso in the presence of zzso or zzso Both, zzso of the type 17 program as well as suppression of zzso differentiation are zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso cells producing zzso but not zzso B are also zzso in zzso a mouse model for multiple zzso Our data point to the existence of mutually exclusive zzso and zzso zzso pathways in zzso and in zzso
