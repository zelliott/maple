zzso of the zzso signaling cascade in the zzso nucleus zzso is a key event that couples light to zzso clock zzso However, we do not fully understand the mechanisms that shape the properties of zzso signaling in the zzso and how these mechanisms may influence overt zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso inhibitor protein zzso controls the zzso of zzso zzso activity in the zzso and zzso zzso of behavioral zzso Light triggers robust zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of a zzso form of zzso in the zzso of transgenic mice blocks zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and severely zzso zzso phase delays in behavioral zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso mice, zzso zzso activity in the zzso is prolonged in the early and late zzso night, resulting in zzso of the zzso and zzso effects of zzso zzso to an advancing light cycle was also accelerated in zzso zzso In relation to the molecular zzso genetic deletion of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein expression in the zzso in the early zzso Additionally, zzso mice displayed enhanced zzso zzso of zzso and the immediate early gene zzso in the zzso in response to a zzso light zzso zzso our data reveal an important role of zzso in the regulation of zzso signaling in the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
