Many zzso therapies, including zzso radiation zzso cause zzso through generation of DNA zzso breaks zzso zzso of therapeutic zzso to DNA zzso sites can amplify this DNA damage, for additional therapeutic zzso zzso we report on two zzso zzso with the zzso electron zzso zzso with dual specificity for both the zzso DNA damage repair signaling protein zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso to a zzso or zzso zzso zzso linked via a nuclear zzso sequence zzso to ensure nuclear zzso zzso zzso was achieved either through a zzso zzso zzso zzso or a zzso zzso zzso Both zzso selectively bound zzso on fixed cells and zzso in cell zzso Both compounds enter zzso cells in an zzso zzso However, only the zzso compound was seen to associate with zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso retention of the zzso compound was prolonged in zzso zzso zzso survival was significantly reduced when cells were exposed to zzso (to induce zzso plus zzso zzso compound compared to either alone and compared to zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso compound in zzso zzso in zzso mice was zzso zzso zzso percent injected zzso zzso but increased significantly to zzso zzso zzso in zzso where zzso was induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso was dependent on zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso delivery of zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso is possible using zzso zzso zzso
