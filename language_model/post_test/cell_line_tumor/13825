We investigated the capacity for vitamin D zzso zzso to zzso the expression of zzso and other genes that may facilitate the zzso zzso of zzso such as testosterone and zzso within prostate zzso We report that exposure to the active hormonal form of vitamin D markedly increased gene expression of zzso and zzso and ultimately achieved levels of zzso zzso zzso activity within zzso prostate cancer cells that were comparable to that observed for zzso cells, an established model of zzso zzso and resulted in the increased turnover of testosterone to its inactive zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso directs zzso and zzso expression through binding to distinct regulatory motifs located within the zzso promoter regions of both zzso The current data highlight the potential application of zzso treatment regimes as a means to limit the zzso of zzso zzso within the tumor zzso
