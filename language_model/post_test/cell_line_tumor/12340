zzso zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso is frequently observed in zzso notably in tumors of zzso zzso Attempts to treat such tumors with zzso growth factor zzso zzso resulted in remarkable success in recent zzso Little is known, however, about the efficacy of this therapy in zzso tract zzso zzso expression of zzso growth factor zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso was assessed in seven human zzso tract cancer cell lines by zzso In addition, zzso sections from 19 patients with zzso zzso were analyzed for zzso growth factor zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso expression by zzso Moreover, we zzso the zzso products representing the entire zzso growth factor zzso coding region of the seven cell lines, and searched for zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso Cell growth zzso by zzso zzso and zzso was studied in zzso by automated cell zzso In addition, the zzso effect of zzso and zzso was studied in a zzso mouse zzso The zzso drug mechanism in this model was assessed by zzso zzso zzso terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso von zzso factor zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed expression of zzso growth factor zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso in all zzso tract cancer cell zzso zzso was zzso in six of 19 zzso zzso human zzso tissue samples, zzso in 16 of 19 zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso in nine of 19 zzso Neither zzso growth factor zzso zzso nor zzso or zzso were found in the seven zzso tract cancer cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso caused a significant growth zzso in zzso however, there was a significant difference in efficacy zzso After 14 days of zzso treatment, using the zzso mouse model, tumors had a significantly reduced volume and mass after zzso but not after zzso treatment, as compared with zzso Reduction of proliferation zzso via the zzso protein zzso zzso induction of zzso and zzso of zzso were the main mechanisms of drug zzso No significant reduction of zzso zzso zzso however, occurred, which may be a possible counter mechanism of the zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso expression was zzso in zzso tract cancer, and zzso zzso exerts marked effects on tumor growth in zzso and in zzso which was strongest for the dual zzso inhibitor zzso zzso further clinical evaluation of this new drug for the treatment of zzso tract cancer is zzso
