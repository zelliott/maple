zzso have been extensively used as effective zzso providing better zzso higher stability and slower release of drugs compared to free drug zzso They are also preferred due to their nontoxic nature as well as their zzso and cell membrane mimicking zzso In this study, we examined zzso integration of a cell penetrating zzso zzso zzso into a zzso zzso of zzso charged zzso zzso zzso in the presence of cholesterol due to its zzso zzso We studied changes in the physical characteristics zzso surface potential and membrane zzso of the zzso zzso as well as in the zzso of zzso and zzso agents due to zzso zzso zzso The activities of zzso integrated zzso systems as drug delivery agents were investigated by using zzso drugs, zzso and zzso Enhancement in zzso zzso due to zzso zzso integration, and enhanced efficacy of the drugs were observed with zzso zzso zzso compared to free zzso
