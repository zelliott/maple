Based on our recent findings that zzso a natural plant zzso found in red grape skins as well as other food products, zzso zzso via a zzso intrinsic zzso in human lung zzso cells, this study is designed to explore whether zzso a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of human lung zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso with zzso enhanced the zzso zzso by accelerating the intrinsic zzso zzso including zzso zzso loss of zzso membrane potential, and zzso of both zzso and zzso Although treatment with zzso alone did not induce zzso zzso zzso with both zzso and zzso not only enhanced zzso zzso but also activated zzso indicating that the zzso zzso zzso may be involved in the synergistic zzso zzso we for the first time demonstrate that zzso zzso enhances the zzso zzso by accelerating zzso intrinsic zzso and initiating zzso pathway, suggesting a possible alternative therapeutic strategy for human lung zzso
