There has been intense interest in the development of selective zzso reactions or zzso chemistry that can proceed in live zzso Until now however, most reactions still require vast surpluses of zzso because of steep zzso and spatial concentration zzso Using zzso modeling and design of zzso zzso zzso we have developed a predictable method for efficient in zzso click zzso Specifically, we show that zzso modified zzso zzso are a key zzso for in zzso zzso chemistry based on the very fast and zzso zzso zzso zzso Using fluorescent zzso for cellular resolution and zzso labeled zzso for whole animal imaging, we show that cancer cell zzso can be easily reacted in zzso This generic strategy should help guide the design of future zzso and find widespread use for different in zzso zzso applications, particularly in the biomedical zzso
