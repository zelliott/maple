Whereas the role of zzso hormone is clearly established in the regulation of cholesterol zzso its involvement in the control of serum zzso zzso levels remains largely zzso zzso proteins 3 and 4 have recently been characterized as potent zzso zzso zzso and therefore as important components of plasma zzso zzso In the present study, the role of zzso hormone in the regulation of both zzso and zzso gene expression was zzso In zzso studies revealed that zzso hormone zzso zzso but not zzso gene expression in zzso zzso Using zzso hormone zzso zzso mice, we show that zzso hormone regulates zzso gene expression in a zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that this zzso occurs at the zzso level in a DNA zzso fashion and requires the zzso zzso to zzso region of the zzso gene zzso Moreover, zzso zzso experiments indicate that the zzso site within this zzso region mediates this zzso zzso Finally, zzso studies and zzso mobility shift zzso suggest that zzso zzso the zzso signaling zzso by zzso its zzso activity without interfering with its zzso zzso Taken together, our results lead to the identification of zzso as a novel zzso target gene and provide a new potential mechanism to explain the zzso properties of zzso zzso in zzso
