A common feature of tumor cells is the zzso expression of zzso channels on their plasma zzso The molecular mechanisms regulating zzso channel expression in cancer cells are still poorly zzso zzso channels that belong to the human zzso gene 1 zzso family are frequently zzso in cancer cells compared to their healthy zzso We describe here a zzso mechanism for the regulation of zzso channel surface expression in cancer zzso This mechanism is based on the activity of zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso These zzso zzso are frequently zzso in human zzso zzso are retained in the zzso zzso and zzso form zzso with different proteins of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso are retained zzso and undergo zzso zzso This process results in decreased zzso current zzso zzso We detailed such a mechanism in zzso systems and confirmed its functioning in tumor cells that zzso express zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso a higher zzso density in tumors, an effect that apparently regulates zzso outgrowth in zzso cells and zzso in leukemia zzso
