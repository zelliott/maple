zzso zzso and many other zzso zzso bacteria use the zzso zzso zzso to assemble zzso surface fibers termed zzso or zzso zzso zzso has two zzso zzso zzso the zzso genes coding for the F1 capsule and the zzso genes coding for the pH 6 zzso The zzso zzso zzso contains additional zzso pathways that are capable of assembling zzso zzso but the roles of these pathways in the zzso of plague are not zzso We constructed deletion zzso in the usher genes for six of the additional zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and usher deletion strains were compared in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso plague infection zzso zzso zzso strains containing deletions in zzso pathways zzso zzso and zzso were attenuated for zzso compared to the zzso strain by the zzso but not zzso routes of infection, suggesting specific roles for these pathways during zzso zzso We examined binding of the zzso zzso zzso and usher deletion strains to zzso human lung zzso cells, zzso human cervical zzso cells, and primary human and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways zzso and zzso were found to contribute to zzso to all host cells tested, whereas zzso zzso was specific for binding to zzso The correlation between the zzso zzso and host cell binding zzso of the usher deletion zzso identifies three of the additional zzso pathways of zzso zzso as zzso interactions with host cells that are important for the zzso of zzso
