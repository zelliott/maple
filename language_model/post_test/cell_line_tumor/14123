Twenty previously zzso fused zzso zzso II zzso zzso compounds were investigated for their potential efficacy in various human cancer cell lines that were derived from different tumor zzso Moreover, different zzso zzso of these cancer cell lines with decreased zzso II expression were zzso In zzso zzso cells merely the compounds zzso and zzso showed zzso in terms of zzso which were similar to that of the classical zzso II inhibitor zzso On the other hand, most of the tested zzso compounds were found more effective in drug-resistant cells than in the zzso zzso ones, and some of the compounds showed high zzso efficacy in several drug-resistant cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited high zzso activities against the drug-resistant zzso zzso and zzso derived from gastric zzso zzso and zzso derived from pancreatic zzso zzso derived from breast cancer, zzso derived from zzso and zzso derived from zzso Furthermore, compound zzso was found highly efficient in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso derived from colon zzso and compound zzso exhibited the highest zzso activity among the tested compounds in the drug-resistant zzso zzso derived from breast zzso In conclusion, compounds BD 13, BD 14, BD 16, D 23 and D 24 may be useful for the treatment of different zzso cancer cells with cross resistance against zzso zzso zzso zzso
