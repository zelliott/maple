Cancer stem cells reportedly participate in the zzso of some zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso with abundant zzso zzso zzso we zzso examined zzso (29 zzso and conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso with reference to cancer stem zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso into 3 types based on small zzso cells at the periphery of tumor cell zzso Of 29 cases of zzso zzso zzso 21 contained small zzso zzso zzso those cells were positive for zzso 7 and zzso cassette zzso zzso In 11 cases, those small tumor cells were also positive for zzso 19, neural cell zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso 1), whereas 10 cases did not show such additional expression zzso zzso The remaining 8 tumors did not contain small tumor cells with stem cell features zzso zzso In the central parts of tumor zzso zzso cells got zzso markers and lost expression of neural cell zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso suggesting zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso a zzso zzso was also detected in those small tumor zzso Culture cells extracted as zzso zzso from zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso expressed more intensely zzso 7 and 19, neural cell zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and transforming growth factor zzso than did zzso population zzso Small tumor cells with stem cell features in zzso zzso zzso may zzso to side population of culture cells and might be involved in zzso of zzso zzso zzso
