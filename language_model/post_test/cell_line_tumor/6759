zzso of the zzso protein zzso has been reported in over 20 types of zzso While a number of factors have been demonstrated to regulate zzso gene transcription, little is known about the mechanisms responsible for its zzso In this study, we have demonstrated that zzso protein stability was regulated by zzso in prostate cancer zzso We found that exposure of prostate cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso to zzso resulted in a rapid and significant zzso of the zzso protein zzso The fact that neither the zzso promoter activity nor the zzso zzso level was affected by the zzso treatment suggested that the decrease in zzso protein was not due to the suppression of gene zzso In addition, the zzso of the zzso protein was decreased in both cell lines in the presence of zzso and the addition of an zzso inhibitor zzso prior to the zzso treatment completely blocked the effect of the zzso zzso protein zzso Furthermore, introduction of a zzso sequence into the zzso region of the zzso zzso which has been shown to stabilize the zzso was able to protect the zzso protein from zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso through zzso of the zzso degradation zzso in prostate cancer zzso Interestingly, in both zzso and zzso cells, the decrease of zzso protein was associated with the zzso of zzso pathway, as evidenced by the increased expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso failed to zzso zzso in a zzso of zzso cells that was resistant to zzso zzso These results further suggest that the zzso of zzso may facilitate zzso zzso in prostate cancer zzso In conclusion, our findings indicate that zzso protein may be regulated by zzso through the zzso degradation zzso and the stability of the zzso protein appears to correlate with the sensitivity of zzso zzso
