zzso is a complex zzso process, which requires the concerted action of many genes and is the primary cause of cancer zzso Both pathways that regulate zzso enhancement and those that regulate its suppression contribute to the zzso dissemination zzso To identify new zzso zzso we set up a forward genetic screen in a mouse zzso We zzso a zzso zzso interference zzso library into the zzso zzso breast cancer cell line and zzso transplanted the cells into mouse zzso fat zzso We then selected cells that could zzso to the lung and identified an zzso for the zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso expression of zzso in a highly zzso zzso breast cancer cell line zzso the ability of cells to zzso from the zzso fat pad to the zzso We also show that suppression of zzso expression promotes breast cancer cell invasion and zzso transition zzso and that zzso protein functions by directly binding to the promoter region of zzso (which encodes a key zzso regulator in breast zzso to inhibit its zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso expression is significantly zzso in primary human breast cancer samples and that the combined expression pattern of zzso and zzso can serve as a potential zzso for zzso zzso zzso in breast zzso
