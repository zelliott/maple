zzso zzso cancer zzso is an extremely aggressive tumor characterized by marked zzso zzso transition, which zzso almost zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have recently emerged as potential zzso zzso To establish whether zzso could be a target of zzso gamma zzso we first examined zzso gamma protein expression in a panel of six zzso cell lines and then studied the zzso effects of two zzso gamma zzso zzso and zzso that belong to the class of zzso zzso gamma protein was present and functional in all zzso cell zzso Both zzso and zzso showed complex biological effects in zzso cells, including zzso of zzso and zzso growth and migration, and increased zzso zzso zzso growth zzso was associated with cell cycle arrest and changes in cell cycle regulators, such as an increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso a decrease of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with a decrease of zzso expression and zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso antagonized zzso biological effects by zzso zzso and zzso zzso deleted from zzso 10 with subsequent zzso of the zzso zzso signaling zzso Finally, zzso increased the expression of zzso differentiation zzso In conclusions, these data suggest that zzso gamma zzso induce a partial zzso of the zzso zzso transition in zzso cells by multiple zzso zzso gamma zzso may, therefore, have a role in the zzso therapy currently used to slow down zzso growth and zzso
