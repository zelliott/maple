zzso regulate adhesive zzso interactions and mediate survival zzso On the other hand, zzso or free zzso fragments of zzso induce zzso in many cell types zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso expression protects zzso stem cells from zzso whereas the role of the zzso zzso zzso has not been zzso In this study we report that suspended zzso undergo zzso through the zzso of zzso independently of the zzso zzso zzso Indeed, zzso zzso zzso induced zzso in short hairpin zzso zzso death zzso zzso Moreover, before and during suspension, zzso directly associated with zzso zzso which in turn zzso and progressively zzso shedding the zzso zzso zzso was expressed only in the zzso in a zzso manner and remained zzso during zzso At zzso as zzso was located close to the nucleus, zzso zzso with zzso and zzso with zzso zzso was activated earlier in zzso zzso zzso and these cells underwent a higher rate of zzso than mock zzso In contrast, zzso was not activated in small interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that when zzso is zzso zzso is responsible for zzso zzso in human zzso
