We have reported the development of a novel fusion protein zzso consisting of an zzso zzso of zzso linked to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The present study compared the effect of this novel zzso on the proliferation of human zzso skin, breast zzso and pancreatic cancer cell zzso 

The zzso zzso and a zzso zzso with reduced zzso activity, were produced by zzso zzso The effect of treatment with zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the proliferation of the cancer cells was measured in zzso using an zzso zzso 

The zzso effect of the zzso was found to be significantly greater than that of zzso alone or the zzso zzso In addition, the zzso produced a greater zzso effect on an zzso cancer cell line than on comparable normal, zzso zzso Further, the zzso produced a zzso zzso of the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cell zzso 

These results suggest that this zzso is a potent and selective inhibitor of the proliferation of various cancer cell lines and has potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of various zzso zzso
