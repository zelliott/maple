Recent studies have revealed the essential role of zzso binding protein 4 zzso in insulin zzso However, the impact of zzso on zzso zzso the common zzso manifestation in insulin resistance states, and the underlying mechanism remain zzso The present study was designed to examine the effect of zzso on zzso regulatory zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso Treatment with human zzso zzso zzso significantly induced zzso zzso zzso synthesis in zzso cells and this effect is zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment enhanced the levels of mature zzso and its nuclear zzso thereby increasing the expression of zzso zzso including fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso strongly zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at both the zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is necessary and sufficient for the zzso zzso of zzso in response to zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso element binding protein zzso was identified as the target zzso factor involved in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso as a result of zzso on zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso infusion induced zzso zzso and consequently accelerated zzso zzso and plasma zzso in zzso mice, a phenomenon not observed in zzso knockout zzso 

These findings reveal a novel mechanism by which zzso achieves its effects on zzso zzso zzso
