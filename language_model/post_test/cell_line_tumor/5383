Little was known about biological activities of compounds from the medicinal mushroom of the zzso zzso A zzso from the zzso zzso has now been isolated and its properties zzso The isolation procedure included zzso exchange zzso on zzso and zzso and fast protein liquid zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso The zzso was composed of two identical zzso each with a molecular mass of 16 zzso Its zzso zzso sequence showed little similarity to sequences of other zzso zzso The zzso activity of the zzso was stable at temperatures up to 50 degrees C, and in zzso and zzso solutions with zzso less than 25 zzso It was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso but enhanced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso showed zzso activity toward zzso zzso zzso cells and breast cancer zzso cells with an zzso of zzso zzso and approximately zzso zzso zzso It exhibited zzso reverse zzso zzso activity with an zzso of zzso zzso When compared with zzso zzso zzso the only zzso zzso published to date, zzso zzso zzso differs in zzso behavior, molecular mass, zzso zzso and effect of zzso on zzso zzso In the case of the zzso from zzso zzso its zzso zzso and zzso reverse zzso zzso activities have not been zzso
