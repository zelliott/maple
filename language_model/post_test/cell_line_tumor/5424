zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein that acts at the intersection of energy metabolism and stress response in tumor zzso To zzso the role of zzso in zzso stress, we analyzed its activity, protein level, zzso distribution, and zzso mobility in human zzso cells zzso and zzso after treatment with zzso zzso and zzso After treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso inactive zzso accumulated in the zzso zzso on zzso recovery after zzso with green fluorescent zzso fusion protein in the live cells treated with zzso demonstrated reduced mobility of green fluorescent zzso inside the nucleus, indicative of interactions with nuclear zzso components after zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso interference stopped cell zzso and induced cell cycle arrest in zzso phase via zzso stabilization, and zzso of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Neither zzso zzso nor cell cycle arrest was detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso more resistant to treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso did not significantly alter cellular sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso of cell cycle arrest in zzso zzso cells via zzso zzso suggests that zzso agents may have a zzso effect in cancer zzso Our results define zzso as an important zzso of cellular sensitivity to zzso chemotherapy because of its regulatory zzso
