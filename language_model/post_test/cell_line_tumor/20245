The zzso syndromes zzso comprise a group of disorders characterized by zzso progression from zzso to acute zzso leukemia zzso They display exaggerated zzso in early zzso but lose this behavior during evolution to zzso The molecular basis for loss of zzso is zzso To investigate this critical event, we analyzed zzso zzso zzso zzso implicated as a critical zzso of cell survival control in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso activates zzso through its production of 3' zzso In turn, the zzso are zzso by two zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso We studied primary zzso bone zzso cells and bone zzso sections by western zzso zzso zzso and quantitative zzso for components of the zzso zzso signaling zzso We reported zzso activated zzso variable levels of zzso and zzso decreased zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not the zzso form, inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso which target zzso were increased in zzso zzso cells compared with their normal zzso zzso binding of zzso to the 3' untranslated region of zzso was confirmed by zzso reporter zzso zzso of a zzso cell line with zzso resulted in loss of zzso protein zzso These data suggest that zzso and zzso pathways could serve as clinical zzso for disease zzso and that zzso and zzso might serve as novel therapeutic targets in zzso
