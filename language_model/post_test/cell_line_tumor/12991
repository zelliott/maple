zzso breast zzso are zzso zzso zzso negative, zzso zzso negative, zzso leukemia viral zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso tumors with an aggressive clinical behavior that lacks effective molecular targets for zzso We reported previously that the zzso zzso cell lines display high zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso whose zzso in the zzso zzso suppressed their zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso is involved in the zzso zzso zzso Here, we report that enhanced zzso zzso which is exclusively observed in the zzso zzso rather than the zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso cells, is caused by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The stability of zzso zzso and zzso activity driven by the zzso promoter are similar in the zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso in the zzso zzso Furthermore, treatment of the zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, significantly increased zzso zzso Although DNA zzso of the zzso locus was not zzso zzso expression also increased when the zzso zzso was treated with zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso in addition to DNA zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the closed zzso structure zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso suppresses zzso expression in the zzso zzso whereas disruption of these suppression mechanisms leads to enhanced zzso expression and the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Thus, zzso and genes induced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso could be therapeutic targets of zzso breast zzso
