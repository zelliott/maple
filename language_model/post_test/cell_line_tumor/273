To determine the in zzso zzso zzso and in zzso efficacy of zzso zzso containing zzso zzso compared to a conventional zzso treatment zzso 

The zzso zzso of zzso labeled zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso efficacy was evaluated in two separate studies using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consisted of intravenous zzso or zzso zzso with or without zzso local zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso with or without zzso The tumor diameter and animal weight was monitored at various zzso zzso changes were evaluated in zzso zzso 

The tumor diameter increased at a constant rate for all the groups between days zzso After a single zzso zzso dose of zzso containing zzso showed significant reduction in tumor diameter on day 15 when compared to control, zzso and intravenous zzso zzso The tumor diameter reached a zzso decrease zzso by day 18, and the difference was reduced to approximately zzso by day zzso zzso similar results were observed in a separate study containing zzso when administered zzso
