zzso cells store excess fatty acids as neutral lipids in zzso zzso called zzso droplets zzso Using a simple zzso zzso and zzso software we established a high zzso screen for zzso formation in zzso cells in order to identify small zzso molecules affecting zzso zzso zzso an zzso extract library from Australian marine organisms we identified 114 extracts that produced either an increase or a decrease in zzso formation in fatty zzso zzso cells with varying degrees of zzso We selected for further analysis a zzso extract derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis zzso zzso identified a family of related molecules within this extract with unique structural features, a subset of which reduced zzso zzso We selected one of these zzso zzso zzso for more detailed cellular zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso A1 was observed in both zzso cells and zzso zzso The activity of zzso A1 was dose dependent with 20 zzso zzso zzso formation and zzso zzso by zzso in the presence of 50 zzso zzso zzso Using a fluorescent fatty acid analogue we found that zzso A1 significantly reduces the zzso zzso of fatty acids and results in the formation of distinct fatty acid zzso in both cultured cells and in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In summary we have shown using readily accessible software and a relatively simple zzso system that we can identify and isolate zzso molecules from marine zzso which affect the formation of zzso and the metabolism of fatty acids both in zzso and in zzso
