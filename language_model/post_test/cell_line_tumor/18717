The effects were examined of selected zzso medium zzso components on the proliferation of zzso zzso zzso cells and on the production of zzso and zzso Human zzso cells and rat zzso cells were cultured for 24, 48 and 72 hours on glass coated with type I zzso zzso or zzso More pronounced proliferation was demonstrated by zzso cells grown on zzso or collagen in comparison with the control and less pronounced proliferation was typical of cells grown on zzso On the other hand, zzso cells were more markedly manifest on any zzso zzso than that on zzso zzso in the proliferation were paralleled by changes in the expression of CT and zzso
