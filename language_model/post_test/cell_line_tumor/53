To detect and repair damaged DNA, zzso proteins need to overcome the barrier of condensed zzso to gain access to DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the fundamental mechanisms used by cells to relax zzso in DNA zzso However, the mechanism zzso their recruitment to DNA zzso remains largely zzso zzso (also known as zzso is an early zzso protein that is zzso in human primary zzso Here we report a previously unknown function of zzso as a regulator of the zzso zzso zzso complex zzso in DNA zzso After damage to DNA, zzso increases its interaction with zzso through zzso zzso on the zzso zzso This increase in binding affinity provides a means by which zzso can be specifically recruited to and maintained at DNA zzso Loss of zzso causes impaired zzso relaxation as a result of decreased association of zzso with zzso This explains the decreased recruitment of repair proteins to DNA zzso and the reduced efficiency of repair in zzso cells, resulting in impaired cell survival after DNA zzso Our findings therefore identify zzso as a key zzso that links zzso zzso with response to DNA damage in the control of DNA repair, and its dysfunction contributes to human zzso
