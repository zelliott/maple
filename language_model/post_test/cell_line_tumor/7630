zzso zzso also commonly known as Ball Moss, is endemic to Jamaica and some parts of the Caribbean and South zzso The plant, despite being reported to be used in folk medicine, had not previously been evaluated for its zzso zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso activity zzso zzso 

The zzso activity of the crude zzso extract of the T zzso was evaluated in zzso in five different zzso cancer cell lines zzso cancer - zzso breast cancer zzso zzso zzso melanoma and a zzso zzso from a transgenic mouse zzso using the zzso blue zzso The crude extract was also evaluated in zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso was used for zzso and determination of zzso 

The crude zzso extract of T zzso demonstrated zzso activity against all the cell lines, killing zzso 50% of the cells at a concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were inhibited by up to zzso compared to control in the in zzso study zzso zzso zzso There was evidence of DNA fragmentation and a decrease in cell viability on zzso zzso The zzso extract showed no toxic effect in the mice at a dose of 200 zzso 

Our data suggest that T zzso has great potential as an zzso agent and that one of its mechanisms of cell kill and zzso zzso is by the induction of zzso
