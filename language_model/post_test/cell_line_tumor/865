To examine the changes in the function and expression of zzso resistance gene zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso cell following zzso for determining the sequential order of zzso and chemotherapy in the treatment of zzso 

The expressions of zzso gene and its protein zzso as well as the function of zzso zzso were examined in zzso cells before and after zzso exposure by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso Western zzso and flow zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso cells induced a long-term zzso of zzso gene and zzso and reduction in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso decreases the chemotherapy sensitivity of zzso cell, and induction chemotherapy should be therefore performed before zzso in the treatment of advanced zzso
