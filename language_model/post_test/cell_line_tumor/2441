The nuclear zzso zzso zzso is a key component of the generic zzso complex involved in zzso zzso zzso a key regulator of zzso cell growth, is frequently zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we report that loss of zzso zzso control of zzso due to zzso contributes to zzso growth in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso An analysis of zzso genes in zzso cells led to the identification of zzso as a zzso target of zzso zzso level was zzso related to zzso status in various leukemia zzso zzso was associated with the zzso promoter zzso and a reporter driven by the zzso promoter was effectively zzso by zzso zzso zzso loss with zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso significantly zzso zzso levels regardless of the zzso zzso zzso status and promoted the differentiation of zzso zzso While stimulation of the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso triggered zzso loss, zzso zzso zzso blockade of zzso zzso binding led to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso induced proliferation of zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso repression of zzso might be crucial for limiting the contribution of the zzso signaling zzso on the growth potential of zzso cells and its deregulation due to zzso loss in zzso could contribute to zzso growth by zzso a zzso advantage to the zzso zzso zzso restoration of zzso function could thus be a useful approach in restricting the contribution of the zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso
