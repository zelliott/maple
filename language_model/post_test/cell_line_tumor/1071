zzso prostate cancer cells are highly resistant to several zzso drugs and are characterized by the appearance of zzso zzso In this study, we identified the critical role of zzso inhibitor of zzso protein zzso a potent zzso factor, in zzso chemotherapy resistance in an zzso zzso human prostate cancer cell zzso zzso reveal that zzso cells were highly resistant to zzso but this resistance was overridden when the cells were treated for a prolonged time zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso A decrease in levels of zzso and zzso and an increase in zzso activity were identified to be key factors in zzso sensitivity zzso to zzso decrease in cell zzso at later time zzso In contrast, tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment caused a zzso to 50% decrease in cell viability within 6 hours zzso zzso 135 to 145 zzso However, increasing zzso or prolonged treatment with TRAIL did not change drug zzso A significant increase in zzso activity was observed with TRAIL treatment with no apparent change in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression using an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso and increased zzso zzso Combination of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity by decreasing the zzso from zzso zzso with zzso alone to 9 to 20 zzso and decreasing incubation time required for activity from 96 to 24 zzso Similarly, TRAIL in combination with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced TRAIL potency by 12- to zzso In conclusion, zzso of zzso expression is essential for therapeutic zzso and enhanced chemotherapy zzso in zzso prostate cancer zzso
