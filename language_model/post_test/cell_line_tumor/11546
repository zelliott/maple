Among various naturally occurring compounds which have been extracted from zzso zzso zzso has shown different pharmacological effects zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Here, zzso effects on human zzso leukemia cell line, zzso were zzso In this study, we examined the effects of 24 and 48 h of zzso treatment zzso 250 and 500 zzso on the viability of zzso cell zzso Moreover, probable zzso zzso zzso oxygen species zzso production variations along with zzso treatment consequences on DNA, were zzso 

zzso from zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso treatment at 500 zzso significantly reduced cell viability ( zzso DNA fragmentation was recorded to be significantly increased at higher doses of zzso following 24 and 48 h ( zzso According to our results, while zzso was detected at all zzso necrosis detected at the highest dose, zzso In comparison with control, zzso production was reduced at 50 and 250 zzso 

In accordance with previous reports, zzso exhibited mild zzso effects on a leukemia cell line which might be zzso through the increase of DNA zzso
