zzso of the molecular zzso zzso have been shown to enhance tumor cell zzso To begin to address the mechanism responsible, we have determined the effect of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso on the DNA damage response to zzso Exposure of zzso tumor cells to zzso which results in zzso inhibited the repair of DNA zzso breaks according to zzso zzso zzso and the neutral comet zzso This repair zzso was associated with reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso and a disruption of zzso zzso These data suggest that the previously established zzso reduction in zzso activity reduces its interaction with zzso and thus accounts for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was also found to abrogate the zzso of the zzso and zzso cell cycle zzso Associated with these events was a reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso formation in zzso zzso Although no interaction between zzso and zzso was zzso zzso was found to interact with the zzso zzso zzso zzso exposure reduced the ability of the zzso components to form nuclear zzso after zzso Moreover, zzso exposure reduced the interaction between zzso and zzso although no degradation of the zzso complex was zzso These results suggest that the diminished zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells was the result of a compromise in the function of the zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso can contribute to the DNA damage response to radiation affecting both DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint zzso
