The zzso of carbon zzso zzso by zzso cells and their distribution within cells is being widely studied in recent years due to their increasing use for biomedical zzso The two main imaging techniques used are zzso zzso zzso and transmission electron zzso zzso The former, however, requires labeling of the zzso with fluorescent zzso while the latter is a zzso technique that is zzso for in zzso zzso zzso zzso on the other hand, presents a zzso straightforward and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be used to image the zzso inside cells, exploiting the strong zzso signal connected to different zzso modes of the zzso In addition, cellular zzso such as the zzso zzso and the nucleus, can be zzso We first validate our method by showing that only when using the zzso G band for zzso mapping accurate results can be zzso as mapping of the zzso breathing mode zzso only shows a small fraction of zzso We then take a closer look at the exact zzso of the zzso inside cells after folate zzso zzso and show that, after 8-10 h zzso the majority of zzso are localized around the zzso In zzso zzso imaging has enormous potential for imaging zzso inside cells, which is yet to be fully zzso
