Cancer zzso unveils many zzso zzso including some zzso 20 zzso zzso The zzso messages have been found in the corresponding zzso however, whether they could be translated to proteins still requires more zzso zzso we proposed a zzso strategy to profile the expression status of human zzso genes zzso in zzso zzso The data of zzso and zzso (the zzso bound with zzso translating zzso revealed that zzso of the coding genes on zzso were detected with zzso signals in three liver cancer cell lines, whereas of the zzso identified, only zzso of the zzso coding genes were zzso The high amount of overlapping of identified genes in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso translating zzso and the consistent distribution of the abundance averages of zzso and zzso along the zzso zzso in three liver cancer cell lines indicate that the zzso information is efficiently transmitted from zzso to zzso stage, zzso and zzso Of the zzso genes identified in zzso and zzso 136 were found to contain zzso with zzso sites, and zzso of these zzso existed only in zzso cell lines, suggesting them as the zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that 16 genes with 20 zzso sites were detected with reliable zzso signals, and some zzso were further validated by the zzso zzso With the integration of the zzso data at the three expression zzso therefore, we are able to achieve the overall view of the gene expression of zzso which is constructive in understanding the potential trend of zzso genes in a cell line and exploration of a new type of markers related to zzso
