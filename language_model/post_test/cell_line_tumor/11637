The sensitivity of only a few tumors to zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be explained by the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso domain zzso In addition, such zzso were rarely found in tumor types other than zzso such as pancreatic and head and neck zzso In this study we sought to zzso mechanisms of resistance to zzso therapies in tumors that do not harbor zzso zzso zzso in order to identify markers capable of guiding the decision to incorporate these drugs into zzso zzso Here we show that zzso activity was markedly decreased during the evolution of resistance to the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso with a zzso increase of zzso gene 6 zzso a negative regulator of zzso through the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso activity, which was more accurately predicted by the ratio of zzso highly correlated with zzso sensitivity in panels of cancer cell lines of different tissue zzso zzso testing and analysis in a zzso followed cohort of lung cancer patients treated with zzso alone demonstrated higher response rates and a marked increased in progression free survival for patients with a low zzso ratio zzso 100 days, zzso
