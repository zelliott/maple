zzso a small zzso first isolated from the fermented broth of zzso zzso zzso exhibits zzso activities through an undefined zzso The present study evaluated the effects and mechanisms of zzso on the growth and death of zzso human lung cancer zzso zzso significantly inhibited the proliferation of zzso cells in a zzso manner, with a 50% growth zzso zzso value of approximately zzso at zzso zzso significantly decreased the expression of zzso D1 and E and induced zzso cell cycle arrest and a subsequent increase in the zzso phase zzso zzso also markedly reduced the expression of zzso and activated zzso and zzso increased zzso oxygen species zzso generation, caused the collapse of the zzso membrane potential zzso and enhanced zzso production, thus triggering zzso in the zzso zzso Taken together, zzso exerts zzso effects on human lung cancer cells through the induction of cell cycle arrest and zzso zzso testing of its effects in zzso is warranted to evaluate its potential as a therapeutic agent against lung zzso
