Selective zzso zzso zzso zzso have been suggested as therapeutic agents for treatment of zzso zzso One such zzso zzso was recently in clinical trials for treatment of zzso zzso and zzso We present the crystal structures of zzso zzso zzso zzso binding domain zzso with zzso and the zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso This is the first report of steroid nuclear zzso crystal structures with zzso and zzso These structures show zzso in a different zzso than zzso zzso with zzso zzso We zzso zzso in zzso zzso to understand further the zzso mechanism of zzso We confirmed previous findings that zzso demonstrated zzso but not zzso in a zzso zzso zzso and the zzso breast cancer cell alkaline zzso activity zzso zzso but not zzso zzso recruited the zzso zzso and zzso However, zzso strongly recruited the zzso zzso in a manner similar to zzso Unlike zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso could be displaced with equal affinity by zzso or zzso zzso We further showed that it zzso activated zzso cell gene expression of zzso and zzso and antagonized zzso expression of both zzso In rat zzso zzso cells, zzso demonstrated partial zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso gene zzso In the rat zzso zzso zzso demonstrated no zzso ability to oppose zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso recruits zzso and zzso compared to zzso or zzso and this specific zzso interaction profile is apparently insufficient to oppose zzso activity in rat zzso
