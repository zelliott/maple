zzso cancer is one of the most deadly human zzso resulting in over 15,000 deaths in the US each zzso A reliable method that could predict disease outcome would improve care of patients with this zzso The main aim of this study is to identify novel zzso zzso for advanced zzso zzso 

We hypothesized that zzso zzso may predict outcome and have examined the zzso value of these small zzso molecules on disease outcome zzso zzso are a newly identified family of zzso zzso zzso and recent studies have shown that zzso are extensively involved in the tumor development zzso We have zzso the expression of zzso in advanced zzso cancer using a novel zzso platform and correlated zzso expression profiles with disease zzso 

By performing zzso expression profiling analysis of 55 advanced zzso tumors, we have shown that three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso cluster are significantly associated with cancer recurrence and overall zzso Further target analysis indicates that these zzso zzso target multiple genes that are involved in cancer zzso In addition, we have also shown that zzso of this zzso cluster zzso zzso cancer cell zzso 

zzso may be used as a zzso marker for zzso cancer outcome, and low-level expression of zzso zzso in this cluster predicts poor zzso In addition, our study suggests that zzso zzso could play an important regulatory role in zzso zzso
