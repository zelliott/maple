zzso was first characterized as a nuclear factor that binds DNA zzso breaks in zzso zzso DNA zzso However, recent studies have shown that zzso is also found in the zzso and binds zzso preventing zzso cell zzso We have shown that, in zzso cells, the binding between zzso and zzso depends on the zzso status of zzso such that, when zzso is zzso zzso is released from zzso triggering cell zzso Thus, to survive, in zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso status is carefully regulated such that zzso is maintained in a zzso state, keeping zzso zzso with zzso We have shown that zzso of zzso protein zzso a known zzso that zzso zzso releases zzso from zzso triggering zzso Although we have shown that blocking zzso activity using zzso zzso also triggers zzso zzso and zzso cell death, the targets of these zzso zzso in zzso cells remain zzso Here, we demonstrate that, in zzso cells, zzso zzso 6 zzso binds zzso and zzso in the zzso and that knocking down zzso or using an zzso inhibitor triggers zzso cell zzso Our results show that zzso regulates the interaction between zzso and zzso in zzso cells and may be a therapeutic target in this pediatric solid zzso
