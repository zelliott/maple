The zzso zzso is the zzso for the basement membrane protein zzso Recent studies suggest that zzso zzso expression in invasive breast zzso may be a poor zzso zzso Because we have not had reliable results with commercially available zzso for the zzso detection of zzso zzso in archival zzso zzso we designed a probe to detect zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso for zzso zzso was performed on zzso tissue sections of 25 invasive breast zzso using a zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso was performed on corresponding frozen tumor sections using two commercially available zzso to the zzso zzso zzso All cases positive for zzso protein by one or both zzso were also positive for zzso zzso by in zzso zzso but three cases with zzso zzso expression were negative by zzso with both zzso These findings suggest that in zzso zzso appears to be a sensitive method for detecting zzso zzso zzso but it appears to identify some cases that either lack zzso protein or express zzso not recognized with commercial zzso directed to particular zzso or zzso zzso
