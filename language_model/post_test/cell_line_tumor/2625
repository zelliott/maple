There are multiple lines of evidence showing that environmental zzso including pesticides may contribute to zzso cell zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that acts on insect zzso zzso Although the action of zzso is restricted to insect zzso or muscular zzso systems, a few studies have assessed the effects of this zzso on zzso cell death distinct from an zzso To determine the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso cell death, we evaluated the ability of this chemical to induce zzso stress and studied the involvement of zzso activated protein zzso zzso in zzso zzso stress in human zzso zzso zzso zzso Exposure of zzso cells to zzso led to the production of zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso cell death via zzso of zzso and zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso zzso attenuated zzso cell death and zzso production induced by zzso These results indicated that zzso stress plays a central role in zzso zzso zzso complex I activity was also inhibited by zzso zzso These finding indicate that zzso triggers intrinsic zzso via the zzso signaling zzso that is initiated by the generation of zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment induced zzso of zzso zzso zzso of these protein zzso by zzso was involved in the onset of zzso as zzso specific to these zzso protect against zzso cell death as well as zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso is zzso primarily by the generation of zzso and zzso of zzso members followed by zzso of the intrinsic zzso zzso
