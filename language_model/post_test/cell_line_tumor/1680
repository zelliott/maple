We describe a method to detect the expression of a surface protein in single cells without prior labeling or manipulation using a zzso zzso When the protein is expressed on a cell surface, it zzso transient bond formation with an immobilized zzso as the cell is pumped through a zzso channel, resulting in a specific decrease in the cell's zzso We were able to detect the expression of zzso 13 zzso alpha 2 zzso zzso expressed on zzso cells, a zzso of zzso human breast cancer cells with a unique lung zzso zzso The detection of cells with high expression of the protein was near zzso sensitive and zzso zzso We also provided proof of principle of zzso by tracking the same cell over two, zzso zzso The method is zzso and cells can be collected for zzso The system can identify positive cells in a cell zzso This method will have a potential impact in analyzing cancer cells when only a few are available, such as the case with needle zzso and when labeling and manipulation result in cell zzso
