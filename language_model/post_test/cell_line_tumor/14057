zzso the expression of human zzso resistance zzso 1 gene in bone zzso cells to prevent or circumvent bone zzso toxicity from chemotherapy agent is a high priority of dose zzso zzso In this study, we have used a zzso model to investigate the zzso effect of zzso gene by zzso zzso zzso containing and expressing the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso cells were served as target of zzso gene transferred by the mediation of zzso zzso and zzso into the zzso mice with zzso ray exposure in zzso zzso zzso 10, and 20 zzso suppressed tumor growth of the zzso significantly in a zzso mode if supported by suitable peripheral zzso zzso count revealed that the mice that had received zzso cells showed a significant increase in zzso count compared with their zzso zzso zzso The function and expression of zzso gene were detected by flow zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression could be detected in zzso zzso contained measurable amounts of zzso zzso Tail vein blood and tumor tissue detected zzso DNA but no zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of infected zzso cells obtained 6 weeks later showed high levels of zzso zzso Based on these results we conclude that zzso drug resistance gene therapy may provide some degree of zzso and so can increase the chemotherapy dose to kill tumor zzso
