The zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene family contains zzso 2 and zzso zzso is a negative regulator of zzso but little is known about the function of zzso To determine the role of zzso in the progression of zzso we performed zzso zzso zzso of zzso in a human zzso cell line zzso zzso of zzso expression resulted in: rapid zzso loss of zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso increased spontaneous zzso enhanced cell zzso and increased invasion capability of zzso cells in zzso These findings indicate that zzso possesses distinct functions compared with zzso and validate the attractiveness of zzso as a target in zzso zzso
