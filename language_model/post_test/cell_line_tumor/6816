zzso zzso zzso is widely used as a chemical intermediate in the production of zzso zzso asthma is related to its zzso of zzso activity in most affected workers, but the relevant mechanisms are zzso zzso zzso zzso is the main zzso of zzso TDI and zzso have in common the basic zzso zzso zzso is an abused zzso affecting zzso signal zzso by influencing the function of zzso gated zzso channel zzso including zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso acid type A zzso zzso zzso To understand the actions of TDI and zzso on zzso gated zzso channels, we investigated their effects on the changes of zzso calcium concentration zzso while stimulating zzso in human zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso in zzso cells, and zzso receptors in bovine adrenal zzso zzso Our results showed that both TDI and zzso suppressed the zzso rise induced by the potent zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso Similar but stronger suppression of zzso zzso rise occurred in zzso zzso TDI and zzso also partially suppressed the zzso c rise induced by zzso in bovine adrenal zzso zzso We conclude that TDI and zzso can act on zzso gated zzso channel zzso Our findings suggest that TDI and zzso might have some zzso that will need to be zzso
