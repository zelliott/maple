Recently, we identified zzso zzso zzso protein zzso as a novel zzso and revealed that treatment of cultured cells with zzso zzso insulin signal zzso The aim of this study was to examine the impact of zzso on zzso metabolism in zzso zzso of zzso zzso in mice significantly lowered blood zzso levels in zzso tolerance zzso Administration of zzso to mice for 10 days increased serum insulin levels, whereas the contents of zzso zzso and zzso were significantly zzso zzso of calcium influx and insulin zzso by zzso was observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso function by specific zzso inhibited zzso insulin zzso These results provide novel insights into the zzso functions of zzso in zzso
