In zzso cells, zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso factors such as zzso acid, zzso zzso and zzso 3A require the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso second zzso zzso zzso and zzso of active zzso is sufficient to induce zzso zzso in both zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso However, how zzso are regulated or how they induce zzso zzso is not well zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso induced by zzso is dependent on its interaction with the low molecular weight G protein zzso We identified the interaction site between zzso and zzso and generated a point zzso of zzso that no longer interacts with zzso zzso Using this zzso we show that zzso controls the plasma membrane zzso of zzso and thereby the zzso synthesis of zzso required to induce zzso zzso zzso of this zzso in other zzso zzso also zzso their ability to induce zzso zzso and to zzso at the zzso To clarify how increased levels of zzso induce zzso zzso we show that zzso of zzso that are unable to interact with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our findings support a role for zzso synthesis in the regulation of zzso zzso at focal complexes and ultimately in the regulation of zzso zzso
