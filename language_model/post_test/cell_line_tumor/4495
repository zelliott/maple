The two hit hypothesis of zzso states that cells that have been severely stressed once are more vulnerable to the negative impact of a second zzso In other words, the toxicity of two hits of severe stress may be synergistic in zzso We previously developed a two hit model of zzso zzso using the zzso inhibitor zzso In that study, we found that the potent zzso zzso zzso was able to protect against the toxicity associated with dual zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to zzso cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's patients and to reduce the symptoms of blast injury in zzso These studies and many others in experimental models of zzso suggest that zzso zzso can protect zzso even when they are severely zzso In the present study, we tested the hypotheses that dual hits of hydrogen zzso and zzso would elicit synergistic zzso and that this extreme toxicity would be prevented by zzso zzso The findings reveal for the first time that zzso zzso cells are much more sensitive to zzso stress from hydrogen zzso treatment when they have been exposed previously to the same zzso Two hits of hydrogen zzso also caused severe loss of zzso zzso zzso attenuated the loss of zzso and reduced the near-complete loss of cells after exposure to dual hydrogen zzso zzso The present study supports the notion that zzso zzso can robustly protect against zzso unremitting zzso stress in a zzso zzso
