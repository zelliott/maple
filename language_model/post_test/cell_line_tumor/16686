The principal aim of this study was to analyze in zzso zzso zzso cells the response of three zzso proteins to zzso zzso a major circulating cholesterol zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses of zzso cells exposed for up to 72 h to 2 zzso zzso zzso or to 2 zzso zzso demonstrated similar responses in the expression of zzso and zzso compared to the zzso zzso Thus, the results confirm zzso function as a novel selective zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso to zzso transition zzso observed in zzso cells zzso for longer than 48 h with 2 zzso zzso was accompanied by lower zzso levels of nuclear zzso in comparison to zzso zzso The results presented in this study are discussed taking into consideration the relationship of zzso zzso production, zzso synthesis and zzso zzso potentially occurring in obese patients with zzso infiltrated zzso zzso
