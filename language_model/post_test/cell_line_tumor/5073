zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways have not been fully zzso In this study, we used zzso zzso analysis on two zzso prostate cancer zzso cell lines to identify 16 zzso zzso zzso We focused on zzso because of its previously reported zzso activity in other zzso We show zzso zzso binding to the defined zzso promoter, zzso suggesting direct zzso zzso zzso of zzso diminished zzso zzso cell zzso providing new evidence that zzso can contribute to zzso cell zzso zzso expression of zzso enhanced zzso tumor growth in zzso and, surprisingly, was sufficient for zzso tumors to overcome zzso growth zzso Thus, elevated zzso expression alone is sufficient to impart zzso zzso Moreover, quantitative reverse zzso analysis revealed elevated zzso expression in zzso when compared with adjacent normal zzso These results suggest that zzso may contribute to zzso zzso
