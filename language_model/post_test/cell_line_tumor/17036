The present work aimed at designing a zzso zzso for zzso delivery toward two cell zzso within breast tumors, the cancer and the zzso cells from zzso tumor blood zzso To achieve such goal, the F3 zzso which is specifically zzso by zzso zzso on both those zzso was used as a targeting zzso The developed zzso stable zzso acid zzso particles presented adequate features for systemic zzso In addition, the attachment of the F3 zzso onto the zzso surface enabled an zzso by both cancer and zzso cells from zzso blood vessels that was significantly higher than the one observed with zzso zzso zzso zzso of enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso in zzso human cancer cell lines, both at the protein and zzso levels, was further observed upon delivery of zzso zzso by zzso zzso in contrast with the zzso zzso This effect was highly dependent on the content of zzso zzso zzso as evidenced by the zzso studies between the zzso and the zzso Overall, the present work represents an important contribution toward a zzso with zzso capabilities in breast cancer, both at the cellular and molecular zzso
