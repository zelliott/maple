We previously showed that the B cell leukemia cell line zzso had the highest zzso among a number of leukemia cell lines to zzso B zzso a potent zzso zzso zzso zzso We also showed that zzso zzso depended on induction of zzso that was zzso by zzso zzso In the present study, we generated and characterized a stable, zzso zzso cell line zzso by continuous exposure to zzso starting with a low zzso zzso zzso cells were also more resistant to zzso which has a similar chemical structure to zzso and were slightly more resistant to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso than parental cells, but displayed similar zzso to other zzso zzso and to zzso as the parental zzso There was little change in the zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso compared to parental cells, but the zzso expression of zzso was zzso The introduction of an zzso zzso expression zzso restored zzso induction of zzso cell zzso Moreover, zzso zzso enhanced zzso induction of the zzso of the human zzso leukemia cell line zzso which is less susceptible to zzso than zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso which is a characteristic feature of zzso cells, was important for their resistance to zzso and that this zzso resistance could be overcome by the introduction of zzso zzso Furthermore, introduction of zzso to other leukemia cells such as zzso may enhance their zzso to zzso This is the first report of the characterization of zzso cells and of the effect of zzso zzso on the resistance or zzso of human leukemia cells to zzso
