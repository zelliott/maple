The zzso complex is a recently identified but zzso ancient member of the family of zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso It is associated with two proteins that are zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here we show that the four zzso zzso can be zzso with zzso and zzso both from zzso and from zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso all six zzso cause the zzso zzso zzso zzso to become trapped in clusters of early zzso In addition, zzso zzso and zzso zzso on a late zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso have predicted secondary structures containing zzso related to those of zzso heavy chain and zzso zzso zzso also has an zzso zzso domain, which interacts in zzso with zzso We propose that zzso zzso and zzso form a zzso complex, with zzso involved in protein zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the coat onto zzso by interacting with zzso via its zzso domain, and zzso zzso together with zzso forming a zzso
