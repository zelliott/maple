zzso of zzso and zzso support a role for zzso pathways in the zzso of some zzso zzso Our goal was to determine if expression of these zzso molecules also extend to childhood precursor B cell acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso We now show that transcripts of zzso and its receptors zzso and zzso are zzso expressed in both ALL cell lines and primary zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso consistently detected zzso protein in the zzso of the cell zzso Similarly, zzso and zzso proteins are also zzso by zzso zzso Interestingly, the expression of the receptors in immature B cells is limited to the zzso compartment and may suggest either zzso of the receptors or a block in trafficking of the zzso to the zzso
