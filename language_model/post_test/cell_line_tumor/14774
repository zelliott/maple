Alternative zzso zzso is a widespread mechanism underlying the generation of zzso and regulatory zzso However, which of the myriad of human AS events play important roles in disease is largely zzso To identify frequently occurring AS events in lung cancer, we used AS zzso profiling and reverse zzso zzso zzso to survey zzso normal and zzso tumor zzso from the lungs of 29 individuals diagnosed with zzso cell lung cancer zzso Of zzso zzso alternative zzso four displayed zzso changes in the majority of the zzso These events affected transcripts from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Similar AS changes were detected in zzso and zzso transcripts in primary breast and colon zzso zzso increases in zzso zzso 9 inclusion correlated with reduced levels of zzso protein expression and zzso of the zzso signaling pathway, an event that has been linked to zzso Moreover, short hairpin zzso zzso zzso of zzso followed by zzso rescue revealed that expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso target gene zzso whereas expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso lacks this activity and is capable of promoting cell zzso The results thus reveal widespread AS changes in zzso that impact cell signaling in a manner that likely contributes to zzso
