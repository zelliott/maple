zzso governing the zzso of zzso zzso zzso are poorly zzso Recent data support a role for the cell surface zzso zzso zzso zzso in the progression of several human zzso Here we present evidence for a direct role of zzso in human zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso are more highly expressed in zzso than in normal zzso High zzso levels correlated with zzso zzso zzso ( zzso and zzso space involvement ( zzso in zzso zzso of zzso by stable zzso zzso decreased the migratory and invasive capacity of cancer cell lines in zzso and resulted in zzso in suspended zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso increased cell migration and invasion and promoted zzso resistance in suspension zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso or stimulation by zzso resulted in altered the expression of molecular zzso of the zzso transition zzso zzso interference zzso depletion of the downstream regulator, zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso The use of in zzso models revealed decreased zzso dissemination in zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso cells underwent zzso transition and zzso in zzso Our data support a novel function for zzso in promoting zzso and resistance to zzso Thus, zzso may constitute a potential therapeutic target in human zzso
