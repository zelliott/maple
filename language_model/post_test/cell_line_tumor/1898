High levels of zzso are a risk factor for zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso levels benefit tumor zzso but the detailed mechanism is not zzso zzso the aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanism of high levels of zzso hormone zzso on the promotion of tumor zzso and to outline a feasible therapeutic zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso were used to determine the effect of zzso on zzso and zzso expression and examine the signaling zzso involved in regulating the expression of both zzso zzso zzso was used to investigate the effect of zzso on zzso induction of zzso and zzso zzso It was found that 50 zzso zzso significantly zzso zzso and zzso zzso and activated the zzso signaling zzso However, zzso inhibited the zzso signaling zzso and further blocked zzso zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, high levels of zzso promote zzso in zzso cancer via the zzso zzso However, zzso could inhibit tumor zzso by blocking the zzso signaling zzso
