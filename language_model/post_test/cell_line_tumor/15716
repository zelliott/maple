zzso pathways help control the expression of zzso In cancer and other diseases, zzso zzso or zzso of zzso such as those that control cell growth, can greatly contribute to zzso Access to these genes by the zzso machinery is largely zzso by chemical modifications of DNA or zzso which are controlled by zzso zzso making these zzso attractive targets for drug zzso Here we describe the characterization of a locus zzso zzso a zzso zzso cellular system which was used to screen the zzso structural diversity library for novel zzso zzso using an automated imaging zzso Four structurally unique compounds were uncovered that, when further investigated, showed distinct zzso These compounds block the viability of lung cancer and melanoma cells, prevent cell cycle zzso and/or inhibit zzso zzso activity, altering levels of cellular zzso zzso
