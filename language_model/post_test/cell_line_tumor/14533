zzso cancer is the third most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death for males in zzso zzso has recently been described as a zzso member of inhibitor of zzso proteins family, highly expressed in prostate zzso zzso gene encodes two zzso zzso termed zzso and zzso We hypothesized that deregulation of proliferation could be due in part to zzso zzso 

zzso analysis of zzso was performed in 20 prostate cancer zzso and 5 benign zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso was also investigated by Western zzso in prostate cancer cell lines zzso and zzso The role of zzso in zzso was further zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso models, cell cycle analysis, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were performed zzso 

zzso expression positive ratio was shown to be zzso zzso zzso zzso in benign zzso zzso low, zzso and high grade of prostate cancer respectively, and zzso was positively correlated with clinical pathological grades of prostate zzso zzso was expressed in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso was only detected in the zzso zzso zzso not only resulted in zzso cell cycle arrest, but also strongly correlated with the descended proliferation index and survival rate in zzso In comparison, zzso of zzso resulted in an accelerated S phase entry combined with elevated proliferation index and survival in zzso 

zzso may promote cell proliferation by regulating zzso cell cycle transition and possibly play an important part in initiation of prostate zzso
