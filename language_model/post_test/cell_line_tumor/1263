We have established zzso of zzso human colon zzso and zzso human zzso cells resistant to the new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso were shown to have decreased zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, and exhibited zzso to zzso and zzso Based on the zzso values determined by zzso testing, a zzso to zzso resistance to zzso was observed in the resistant zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso while its effect on DNA synthesis was zzso The degree of resistance zzso to zzso zzso calculated from the zzso of zzso synthesis tended to be close to the degree of zzso of tested cells to zzso The experiments on the zzso metabolism of zzso in the parental cells revealed a rapid zzso to its zzso particularly the zzso zzso its major active zzso The amount of zzso transported into the resistant cells was markedly reduced and the zzso level of zzso was decreased from zzso to below the limit of zzso however, the zzso zzso as a percentage of the total zzso level was high as compared with the parental zzso The ratio of the zzso level of zzso between parental and resistant cells tended to approximate to the degree of resistance calculated from the zzso effect on zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso sensitivity of cells is correlated with the zzso zzso of zzso which may be affected by both the cellular membrane transport mechanism and zzso zzso
