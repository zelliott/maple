zzso zzso complexes have been considered as a zzso for DNA zzso nonetheless, their zzso efficiency is relatively zzso An approach by incorporating zzso zzso zzso in zzso complexes was developed in our previous study to enhance their gene expression zzso however, the detailed mechanisms remain to be zzso The study was designed to investigate the mechanisms in cellular zzso and zzso trafficking of zzso zzso The results of our molecular dynamic simulations suggest that after forming complexes with zzso zzso displays a free zzso acid in its zzso end and thus may be recognized by zzso zzso in the cell zzso resulting in a significant increase in their cellular zzso In the zzso zzso study, we found that the zzso of zzso complexes took place via zzso and zzso zzso by incorporating zzso in complexes, both zzso pathways were further enhanced but the zzso zzso played a major zzso zzso was used to gain directly understanding of the zzso mechanism of test complexes and confirmed our findings obtained in the zzso zzso After zzso a less percentage of zzso of zzso complexes with zzso was observed when compared with their zzso zzso A greater cellular zzso together with a less entry into zzso might thus explain the promotion of zzso efficiency of zzso zzso zzso of these mechanisms involving zzso complexes containing zzso is critical for the development of an efficient zzso for DNA zzso
