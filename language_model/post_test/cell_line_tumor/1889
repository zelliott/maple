zzso is a member of the family of zzso of zzso proteins zzso and tumor cell invasion is a general property of multiple zzso zzso is highly expressed in prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso cells are more resistant to zzso stimuli than normal zzso Thus, zzso increased cell survival is an zzso requirement of zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso signaling affects zzso by zzso zzso targeting zzso into the zzso prostate cancer cell line to confirm the zzso effect and blockade of the zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso inhibited zzso prostate zzso cell zzso We investigated how zzso promotes tumor cell invasion, and found that zzso induction of zzso contributed to tumor cell zzso In addition, we found that zzso induction of zzso regulates tumor cell invasion via nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso These data showed that zzso as a gene directly promoting zzso can be useful for therapeutic intervention against advanced and zzso zzso
