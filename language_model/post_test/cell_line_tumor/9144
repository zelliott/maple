zzso is currently the best treatment available for pancreatic cancer, but the disease develops resistance to the drug over zzso Agents that can either enhance the effects of zzso or overcome zzso to the drug are needed for the treatment of pancreatic zzso zzso a component of turmeric zzso zzso is one such agent that has been shown to suppress the zzso factor nuclear zzso zzso which is implicated in zzso survival, zzso and zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso can sensitize pancreatic cancer to zzso in zzso and in zzso In zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation of various pancreatic cancer cell lines, zzso the zzso induced by zzso and inhibited zzso zzso zzso in the zzso In zzso tumors from nude mice injected with pancreatic cancer cells and treated with a combination of zzso and zzso showed significant reductions in volume zzso zzso zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso proliferation index zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso and expression of zzso gene products zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cellular inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth zzso compared with tumors from control mice treated with olive oil zzso The combination treatment was also highly effective in suppressing zzso as indicated by a decrease in zzso zzso density zzso zzso zzso versus zzso Overall, our results suggest that zzso zzso the zzso effects of zzso in pancreatic cancer by suppressing zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso
