The zzso zzso binding cassette zzso zzso zzso can mediate resistance against the commonly used zzso drugs zzso and zzso To overcome the zzso drug resistance, two specific zzso small interfering zzso zzso were designed for transient triggering of the zzso zzso interference zzso zzso in the zzso human zzso zzso cell line zzso Since both zzso showed biological activity, for stable zzso of zzso a corresponding short hairpin zzso zzso expression zzso was zzso By treatment of zzso cells with this zzso the expressions of the targeted zzso zzso zzso and transport protein were zzso These effects were accompanied by reversal of resistance against zzso and zzso Thus, the data demonstrate the utility of the analyzed zzso as powerful laboratory tools and indicate that zzso and zzso zzso gene therapeutic approaches may be zzso in preventing and reversing zzso drug zzso
