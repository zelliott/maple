zzso membrane protein 1 zzso an zzso virus zzso zzso mimics a zzso activated tumor necrosis factor zzso and activates various signaling zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso zzso transformation and is sufficient to transform several cell zzso Cellular transformation has been associated strongly with zzso instability, while DNA repair plays an important role in maintaining zzso zzso Previously, we have shown that zzso zzso DNA repair by the zzso zzso region 1 zzso in human zzso zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso is required for zzso repression of DNA zzso Through the zzso pathway, zzso which can induce DNA repair, is zzso because of zzso and zzso zzso of a zzso active zzso zzso can rescue zzso repression of DNA zzso Furthermore, zzso can decrease the expression of DNA zzso protein 1 zzso which functions in zzso zzso repair, through the zzso zzso zzso repression of DNA repair is restored by zzso although only zzso These results suggest that zzso triggers the zzso zzso to zzso zzso and decrease zzso which can lead to repression of DNA repair and may contribute to zzso instability in human zzso zzso
