zzso consist of zzso zzso Recently, it has been demonstrated that cells with zzso potential are limited to a small population, called zzso cells zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is one of the markers of zzso We previously reported that zzso cases of zzso zzso zzso showed poor zzso and zzso population of zzso zzso cell line was more zzso resistant to zzso drugs, and invasive than zzso zzso Here, the regulatory signaling for zzso was zzso The zzso of zzso signaling increased zzso zzso Among zzso family members, zzso expression and zzso expression levels were mutually zzso zzso analysis on clinical samples revealed zzso tumor cells to be zzso and zzso versa, suggesting that zzso may inhibit zzso expression via stimulating zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso In fact, the addition of zzso to zzso zzso cell line reduced zzso zzso Although zzso zzso level was not affected, the amount of zzso protein appeared to be reduce by zzso through zzso zzso The regulation of zzso signaling might be a novel therapeutic target of zzso in zzso zzso
