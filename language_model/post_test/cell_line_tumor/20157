Although dormant tumors are highly prevalent within the human population, the underlying mechanisms are still mostly zzso We have previously identified the consensus gene expression pattern of dormant zzso Here, we show that this gene expression signature could be used for the isolation and identification of clones which generate dormant zzso We established single zzso clones from the aggressive zzso zzso zzso human zzso cell zzso Based only on the expression pattern of genes which were previously shown to be associated with tumor zzso we identified clones which generate dormant zzso We show that very high expression levels of zzso and high expression levels of zzso and zzso growth factor binding protein 5 zzso together with low levels of zzso specific marker zzso 1 and zzso growth factor zzso zzso characterize the clone which generates dormant zzso zzso derived zzso These tumors remained zzso both in subcutaneous and zzso zzso sites, in spite of a high prevalence of zzso zzso We further show that tumor cells which form zzso zzso derived dormant tumors have an impaired zzso potential both in zzso and in zzso and have a slower invasion zzso This work demonstrates that fast-growing tumors contain tumor cells that when isolated will form dormant tumors and serves as a zzso for the use of zzso profiles in the identification of such zzso zzso the tumor cells that form dormant tumors will facilitate understanding of the underlying mechanisms of dormant zzso late zzso and changes in rate of tumor zzso
