zzso receptors zzso are a unique family of zzso coupled zzso zzso the most recently identified zzso member, was reported to be zzso during the progression of colon and prostate zzso Though zzso zzso was detected in normal stomach, the role of zzso in gastric cancer has not been zzso In this study, differential expression of zzso was measured by real-time zzso zzso and tissue zzso zzso We showed that zzso was located from zzso to middle portions of normal gastric zzso zzso expression was remarkably decreased in gastric cancer zzso as compared with matched zzso zzso especially in positive zzso zzso or low differentiation zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso promoter in cell lines was assessed by treatment with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso human gastric cancer cell lines did not express zzso as compared to zzso human colon cancer cell line with significant zzso zzso Treatment with zzso restored zzso expression in zzso and zzso cells, which exhibited significantly more zzso in the zzso promoter compared with zzso zzso Our results revealed that zzso of zzso expression occurs frequently in gastric zzso and exhibits association with more aggressive gastric zzso Interestingly, the loss of zzso expression in gastric zzso may result from zzso of the zzso zzso
