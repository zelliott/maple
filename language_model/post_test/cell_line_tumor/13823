The aims of this study were to examine the role of zzso zzso a zzso zzso found at elevated levels in a number of zzso and which has been shown to influence oral cancer cell zzso via zzso zzso zzso on the zzso of oral zzso 

The effect of zzso on proliferation and migration of human primary oral zzso was assessed using zzso and scratch zzso zzso The ability of zzso to affect zzso zzso was zzso using zzso collagen zzso Changes in gene expression in oral zzso exposed to zzso were examined using quantitative zzso The zzso of oral cancer cells in the presence of zzso media collected from zzso treated zzso was determined using zzso zzso zzso 

Here we provide evidence that zzso increases the migration of oral zzso and zzso a more zzso zzso which is not associated with changes in gene expression indicative of zzso zzso In addition we provide evidence that zzso medium of zzso oral zzso promotes invasion of zzso cells in zzso 

In oral zzso cell zzso a frequently fatal and increasingly common zzso zzso of the oral zzso zzso is known to contribute to zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso and cancer zzso The ability of zzso to zzso the zzso of human oral zzso zzso however, has not previously been zzso The findings presented here suggest that targeting the zzso zzso system may be a viable and novel therapeutic strategy for invasive oral zzso
