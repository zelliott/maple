zzso zzso a zzso zzso is highly expressed in zzso cells and in most cancer zzso However, little is known about the regulation of its zzso Here, we identify the zzso gene as a novel direct zzso target of the zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso enhances zzso zzso in cultured cells and in zzso B cells from zzso transgenic zzso zzso with zzso being downstream of zzso zzso expression parallels that of zzso in a large panel of human cancer cell zzso Using zzso zzso we show that zzso binds to a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso we show zzso zzso profoundly delays zzso cancer formation in zzso zzso transgenic mice have much slower rates of zzso zzso development, with life spans twice that of their zzso zzso Moreover, we demonstrate that zzso is essential for the proliferation of zzso cells in cultured cells and in zzso impaired zzso development was associated with a drastic decrease of zzso proliferation of zzso B zzso Finally, we provide evidence that in cell culture zzso controls cell proliferation independently of zzso and that zzso zzso significantly delays zzso in zzso zzso Together these data indicate that zzso functions downstream of zzso as a zzso regulator of cell proliferation and zzso independently from its putative role within the zzso zzso zzso zzso is therefore expected to compromise early zzso development zzso of the zzso zzso
