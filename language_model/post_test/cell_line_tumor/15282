zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso complexes were prepared using the neutral zzso zzso zzso and one equivalent of each zzso zzso The zzso zzso and in zzso cellular properties of each zzso metal complex were studied to determine their viability as cell surface fluorescent zzso Each compound was characterized by zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso differential scanning zzso zzso and zzso analysis zzso Upon zzso at 320 zzso each complex displayed characteristic zzso zzso zzso in the visible wavelength range with stokes shifts greater than 200 zzso Each complex was found to be chemically stable when exposed to pH range of zzso for 72 h and resistant to zzso To simulate pulmonary administration of these zzso the aerodynamic properties of the zzso and zzso complexes were determined using a next generation zzso zzso This measurement confirmed that the complexes retain their zzso zzso properties after zzso Cellular zzso was determined on zzso lung cancer cell line using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 24, 48, and 72 h zzso to the zzso The complexes showed a dose and zzso effect on the percent viability of the zzso
