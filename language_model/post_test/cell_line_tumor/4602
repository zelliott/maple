The current model for zzso zzso dissemination in zzso focuses on zzso as zzso However, recent evidence suggested that other host cells may also play a role in the zzso Here, we tested the possibility of zzso zzso being zzso by a human zzso cell line, zzso and an zzso cell line, zzso A combination of zzso protection zzso scanning and transmission electron zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso The results demonstrated for the first time that both spores and zzso cells of zzso zzso zzso strain zzso were able to adhere to and be zzso by cultured zzso and zzso zzso zzso adherence to and zzso by zzso cells were not affected by a zzso zzso This suggested that certain features on dormant spores were sufficient for these zzso zzso cell adherence to and zzso by both cell lines were growth zzso zzso images suggested that zzso cells may have the ability to escape zzso zzso Finally, we showed that zzso of both spores and zzso cells required active functions of the host cell zzso These results raised the possibility that zzso zzso may zzso in zzso by directly infecting zzso zzso
