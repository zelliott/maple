zzso germ cell zzso are the most frequent cancer of young men with an increasing zzso all over the zzso zzso and reasons of this increase remain unknown but zzso and clinical data have suggested that fetal exposure to environmental zzso zzso zzso with zzso effects, could participate to zzso germ cell zzso However, these zzso (like zzso zzso are often weak zzso for classical nuclear zzso zzso Several research groups recently showed that the non classical membrane zzso coupled zzso zzso zzso mediates the effects of zzso and several zzso through rapid non zzso zzso of signal zzso pathways in various human zzso dependent cancer cells zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to demonstrate that zzso was zzso in zzso zzso and was able to trigger zzso zzso cell zzso 

We report here for the first time a complete zzso and functional characterization of zzso in normal and zzso human zzso germ zzso In normal adult human zzso zzso was expressed by zzso zzso zzso and germ cells zzso and zzso zzso was exclusively zzso in zzso the most frequent zzso germ cell cancer, localized at the cell membrane and triggered a zzso effect on zzso cells in zzso which was completely abolished by zzso (a zzso selective zzso and by zzso zzso 

These results demonstrate that zzso is expressed by human normal adult zzso germ cells, specifically zzso in zzso zzso and able to trigger zzso cell proliferation in zzso It should therefore be considered rather than classical zzso when zzso or other zzso zzso are assessed in zzso germ cell zzso It may also represent a prognosis marker and/or a therapeutic target for zzso
