zzso zzso inhibited proliferation of several tumor cell zzso The drug induced zzso fragmentation of DNA in zzso cells and increased zzso zzso -9 activities followed by the degradation of zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso and zzso zzso It also increased zzso activity and a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso inhibitor zzso also reduced zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso decreased the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso and it increased the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a sustained generation of zzso oxygen species zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso attenuated the generation of zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso zzso alters the zzso zzso status, changed the balance of zzso and zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso through zzso pathways in zzso zzso
