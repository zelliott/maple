The zzso gene is a putative zzso zzso gene located on the human zzso zzso which is frequently rearranged in zzso and other human zzso We previously reported that the zzso gene can be zzso and its expression zzso in human zzso However, the mechanism underlying zzso zzso remains largely zzso We show here that unscheduled zzso of zzso expression through zzso zzso is a frequent event in a variety of human zzso zzso was found to be silenced in nine head and neck cancer zzso cell lines studied and zzso zzso zzso correlated with loss of gene expression in these zzso zzso expression could be restored via zzso treatment using zzso In addition, zzso of cancer cell lines with zzso impaired their zzso consistent with the critical role of zzso zzso of zzso in the development and maintenance of zzso zzso We further observed that zzso zzso occurs frequently in a variety of primary human zzso including solid zzso zzso in zzso zzso in lung zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Control blood samples and zzso mouth zzso cells from healthy individuals showed a low level of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso is a zzso specific zzso Finally, an inverse correlation was observed between the level of zzso gene zzso and its expression in zzso and adjacent non zzso zzso Thus, zzso of zzso is a potentially critical event in human zzso and may be a potential cancer zzso and an attractive target for zzso zzso
