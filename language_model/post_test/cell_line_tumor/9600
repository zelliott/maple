zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso for zzso synthesis in zzso Although accumulating evidence has indicated the zzso processing of zzso it remains unknown what kinds of zzso are zzso We investigated the processing of zzso in a mouse zzso zzso using a zzso expression zzso zzso was expressed as a zzso precursor form, which is zzso to yield the zzso and zzso forms upon treatment with zzso zzso zzso revealed that two tandem zzso zzso zzso zzso are critical for the zzso Treatment with zzso caused an increase in the zzso activity of the cells expressing the wild type zzso but not in the cells expressing the zzso zzso An increase in zzso synthesis by zzso was accompanied by formation of the zzso and zzso form of zzso In addition, the in zzso translated zzso form of zzso was found to undergo a limited zzso by zzso human zzso whereas the zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells was enhanced in the presence of a zzso zzso zzso Although treatment with zzso and zzso drastically zzso the zzso activity of zzso and zzso no zzso cell death was zzso Both zzso zzso and processing of zzso were completely suppressed by a zzso zzso partially but significantly by a specific inhibitor for zzso but not by a zzso zzso These results suggest that, in zzso cells, zzso synthesis is zzso through the zzso zzso of zzso which is zzso by zzso
