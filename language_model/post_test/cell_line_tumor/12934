Through zzso of the metal zzso at the zzso active site, zzso zzso show potent zzso of viral zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso In order to zzso the zzso activity of the zzso structural modification of their zzso units, zzso acids or zzso zzso have been actively zzso In this study, we proposed zzso 3 as an alternative to zzso aromatic zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso As a zzso study, a series of zzso derivatives zzso were prepared and their zzso activity against zzso zzso was zzso zzso relationship of the zzso derivatives was in good accordance with that of the zzso aromatic zzso zzso In particular, two zzso zzso zzso and zzso completely zzso with the most potent zzso aromatic zzso analogue zzso in zzso fashion showed zzso zzso activity to that of zzso Taken together, this result provides convincing evidence that the zzso can successfully mimic the zzso function of the zzso zzso to show potent zzso activity against the target zzso zzso zzso
