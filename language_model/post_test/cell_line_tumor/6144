zzso has been linked to favorable prognosis in zzso and in the present study we investigate if it can be used to zzso isolate zzso zzso 

To define the zzso properties of zzso positive and negative cells, we zzso the zzso zzso cell line on the basis of zzso expression and proceeded to zzso and zzso characterize the two cell zzso 

We found that zzso defines two zzso distinctive cell populations with different zzso zzso profiles, and that zzso negative cells expressed higher levels of the zzso cell marker zzso When zzso zzso into zzso animals, the zzso negative cells were capable of tumor formation and organ zzso clearly demonstrating an inverse correlation of zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso Gene expression analysis revealed that zzso defines zzso discrete cell types with the zzso negative cells expressing proteins associated with uncontrolled cell cycle zzso immune evasion and a reduced capacity to undergo zzso 

zzso our findings show that zzso negative zzso cells possess all the zzso and molecular features required for a zzso zzso
