We described zzso a human zzso zzso zzso zzso protein cage for which the zzso zzso termed zzso was modified at the surface of a naturally occurred heat shock protein zzso zzso Six types of zzso zzso cages were chemically zzso using two types of zzso zzso zzso with different lengths and two types of zzso zzso which contained a unique zzso zzso at the zzso or zzso of the zzso These zzso cages were characterized using zzso laser zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso sodium zzso gel zzso zzso zzso and dynamic light scattering zzso zzso Fluorescence microscopic observations revealed that all the engineered protein cages bind selectively to zzso cells but not to the other cell lines tested (including normal liver zzso Moreover, the number of zzso peptides on zzso zzso zzso site of zzso zzso and zzso length between a zzso cage and a zzso zzso had important effects upon the binding of engineered zzso cages to zzso zzso An engineered zzso cage zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso via a longer zzso zzso and containing high zzso zzso levels showed greater binding toward zzso zzso Surprisingly, through zzso of these three factors, up to zzso greater affinity toward zzso cells was zzso These results are critically important not only for the development of zzso zzso devices using zzso zzso but also to create other zzso materials that zzso other zzso zzso
