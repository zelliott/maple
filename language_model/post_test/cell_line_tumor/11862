zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso is associated with poor prognosis in zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is an active zzso zzso that is zzso in many zzso including prostate zzso Previously, we found that zzso interacts with and zzso zzso in cancer zzso 

In this study, we determined the zzso of zzso that is required for its interaction with zzso and the effects of zzso of zzso on zzso interaction, measured the expression of zzso and zzso in prostate cancer zzso and tested the effect of zzso of zzso on the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to zzso zzso zzso 

We found that the zzso region zzso zzso zzso of zzso was required for its sufficient interaction with zzso and that this interaction was independent of zzso zzso zzso zzso Most importantly, the zzso interaction does not respond to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in prostate cancer zzso and zzso of zzso by a zzso inhibitor zzso zzso prostate cancer cells to zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

These data suggest that zzso in cancer cells can exist as either a zzso zzso zzso responsive status or an zzso zzso zzso is a protein involved in zzso functions that are zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and, therefore, the zzso interaction might be a novel target for prostate cancer zzso
