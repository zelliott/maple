zzso cancer cells escape most treatment zzso Heat shock protein zzso is frequently zzso in zzso zzso and protects a number of zzso regulators such as the zzso zzso We show that zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso independent of zzso whereas the standard drug for zzso zzso treatment, zzso zzso causes zzso degradation through the zzso of zzso Both agents applied together zzso inhibit the expression of zzso and the proliferation of zzso zzso cells thereby demonstrating that both zzso pathways are zzso The role of zzso as stabilizer of zzso in zzso zzso cells is further supported by two novel synthetic zzso zzso acid and zzso acid and specific zzso zzso zzso Our data show that targeting zzso reduced the resistance of zzso zzso cells to treatment with zzso
