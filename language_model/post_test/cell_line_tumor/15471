To investigate the zzso effect of zzso alone, or in combination with zzso on the proliferation of zzso pancreatic cancer zzso 

zzso cells were treated under different conditions: with zzso at 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160 zzso each for 24 zzso 48 h or 72 zzso with 20 zzso zzso for 24 h or 0 h before 20 zzso zzso for 24 zzso with 20 zzso zzso for 24 zzso 48 h and 72 h following 20 zzso zzso for 24 zzso or with 20 zzso zzso alone as a zzso Cell proliferation was assessed and changes in cell zzso were assessed by light and zzso zzso zzso was detected using flow zzso 

zzso inhibited zzso cell proliferation in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso alone or combined with zzso induced zzso cell zzso zzso zzso rates with combined treatment were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso following treatment with 20 zzso zzso for 24 h or 0 h before 20 zzso zzso for 24 zzso or 20 zzso zzso for zzso 48 h and 72 zzso following 20 zzso zzso for 24 zzso zzso 

zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso zzso zzso significantly increased the zzso and zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells was achieved with zzso treatment for 24 h before zzso zzso
