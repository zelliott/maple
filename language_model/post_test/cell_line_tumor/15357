This study aimed to establish a new in zzso three-dimensional zzso cell culture and use quantum dots zzso molecular imaging to examine the invasive behaviors of zzso zzso zzso zzso Each well of the zzso cell culture plate was zzso zzso diluted with zzso zzso was added and zzso cells were cultured on the zzso The cell zzso and cell growth characteristics were observed by zzso zzso and laser zzso zzso at different culture zzso Cell invasive features were monitored by zzso real-time molecular imaging zzso The results showed that on this zzso cell culture platform, zzso cells exhibited typical zzso invasive behaviors, including zzso of cell zzso active focal proliferation and dominant clones zzso During the process, cells under zzso cell culture showed biological behaviors of zzso zzso zzso first merged on the surface of zzso then gradually infiltrated and migrated into deep part of zzso presenting zzso zzso with stretched zzso forming zzso zzso and even network structure, which suggested that zzso cells have the zzso basis for zzso zzso In addition, small cell clones with their edges zzso in early stage, progressed into a large irregular clone with zzso edge, while the other cells developed zzso And zzso probing showed zzso was strongly expressed in the zzso These findings indicate that a novel zzso cell culture platform has been successfully established, which can mimic the in zzso tumor zzso and when combined with zzso molecular imaging, it can help to better investigate the invasive behaviors of zzso zzso
