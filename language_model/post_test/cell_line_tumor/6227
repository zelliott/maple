The identification of molecular markers useful for predicting prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients is crucial for advances in disease zzso The zzso cell zzso zzso zzso is known to express in most zzso zzso and was reported as a tumor marker or a candidate of molecular targeting zzso However, the clinical significance of zzso expression in pancreatic cancer is not zzso We determined the difference of zzso potential between parental and zzso pancreatic cancer cell lines by using zzso invasion and migration zzso Furthermore, we determined the relationship between zzso zzso expression of zzso specimens and clinical prognosis in 95 pancreatic cancer patients receiving radical surgery at two different cancer zzso One of the three zzso cell lines showed significantly low proliferation rate compared with the parental cell, while there was no difference in the other two cell zzso In invasion and migration zzso zzso cells showed significantly lower zzso potential than parental in all of the three cell zzso In 95 pancreatic cancer patients, 47 patients showed zzso zzso while 48 patients showed low, and there was no difference of zzso features between zzso high and zzso zzso zzso expression group showed significantly good prognosis in overall survival zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso as well as in zzso survival zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso In addition, the impact of zzso was observed strongly in zzso group when the influence of zzso was examined with dividing patients into zzso and negative zzso In zzso analysis, zzso expression was one of the independent zzso factors as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was found to be related to the suppression of pancreatic cancer cell activity and the good prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients receiving the zzso zzso
