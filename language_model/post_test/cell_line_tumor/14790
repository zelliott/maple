zzso a zzso zzso zzso degrades oxidized proteins of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the replication of zzso Lon is zzso in the presence of substances such as zzso zzso zzso zzso that increase the zzso zzso oxygen species zzso levels, or in the presence of zzso Here we show the promoter region zzso is essential for response to zzso and that in zzso zzso and zzso cell lines the region zzso zzso transcription, while the region zzso increases promoter zzso zzso zzso Lon promoter activity in all cell lines while zzso zzso Lon mainly in zzso cells, and in shorter incubation zzso These data confirm that Lon can be considered a stress responsive zzso
