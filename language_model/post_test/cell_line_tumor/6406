zzso zzso has been observed in response to zzso in zzso zzso cholesterol storage, zzso and zzso induced in rats by a high-fat zzso It has been suggested that cholesterol zzso is altered in Alzheimer's disease resulting in higher zzso and zzso zzso In the current study the zzso zzso status of zzso regulatory element binding protein 2 zzso as well as its involvement in zzso zzso activity was investigated in high-fat fed rats zzso fat and zzso cholesterol for 20 weeks), and in zzso zzso cells exposed to 20 zzso zzso This work demonstrates that in the brain a zzso diet is able to induce a zzso of zzso and determine an zzso in cerebral cholesterol zzso so that zzso is zzso In addition, we show for the first time the involvement of zzso on expression of zzso in zzso cells exposed to high zzso Although the enhanced risk of Alzheimer's disease in zzso syndrome is related to several factors, our results suggest that zzso which can be modulated by the impairment of cerebral cholesterol zzso has a direct role on zzso expression and may be involved in Alzheimer's disease zzso
