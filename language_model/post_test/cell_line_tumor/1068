zzso is the most common highly zzso bone tumor with primary appearance during the second and third decade of zzso It is associated with a high risk of zzso possibly resulting from a developed resistance to chemotherapy zzso As a means to overcome zzso tumor cell resistance and/or to sensitize tumor cells to currently used zzso treatments, we examined the role of human zzso zzso 1 zzso in zzso tumor cell resistance and zzso Sixty human samples of zzso conventional zzso zzso were zzso zzso protein was elevated in zzso of these zzso and among those with a known clinical outcome, there was a significant correlation between high zzso expression levels and reduced survival zzso The remaining zzso of samples showed low expression of zzso Given that zzso was zzso in zzso we decreased zzso levels using zzso zzso zzso targeting technology in the zzso cell line, human zzso zzso zzso to enhance zzso and radiation zzso Using zzso targeted technology of zzso protein levels were reduced by more than zzso within 24 hours, remained low for 72 hours, and returned to normal levels at 96 zzso There was also a clear loss of zzso zzso activity following zzso zzso A decrease in zzso levels in zzso human zzso zzso cells led to enhanced cell zzso to the DNA damaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso radiation, and zzso zzso The findings presented here have both zzso and therapeutic implications for treating zzso The zzso results demonstrate the feasibility for the therapeutic zzso of zzso using a variety of molecules and zzso
