zzso (a zzso and zzso 10) is the principal zzso responsible for the zzso processing of the Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso precursor protein zzso A zzso relationship exists between zzso and zzso zzso processing such that impaired zzso zzso of the protein serves to enhance zzso processing (by zzso and zzso thereby zzso levels of the zzso beta (A zzso responsible for the zzso death observed in the zzso zzso It has previously been demonstrated that the zzso processing of zzso occurs within specialized regions of the cell membrane known as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso processing is thought to occur in the zzso region of the membrane with the majority of zzso being excluded from zzso In the current study, we hypothesized that the exclusion of zzso from zzso may leave the zzso zzso particularly susceptible to alternative zzso zzso within these zzso In order to test this hypothesis, we targeted zzso to zzso by replacing its zzso and zzso regions with a zzso zzso anchor and examined the associated effects on zzso zzso We found that whereas zzso zzso was exclusively present in the zzso region of the membrane where it enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was effectively targeted to zzso where it zzso with zzso thereby reducing zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that it is the exclusion of zzso from zzso rather than simply the raft zzso of zzso and zzso that zzso A zzso generation within these cellular zzso
