zzso and zzso are citrus zzso that are among the most effective at zzso cancer cell growth in zzso and in zzso The zzso activity of zzso and zzso was investigated in human breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso and human colon cancer line zzso Both zzso inhibited proliferation in a zzso and zzso manner, and blocked cell cycle progression at zzso in all three cell zzso At zzso that resulted in significant zzso of proliferation and cell cycle arrest, neither zzso induced zzso or cell death in any of the tumor cell zzso To test the ability of arrested cells to zzso cells that were incubated with zzso and zzso for 4 days were then cultured in zzso medium for an additional 4 zzso zzso resumed proliferation similar to zzso control within a day of zzso zzso Cell cycle distribution was similar to that of control within 4 days of zzso zzso These data indicate that, in these cell lines at zzso that inhibit proliferation up to zzso over 4 days, zzso and zzso are zzso and significantly suppress proliferation by cell cycle arrest without zzso Such an agent could be expected to spare normal zzso from toxic side zzso Thus, zzso and zzso could be effective zzso zzso zzso zzso of proliferation of human zzso without inducing cell death may be advantageous in treating tumors as it would restrict proliferation in a manner less likely to induce zzso and death in normal, zzso zzso
