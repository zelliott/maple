zzso zzso synthesis and/or release represents a potentially useful approach to the prevention of cardiovascular zzso zzso production is zzso by zzso II zzso zzso or zzso zzso and is zzso mainly by zzso influx into adrenal zzso cells through zzso calcium zzso We therefore examined the effects of zzso a dual zzso zzso channel blocker, on zzso zzso in the zzso human zzso cell line; 100 zzso zzso II and 10 zzso zzso respectively increased zzso zzso from zzso cells zzso and zzso over zzso zzso zzso inhibited both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso an zzso zzso channel blocker, and zzso a relatively selective zzso channel blocker, similarly inhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but were much less potent than zzso zzso also lowered cortisol zzso most zzso among these zzso zzso zzso and zzso also significantly suppressed zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso which catalyze the final two steps in the zzso zzso whereas zzso reduced only zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso acts via zzso zzso channel blockade to significantly reduce zzso zzso and that this effect is zzso at least in part, by suppression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso
