zzso exert their actions via the zzso zzso through at least 2 zzso mechanisms, known as zzso and zzso It has been hypothesized that zzso is the basis of their zzso effects, whereas zzso has been assumed to cause their side zzso zzso a recently identified, novel selective zzso zzso zzso exerts strong zzso and weak zzso The objective of this study was to determine whether its pharmacological effects can be zzso from its side zzso For this, we employed in zzso zzso and topical in zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso were used in in zzso zzso and zzso zzso To evaluate zzso and zzso activities in zzso zzso and zzso zzso were tested in the zzso conjunctivitis model and allergic conjunctivitis model in zzso To evaluate side effects in zzso treatments with zzso and zzso zzso were tested for the zzso zzso effects in a zzso model, each drug being administered zzso 

zzso showed strong zzso and weak zzso in the in zzso zzso When given as zzso zzso and zzso zzso each had an zzso effect on zzso weight in the rat zzso conjunctivitis zzso In the rat allergic conjunctivitis model, zzso reduced the elevated vascular zzso at a concentration of zzso In the zzso zzso pressure zzso experiment, zzso administered zzso zzso elevated zzso but zzso had no effect on zzso 

The present investigations suggest that zzso zzso have both zzso and zzso effects, but no unwanted zzso zzso On that basis, zzso might be a promising candidate as an zzso drug with a better therapeutic index than classic zzso
