zzso zzso a zzso fluorescent zzso zzso has been recently characterized to exhibit preferential zzso property in the zzso of tumor zzso In this study, we investigated the possible mechanisms for its tumor selective activity and its potential as a drug delivery zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso into the zzso of tumor cells was affected by zzso and plasma membrane zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of organic zzso zzso peptides zzso may play a dominant role in the transportation of zzso zzso into tumor cells, while cellular zzso zzso membrane potential and the zzso cassette zzso did not show significant influence to its zzso We further evaluated the potential of zzso zzso as a drug delivery carrier by zzso zzso of zzso with nitrogen mustard zzso zzso imaging showed that zzso remained the tumor targeting property, indicating that zzso zzso could be potentially applied as a drug delivery agent for cancer targeted imaging and zzso
