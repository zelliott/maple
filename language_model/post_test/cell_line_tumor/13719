The hollow fiber zzso zzso is a drug discovery tool to aid investigators in the zzso of lead compounds identified by in zzso testing for further development in animal models of zzso In the zzso cells are cultured in hollow fibers containing pores of a diameter zzso zzso large enough for proteins and other zzso to zzso but too small for the cells to zzso The fibers are filled with cells, sealed and placed in the zzso cavity of zzso zzso The mice undergo a predetermined treatment regimen after which the fibers are retrieved and the cells evaluated for activity of a target relevant to the disease zzso The zzso combines advantages of both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso It uses the same cell lines used in culture systems, is a rapid zzso and requires fewer animals and less test substance than conventional zzso zzso Like traditional in zzso zzso the test substance is evaluated in a live animal, which zzso an initial assessment of associated toxicity and zzso properties of the test zzso
