Ewing zzso family of tumors zzso is a group of aggressive pediatric zzso driven by the zzso fusion zzso an zzso zzso factor zzso specific target zzso such as zzso Y zzso and its zzso and zzso receptors zzso Previously, we have shown that both zzso zzso and zzso zzso stimulate zzso cell death via its zzso and zzso Here, we demonstrate that this effect is prevented by zzso zzso zzso which cleave zzso to its shorter form, zzso not active at zzso We have shown that zzso cell death can be abolished by zzso of zzso and enhanced by their zzso Both zzso treatment and zzso blockade activated the same cell death zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso factor zzso Moreover, the decrease in cell survival induced by zzso zzso was blocked by zzso and zzso antagonists, confirming its dependence on zzso zzso Interestingly, similar levels of zzso cell death were achieved by blocking membrane zzso and zzso zzso and zzso Thus, this is the first evidence of these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso in live zzso In contrast, another membrane zzso zzso zzso protein zzso did not affect zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso act as survival factors for zzso cells and protect them from cell death induced by zzso zzso This is the first demonstration that zzso zzso are involved in regulation of zzso growth and may become potential therapeutic targets for these zzso
