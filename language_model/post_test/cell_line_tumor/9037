A new role for fat supplements, in particular zzso zzso acid zzso has been delineated in zzso although the underlying molecular mechanisms have not yet been zzso The aims of the present study were to identify the zzso zzso by zzso supplementation using a cell culture model and to determine whether this same zzso is also zzso in zzso by zzso supplementation associated with zzso In zzso zzso zzso rat cells zzso supplemented with different zzso of zzso exhibited increasing testosterone zzso accompanied by increasing levels of zzso zzso and zzso In zzso trained mice showed an increase in free plasma testosterone and an zzso of zzso zzso and zzso The effect of training on zzso expression and testosterone zzso was significantly higher in the trained mice supplemented with zzso compared to the zzso The results of the present study demonstrated that zzso stimulates testosterone zzso via zzso and endurance training led to the synthesis of testosterone in zzso by inducing the zzso of zzso zzso and protein in the zzso cells of the zzso This effect was enhanced by zzso zzso zzso zzso physical activity may be used for its zzso property in different fields, such as zzso industry, human zzso medicine, sport science, and zzso zzso
