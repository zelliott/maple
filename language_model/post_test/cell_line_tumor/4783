zzso delivery of zzso drugs triggered by zzso has significant advantages in clinical applications, since it is easy to implement and side effects are zzso To release drugs zzso upon local heating often requires the drugs to be loaded into a zzso zzso zzso with a low critical solution temperature zzso between 37 and 42 degrees zzso However, the zzso of most zzso materials were below 37 degrees C, which limits their application in clinic because they would zzso once injected into human body and lost zzso targeting zzso zzso we prepared a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso that exhibits no obvious physical change up to 41 degrees C when zzso zzso loaded zzso made of such zzso zzso were prepared by dialysis method and the maximum loading content was found to be up to zzso The physical properties, such as structure, zzso and size distribution of the zzso with and without zzso were investigated by zzso X-ray zzso dynamic light zzso atomic force zzso zzso The efficacy of this drug delivery system was also evaluated by examining the proliferation zzso activity against different cell lines in zzso After zzso the zzso of zzso zzso increased zzso Our results demonstrated that this zzso could be an ideal candidate for zzso targeted zzso drug zzso
