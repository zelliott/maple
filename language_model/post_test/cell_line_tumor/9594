In the present study, we investigated the effects of the zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which accumulate in maple syrup urine disease zzso on zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso reorganization by exposing the cultured cells to 1 and 5 zzso zzso We observed that cells showed a zzso shape with processes after 3 h zzso Cell death was also observed when cells were incubated in the presence of the zzso for 3 and 24 zzso zzso cells presented the most dramatic zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso revealed that all zzso induced reorganization of zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso regulates intermediate filament zzso zzso we verified that the zzso did not change the in zzso zzso of IF proteins either in zzso cells or in slices of cerebral zzso of rats during development zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, we observed that 3 h cell exposure to 5 zzso of each zzso resulted in a marked reduction of reduced zzso zzso levels and significantly increased zzso oxide zzso Finally, we observed that the zzso features caused by the zzso on zzso cells were prevented by the use of the antioxidants zzso (1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On the basis of the present results, we conclude that free radical attack might be involved in the cell zzso zzso as well as, in the zzso reorganization zzso by the zzso It is therefore presumed that these findings could be involved in the zzso features observed in patients affected by zzso
