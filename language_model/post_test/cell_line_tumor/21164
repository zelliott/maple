As the majority of prostate zzso zzso express zzso zzso we evaluated the combination of radiation and zzso stimulation zzso and zzso on the zzso of PC cells in zzso 

PC cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was analyzed by means of zzso zzso were incubated in zzso media with zzso 10 zzso and zzso 10 zzso 24 h before zzso and up to 24 h after zzso zzso survival, cell cycle changes, and expression of zzso were zzso 

zzso expressed both zzso and zzso zzso did zzso zzso of zzso and zzso with zzso resulted in a significant reduction of zzso zzso zzso with zzso exhibited in low zzso zzso zzso zzso effects, while higher zzso did not influence zzso Both zzso 10 zzso and zzso 10 zzso increased zzso zzso zzso in zzso while hormonal incubation abolished zzso in zzso In zzso cells hormonal stimulation inhibited zzso induction after zzso with 4 zzso In zzso cells, the proportion of cells in zzso was increased after zzso with 4 zzso 

We found an increased zzso to low zzso doses after incubation with zzso or zzso in zzso and zzso positive zzso zzso This is of high clinical interest, as this tumor model reflects a locally advanced, zzso dependent zzso In contrast, in zzso and zzso negative zzso cells we observed an abolishing of the zzso to low zzso doses by hormonal zzso The effects of both tested compounds on survival were zzso and zzso zzso Since zzso and zzso effects in both cell lines were comparable, neither zzso nor zzso seemed to play a role in the linked zzso zzso both compounds targeted the same molecular zzso To identify the underlying molecular mechanisms, further studies are zzso
