In order to understand the zzso processes underlying sporadic Alzheimer's disease zzso we carried out a zzso cloning screen for novel zzso candidate zzso We identified the gene zzso the DNA replication factor zzso zzso interacting zinc finger protein 1) as being more highly expressed in zzso tissue than in healthy zzso We show here that an zzso of zzso which lacks a zzso region, due to alternative zzso in zzso 8, is zzso in zzso brains relative to the full-length zzso zzso We demonstrate for the first time that a minimal 28 zzso acid sequence within this region is required for zzso to associate with the nuclear zzso and to form nuclear zzso
