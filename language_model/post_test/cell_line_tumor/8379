zzso zzso is a zzso protein and binds both bone zzso proteins zzso and zzso Cellular zzso acts as a zzso zzso to enhance the zzso of zzso a key iron regulatory hormone zzso predominantly by liver zzso In this study we characterized the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were expressed in liver zzso zzso of zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso levels by zzso in zzso zzso cells but only by about zzso in cells zzso with either empty zzso or zzso zzso zzso that does not bind zzso Further studies indicated that disruption of the zzso interaction is responsible for a marked suppression of zzso zzso Moreover, in zzso studies showed that zzso zzso zzso could be significantly suppressed by blocking the interaction of zzso with full-length zzso with a soluble zzso of zzso in zzso Together, these results suggest that the zzso interaction is required for the zzso induction of zzso expression when zzso is zzso Combined with our previous studies, our results support that zzso zzso possesses two functions, mediation of cellular zzso release, and stimulation of zzso zzso zzso
