A series of metal complexes were prepared as potential zzso of the extremely toxic DNA minor groove zzso zzso zzso and close zzso The zzso zzso were prepared from zzso in a zzso synthesis involving a zzso construction of a zzso zzso its appropriate zzso and a final radical zzso The metal complexes were prepared from these and the zzso metal complex zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso complexes were considerably more stable than the free zzso and showed significant zzso of the zzso of the latter, with zzso ratios zzso of 50- to zzso and substantial hypoxic cell zzso with zzso ratios zzso zzso of zzso to zzso The zzso complexes were also efficiently activated by zzso radiation, with G values for loss of the compound close to the theoretical value for zzso reduction of zzso zzso This work extends earlier observations that zzso zzso complexes are suitable for both the zzso and zzso release of potent zzso zzso
