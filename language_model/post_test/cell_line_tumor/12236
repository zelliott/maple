The synthesis of a series of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and some derived zzso and zzso ring systems is zzso All the newly zzso target compounds were subjected to the zzso zzso zzso zzso screening to be evaluated for their zzso zzso Eight compounds zzso zzso 7, 8, 10, 13, and 16; showed promising broad spectrum zzso activity against most of the tested zzso tumor cell lines zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso 3, zzso zzso although it did not show the highest growth zzso value zzso zzso zzso zzso it proved to be the most active analog in this study with the highest zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In general, the oxidized zzso displayed better zzso activity than their parent zzso zzso whereas the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso showed significant better zzso spectrum than the zzso and the derived zzso zzso
