Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in western countries and carries a poor overall five year survival zzso Several studies demonstrate that zzso zzso or zzso are actively involved in tumor development by serving as tumor zzso zzso or zzso In lung cancer, zzso may serve as both diagnostic and zzso zzso as well as regulate in zzso and in zzso tumor zzso However, zzso therapy is faced with several challenges including lack of tissue zzso lack of optimal delivery systems, poor cellular zzso and risk of systemic zzso Here, we report a zzso zzso based zzso delivery system to address some of these zzso Among many lung cancer related zzso zzso a tumor zzso was selected as a therapeutic target because it directly targets the zzso gene zzso thus regulating cell survival and sensitivity of lung cancer cells to zzso zzso The efficacy of zzso containing zzso was evaluated in zzso zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso agent, zzso delivered zzso in a more efficient manner with zzso increase in mature zzso expression and zzso difference in zzso protein zzso in zzso In the in zzso zzso study, zzso achieved zzso zzso in lung zzso which was zzso higher than zzso zzso zzso zzso Mice treated with zzso containing zzso had mature zzso expression in lung zzso higher than zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso zzso are a promising carrier system for the development of zzso zzso in lung cancer zzso
