The effect of polystyrene surface polarity on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been studied with atomic force zzso We demonstrated that bare zzso and zzso polystyrene surfaces featured similar zzso After the zzso zzso direct comparison of both types of zzso revealed drastically different zzso zzso values, and also zzso zzso This was interpreted in terms of zzso zzso changes induced by the surface zzso At zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso took place zzso for the zzso zzso in an increase of surface zzso whereas for the zzso one the zzso was approximately zzso zzso the zzso zzso characteristic for the first zzso layer tended to be zzso in the consecutive zzso as evidenced by height zzso The height of individual zzso molecules zzso zzso with the derived thickness of the zzso protein layer (the latter value being zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, for an unmodified and zzso polystyrene zzso that molecules are flattened on polar surfaces and more compact on zzso zzso It was also demonstrated that the zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso and hence the zzso zzso properties, depended on the chemistry of the original surface rather than on its zzso Our results also demonstrated the ability of surface polarity to influence the protein zzso and its associated biological zzso
