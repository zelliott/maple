zzso zzso are typically comprised of zzso diverse zzso Despite current advances in therapy, including surgical zzso followed by radiation and chemotherapy, the prognosis for patients with zzso remains zzso Unfortunately, most patients die within 2 years of diagnosis of their zzso zzso abnormalities vary among individual patients and also within each zzso Indeed, one of the distinguishing features of zzso is its marked genetic zzso Due to the brain location of the zzso the potential target zzso for zzso therapy must exhibit a manageable zzso profile in the concentration range in which the compounds show zzso zzso zzso zzso by small molecules such as zzso or zzso is currently under investigation in the field of zzso zzso In the current study we have assessed the relevance of the zzso zzso protein zzso in human zzso zzso 

In this study the target was validated using a set of well zzso and potentially specific small zzso zzso of zzso an zzso zzso zzso a zzso compound and 3 simplified derivatives of the zzso zzso Following an in zzso selection, those compounds predicted to bear a favorable zzso zzso profile were assessed for their zzso effect on cell lines derived both from primary zzso as well as treated zzso zzso For some compounds, these data could be compared to their effect on normal human zzso as well as their zzso on primary rat cortical zzso The zzso analogue 1 showed an zzso effect on zzso cell lines by blocking them in the zzso phase in a concentration range which was shown to be harmless to primary rat cortical zzso Furthermore, zzso analog increased zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

In the area of cell cycle zzso zzso is critical for proper zzso assembly and represents an attractive zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso when able to zzso the zzso could represent an interesting class of zzso drugs with low zzso effects in the treatment of brain zzso
