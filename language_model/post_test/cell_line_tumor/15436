zzso is a highly zzso invariably fatal brain tumor for which effective zzso remains an zzso medical zzso 

zzso of a compound library of 160 synthetic and natural toxic substances identified the zzso zzso as a previously zzso candidate for clinical zzso Considering the cellular and zzso zzso of glioblastoma, a portfolio of short-term expanded primary human zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso common zzso lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso human control cells zzso zzso 3) was applied as a discovery platform and for zzso zzso zzso analysis, study of zzso zzso zzso cell migration, zzso and on the frequency of zzso zzso cells were conducted in zzso and zzso zzso was used to confirm zzso effects in zzso 

zzso led to zzso zzso and zzso effects, strongly reduced the zzso of zzso cells in zzso and after exposure significantly diminished the zzso zzso potential in zzso zzso of action analysis revealed that zzso simultaneously inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso Furthermore, zzso drug testing established that a zzso deletion of the zzso locus in zzso samples could serve as a zzso zzso for predicting a synergistic activity of zzso with zzso the current standard in zzso zzso 

Together, our data advocate the use of zzso for exploration of compound libraries to reveal unexpected zzso for example, zzso that might be suited for further development toward personalized clinical zzso
