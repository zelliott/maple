zzso is the first choice zzso drug for patients with gastric cancer, but the mechanism that zzso plays the zzso role remains zzso The aim of this study was to clarify correlated zzso proteins induced by zzso in the zzso of human gastric cancer zzso zzso The time point of zzso induced by zzso in zzso cells was zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso were employed to compare the differentials of protein expressions of the zzso cells at the zzso phase and those of the zzso cells zzso with zzso The differential proteins included 14 zzso proteins and 8 zzso zzso They indicated a zzso zzso These proteins were zzso in gels by zzso and the mass of generated peptides were measured by zzso assisted laser zzso zzso time of flight mass zzso zzso The data obtained from zzso mass zzso zzso were searched out using the zzso available database mascot zzso The results showed that zzso analyses have evidenced that many kinds of proteins are involved in the zzso initiation of human gastric cancer zzso zzso These proteins are related to zzso zzso zzso and signal zzso and other aspects of zzso In conclusion, the experiment model of zzso of human gastric cancer zzso cells induced by zzso based on zzso analysis has been established, giving an impetus to researches of the mechanism of zzso in human gastric cancer, and laying a foundation for the selection of potential drug precursors specific for inducing zzso in human gastric zzso
