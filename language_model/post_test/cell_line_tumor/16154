The present study determines whether the novel designer zzso zzso zzso can zzso and deliver the zzso zzso gene to breast cancer cells to achieve a therapeutic zzso We have previously shown the benefits of zzso for cancer gene therapy but the stumbling block to future development has been the delivery zzso The zzso was zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso The particle size and charge were determined via dynamic light scattering zzso The toxicity of the zzso zzso was zzso using the cell toxicity and zzso zzso Over expression of zzso was confirmed via Western zzso and zzso zzso The zzso delivery system fully condensed the zzso gene with zzso less than zzso zzso with the zzso zzso resulted in a maximum of zzso cell killing and less than zzso zzso zzso zzso was confirmed and total zzso levels were in the range of zzso We report for the first time that the zzso can successfully deliver zzso and achieve a therapeutic zzso There is significant zzso coupled with evidence of a bystander zzso We conclude that the success of the zzso fusion protein in the delivery of zzso in zzso is worthy of future in zzso zzso
