zzso a member of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso is frequently expressed in zzso where its stimulation results in induction of zzso when de zzso protein synthesis is zzso The requirement of protein synthesis zzso for efficient killing suggests that zzso zzso potent survival signals capable of suppressing its zzso zzso We have found that zzso of zzso signaling on the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not on the zzso zzso axis zzso this balance and zzso zzso cells to zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso and zzso activities were found to zzso on the regulation of protein synthesis in zzso cells via a zzso involving the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso upstream of the translation zzso factor zzso In addition, zzso zzso was found to mediate a zzso and zzso target of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and its subsequent zzso from the zzso zzso protein zzso as well as an zzso zzso of zzso thus promoting translation zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso was found to be induced in zzso zzso zzso cells in a zzso zzso and zzso target of zzso zzso manner and zzso of zzso expression zzso to zzso zzso cell zzso These data underline the significance of the zzso and zzso pathways in controlling the balance between zzso survival and death signals through the regulation of the protein synthesis zzso zzso agents that target this machinery or its upstream zzso could, therefore, be exploited for zzso tumor zzso
