zzso an zzso navigation cue was proposed to play a crucial role during zzso zzso by regulating zzso The zzso receptors zzso and zzso were shown to belong to the family of dependence receptors that share the ability to induce zzso in the absence of their zzso Such a trait zzso on these receptors a tumor zzso zzso zzso of one of these dependence receptors at the surface of a tumor cell is indeed speculated to render this cell dependent on zzso availability for its survival, hence zzso uncontrolled cell proliferation or zzso zzso it is a selective advantage for a tumor cell to lose this dependence zzso activity, as previously described with losses of zzso and zzso expression in human zzso However, the model predicts that a similar advantage may be obtained by gaining zzso expression of the zzso We describe here that, unlike human zzso breast tumors, a large fraction of zzso breast zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we show that zzso zzso zzso tumor cell lines undergo zzso when zzso expression is zzso decreased or when decoy soluble zzso zzso are zzso Such treatments prevent zzso formation both in a zzso mouse model of lung colonization of a zzso cancer cell line and in a model of spontaneous lung zzso of zzso human breast zzso Thus, zzso expression observed in a large fraction of human zzso breast tumors zzso a selective advantage for tumor cell survival and potentially represents a promising target for alternative zzso therapeutic zzso
