DNA zzso is an zzso mechanism establishing long-term gene zzso during development and cell commitment, which is maintained in subsequent cell zzso zzso DNA zzso is found at gene promoters in most zzso and can lead to zzso of tumor zzso zzso The DNA zzso inhibitor zzso zzso is able to reactivate genes silenced by DNA zzso and has been shown to be a very potent zzso drug in several zzso zzso In this report, we demonstrate that zzso exhibits high zzso activity against zzso large cell zzso zzso a rare zzso positive zzso zzso of zzso zzso Low dose treatment of zzso cell lines and zzso tumors causes zzso and cell cycle arrest in zzso and in zzso This is also reflected in zzso expression zzso where genes related to zzso and cell death are amongst the most affected targets of zzso Furthermore, we observed zzso and zzso of zzso after drug administration and zzso associated zzso zzso Thus, our data provide evidence that zzso is highly efficient against zzso and warrants further clinical evaluation for future therapeutic zzso
