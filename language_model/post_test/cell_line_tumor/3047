zzso zzso zzso remains the most aggressive and frequently occurring brain zzso Members of the zzso family of small zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to participate in cell growth differentiation and zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso pathway, which includes zzso zzso protein zzso 1 and 2 zzso has been shown to regulate cell growth, differentiation and zzso Here, the involvement of the zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso pathway, along with zzso was investigated to determine their roles in zzso cell migration and zzso 

In zzso studies zzso the human zzso zzso cell line zzso The cells were treated with zzso a ROCK zzso and zzso an upstream zzso zzso inhibitor zzso alone or in combination with one zzso zzso analysis established the levels of zzso zzso Cell migration was determined by zzso migration zzso and cell proliferation by zzso 

zzso reduced zzso of zzso at zzso and 2 zzso zzso in combination with zzso led to a more pronounced repression of zzso growth factor zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso treatment zzso zzso treatment for 24 h suppressed zzso cell migration and resulted in a reduction in zzso cell zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso cell proliferation was suppressed by zzso with zzso or zzso with the greatest reduction achieved by a combination of the two zzso 

zzso signaling is involved in zzso cell migration and zzso and this zzso may be linked to zzso zzso
