zzso zzso are accepted treatment for zzso zzso that harbor specific driver zzso in zzso or zzso but only zzso to 50% of cases are zzso To uncover other potential zzso zzso we conducted zzso sequencing of a highly aggressive zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, we found a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso 15 in 49 tumors negative for zzso zzso as well as driver zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed that two zzso zzso zzso zzso and another two involved zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso signaling induced by zzso zzso was suppressed by zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A patient with zzso zzso zzso melanoma responded significantly to treatment with the zzso zzso zzso zzso these data show clinical significance to zzso zzso in zzso 

This study shows that cells harboring zzso zzso are sensitive to zzso inhibitor treatment, providing a rationale for routine screening and therapy of zzso zzso
