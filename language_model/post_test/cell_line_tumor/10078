To evaluate the effect of manipulating zzso zzso during zzso on lung zzso referring to its effect on the sensitivity of zzso tumor zzso 

zzso melanoma zzso zzso mice were continuously given zzso zzso to label all zzso zzso zzso They received zzso zzso following loading with the acute zzso agent zzso or local zzso at mild temperatures zzso Immediately after the zzso cells from some tumors were isolated and incubated with a zzso zzso The sensitivity of zzso zzso cells was assessed in terms of the zzso frequency using zzso zzso for zzso That of the total zzso + zzso tumor cell population was determined from zzso zzso zzso In other zzso mice, 17 days after zzso zzso lung zzso were zzso 

In the total cells, a more marked enhancement in sensitivity was observed with zzso than zzso In Q cells, zzso combination induced a more marked enhancement than zzso Both zzso and zzso reduced the size of the hypoxic fraction in the two cell zzso especially zzso in the total cells and zzso in Q zzso Without zzso zzso zzso loading tended to decrease the number of lung zzso With zzso zzso zzso loading and zzso especially the former, reduced the number of zzso more than zzso zzso zzso 

zzso manipulation in solid tumors has the potential to influence lung zzso zzso acute zzso zzso may be promising for reducing the number of lung zzso
