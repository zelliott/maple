zzso zzso zzso is the most lethal zzso zzso However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease development and zzso In this study, we found that the expression of zzso zzso factor zzso was greatly reduced in zzso tumors and in zzso cancer cell lines when compared with their normal zzso zzso surface zzso zzso In addition, we showed that zzso zzso inhibited the growth of cultured human zzso as well as zzso cancer cell lines, whereas targeted zzso of zzso zzso using small interfering zzso or zzso zzso zzso promoted the growth of these cells, confirming that the zzso effect was zzso zzso We also report for the first time that zzso is an important upstream regulator of zzso in human zzso Treatment of the cultured cells with 17 zzso zzso inhibited the expression of zzso protein and zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, which could be reversed by the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that the regulation was zzso zzso We further showed that this zzso of zzso gene zzso was a zzso primary effect of zzso zzso promoted zzso and zzso cancer cell growth, whereas simultaneous treatment with zzso and zzso zzso the zzso growth stimulation of these zzso This study is the first to demonstrate a role of zzso in zzso biology and zzso cancer and suggests that the loss of zzso may e of relevance in zzso
