zzso colitis is a chronic inflammatory condition associated with a high colon cancer zzso We have previously reported that American zzso extract significantly reduced the inflammatory parameters of chemically induced zzso The aim of this study was to further delineate the components of American zzso that suppress colitis and prevent colon zzso Among five different zzso of American zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso fraction has particularly potent zzso and zzso zzso The effects of this fraction were shown in a mouse zzso cell line zzso zzso in a human zzso cell line zzso and in an ex zzso model zzso primary zzso T zzso A key in zzso finding was that compared with the whole American zzso zzso the zzso fraction of American zzso was more potent in treating colitis in a zzso sodium zzso zzso mouse model, as well as suppressing zzso colon zzso Furthermore, terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso labeling of inflammatory cells within the zzso zzso zzso zzso was elevated in mice consuming zzso + the zzso fraction of American zzso zzso are consistent with our in zzso data and with the hypothesis that the zzso fraction of American zzso has zzso properties and drives inflammatory cell zzso in zzso providing a mechanism by which this fraction protects from colitis in this zzso mouse zzso This study moves us closer to understanding the molecular components of American zzso that suppress colitis and prevent colon cancer associated with zzso
