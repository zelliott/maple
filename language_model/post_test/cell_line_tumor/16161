We show here that zzso zzso zzso can be used to detect treatment response in a zzso tumor zzso a tumor type where detection of response with zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso is limited by the high background signals from normal brain zzso zzso C chemical shift images acquired following intravenous injection of zzso zzso zzso into rats with implanted zzso zzso showed significant labeling of zzso within the tumors but comparatively low levels in surrounding zzso zzso was observed at high levels in blood vessels above the brain and from other major vessels elsewhere but was detected at only low levels in tumor and zzso ratio of zzso zzso C label in tumor zzso compared to the maximum zzso signal in the blood vessels was decreased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso (a reduction of zzso by 72 h following whole brain zzso with 15 zzso
