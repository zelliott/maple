Currently available zzso zzso zzso for the treatment of chronic zzso B virus zzso infections profoundly reduce virus load, but rarely cure the virus zzso This is due, at least in part, to their failure to eliminate viral zzso closed circular zzso DNA from the zzso of infected zzso To screen compound libraries for zzso drugs targeting zzso we set out to develop a zzso zzso suitable for high zzso zzso Since zzso is time-consuming to zzso it was desirable to use a viral gene product that could serve as a reporter for zzso zzso zzso We predicted that the zzso of zzso e zzso zzso by zzso cells, a zzso zzso zzso expression cell line, would be zzso This is because a large portion of zzso zzso leader sequence in the zzso zzso of integrated viral zzso was deleted, preventing zzso expression from zzso but could be restored from the 3' terminal zzso of zzso zzso during viral DNA replication and subsequent zzso zzso Our experimental results showed that following zzso zzso produced and accumulated zzso which became zzso between 7 and 8 zzso zzso synthesis and zzso into culture fluid were dependent upon and zzso to the level of zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso by zzso cells could potentially serve as a convenient reporter for the high zzso screening of novel zzso drugs targeting zzso zzso
