The resistance of hypoxic cells to conventional chemotherapy is well zzso Using both zzso gene delivery and small molecules targeting zzso zzso zzso we evaluated the impact of zzso zzso on the sensitivity of hypoxic tumor cells to zzso The genetic therapy exploited a truncated zzso protein that acts as a zzso zzso zzso Its functionality was validated in six human tumor cell lines using zzso reporter zzso An zzso protein demonstrated that the zzso zzso was zzso and zzso expressed irrespective of oxygen zzso The small molecules studied were zzso zzso zzso its analog zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso have been previously established as zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were treated with either zzso or nontoxic zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and exposed to zzso in air or zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso activity only at zzso zzso and was not used in the combination zzso zzso zzso values in zzso were zzso higher than those in air for zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (9 zzso 4 versus 3 zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly reduced the zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, whereas only zzso yielded zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of infection 50) zzso the zzso resistance in both cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso 1 zzso zzso expression inhibited zzso zzso of the zzso protein Bid under zzso These data support the potential development of zzso targeted approaches in combination with chemotherapy, where hypoxic cell resistance contributes to treatment zzso
