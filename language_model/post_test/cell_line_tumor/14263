Despite the prevalence of prostate disease, little is known about the zzso of the prostate and its contribution to zzso The main goal of this work was to investigate how prostate zzso cells deal with inflammatory zzso To this aim, we zzso a rat prostate zzso cell line zzso zzso or rat primary zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso express significant levels of zzso zzso 4 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso could also be demonstrated, suggesting that these cells could recognize a broader spectrum of microbial molecular zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins were also zzso although not at the cell surface but zzso zzso zzso cells not only express these zzso but they are also able to respond to zzso and zzso zzso cells activate nuclear zzso zzso factor, induce the expression of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso zzso Even more, numerous zzso genes are zzso or induced in this zzso Our results clearly demonstrate that prostate zzso cells are fully competent to zzso The fact that they express zzso and zzso zzso suggests the presence of regulatory mechanisms, which once zzso could turn these cells into active players of the innate zzso capable of initiating an inflammatory zzso
