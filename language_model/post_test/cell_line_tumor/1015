zzso zzso zzso the production of zzso zzso the precursors of zzso zzso for DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso consisting of two zzso zzso zzso and either zzso or zzso which are considered to be involved in DNA replication and repair, zzso We have demonstrated that DNA damage by zzso and zzso caused a steady zzso of the zzso protein in zzso zzso human colon zzso cells but induced degradation of the protein in zzso zzso To evaluate the involvement of zzso in response to DNA damage, zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso with an expression zzso zzso short zzso interference zzso directed against zzso zzso zzso zzso clones exhibited a pronounced reduction of the zzso protein with no change in the cellular growth zzso Furthermore, short interference zzso reduction of the zzso protein caused a marked increase in sensitivity to the zzso agent zzso as well as to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso partially reversed the zzso of zzso but not that of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso The increase in sensitivity to zzso and zzso zzso was correlated with the suppression of zzso and zzso levels caused by stable expression of zzso short interference zzso These results indicated that DNA damage resulted in elevated levels of the zzso protein and zzso and, consequently, enhanced the survival of zzso zzso zzso The findings provide evidence that zzso can be employed to supply zzso for the repair of DNA damage in cells with an impaired zzso induction of zzso
