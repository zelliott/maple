The zzso of current animal colon cancer models is zzso This study was performed to evaluate whether zzso injection of a zzso colon cancer cell line into the zzso wall of zzso rats leads to a solid zzso 

A zzso of zzso prep was given to zzso zzso zzso was injected zzso Video zzso allowed for irrigation and zzso Failure was inability to zzso zzso zzso was performed by four zzso zzso of colon tumor cell suspension zzso zzso in zzso was injected into zzso wall with 23-gauge needle placed on zzso wire resulting in a zzso zzso were allowed to zzso Solid tumor growth was measured at scheduled zzso at zzso Sample size zzso zzso type I error zzso power zzso was based on a pilot zzso Data were presented as median zzso 

A total of 107 male zzso retired breeders weighing zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso with zzso injection of zzso zzso A single solid zzso cancer was identified in 98 zzso rats at scheduled zzso zzso confirmed zzso with tumor size of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in ten zzso zzso Distant zzso were found in three zzso zzso zzso occurred in four zzso zzso two aspirations and two colon zzso 

A solid zzso tumor without zzso or zzso has been developed by zzso injection of a rat colon cancer cell line in zzso of zzso zzso
