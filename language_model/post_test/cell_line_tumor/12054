zzso zzso a zzso magna zzso of zzso hydrocarbon zzso nuclear zzso zzso were isolated and the structural and functional features as well as the expression pattern of their product, zzso were zzso Among the known zzso zzso the deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso showed the highest degree of identity to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso mouse zzso cells resulted in the compensation for the loss of zzso response, suggesting the formation of a zzso with mouse zzso and that the resulting zzso binds to the zzso elements zzso leading to zzso of the downstream zzso zzso zzso of zzso magna zzso was evident at the middle to late stages of embryonic development (about 25 h to 48 h after zzso in several zzso including a pair of the 1st zzso 2nd zzso 2nd zzso five pairs of the zzso zzso the central nerve system, zzso zzso organ, zzso zzso and zzso As observed in other species, the zzso magna zzso is likely to function broadly as an expressed zzso partner in zzso zzso In contrast, expression of zzso in adult zzso magna was limited to the zzso of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso plays a role solely in zzso response in adult zzso
