The molecular mechanisms zzso resistance to zzso in prostate cancer patients remain partially zzso We generated zzso resistant derivatives of the zzso independent prostate cancer cell lines zzso and zzso zzso rapidly zzso zzso cell death via zzso and the drug resistant cells were produced by periodically exposing zzso zzso cultures to small doses of zzso In zzso cells zzso zzso delayed cell death via zzso catastrophe evident by profound zzso and formation of giant zzso zzso progeny of the giant zzso cells shows significant resistance to zzso Gene expression profiling of these zzso resistant zzso cells revealed sets of zzso zzso and zzso expressed genes associated with major cancer zzso A contradictory overlap with zzso zzso resistant cells was also zzso zzso suggested significant changes associated with zzso function, DNA repair, cell growth, survival and zzso zzso maintenance of zzso and zzso zzso zzso These cellular processes often contribute to drug resistance and our study identified a set of genes managing this zzso Additional analyses of the drug resistant zzso cells using zzso zzso determined direct relevance of zzso zzso to zzso resistance as well as prevention of zzso whereas the zzso of zzso zzso showed no effect on either of these zzso zzso zzso was explored by zzso zzso and even though zzso has a potential to mediate resistance to zzso it was not zzso in zzso zzso The results suggest complex combination of gene expression pattern changes that enables resistance to zzso while preventing death via zzso
