Work by our group has shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso cell cycle arrest at the zzso interface in human transitional zzso cell zzso This study evaluated the effect of zzso on cell cycle regulatory proteins relevant to this zzso 

The effect of zzso on selected cell cycle regulatory zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso was assessed in 2 human cell zzso After the identification of zzso as a candidate zzso zzso regulation was evaluated using a combination of zzso reverse zzso zzso chain reaction, and zzso zzso The immediate early versus delayed nature of zzso induction was zzso Finally, given the known potential for zzso to be regulated by both zzso dependent and independent zzso the role of zzso in zzso induced expression of zzso was zzso 

zzso increased zzso expression zzso relative to controls as measured by zzso and zzso zzso zzso of protein synthesis had no effect on zzso zzso zzso acid induction in response to zzso zzso cells contained a previously reported zzso in zzso In the zzso zzso zzso cells, deletion of one or both zzso response elements in the zzso reporter had no effect on zzso induced reporter zzso 

zzso zzso expression of zzso in human transitional cell zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in response to zzso occurs through an immediate early, zzso independent zzso The finding of increased zzso together with the observation that zzso zzso cell cycle arrest at the zzso zzso supports a role for this protein in the zzso response to zzso
