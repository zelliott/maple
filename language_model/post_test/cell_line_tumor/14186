zzso zzso is a heavy metal affecting human health both through environmental and occupational zzso There is evidence that zzso accumulates in several zzso and is zzso to zzso In zzso zzso mimics the effect of zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso In zzso breast cancer cell lines, zzso stimulates proliferation and can also activate the zzso zzso independent of zzso The ability of this zzso to increase gene expression in zzso cells is blocked by zzso suggesting that the activity of these compounds is zzso by zzso zzso The aims of this work were to test whether zzso zzso zzso proliferation in zzso cells, and also to study whether zzso specifically zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso We show that zzso prevents the zzso growth of synchronized zzso breast cancer zzso In transient zzso experiments, we prove that both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso by zzso zzso is a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso in both zzso response elements zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso is not inhibited by the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso zzso unable to bind zzso is activated by zzso but becomes insensitive to zzso zzso These results proved that zzso zzso zzso cell growth induced by zzso and zzso the zzso effect of the heavy metal in cells expressing zzso alpha at both zzso and zzso zzso We can zzso from these experiments that zzso regulates zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso These results also reinforce the hypothesis of the zzso properties of zzso as a valuable tool in breast cancer zzso
