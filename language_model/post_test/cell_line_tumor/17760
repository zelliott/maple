This study investigated the efficacy of zzso ultraviolet zzso zzso and the synergistic effect of zzso dioxide zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso At zzso doses of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso oxygen species zzso generated by zzso zzso radiation zzso and zzso achieved less than zzso zzso However, the synergistic effect of zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulted in zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso using zzso in combination with zzso reduced the dose requirement for zzso zzso by zzso An approximate zzso decrease in zzso of zzso was observed with zzso water in comparison to zzso water, whereas changes in pH from 6 to 8 had little effect on the zzso zzso of zzso in either zzso zzso
