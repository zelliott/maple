Recent studies demonstrated the zzso activity of bacterial DNA zzso zzso with zzso zzso This zzso is related to the ability of zzso to induce zzso the immune system, which is associated with release of inflammatory zzso Both activities seem to be related to the zzso zzso sequences present in the zzso Here we study the zzso activity of zzso DNA zzso with zzso lipids against various tumor cell zzso 

Various zzso acids zzso with zzso zzso were prepared and their zzso activity was studied in cell cultures and in zzso zzso Cell zzso of zzso was zzso and mechanism of DNA zzso activity was zzso 

We found that zzso zzso zzso DNA when zzso with zzso lipids is highly zzso against zzso and zzso tumor zzso zzso lipids alone were not toxic to these zzso The zzso activity does not result from zzso zzso of the zzso zzso as substitution of DNA by zzso did not result in zzso although the level of zzso of zzso charges per cell was similar to that of the zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso effect is specific to zzso zzso By studying the zzso acid fate using zzso zzso we found that zzso correlated with the release of DNA into the zzso following zzso of zzso zzso of calf zzso zzso zzso to mice with zzso zzso zzso resulted in doubling of median survival time and long-term survival in zzso of the zzso zzso Judging by low levels of zzso zzso and zzso in the treated mice, this effect cannot be ascribed to zzso zzso but rather to a direct zzso effect on the tumor zzso 

The above data provide a new insight into the mechanisms of zzso zzso effects in zzso and in zzso and new perspectives in cancer zzso
