Human zzso zzso 16 is the primary zzso agent of cervical zzso Most zzso therapeutic vaccines target zzso protein which is consistently expressed in tumor zzso In this study, we cloned mouse zzso heat shock protein 70 zzso gene from mouse liver cells and then expressed zzso and fused zzso zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso at the zzso proteins in zzso zzso Then we investigated the zzso of zzso cell growth by using the zzso zzso tumor cell line, zzso as a model of cervical zzso In this model, mice were zzso with the fusion protein of zzso without any zzso The results showed that zzso zzso of zzso protected mice against challenge with zzso zzso In addition, therapeutic zzso with zzso could inhibit zzso tumor growth on zzso Our study demonstrated that zzso with zzso protein without any zzso could generate zzso effect in mice challenged with zzso zzso
