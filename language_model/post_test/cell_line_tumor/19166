Multiple myeloma zzso is an incurable zzso of plasma zzso Although multiple myeloma patients often respond to initial therapy, the majority of patients will zzso with disease that is zzso to further drug zzso Thus, new therapeutic strategies are zzso One common mechanism of acquired drug resistance involves a reduction in the expression or function of the drug zzso We hypothesized that the zzso activity of zzso II zzso zzso poisons could be zzso and drug resistance zzso by increasing the expression and activity of the drug target, zzso II in myeloma zzso To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the zzso of the zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso in combination with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso Combination drug activity studies were done in zzso myeloma cells and its drug resistant zzso zzso We found that a zzso treatment of cells with zzso zzso increased zzso zzso protein expression and activity, and consistently increased the zzso of zzso in the zzso and zzso cell zzso This increase in zzso corresponded to an increase in DNA zzso breaks, as measured by the neutral comet zzso zzso increasing zzso zzso expression through zzso of zzso degradation increased DNA zzso breaks and enhanced the zzso of the zzso II poison zzso These data suggest that zzso stabilization of zzso zzso expression may zzso the zzso activity of zzso II poisons and zzso provide a strategy to circumvent drug zzso
