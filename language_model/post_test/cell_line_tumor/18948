Cellular zzso plays an important role in tumor zzso zzso tumor zzso has been reported to be crucial in cellular zzso However, the underlying mechanism is poorly zzso In this regard, a zzso zzso zzso was performed to identify zzso targets involved in zzso Among the many candidates is zzso a basic zzso zzso factor that has been recently shown to be zzso in zzso premature zzso However, it is not clear whether zzso is capable of inducing zzso Here, we found that zzso is a novel target gene of the zzso family and mediates zzso premature zzso Specifically, we showed that zzso is induced by the zzso family and DNA damage in a zzso zzso We also found that the zzso family proteins bind to, and zzso the promoter of the zzso zzso In addition, we showed that zzso of zzso zzso zzso arrest and promotes zzso Moreover, we found that targeting zzso zzso zzso zzso premature zzso in response to DNA zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso cellular zzso in zzso cells, albeit to a lesser zzso Finally, we showed that zzso zzso is zzso Taken together, our data provided strong evidence that zzso is one of the zzso downstream of zzso to promote premature zzso
