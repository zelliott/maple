Despite recent advances in linear whole zzso amplification of intact zzso amplification of zzso zzso acids in an unbiased fashion remains a serious challenge for genetic zzso We describe a new whole zzso amplification zzso zzso zzso and zzso Rolling Circle zzso which retains the zzso differences among zzso amplified zzso while achieving almost complete zzso zzso zzso zzso restriction zzso and whole zzso zzso to generate zzso sequences amenable to rolling circle zzso When intact zzso DNA is used, zzso retains zzso differences zzso or zzso between complex zzso on a zzso scale providing highly improved zzso with unamplified material as compared with other amplification zzso including multiple displacement zzso Using zzso zzso samples of modest or substantial DNA degradation were successfully amplified and screened via zzso or zzso zzso that displayed retention of the principal gene amplification features of the original zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso amplified zzso DNA is representative of the original material at the zzso zzso zzso of zzso is successfully performed via zzso and results to unbiased gene expression analysis zzso zzso zzso The simplicity and universal zzso of zzso make it a powerful new tool for zzso analysis with unique advantages over previous amplification zzso
