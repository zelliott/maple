The action of zzso zzso is zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso which is regulated by cell cycle proteins controlled by protein zzso We studied the effects of zzso and its analogue zzso zzso of protein zzso C zzso on zzso zzso in zzso colon cancer zzso Each drug contributes equally to the cell cycle effects of the zzso zzso In sequential drug administration, the cell cycle distribution was determined by the first zzso zzso zzso combinations induced additive effects in induction of zzso When zzso was used as the second drug, induction of zzso was zzso higher than the sum of both drugs zzso Based on induction of zzso zzso addition prior to the zzso zzso seemed zzso
