We have previously described a strong correlation between zzso cycling and insulin zzso We have also demonstrated a particularly important role for a zzso cycling zzso involving the zzso zzso carrier zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso requires zzso zzso as a zzso during zzso and zzso zzso Thus, considering that the zzso zzso carrier zzso provides an important source of zzso zzso we investigated the potential role of zzso in control of zzso insulin zzso zzso 

We used pharmacological and small interfering zzso zzso tools to assess the role of zzso in insulin release in zzso zzso zzso cells and isolated rat zzso 

zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso and zzso levels, and inhibited zzso in a zzso manner in zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression resulted in zzso of zzso by zzso to zzso the extent of zzso of insulin zzso being zzso to the level of zzso (also known as zzso gene zzso The most effective zzso duplex against zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso ratio, but did suppress zzso increments of the zzso zzso Confirmation of our results in primary cultures of isolated rat zzso showed that zzso and an zzso expressing an zzso against zzso zzso 

zzso transport by zzso may play an important role in zzso possibly by providing zzso zzso as a zzso for zzso and/or zzso export by zzso These studies also suggest that zzso transport by zzso is zzso a critical component of zzso production zzso by zzso and zzso regulates zzso
