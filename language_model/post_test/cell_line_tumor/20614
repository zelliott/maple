zzso melanoma is a devastating disease with limited therapeutic zzso zzso zzso are small non coding zzso molecules with important roles in zzso gene expression regulation, whose zzso expression has been implicated in zzso 

We show that the expression of zzso from a large cluster on human zzso zzso is significantly zzso in melanoma cell lines, benign zzso and melanoma samples relative to normal zzso This zzso cluster resides within a zzso imprinted zzso region known to be important in development and zzso In some melanoma cell lines, a zzso deletion or zzso was observed in the zzso regulatory region of this zzso In several cell lines we were able to zzso two zzso genes and several zzso from the cluster with a combination of zzso agents and zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso modifications take part in their zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso two zzso from this cluster that could be zzso following zzso zzso led to modest growth zzso and to a significant decrease in migration zzso zzso analysis predicted that both zzso could potentially target the zzso of zzso Indeed, stable expression of zzso and zzso in melanoma cells led to a decrease in zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso reporter zzso indicated that the zzso of zzso is a target of both zzso and zzso 

Our work is the first to show that the large zzso cluster on zzso zzso is silenced in zzso Our results suggest that zzso of zzso and zzso may contribute to zzso zzso and to zzso negative regulation of this signaling zzso in melanoma, thus promoting zzso and zzso
