Human tumors often contain slowly zzso cancer cells that resist treatment, but we do not know precisely how these cells zzso We show that rapidly zzso cancer cells can divide zzso to produce slowly zzso zzso progeny that are enriched following chemotherapy in breast cancer zzso zzso cancer cell division results from zzso suppression of zzso zzso signaling in one daughter cell during zzso of zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso signaling with zzso drugs can induce zzso cancer cell division and the production of slow zzso Cancer cells therefore appear to continuously flux between zzso and zzso division depending on the precise state of their zzso signaling zzso This model may have significant implications for understanding how tumors grow, evade treatment, and zzso
