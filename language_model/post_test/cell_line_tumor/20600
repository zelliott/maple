Side population zzso cells are identified as cells capable of excluding the fluorescent zzso dye and zzso drugs, and it represents zzso stem cells and zzso cells from several solid zzso In this study, we confirmed the presence of SP cells in tumors from melanoma zzso zzso SP cells zzso zzso (ABC) zzso zzso and zzso We generated a direct in zzso zzso model, and demonstrated that SP cells were resistant to zzso a zzso of zzso both in zzso and in zzso However, melanoma SP cells were also resistant to zzso which is not a zzso for ABC zzso through zzso zzso In addition, gene profiling studies identified three signaling pathways zzso zzso and zzso as zzso zzso in melanoma SP cells, and there was a significant increase of zzso and decrease of zzso and zzso in these zzso zzso we provide evidence that SP is an enriched source of zzso cells in human zzso and suggest that the selected genes and signaling pathways of SP cells may be a potential target for effective melanoma zzso To our knowledge, this is a previously zzso study to isolate SP cells from melanoma patients and to investigate the gene expression profiling of these zzso
