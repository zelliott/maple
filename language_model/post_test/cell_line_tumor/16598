zzso zzso 1 zzso the formation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and is a target for zzso zzso We demonstrate here that zzso zzso also referred to as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibit zzso zzso 1 activity with distinct zzso indicating that these compounds exhibit different binding zzso with zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a mixed inhibitor of zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso is competitive with zzso and uncompetitive with zzso and zzso zzso is uncompetitive with zzso and is a mixed inhibitor with respect to zzso A novel zzso model is proposed for the binding of inhibitor to zzso and zzso sites, the latter dependent on zzso zzso that provides an explanation for the different inhibitor zzso In addition, we demonstrate that the expression level and properties unique to an zzso 86 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso in prostate cancer cells reduce its sensitivity to zzso zzso degradation in comparison to zzso zzso these two zzso zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso have different zzso The reduced sensitivity of zzso to zzso degradation in response to zzso is translated into specific changes in zzso and zzso levels that leads to zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso our proposed zzso model might be zzso employed in the design of zzso zzso zzso to promote zzso of zzso resistant cancer zzso
