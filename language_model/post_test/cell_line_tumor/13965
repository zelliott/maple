Because multiple myeloma remains associated with a poor zzso novel drugs targeting specific signaling pathways are zzso The efficacy of selective zzso zzso zzso for the treatment of multiple myeloma is not well zzso In the present report, we studied the zzso activity of zzso a selective zzso zzso zzso on multiple myeloma cell zzso zzso effects were assessed by zzso salt reduction zzso cell cycle analysis, and Western zzso zzso shift zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and gene expression profiling were performed to characterize the mechanisms of zzso zzso Indeed, zzso as well as zzso decreased zzso and zzso myeloma cell viability and induced zzso zzso zzso and tamoxifen also increased the zzso response to zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso inhibited zzso nuclear zzso zzso activity in myeloma cells by removing zzso from its binding sites through zzso zzso alpha interaction with zzso It is noteworthy that zzso analysis showed that zzso treatment decreased the expression of known zzso genes involved in myeloma cell survival and zzso bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and induced the expression of a subset of genes regulating cellular cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso myeloma cell cycle arrest and zzso partly through zzso zzso These findings also provide a zzso profile of zzso treatment on multiple myeloma cells, offering the framework for future studies of selective zzso zzso zzso therapy in multiple zzso
