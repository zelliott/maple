The short arm of zzso 8, zzso is often rearranged in zzso typically showing zzso loss by unbalanced zzso We zzso zzso zzso in 48 breast, pancreatic and colon cancer cell lines by zzso in zzso zzso zzso and array comparative zzso zzso with a zzso path of zzso zzso resolution over zzso and 1 zzso resolution over zzso zzso zzso breast lines zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso Most cell lines showed loss of zzso zzso to a break that was between 31 zzso zzso to zzso and the zzso but the zzso were accompanied by variable zzso deletions and zzso zzso to this zzso The zzso zzso in zzso was flanked by an inversion of 4 zzso with a 100 zzso deletion at the zzso zzso The zzso zzso in zzso carries multiple zzso including zzso zzso a zzso zzso junction between zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso to zzso and two separate zzso of zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that if there is a zzso zzso gene on zzso it may be near 31 zzso for example zzso but the complexity of zzso zzso suggests that they target various genes zzso to 31 zzso including zzso and the zzso zzso around zzso
