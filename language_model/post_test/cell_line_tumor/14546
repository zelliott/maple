An zzso zzso zzso is a zzso whose pharmacological efficiency is dependent on its zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso in target zzso The aim of this review was to zzso our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of zzso action in the cancer zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the product of zzso zzso by zzso the zzso zzso are the zzso zzso of this zzso In contrast, two zzso zzso zzso and zzso derived from two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso generate two major zzso zzso in DNA found in the human breast zzso zzso cells, leukemia zzso and zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells and zzso zzso cells in zzso and in rat breast zzso in zzso zzso of these zzso DNA zzso by zzso is the zzso mechanism of its zzso and zzso activity to these cancer cell zzso zzso is also an zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the cancer cells and/or in zzso in rats exposed to this compound, thus modulating its own pharmacological zzso The study forms the basis to further predict the zzso of human zzso to zzso and suggests that this zzso for treatment in combination with zzso and/or zzso gene transfer increasing the zzso potential of this zzso It also suggests zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to be good candidates for targeting to tumors absent from the zzso and zzso zzso zzso
