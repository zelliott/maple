Dynamic nuclear polarization zzso is an emerging technique for increasing the sensitivity of zzso MR zzso zzso zzso was zzso using this technique by up to zzso representing a zzso increase in zzso The conversion of zzso zzso to zzso by zzso zzso was demonstrated using zzso zzso in cultured human zzso cells zzso These results represent the first step in developing an imaging technique for detecting zzso metabolism in zzso Furthermore, since zzso zzso has been correlated with cell zzso the study suggests a new technique for detecting changes in tumor cell zzso
