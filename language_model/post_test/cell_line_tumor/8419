zzso are used for numerous biomedical applications, but the selection of optimal properties for maximum delivery remains zzso Thus, there is a significant interest in zzso the zzso interactions underlying tissue zzso To date, researchers have relied on cell culture or animal models to study zzso zzso However, cell cultures lack the complexity of biological zzso and animal models are zzso slow and zzso Here we report a zzso system where incorporation of zzso zzso into a zzso channel permits real-time analysis of zzso zzso zzso at zzso flow zzso We show that penetration of zzso into the tissue is limited by their diameter and that retention can be improved by zzso zzso zzso transport is predominantly zzso with zzso improving zzso mostly at the tissue zzso A zzso zzso model confirms these findings and demonstrates that the zzso can be useful for screening optimal zzso designs prior to in zzso zzso
