Continuous zzso with zzso reducing zzso zzso cell death, known as zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the zzso arrest and zzso caused by the zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso and 40 zzso zzso zzso were added to zzso zzso cells, and cell zzso zzso and DNA zzso changes were zzso zzso showed zzso and zzso effects on cell viability and on cell zzso and zzso At a zzso dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso arrest was observed after 16 hours, and zzso zzso zzso indicated a slow, zzso increase in zzso zzso At a zzso dose of 40 zzso DNA fragmentation was observed at 2 hours, indicative of early damage in the zzso In zzso our results showed that continuous zzso with zzso zzso induced zzso arrest and progressive zzso which may be characteristic mechanisms of zzso zzso
