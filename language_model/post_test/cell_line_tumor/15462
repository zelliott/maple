The mechanical features of individual cells have been regarded as unique indicators of their states, which could constantly change in accordance with cellular events and zzso zzso cancer progression was characterized by the disruption and/or reorganization of zzso filaments causing mechanical zzso Thus, mechanical characterization of cells could become an effective zzso approach for early detection of zzso To develop mechanical zzso it would be necessary to clarify the mechanical properties in various cell zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the surface mechanical behavior of cancer and normal cells in the adherent and suspended states using atomic force zzso zzso normal zzso cells showed high surface zzso due to developed zzso cap structures on their zzso surface, whereas cancer cells did not have developed zzso zzso structures, and their surface zzso was zzso Upon cell detachment from the zzso zzso zzso structures of adherent normal zzso cells reorganized to the cortical region and their surface zzso decreased consequently however, the zzso of suspended normal cells remained higher than that of cancer zzso These suspended state zzso structures were similar, regardless of the cell zzso Furthermore, the mechanical responses of the cancer and normal zzso cells to zzso of the zzso zzso were different, suggesting distinct regulatory mechanisms for zzso zzso in cancer and normal cells in both adherent and suspended zzso zzso cancer cells possess specific mechanical and zzso zzso features different from normal zzso zzso
