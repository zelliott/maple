A zzso zzso of the zzso extract of zzso zzso yielded six zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The structures of isolated compounds were determined using zzso zzso Among these zzso compounds zzso showed potent zzso against five human tumor cells, while compounds 1 and 6 did zzso In the case of compounds 1 and 2, zzso zzso zzso compound 1 was zzso but compound 2 showed potent zzso In addition, compound 5 exhibited potent zzso but, compound 6 which is the zzso of compound 5 was zzso active against tumor cell zzso zzso in the case of zzso zzso the zzso appeared to be affected by the structural differences, zzso the zzso of zzso group and the number of zzso double zzso Taken all together, the present study isolated six zzso from zzso zzso for the first time based on a zzso zzso and indicated that isolated zzso could exhibit the zzso effects against tumor cells, suggesting that zzso zzso might be a promising candidate for the development of zzso zzso
