zzso natural killer T zzso cells from zzso zzso patients are zzso and functionally zzso zzso zzso zzso cells drive zzso T cells into a zzso response to suppress zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells do not affect either zzso T cell zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells from patients with zzso zzso impair the production of zzso by zzso zzso zzso In this study, we have established a zzso zzso model to further investigate the underlying mechanism of zzso zzso zzso cells in suppressing zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells suppress zzso zzso in a manner dependent on the zzso response and zzso zzso T zzso However, adoptive transfer with zzso zzso cells alone zzso T cell zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso cells themselves zzso high levels of zzso enhancing the persistence of zzso transferred zzso zzso cells and T cells, thereby leading to a more pronounced T cell zzso response in zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, immune zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso enhances T cell zzso zzso providing a potential zzso and therapeutic treatment for zzso zzso
