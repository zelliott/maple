The zzso zzso is frequently zzso in human zzso and a promising target for immune zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso of mouse or rat zzso leads to markedly reduced levels of major zzso complex zzso class I and molecules of the zzso processing and presentation machinery zzso thus resulting in a zzso promoting tumor escape from the immune zzso Our study focuses on analyzing the effect of zzso on zzso class I zzso presentation and sensitivity to zzso specific zzso T zzso zzso in zzso melanoma cell zzso We demonstrate significant inverse correlations both between the expression of zzso and total zzso class I surface expression as well as between zzso and zzso A significant reduction of zzso levels was found when melanoma and zzso cell lines were zzso with a human zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was crucial for the observed zzso zzso as zzso expressing high levels of zzso zzso in the zzso signaling domain did not show altered zzso zzso zzso the human melanoma cell line zzso demonstrated reduced zzso and melanoma zzso recognition by zzso upon zzso zzso In addition, high expression of zzso prevented both zzso zzso zzso zzso and improved recognition by zzso zzso in treated zzso Moreover, key zzso molecules were zzso by zzso These findings zzso that zzso zzso tumors may be more prone to escape from zzso restricted zzso suggesting that zzso approaches inducing an integrated zzso cellular and innate immune response would be most zzso
