The zzso zzso factor zzso also known as zzso is a master zzso of zzso gene expression and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Recently, zzso was identified as a human zzso zzso in zzso zzso suggesting that its regulation may have important zzso and pathological zzso However, the pathways controlling zzso have yet to be zzso Here we show that zzso is regulated by zzso zzso and use an zzso interference zzso screen to identify a zzso protein complex containing the zzso protein zzso zzso as an zzso zzso zzso responsible for zzso zzso zzso binds and zzso zzso and controls its stability through a zzso zzso During neural zzso zzso is zzso in a zzso zzso zzso is required for proper neural differentiation only in the presence of zzso indicating that zzso zzso this process through degradation of zzso zzso failure to degrade zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we find that zzso zzso which is common in human zzso zzso causes zzso transformation of human zzso zzso cells and that this zzso function requires zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a key target in zzso transformation and the zzso axis is a new regulatory zzso controlling zzso
