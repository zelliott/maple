zzso zzso tumors zzso are aggressive pediatric zzso arising in brain, kidney and soft zzso which are characterized by loss of the tumor zzso zzso zzso are poorly responsive to chemotherapy and thus a high zzso clinical need exists for novel therapies for zzso zzso zzso is a core zzso of the zzso zzso zzso complex which affects gene expression by zzso zzso Here, we report that loss of zzso function zzso with increased expression of zzso growth factor receptors zzso in zzso cell lines and primary tumors and that zzso of zzso in zzso cells causes a marked repression of zzso zzso zzso zzso impairment of zzso function leads to elevated levels of zzso in human zzso In zzso treatment with zzso a selective zzso zzso blocks progression of a zzso zzso zzso zzso we identify zzso signaling as an zzso activated zzso zzso in zzso and propose pharmacological zzso of zzso as a potential novel clinical therapy for zzso
