zzso factor zzso is zzso expressed on tumor vascular zzso cells zzso and on cancer cells in many zzso tumors, but not on normal zzso making it a promising target for cancer zzso As a zzso zzso for zzso factor zzso zzso zzso forms a zzso complex with its zzso zzso which is subsequently zzso through zzso zzso zzso we developed a method for selectively delivering zzso a potent synthetic zzso zzso to zzso tumor zzso and tumors using zzso as a drug zzso zzso was chemically zzso to zzso through a zzso zzso After binding to zzso targets by zzso zzso will be zzso along with the drug carrier and will exert its zzso Our results showed that the zzso zzso vascular zzso growth zzso zzso in a rabbit cornea model and in a zzso model in zzso nude zzso The zzso zzso in tumor cells and significantly reduced tumor size in human breast cancer zzso in zzso nude mice as compared with the zzso zzso By zzso potent drugs to zzso this targeted drug delivery system has the potential to enhance therapeutic zzso while reducing toxic side zzso It may also prove to be useful for treating drug-resistant tumors and zzso in addition to primary zzso
