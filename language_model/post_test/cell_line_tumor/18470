zzso of precursor into specialized cells involves an increasing restriction in zzso capacity, culminating in cell cycle zzso In this report we used a human zzso cell line to study the molecular mechanisms that coordinate cell cycle arrest and zzso zzso Exposure to zzso acid zzso a differentiation agent in many cell types, causes an zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso at a zzso zzso Full zzso zzso of these two genes requires zzso zzso sequences found in the zzso and zzso zzso As reported for other zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso basic zzso zzso proteins enhances zzso expression of zzso and zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso exerts opposite zzso In addition, zzso expression of zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso is able to activate zzso zzso in the absence of zzso More importantly, we show that zzso and zzso proteins bind the zzso and zzso promoter sequences in zzso Since they establish a direct zzso link between a cell cycle zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins would play an important role in zzso key events of cell cycle arrest and zzso zzso
