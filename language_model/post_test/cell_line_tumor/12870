Two of the hallmark features of melanoma are its development as a result of chronic zzso radiation exposure and the limited efficacy of zzso in the disease zzso Both of these zzso agents result in large zzso DNA damage that is recognized and repaired by zzso zzso repair zzso The aim of this study was to examine the expression of zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso in melanoma cell lines treated with zzso compared with zzso zzso expression of all genes was greater in the melanoma cell lines compared with zzso Global zzso repair zzso transcripts showed significantly decreased relative expression zzso in melanoma cell lines 24 hours after zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was significantly higher in the melanoma cell lines compared with the zzso However, induction of zzso was only significant in the zzso at 6 and 24 hours after zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression significantly decreased the expression of all the zzso transcripts in zzso at 6 and 24 hours after zzso zzso Although the zzso levels were lower with zzso zzso the induction of the zzso genes was very similar to that in the control zzso and increased significantly across the time zzso The findings from this study revealed reduced zzso transcript levels in melanoma cells 24 hours after zzso zzso Our findings suggest a possible zzso explanation for the limited efficacy of zzso treatment and the possible role of zzso light in zzso
