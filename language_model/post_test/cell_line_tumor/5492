zzso cell expansion relies on zzso supply, and oxygen limitation is central in controlling zzso and tumor zzso zzso zzso into tumors from the circulation along defined zzso zzso differentiate into zzso zzso zzso and then accumulate in the hypoxic zzso zzso zzso density in some regions or overall zzso numbers are correlated with increased tumor zzso and a reduced host survival in the case of various types of zzso To evaluate the role of zzso in tumor growth, we here specifically eliminated zzso by in zzso application of zzso zzso zzso zzso to mice bearing various types of tumors zzso zzso melanoma, zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso Lewis lung zzso all of which grew in the zzso of zzso mouse zzso When zzso were injected into four spots to surround the tumor on day 0 or 5 after tumor injection and every third day thereafter, both the induction of zzso and the tumor growth were suppressed in a zzso and injection zzso manner; and unexpectedly, the tumor cells were rejected by 12 injections of three zzso zzso The absence of zzso in turn induced the invasion of inflammatory cells into or around the zzso and the major population of zzso cells zzso against the target tumor cells were zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso zzso These results indicate that both the absence of zzso and invasion of zzso zzso zzso resulted in the tumor zzso
