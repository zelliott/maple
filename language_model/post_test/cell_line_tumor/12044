zzso usually forms solid zzso in patients, and high expression levels of zzso molecules are observed in these zzso However, zzso zzso zzso zzso primary zzso zzso zzso does not form solid zzso and zzso zzso expression is suppressed in the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso cell line into the zzso cavity of severe combined zzso mice resulted in the formation of zzso and solid zzso in the zzso zzso zzso using two-dimensional difference gel zzso and DNA zzso analyses identified 14 proteins and 105 zzso respectively, whose expression differed significantly between zzso and solid zzso Five genes were identified as having similar expression profiles to that of zzso zzso zzso 1, an important zzso zzso in zzso Among these, zzso zzso an zzso zzso was identified as a zzso showing high expression in solid zzso by both DNA zzso and zzso zzso Western and northern zzso showed that zzso zzso was predominantly expressed in solid zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso including viral zzso were highly expressed in zzso zzso compared with solid zzso These data demonstrate that zzso and solid zzso possess distinctive gene and protein expression profiles in our mouse model, and suggest that differences in gene and protein expression between zzso and solid zzso may be associated with the formation of zzso zzso or invasive features of solid zzso Furthermore, the results obtained using this combination of zzso and DNA zzso analyses indicate that protein synthesis partly zzso but does not correlate strictly with, zzso zzso
