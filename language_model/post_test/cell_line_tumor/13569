An important hallmark of cancer cells is acquired resistance toward zzso The zzso zzso is the most zzso cell death program and is characterized by several zzso and zzso zzso The tumor zzso protein zzso is a critical regulator of zzso in many cell zzso zzso stimulates a wide network of signals that act through either zzso or intrinsic pathways of zzso However, a number of studies have shown that zzso can be induced in a zzso manner as zzso In this study, we examined the mechanism of zzso in zzso breast cancer cells in response to the zzso inhibitor zzso Initially, we determined the zzso status of zzso breast zzso and zzso (a highly zzso zzso of zzso cells and verified that both cells are zzso zzso It was subsequently shown that zzso can be induced in both cells in a zzso manner in response to zzso treatment, based on DNA fragmentation zzso Western zzso analyses of zzso zzso additionally showed that the zzso is zzso inhibited by zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results presented in the current study also show that zzso is significantly activated in response to the treatment with zzso zzso that induction of zzso in these zzso cells is occurring via zzso The additional results presented here suggest that the zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso are not critical regulators of zzso induction in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Similarly, there was no difference in the expression level of zzso in treated cells, suggesting that this zzso protein is also zzso in the zzso response resulting from zzso zzso In contrast, a very significant zzso of the zzso protein zzso was detected in these zzso cells after treatment with zzso If the increased expression of zzso protein levels are zzso the zzso effects of the zzso treatment, then the zzso effects of such zzso zzso might be increased with approaches simultaneously zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso
