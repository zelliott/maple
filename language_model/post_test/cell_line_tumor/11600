zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) functions as a zzso regulator of the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso in response to zzso radiation zzso Here we identify zzso protein zzso 2 zzso as a protein zzso that targets zzso for zzso and zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso is zzso zzso by zzso and maintained at a low level by zzso zzso In response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso of zzso zzso through zzso of zzso from zzso followed by stabilization of zzso for termination of the zzso zzso break zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso depletion zzso zzso zzso zzso formation, zzso checkpoint zzso and DNA repair zzso and the survival rate of zzso mice upon zzso is markedly reduced compared to zzso zzso Taken together, zzso plays a critical role in the initiation of zzso repair signaling by controlling zzso levels in response to zzso
