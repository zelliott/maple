In the last decade short interfering zzso zzso became an important means for functional zzso and the development of zzso zzso However, major technical hurdles in the application of zzso include its cellular delivery followed by its zzso trafficking and its release in order to enter the zzso interference zzso zzso The novel zzso cellular zzso of zzso contrasts other known delivery systems because it involves a zzso zzso in which large amounts of zzso are delivered to the zzso environment, leading to measurable though moderate target zzso Limited efficacy seems to be related to zzso zzso of zzso To study the role of zzso trafficking of zzso for biological effectiveness we studied whether a signal zzso for zzso transport of bacterial protein zzso which is zzso attached to zzso can promote its release from the zzso space into the zzso and thereby enhance its biological zzso We show that attachment of the zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso improves target zzso after its zzso zzso This is related to increased zzso of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso In zzso this study strongly suggests that zzso release of zzso leads to increased biological zzso Thus zzso zzso zzso are proposed as new tools to study the relationship between zzso transport and efficacy of zzso
