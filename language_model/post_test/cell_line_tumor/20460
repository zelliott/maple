To gain a global view of zzso zzso around zzso zzso promoter regions, and to identify zzso regulated zzso we developed a novel zzso promoter zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso We designed a custom zzso zzso covering regions spanning zzso to zzso zzso of precursor zzso in the human zzso This zzso covers zzso zzso each of which is covered by approximately 100 zzso zzso over its zzso zzso position, that includes predicted zzso start zzso Using this custom-made zzso promoter zzso we successfully performed zzso zzso to identify zzso regulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed increased levels of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso gastric cancer cells treated with the zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso One of these zzso zzso is zzso in gastric cancer zzso and is activated by zzso drugs, suggesting that it may be a potential target for zzso therapy of gastric zzso
