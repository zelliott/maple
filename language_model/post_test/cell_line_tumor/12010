Many tumors are resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso This study examined the role of zzso zzso via an zzso loop, in the regulation of zzso resistance to zzso zzso We have reported that zzso expression and sensitivity to zzso is zzso regulated by the zzso zzso factor zzso Yang 1 zzso Thus, we hypothesized that zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso both of which zzso regulate zzso expression and sensitivity to zzso zzso This hypothesis was tested in zzso prostate cancer cells which zzso and zzso zzso and express zzso active zzso and zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso (10 zzso resulted in increased zzso and zzso zzso activity, zzso of zzso zzso zzso of surface and total zzso expression and enhanced resistance of zzso to zzso induced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, blocking the binding of zzso zzso on zzso cells with soluble zzso zzso resulted in significant zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity, zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression and zzso of tumor cells to zzso zzso The regulation of zzso expression and activity by zzso was demonstrated by the use of the zzso inhibitor Bay zzso and by the use of a zzso reporter system zzso deletion of the zzso binding site in the promoter significantly enhanced zzso zzso The direct role of zzso expression in the regulation of zzso resistance to zzso zzso was shown in cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso such cells exhibited zzso of zzso expression and were zzso to zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that the zzso zzso loop is involved in the zzso zzso of the zzso factors zzso and zzso in the tumor cells and this loop leads to zzso of zzso expression and resistance to zzso zzso Further, these findings identify new targets such as zzso zzso and zzso whose zzso can reverse tumor cell resistance to zzso zzso
