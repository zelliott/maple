zzso zzso zzso zzso is a new therapeutic target for acute zzso leukemia zzso because zzso zzso are the most common genetic zzso in zzso and are directly related to zzso We studied zzso interactions of a zzso zzso zzso with eight conventional zzso agents zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso using three leukemia cell lines carrying zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and five leukemia cell lines without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed synergistic effects with all agents studied except zzso for zzso cell lines in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was rather zzso to most drugs, except for zzso and zzso in leukemia cell lines without zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso induced zzso arrest in leukemia cell lines carrying zzso zzso whereas it arrested cells in zzso phase in the absence of zzso zzso which may zzso the divergent zzso zzso These results suggest that the simultaneous administration of zzso and other agents except zzso is clinically effective against zzso zzso zzso whereas it would be of little benefit for zzso zzso zzso Our findings may be of help for the design of zzso combination zzso
