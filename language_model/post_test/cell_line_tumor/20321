The synthesis and characterization of complexes zzso where zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso and X is zzso zzso or I, are reported, including the X-ray crystal structures of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in which zzso is zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso were studied for zzso The zzso zzso complexes undergo zzso reactions in zzso solution at 310 zzso their zzso for zzso range from 14 to zzso zzso zzso functional theory calculations on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggest that zzso occurs via an zzso zzso and that the reaction is zzso zzso when the leaving zzso is I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values for the aqua zzso of the complexes range from zzso to zzso A binding preference for zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso was observed for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso solution at 310 zzso The X-ray crystal structure of the zzso complex zzso shows multiple hydrogen zzso zzso functional theory calculations show that the zzso zzso of all complexes are zzso preferred compared with those of zzso However, the zzso complexes are inactive towards zzso human zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso DNA interactions for zzso and zzso consist of weak zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso such as zzso may play a role in zzso the zzso zzso
