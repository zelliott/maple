zzso zzso segregation during zzso relies on a dynamic zzso zzso zzso interface that switches from a zzso to a stable condition in response to correct zzso zzso This transition is essential to satisfy the zzso checkpoint zzso and couple zzso force with zzso movements, but the underlying regulatory mechanism remains zzso In this study, we show that during zzso the zzso and zzso protein zzso is progressively and zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the establishment of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso which primed zzso for association with zzso zzso recruitment to zzso was enhanced by zzso zzso on zzso This was specifically required to stabilize zzso attachments important for zzso alignment and to coordinate zzso and zzso zzso dynamics necessary to maintain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso was also required for zzso alignment and timely satisfaction of the zzso We propose that zzso and zzso mediate a fine zzso zzso that temporally regulates zzso attachment zzso
