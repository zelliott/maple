zzso is a 66 zzso zzso intermediate filament protein found most abundantly in the zzso of the nervous systems during early zzso To characterize the function of mouse zzso promoter, we designed two different expression zzso driven by zzso zzso or zzso zzso of mouse zzso zzso zzso one was the enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso reporter for monitoring specific expression in zzso and the other was the zzso for studying the functional DNA zzso in transgenic zzso After introducing DNA zzso into zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso cell line by zzso zzso we observed that the expression of zzso with zzso zzso mouse zzso promoter was in a zzso zzso To establish a zzso pattern in the nervous system, we generated a transgenic mouse line expressing zzso DNA zzso under the control of zzso zzso zzso zzso The activity of the zzso zzso at zzso day 1 was examined by mating the zzso transgenic mice to zzso reporter zzso mice with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso day 1 zzso newborns showed that zzso activity was detected in the peripheral nervous system zzso such as zzso nerves zzso the tongue and the skin as well as spinal nerves to the body zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso root zzso zzso zzso showed positive for zzso in cell bodies but negative in their spinal zzso The motor zzso in the spinal zzso did not exhibit any zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso driven by mouse zzso promoter, described here, provides a useful animal model to specifically manipulate genes in the developing nervous zzso
