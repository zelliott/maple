zzso of DNA zzso 2 zzso belongs to a family of zzso zzso characterized by a zzso zzso motif that lacks the basic zzso acid domain necessary to bind zzso The aim of this study was to obtain a better understanding of the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Following zzso induction in a rat model of middle cerebral artery zzso zzso the number of zzso cells in cerebral zzso of the zzso area increased zzso while the zzso zzso and protein expression were also significantly zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso rat zzso zzso cell line also demonstrated enhanced zzso zzso and protein expression as well as increased number of cells in the zzso populations after zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso a zzso zzso was also zzso in zzso and in zzso Moreover, triple zzso demonstrated the obvious zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells, and zzso might play an important role in zzso zzso zzso
