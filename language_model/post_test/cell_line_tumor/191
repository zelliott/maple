zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso both zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and cortical target areas, has been implicated in mood disorders such as major depression and zzso Within the zzso zzso zzso a powerful dual zzso element zzso is regulated by two protein zzso zzso and a second, unknown zzso Here we identify human zzso a zzso zzso as the second zzso 

zzso distribution was examined with Northern and Western zzso reverse zzso zzso chain reaction, and zzso zzso function was examined by zzso mobility shift, reporter zzso and Western zzso 

zzso zzso was widely distributed in brain and peripheral zzso zzso protein was enriched in the nuclear fraction of human prefrontal zzso and zzso but was zzso expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In prefrontal cortex, zzso was expressed at similar levels in control and depressed male zzso zzso zzso protein bound specifically to zzso or 3' human zzso adjacent to the zzso zzso Human zzso showed strong zzso activity at the human zzso or zzso promoter in human zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso cells, a model of zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, small interfering zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression zzso zzso promoter activity and increased levels of zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso 

Human zzso binds to the zzso zzso and zzso the human zzso zzso gene to regulate its expression in zzso cells and zzso
