It has been proposed in the literature that zzso magnetic zzso zzso could be exploited to enhance or accelerate nerve zzso and to provide guidance for zzso zzso zzso could create mechanical tension that stimulates the growth and zzso of zzso zzso suitable for this purpose should possess zzso high zzso zzso zzso a negligible zzso profile, and zzso a high capacity to zzso zzso zzso Unfortunately, the materials currently available on the market do not satisfy these zzso therefore, this work attempts to overcome these zzso 

zzso particles were zzso by an zzso zzso method and characterized based on their external zzso and size distribution zzso transmission electron zzso zzso as well as their zzso zzso zzso and magnetic properties zzso zzso zzso Devices zzso Cell viability was assessed via zzso blue dye exclusion zzso cell doubling time, and zzso cell proliferation zzso and zzso oxygen species zzso zzso zzso was monitored via zzso blue zzso zzso iron content zzso via a zzso zzso and direct zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso electron zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed on human zzso zzso cell line and primary zzso cell cultures of the peripheral nervous zzso 

This paper reports on the synthesis and characterization of zzso magnetic zzso zzso with an average diameter of 73 zzso 6 zzso that are designed as magnetic zzso for neural zzso The cells were able to incorporate quantities of iron up to 2 zzso The zzso distribution of zzso obtained by optical and electronic zzso showed large structures of zzso crossing the cell membrane into the zzso thus rendering them suitable for magnetic manipulation by external magnetic zzso Specifically, migration experiments under external magnetic fields confirmed that these zzso can effectively zzso the cells, thus inducing measurable migration towards zzso directions more effectively than commercial zzso zzso supplied by zzso There were no zzso toxic effects from zzso on cell viability for working zzso of 10 zzso zzso of zzso zzso compared to 12 zzso in zzso Cell proliferation zzso performed with primary cell cultures of the peripheral nervous system confirmed moderate zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

These results indicate that loading neural cells with the proposed zzso is likely to be an effective strategy for promoting zzso neural zzso through cell magnetic zzso
