The zzso gene is zzso in the germ line of patients with zzso zzso Parkinson disease, and zzso zzso function at zzso zzso has been related with the zzso of this zzso However, the expression and function of zzso protein in zzso zzso has not been determined zzso Here, we have analyzed zzso protein expression and zzso distribution in normal and zzso human zzso and investigated the function of zzso in breast zzso zzso zzso zzso as stained by a specific zzso zzso zzso was widely expressed in human zzso displaying high expression in zzso zzso and in the central nervous system and lower expression in zzso of zzso zzso The zzso distribution of zzso was zzso zzso or zzso diffuse in most zzso In breast, zzso was also associated with the plasma zzso Human zzso zzso ranged from high zzso expression in zzso to low expression in zzso In zzso zzso zzso displayed a diffuse zzso zzso with an additional zzso zzso in breast zzso and zzso zzso of zzso In the human breast zzso Michigan Cancer zzso cell line, zzso expression of zzso or zzso zzso inhibited zzso triggered by hydrogen zzso and suppressed cell growth in soft zzso whereas zzso zzso increased hydrogen zzso zzso Together, our findings indicate that the zzso functions of zzso go beyond its regulatory role of zzso cell survival in zzso
