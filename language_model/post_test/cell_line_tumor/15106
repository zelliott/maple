The high expression of zzso zzso belongs to one of the most important factors causing zzso zzso of cancer zzso zzso is primarily associated with plasma zzso however, small fraction of that protein is present in the nuclear zzso Such phenomenon is observed in cancer cells and may result in the selection of zzso cells as the secondary tumor and/or resistant zzso that significantly shorten patient survival zzso Here, we confirmed nuclear zzso of zzso in resistant zzso cells and demonstrated its impact on zzso zzso from the nucleus to zzso Furthermore, we showed that zzso located at the nuclear envelope might have a different zzso chain when compared to the form located in the zzso It suggests that the zzso chain plays a role in the zzso trafficking of zzso and may decide about the destination place in the zzso
