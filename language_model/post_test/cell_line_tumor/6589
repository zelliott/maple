zzso zzso suicide gene therapy has proven to be safe in humans when delivered zzso Although signs of efficacy are emerging, it is likely that further improvements will be needed before this technology will have widespread zzso in the zzso Toward this end, we have developed a zzso zzso zzso zzso containing an improved zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso fusion zzso gene and the zzso death protein zzso zzso Relative to the first-generation zzso zzso zzso demonstrated greater tumor cell kill in zzso and significantly greater tumor control in zzso models of human zzso zzso of zzso volume following direct injection of zzso into human tumor zzso and the zzso canine prostate demonstrated that zzso enhanced zzso spread in zzso zzso studies were performed to determine whether the improved zzso fusion and zzso genes increased zzso zzso injection of zzso did not result in significantly increased toxicity relative to the parental zzso zzso the latter of which has proven to be safe in two Phase I prostate cancer clinical zzso Together, these results provide the scientific basis for evaluating the safety and efficacy of the second-generation zzso zzso in zzso
