zzso and understanding the joint effect of combined treatments is important in pharmacology and in the development of combination zzso The zzso zzso model is one of the best general reference models for evaluating drug zzso Based on this model, zzso occurs when the interaction index is less than one, while antagonism occurs when interaction index is greater than zzso We expanded the meaning of the interaction index, and propose a procedure to calculate the interaction index and its associated confidence zzso under the assumption that the zzso curve for a single agent follows zzso and zzso median effect zzso In addition, we review four response surface models based on the zzso zzso model using a single zzso to determine drug zzso We describe each of these models in the context of zzso zzso model and discuss their relative advantages and zzso We also provide zzso code for each approach to facilitate the zzso of these commonly used zzso
