One of the hallmarks of zzso zzso is the development of zzso zzso tissue zzso The exact mechanism of pillar formation has not yet been zzso By using electron and zzso zzso we observed zzso nascent pillars that contain a collagen bundle covered by zzso cells zzso in the zzso of experimental zzso We proposed a new mechanism for the development of these zzso First, zzso zzso bridges are zzso Second, localized dissolution of the basement membrane occurs and a bridging zzso zzso to a collagen bundle in the underlying zzso zzso A pulling force is then exerted by the zzso zzso of the zzso via specific attachment points, which contain zzso to the collagen zzso resulting in zzso and subsequent transport of the collagen bundle into and through the vessel zzso Third, the pillar matures through the immigration of zzso tissue cells and the deposition of new zzso zzso zzso The proposed simple mechanism generates a connection between the processes of zzso bridging and zzso zzso and identifies the source of the force behind pillar zzso Moreover, it ensures the rapid formation of pillars from pre-existing building blocks and the maintenance of zzso zzso To describe it, we coined the term inverse zzso
