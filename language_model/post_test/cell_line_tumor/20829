Increased tissue factor zzso expression is observed in many types of cancer, associated with more aggressive disease, and in zzso The mechanism by which zzso promotes tumor growth remains zzso zzso has been shown to result in a trend toward improved zzso no direct zzso effect has been shown in cancer zzso zzso spliced tissue factor zzso was recently zzso in which zzso 5 is zzso Because of a zzso in zzso 6, the zzso and zzso zzso are replaced with a unique zzso domain, making zzso zzso Both alternatively spliced human tissue factor zzso and full-length tissue factor zzso are expressed in human pancreatic cancer lines and in pancreatic cancer zzso We studied the role of zzso and zzso in a mouse model of pancreatic zzso Although lacking zzso activity, zzso promotes primary growth of human pancreatic cancer cells in mice and zzso zzso zzso This body of work suggests a new paradigm for the role of zzso in pancreatic zzso that zzso contributes to cancer growth, independent of zzso zzso
