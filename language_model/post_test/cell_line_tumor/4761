One of the primary goals of zzso is the description of the zzso zzso and connections of the zzso zzso that catalyze a wide range of biological functions in zzso Mass zzso zzso has proven to be an extremely powerful tool for characterizing the composition of zzso zzso However, because zzso is not a quantitative technique, the usefulness of the data is zzso For example, without quantitative zzso it is difficult to detect dynamic changes in complex zzso and it can be difficult to distinguish bona fide complex components from zzso zzso zzso In this chapter, we describe a strategy for characterizing the composition of protein complexes and their dynamic changes in composition by combining affinity zzso approaches with stable isotope tagging and zzso The use of software tools for statistical analysis of the data is also zzso
