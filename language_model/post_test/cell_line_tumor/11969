We investigated the zzso distribution of human zzso which harbors the zzso zzso binding zzso zzso and zzso zzso was distributed primarily in the zzso and occasionally as nuclear zzso in zzso zzso primary zzso zzso cells, and in several other zzso cell zzso In zzso B zzso cells, zzso zzso efficiently accumulated in nuclear zzso which overlapped zzso zzso zzso zzso or nuclear bodies zzso In zzso zzso the unique zzso region of zzso was necessary for its typical zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso form displayed an increased association with zzso compared to zzso and, unlike zzso perfectly accumulated in zzso in zzso cells, zzso that the presence of zzso domain also zzso the zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso is localized primarily in the zzso but also associated with nuclear zzso in zzso or zzso zzso Given that about half of zzso zzso lacks zzso 2 zzso the zzso domain, our data also suggest that the zzso of zzso may be zzso regulated by the zzso binding domain, zzso in zzso zzso
