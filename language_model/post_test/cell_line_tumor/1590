To investigate the effectiveness of zzso a zzso zzso compound, in zzso the survival of zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso were generated to determine the zzso in rat and human zzso cell lines by treatment with different zzso of zzso To evaluate the architecture of the zzso cells after treatment with zzso the rat and human zzso cells were stained with zzso Tracker Green zzso To determine whether zzso was induced in zzso zzso cells, both rat and human zzso cell lines were stained with zzso orange and light zzso zzso were zzso The efficacy of zzso was monitored in zzso using a rat zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were transplanted into an zzso rat model, followed by infusions of zzso a low dose of zzso (20 zzso for the first half hour, followed by 40 zzso zzso in saline for 4 zzso or a high dose of zzso zzso zzso for the first half hour, followed by 90 zzso zzso for 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso by destroying the zzso as shown with zzso Tracker Green zzso zzso orange zzso and light zzso zzso suggest that zzso is induced when zzso cells are treated with zzso In zzso a low dosage of zzso is sufficient and effective in reducing zzso tumor zzso zzso selectively zzso cell death in rat and human zzso cell lines by the induction of zzso zzso exhibits zzso effects both in zzso and in zzso
