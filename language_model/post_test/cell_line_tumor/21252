A wireless sensing device was developed for the zzso monitoring of the growth of human breast cancer cells zzso and evaluation of the zzso of the zzso drugs zzso and zzso The sensor is zzso by coating a zzso zzso sensor with a layer of zzso that protects the zzso sensor from zzso and provides a zzso zzso In response to a zzso magnetic field, the zzso sensor zzso zzso emitting magnetic flux that can be remotely detected by a zzso zzso No physical connections between the sensor and the detection system are zzso The wireless property zzso zzso biological operation, especially in cell culture as illustrated in this zzso The zzso of cells on the sensor surface results in a decrease in the resonance zzso which is zzso to the cell zzso A linear response was obtained in cell zzso of 5 zzso zzso to 1 zzso zzso zzso with a detection limit of zzso zzso zzso cells zzso The zzso strength of cells on the sensor is zzso evaluated by increasing the zzso of the magnetic zzso zzso And the zzso of the zzso drugs zzso and zzso is evaluated by the zzso zzso The zzso curve is related with the quantity of zzso zzso The lethal concentration zzso for cells incubated in the presence of drugs for 20 h is calculated to be zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso
