Recent studies suggest that zzso in human zzso zzso 3 zzso influence the zzso of zzso First, we sought to identify the promoter of zzso Next, we examined whether two zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso dictate promoter activity and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The promoter activities of zzso reporter zzso were investigated in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were documented in 95 liver samples from white zzso zzso zzso and black zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlation analyses were used to determine the impact of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We identified the promoter of human zzso Liver samples from black donors showed higher relative zzso zzso levels than samples from whites zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso relative fold zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso relative fold, p zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not modify the gene reporter activities of engineered zzso promoter zzso In line, zzso zzso zzso levels were not associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These studies provide the first insights into the regulation and variable zzso expression of zzso zzso
