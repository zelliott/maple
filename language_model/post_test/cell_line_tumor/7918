The zzso zzso gene I zzso and melanoma zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso sense viral zzso in infected cells and initiate zzso responses such as the production of type I zzso Here we have shown that zzso and zzso also initiate a zzso signaling zzso that is independent of type I zzso In human melanoma cells, this signaling zzso required the zzso adapter zzso (also known as zzso and induced the zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso required zzso but was independent of the tumor zzso zzso zzso this zzso led to efficient zzso of zzso zzso requiring zzso and zzso Surprisingly, this zzso signaling zzso was also active in zzso cells, but these cells were much less sensitive to zzso than melanoma zzso zzso zzso rescued zzso but not melanoma, cells from zzso and zzso zzso In addition, we confirmed the results of the in zzso studies, demonstrating that zzso and zzso zzso both reduced human tumor lung zzso in zzso zzso zzso These results identify an zzso zzso signaling zzso initiated by zzso and zzso that activates zzso signaling and, unless blocked by zzso results in zzso Due to their zzso and zzso activity, zzso and zzso zzso have therapeutic potential due to their ability to overcome the characteristic resistance of melanoma cells to zzso
