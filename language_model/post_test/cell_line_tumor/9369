To compare commercially available zzso media with common, standard, growth medium for their ability to support growth of zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso 

Twelve zzso media zzso with or without additional supplements were tested against a standard growth medium containing zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso After a zzso incubation period, the level of zzso development was determined by zzso The extent of development in the zzso media was determined as a percentage of infections compared with those obtained using a standard growth zzso 

Several of the zzso media zzso which included zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso compared zzso with a zzso standard growth zzso Moreover, increasing zzso zzso to zzso actually resulted in an overall decrease in development in many zzso 

Several zzso medium zzso are available which allow development of zzso zzso zzso at levels comparable with standard media employing zzso These zzso media are particularly useful for applications, which may require a more defined medium without the presence of zzso Moreover, the elimination of zzso as a variable allows investigators the ability to more closely regulate their experimental systems when growing zzso zzso in cell zzso
