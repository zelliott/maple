Upon DNA damage, tumor zzso zzso determines cell fate by repairing DNA zzso to survive or by inducing zzso to eliminate damaged zzso The decision is based on its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso exerts zzso cell zzso However, little is known about the precise mechanism of zzso zzso on the induction of zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso is identified for a direct target of zzso zzso via the comprehensive expression zzso zzso zzso selectively binds to the promoter region of zzso zzso indicating that the zzso modification changes target genes by altering its binding affinity to the zzso Although zzso belongs to a family of the zzso growth factor, it also emerges in the nucleus under DNA zzso To clarify nuclear function of zzso we analyze zzso proteins by mass zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates precursor zzso processing zzso zzso with zzso to reduce the expression of zzso protein zzso These findings collectively support a mechanism in which the induction of zzso by zzso zzso is required for the zzso zzso in the zzso response to DNA zzso
