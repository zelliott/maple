zzso evidence indicates cancer stem cells zzso possess the capability to resist zzso induced cell death, whereas the mechanism is largely zzso Here we show that cell cycle status and DNA damage response zzso in zzso probably contribute to their survival in zzso zzso In this study, we isolated zzso cancer stem cells zzso from zzso cancer cell line zzso by zzso zzso zzso through flow zzso and found that zzso zzso stay zzso as compared to the zzso and are more resistant to DNA damage zzso Further study revealed that zzso express a lower level of zzso zzso zzso and zzso yet zzso zzso zzso More interestingly, different from zzso when suffering DNA damage agents, zzso showed attenuated zzso as well as declined DNA repair zzso These data indicated zzso probably employed an impaired zzso to handle severe zzso zzso zzso we zzso that the zzso ability of zzso is likely attributed to their zzso status and avoidance of zzso or zzso triggered by an excessive zzso
