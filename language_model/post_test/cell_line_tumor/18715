Development of resistance to zzso therapy is a major problem in the treatment of breast cancer zzso zzso tumors, which progress after a period of response to treatment, often respond to second line zzso treatment, but eventually develop zzso independent zzso Vitamin D zzso are promising new drugs, using alternative mechanisms to inhibit growth of breast cancer zzso The sensitivity to zzso and vitamin D zzso has been proposed to be zzso indicating that the sensitivity to vitamin D zzso might increase after development of zzso resistance and vice zzso In this study, the inverse sensitivity between zzso and the vitamin D analogue zzso was examined in zzso and vitamin D resistant breast cancer cell zzso The majority of the investigated zzso resistant cell lines had increased sensitivity to treatment with the vitamin D analogue zzso In addition, growth of a vitamin D resistant cell line was more inhibited by the pure zzso zzso zzso than the growth of the parental cells, indicating that the compounds may be used zzso An association between the expression level of the vitamin D zzso zzso and zzso sensitivity was observed, suggesting that zzso is a possible zzso marker for response to vitamin D zzso zzso of zzso gene expression may be useful in combination with zzso to predict the outcome of treatment with zzso Furthermore, we observed a synergistic growth zzso and an zzso development of resistance upon combined treatment with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and vitamin D zzso may also be used as combined treatment for breast cancer patients in the zzso
