Here we describe zzso cell zzso for the zzso screening of gene function in zzso zzso To create these zzso we cultured zzso cells on glass slides zzso with zzso zzso as zzso zzso virus zzso which zzso short hairpin zzso or zzso zzso that land on the printed zzso become infected with zzso creating a living array of zzso zzso cell clusters within a zzso of zzso zzso The small size of the features of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso allows zzso spotting of zzso permitting thousands of distinct parallel infections on a single glass zzso Because zzso have a wide cellular zzso including primary cells, zzso cell zzso can be used as a platform for zzso screening in a variety of cell zzso
