The effect of zzso zzso zzso extract and zzso in reducing zzso stress in male zzso rats was zzso 

zzso zzso was monitored by measuring zzso zzso level in different zzso of zzso zzso of free radical scavenging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined using zzso zzso 

zzso showed that administration of zzso zzso in drinking water of the rats, for 25 weeks, increased the zzso levels in liver, kidney and lung zzso of all the zzso However, rats receiving zzso zzso extract and zzso had lower zzso levels in a dose dependent manner, which indicates decreased zzso zzso in these zzso zzso in the zzso activity appears to be a response to zzso zzso The decrease in the activity of zzso and increase in the activity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in different zzso of the rats receiving zzso zzso extract and zzso indicates the protective effect of the plant in combating zzso stress undergone by the zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso have been zzso claimed to possess a wide array of biological activities including zzso zzso 

To verify the zzso claim, this study was performed in a six Human zzso cell lines, Lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Breast zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso extracts of the zzso of zzso zzso showed highest zzso effect on zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell line, as determined with zzso zzso zzso 

These findings 1 - showed that zzso zzso extract may zzso zzso induced zzso stress by decreasing zzso zzso via zzso of the zzso defense system of the zzso 2 - these data also showed the zzso activity of the plant extracts on different human cancer cell zzso However, further investigation is needed to assess the molecular mechanisms zzso zzso activities of this zzso
