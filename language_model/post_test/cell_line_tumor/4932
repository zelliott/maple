To investigate the effects of single and zzso doses of radiation on tumors and zzso zzso zzso and to zzso the potential of zzso to influence tumor zzso 

A zzso prostate cell line, zzso was grown in zzso mice to zzso tumor diameter and zzso with either 25 zzso in a single dose, or 60 zzso in 15 zzso The tumors were removed at the indicated times and assessed for a variety of markers related to zzso content, zzso status, and zzso 

In tumors receiving a single radiation dose, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression increased as a small transient wave within 24 h and a larger persistent wave starting after 3 zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso was elevated only after 3 days and continued to increase up to 3 zzso After zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels increased within 5 days, whereas zzso was increased only after 10 zzso of zzso had been zzso Increased levels of zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso protein were found to associate with zzso 1-2 weeks after tumor zzso zzso of zzso were compared by mixing them with zzso cells and injecting them into zzso zzso cells mixed with zzso from zzso tumors appeared earlier and grew significantly faster than those mixed with zzso from zzso tumors or zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in the zzso tumor zzso express higher levels of zzso zzso and zzso and promote early tumor growth in zzso
