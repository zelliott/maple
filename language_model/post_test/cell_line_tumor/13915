The breast and zzso cancer specific tumor zzso zzso bound to zzso has multiple functions aimed at maintaining zzso stability in the zzso We have shown earlier that the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity regulates zzso zzso zzso In this study, we tested which zzso of zzso and zzso were required to control the zzso zzso In the present study, zzso we confirmed that the zzso activity of zzso regulates zzso number and function in zzso breast cancer zzso zzso we observed that both the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso are required for regulation of zzso function in zzso zzso an internal domain zzso is zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for regulation of zzso function and protein sequences within the terminal zzso zzso acids are necessary for zzso and zzso zzso is localized at the zzso throughout the cell zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso zzso zzso functions to restrain zzso in zzso cells, and loss of zzso in the zzso breast cell leads to zzso zzso a zzso commonly observed in zzso breast zzso
