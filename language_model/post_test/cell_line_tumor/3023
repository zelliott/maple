The zzso zzso zzso is a selective zzso inhibitor targeting the zzso zzso component and represents a potential candidate for zzso zzso The poor cellular zzso of zzso is a limiting factor that may contribute to the lack of functional zzso To improve delivery of zzso and consequently zzso efficiency in human lung cancer cells, we have investigated several zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso 60, zzso zzso 6 and zzso were tested for zzso zzso A zzso zzso was used to assess the zzso distribution by zzso laser scanning zzso in zzso human zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso activity was measured using the zzso repeat amplification zzso Cell viability after zzso was zzso by the zzso zzso All zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso in zzso cells but the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 60 were most efficient in the delivery of zzso resulting in zzso zzso Among both zzso exhibited the lowest zzso Our experiments show that zzso is the most suitable zzso zzso for the delivery of zzso in human lung cancer cells according to its relatively low zzso and its ability to promote efficient zzso leading to the zzso of zzso
