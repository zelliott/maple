A dilemma for current cancer therapy is surgical injury in addition to the zzso and zzso of systemic zzso Meanwhile, localized therapies have become a noticeable zzso In this study, zzso zzso zzso zzso particles of different sizes (about 50 zzso 5 zzso and zzso zzso zzso were prepared as the zzso system for zzso injection, and their zzso properties, in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso investigated for the first zzso The results of zzso experiments and zzso studies indicated that the release patterns of the particles would strongly affect the biological efficiency not only at the cell level but also in two types of animal zzso zzso raw material and zzso showed higher initial burst release in zzso and higher drug concentration in tumor and zzso Large particles (about 50 zzso showed lower initial burst and slow drug release, which would not supply enough amount of drug to inhibit the cancer cell growth during the whole treatment zzso zzso with mean diameter of about 5 zzso performed the best zzso efficiency both in zzso and in zzso The release patterns, instead of the zzso zzso would be the key factors to affect the biological effects of the particulate system for zzso zzso
