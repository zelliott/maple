In order to gain insight into zzso effects of zzso zzso a standardized extract of zzso zzso previously demonstrated in animal models of memory impairment induced by transient global zzso or zzso injection of zzso the effect of zzso 233 on zzso outgrowth of human zzso zzso cell line was zzso 

zzso were seeded and incubated with various zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis was carried out by a measurement of the longest zzso growth of cells at 24 and zzso zzso signaling pathways possibly involved were subsequently zzso by western zzso zzso 

While zzso 233 had only limited effects on cell zzso it significantly enhanced zzso outgrowth of zzso cells at the zzso of zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that zzso 233 significantly zzso the level of activated zzso and zzso of the treated cells suggesting their involvement in the zzso effect observed, which was subsequently verified by the finding that an addition of their respective zzso could reverse the effect of zzso 233 on these zzso 

The present study clearly demonstrated zzso outgrowth promoting activity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways seemed to account for the zzso effect zzso In conjunction with in zzso zzso effect of zzso 233 previously reported, the results obtained support further development of zzso 233 for clinical use in zzso injury or neurodegenerative zzso
