We assessed the relationship between zzso stress, zzso zzso and tumor growth in response to novel zzso zzso drugs zzso agents with significant zzso effects in zzso zzso Compared with controls, in zzso colon and zzso breast cancer cells, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased the levels of zzso oxygen and nitrogen species zzso and decreased zzso levels and zzso zzso activity, whereas the conventional zzso drugs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did zzso In both cell lines, zzso induced zzso and inhibited cell proliferation much more zzso than zzso We then treated nude mice bearing zzso zzso with zzso or zzso that had an opposite effect on zzso in zzso Compared with controls, zzso markedly suppressed zzso growth, induced zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso inhibited cell proliferation zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso and increased urinary zzso levels zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a marker of zzso zzso all differences were statistically zzso zzso effects on tumor growth, zzso zzso and zzso were not statistically zzso zzso levels correlated with the induction of zzso and the zzso of cell zzso zzso induced zzso stress only in the tumors, and its zzso effect was restricted to zzso Our data show that zzso act against cancer through a mechanism distinct from that of various zzso underscore the critical role of zzso stress in their effect, and indicate that pathways leading to zzso stress may be useful targets for zzso zzso
