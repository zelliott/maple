Several studies have revealed that zzso affects the insulin zzso via zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to the lack of selective zzso zzso antagonists, we used zzso interference technology to generate an zzso zzso in a zzso zzso line to evaluate whether zzso zzso insulin zzso specifically via the zzso zzso zzso experiments were carried out, and the insulin concentration in zzso was measured using a zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso was determined using an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso resulted in a significant increase in the zzso zzso and a significantly elevated zzso insulin zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso decreased the amount of zzso zzso 1 or inhibited the zzso insulin release of zzso cells, while, in zzso zzso cells, no zzso reduction in insulin zzso could be zzso No decrease in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells was zzso after treatment with zzso either, and zzso proved that zzso zzso abolished zzso of zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso cells, zzso with zzso did not sensitize the insulin zzso of zzso zzso zzso We also monitored insulin zzso from isolated zzso of zzso and zzso knockout mice ex zzso In zzso of zzso mice, zzso treatment resulted in a decrease in insulin release, whereas zzso treatment of zzso from zzso knockout and zzso zzso mice did not show a significant zzso The data indicate that zzso zzso insulin zzso primarily via the zzso zzso in rat zzso cells and isolated mouse zzso
