This study was undertaken to explore the potential of new therapeutic approaches designed to reactivate cell death pathways in zzso zzso and to characterize the underlying molecular mechanisms of this zzso Here we investigated the sensitivity of a panel of zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso induced by the death zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso TRAIL in combination with gamma zzso and TRAIL in combination with zzso zzso zzso and zzso Analysis of these six zzso cell lines revealed drastic differences in their sensitivity to these treatments, with two of the six cell lines revealing no significant induction of cell death in response to TRAIL zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were capable of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells and of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, gamma zzso had no synergistic effects with TRAIL in the two zzso cell zzso zzso interference against death zzso 5 zzso revealed that zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso depended on enhanced zzso and surface expression of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso protein and application of the synthetic zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso indicated that enhanced zzso expression occurred independently of zzso zzso zzso but required zzso of the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso Novel therapeutic approaches using TRAIL or zzso TRAIL zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso may represent a promising approach to reactivate zzso in zzso high-grade zzso
