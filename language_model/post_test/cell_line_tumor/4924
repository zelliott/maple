The tumor zzso gene zzso is a major negative regulator of the zzso cellular survival zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso increases zzso zzso Whereas zzso zzso can be zzso by the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso A zzso the mechanisms underlying this process remain zzso The aim of this work was to investigate whether changes in zzso expression are involved in zzso zzso 

We treated zzso T cells with zzso and zzso detected zzso by using zzso zzso zzso and examined changes of zzso and zzso expression by quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction zzso zzso reporter zzso was used to evaluate the promoter activity of zzso and Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to confirm changes in the expression of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed to estimate the zzso level of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was enhanced by zzso whereas small interfering zzso zzso targeting zzso inhibited zzso zzso Also, zzso promoted zzso zzso which is the main zzso factor of zzso and this resulted in zzso of zzso zzso which consequently zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso was able to zzso activate zzso zzso with zzso implicating the role of zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso 

zzso promoted zzso zzso through a mechanism that involved the stimulation of zzso zzso zzso of core zzso at the zzso promoter, and consequently induction of zzso zzso These findings provide a theoretical basis for the therapeutic application of combined treatment of zzso for zzso
