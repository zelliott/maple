We have previously reported that, in prostate cancer, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key element in zzso zzso Here, we show that selective zzso zzso of zzso triggers zzso in zzso and zzso prostate cancer cells, an effect that is reversed by zzso enforced zzso More importantly, we show for the first time that the zzso of the zzso zzso plays a crucial role in the resistance of prostate cancer cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso compound zzso zzso and zzso cells to zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso alone display a limited effect on tumor growth in zzso cells, whereas in combination there is a zzso of effect on tumor size with a significant increase in the zzso to zzso zzso zzso To zzso our study highlights the notion that drugs specifically designed to inhibit zzso could provide a means of enhancing the effects of conventional treatment through the zzso zzso zzso zzso
