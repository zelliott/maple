Identification of zzso zzso associated with the progression of prostate cancer may facilitate the better understanding of the development of this highly variable zzso zzso normal, zzso high-grade zzso zzso zzso and invasive prostate zzso cells were procured by laser capture zzso zzso from human radical zzso zzso From these cells, comparative DNA fingerprints were generated by a modified zzso technique called scanning of zzso archival zzso zzso zzso zzso fingerprint fragments were used in tagging altered zzso zzso zzso regions were found at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes in the surrounding area that may possibly harbor zzso that change normal zzso cells to progress into their tumor stages were zzso Of these fragments, a zzso zzso zzso absent in all 26 normal samples screened, was observed in 2 zzso This zzso was zzso zzso and localized to zzso zzso Within this region, candidate gene sex determining region zzso 5 zzso was zzso Further studies of zzso in cell lines, zzso and human prostate zzso at both the zzso and protein levels, found zzso of the gene in zzso This zzso was then subsequently found by fluorescent in zzso zzso to be caused by amplification of the zzso In conclusion, our results suggest zzso coupled with zzso DNA zzso is a useful method for the screening and identification of zzso regions and genes associated with cancer zzso Further, zzso of zzso is associated with prostate tumor progression and early development of distant zzso
