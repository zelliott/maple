The protein scaffold and signaling regulator zzso is important in critical cellular functions, including bone zzso zzso and cancer, because of its interactions with various signaling zzso zzso is zzso in human zzso and is induced during cell zzso Its genetic zzso zzso lung zzso in zzso and cell proliferation in culture by regulating the zzso signaling cascade to control zzso oxygen species zzso production and zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso at zzso and zzso which is necessary for the maintenance of appropriate zzso B1 levels and the levels of zzso activity necessary to allow cells to properly enter and exit zzso The lack of zzso zzso of zzso leads to a faster exit from zzso which translates into enhanced cell proliferation and zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso emerges as a zzso for the control of not only cell survival but also cell transit through zzso
