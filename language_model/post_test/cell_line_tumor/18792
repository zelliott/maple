Loss of zzso class II expression in zzso zzso has been associated with a higher zzso resulting from lower zzso of zzso zzso This report aims towards the identification of the molecular mechanism leading to defective zzso class II expression in a zzso zzso cell line, zzso We evidenced a coordinated zzso of zzso gene transcription, reminiscent of B zzso cell lines from patients with zzso class II zzso zzso zzso performed between these cell lines and the zzso cells indicated that zzso is altered in the zzso zzso zzso encodes the class II zzso zzso the master regulator of zzso gene zzso However, the coding sequence of the zzso zzso transcript did not reveal any zzso that could hamper the activity of the zzso zzso In agreement with the genetic zzso analysis, we evidenced a highly residual zzso protein expression in the zzso cell line resulting from a zzso zzso affecting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment has proved efficient in the destruction of B zzso zzso Our data indicate that the appearance of zzso losing zzso and thereby zzso expression will require a thorough monitoring during such zzso zzso
