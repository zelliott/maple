We report a zzso zzso for simultaneous optical manipulation and tracking of zzso zzso droplets as actively transported zzso in a living zzso cell with zzso time zzso Using an zzso camera as a highly sensitive zzso zzso we can detect steps of zzso and zzso zzso under known force zzso We can distinguish single and multiple zzso zzso and show that the stall forces for inward and outward transported zzso are zzso By combining the stall force zzso with the ability to detect individual steps, we can characterize zzso and zzso active transport in different force zzso
