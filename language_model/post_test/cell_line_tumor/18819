zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results in a striking proliferation of the smooth zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso and cultured cells produces a similar zzso The signals zzso this process are not known but probably involve signal zzso pathways involved in the unfolded protein response zzso or the zzso overload response zzso We have examined the zzso response of specific genes in these pathways and genes globally to zzso of zzso in cultured zzso zzso of zzso an zzso zzso was substantially increased by zzso of full-length zzso zzso or a zzso with the zzso acid signal anchor sequence of zzso zzso in zzso cells, and the zzso correlated temporally with the zzso of zzso in the zzso In the zzso pathway, zzso of the zzso factor zzso by zzso also correlated with the zzso of zzso in the cells, and in contrast, maximum zzso of the zzso promoter preceded the zzso zzso effects of expression of zzso on zzso were observed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso was zzso and this correlated with sustained zzso of the zzso zzso pathway, induction of zzso and an absence of the increased zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso was only zzso zzso and zzso expression was not zzso As assessed by DNA zzso analysis, zzso of signaling genes was zzso including those involved in zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that both the zzso and zzso pathways are involved in the cellular response to induction of zzso expression and that in zzso cells genes are also induced to block zzso which may be a zzso relevant response to prevent cell death during zzso induced expression of zzso in the zzso
