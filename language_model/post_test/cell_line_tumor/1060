Clinical studies have suggested that human zzso growth factor zzso zzso provide a useful target for zzso zzso We previously described the generation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we extend the repertoire of zzso zzso proteins with zzso a construct that comprises a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso A, and an active zzso which can directly cleave zzso A leading to nucleus damage and inducing programmed cell zzso We demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso selectively recognizes and zzso zzso in zzso tumor cells in zzso but not in cells with zzso zzso The zzso gene was next transferred into zzso zzso mice bearing human breast zzso tumors by zzso injection of zzso zzso by zzso injection of zzso zzso or by zzso injection of zzso modified by zzso zzso Regardless of the method used, expression of zzso suppressed tumor growth and prolonged animal survival zzso Our data show that the zzso zzso zzso can recognize zzso tumor cells, promptly attack their nucleus, and induce their zzso death, suggesting the potential of this strategy for the treatment of human zzso that zzso zzso
