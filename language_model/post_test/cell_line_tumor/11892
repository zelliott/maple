The fragile zzso zzso zzso gene located in human zzso zzso is a candidate tumor zzso gene that has a zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, but its role in zzso remains zzso To investigate the role of zzso in normal cells, specific zzso zzso to zzso rat zzso protein were zzso zzso analysis revealed the zzso zzso protein was most abundantly expressed in kidney and liver, whereas heart, skeletal muscle, and adrenal zzso expressed trace zzso In zzso zzso zzso was strongly observed in zzso convoluted zzso and collecting duct during zzso growth zzso By a zzso reverse zzso analysis of zzso from 2 human kidney cancer cell lines, four zzso zzso zzso with deletion and/or zzso were zzso These were derived from the results of zzso zzso and/or zzso of zzso zzso 5 zzso or selection of cryptic zzso site within the zzso zzso sequence zzso Taken together, our data indicate that zzso expression is frequently altered in human kidney cancer cell lines by alternative zzso and suggest that the zzso protein may play a pivotal role in regulating zzso metabolism of the zzso convoluted zzso and collecting duct in zzso
