zzso C virus zzso infection is a leading cause of chronic liver zzso Progress in the zzso field was greatly enhanced by constructing infectious zzso clone of zzso Since then, zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been developed, and this permitted the study of vaccines and zzso zzso for all zzso Recently, highly efficient zzso culture systems have been established by using consensus zzso zzso We developed a novel strategy to construct infectious zzso zzso clone by combining functional screening of sequences directly from a zzso zzso clinical isolate zzso and cell culture zzso Using zzso zzso as the starting zzso we zzso replaced the zzso fragments with a sequence from the pools of zzso zzso Through engineering zzso zzso that improve zzso zzso we finally established a full-length cell zzso infectious clone of zzso named zzso that could efficiently produce virus particles in zzso cells, with peak zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso could be neutralized by an zzso zzso and inhibited by zzso agents but appeared more resistant to an zzso inhibitor than zzso In zzso we developed a new approach to construct an infectious zzso zzso clone that can produce viruses efficiently in cell zzso This approach could be applied to other viral zzso with potential implications for individualized treatments of zzso zzso
