zzso smoking can contribute to the development of many human diseases such as cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, zzso and chronic zzso pulmonary zzso Thousands of compounds are present in cigarette smoke, including a large number of zzso oxygen species that can cause DNA damage, leading to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso Here we have investigated the effects of cigarette smoke extract zzso on zzso human lung zzso zzso zzso induced DNA damage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso impaired proliferation zzso survival zzso and electric zzso zzso sensing zzso and cell death zzso reduction, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell death was also characterized by zzso zzso but massive zzso of zzso factor could not be zzso To investigate the role of zzso in zzso zzso stress, zzso and zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines exhibited reduced zzso survival, displayed a delayed repair of DNA breaks, and showed higher levels of zzso zzso triggered the production of zzso zzso and hydrogen zzso zzso of zzso zzso increased, whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso our data show that the zzso zzso breakage zzso activates the zzso cycle by zzso and zzso which serves as a survival mechanism in zzso zzso Our data also raise the possibility that the zzso status of smokers may be an important zzso of the efficiency of DNA repair in their lungs and of their zzso to zzso zzso
