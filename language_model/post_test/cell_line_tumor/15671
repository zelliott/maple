A zzso zzso approach was used to interrogate the donor zzso flexibility of zzso the zzso involved in zzso during zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso of the natural sugar donor zzso was compromised, with various zzso plasmids led to the generation of six zzso zzso with altered zzso zzso zzso of the isolated zzso derivatives revealed five new compounds, including zzso V zzso zzso zzso M zzso zzso zzso E zzso zzso zzso M zzso zzso zzso E zzso zzso and the recently characterized zzso V zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso and zzso V exhibit zzso activities comparable to that of their parent drug zzso zzso zzso against human lung cancer zzso zzso lung cancer zzso and breast cancer zzso cell zzso Our findings demonstrate zzso to be a moderately flexible zzso able to transfer both zzso and zzso zzso to the unique zzso zzso backbone of the zzso
