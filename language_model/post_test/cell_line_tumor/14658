zzso zzso is a crucial element of zzso involved in zzso zzso It becomes active when zzso zzso zzso the zzso core, is assembled with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins to produce zzso the precursor for generation of toxic zzso oxygen zzso In a previous study, we demonstrated that the potential second zzso loop of zzso was essential to maintaining zzso zzso activity by controlling electron transfer from zzso to zzso Moreover, replacement of this loop by the zzso zzso in zzso cells induced zzso zzso In the present investigation, we demonstrated that both soluble and particulate stimuli were able to induce this zzso zzso zzso overproduction was also observed after zzso acid zzso in a zzso zzso zzso The highest zzso activity was obtained after zzso and zzso zzso In addition, enhanced sensitivity to zzso influx was shown by zzso zzso or zzso treatment before zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was less dependent on zzso triggered by zzso during zzso or zzso stimulation and by zzso during zzso zzso The zzso overproduction of the zzso zzso may come from a change of responsiveness to zzso zzso level and to zzso events during zzso zzso Finally the zzso cells were more effective against an attenuated strain of zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso The killing mechanism was zzso an early step of zzso production that was directly zzso and a second zzso step related to the amount of zzso produced in the first zzso
