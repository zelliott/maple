Human zzso culture is widely used to predict human drug metabolism for new drug zzso The limited supply and zzso zzso variations in zzso activity, however, hamper its zzso In the present study, we explore a new cell system with zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso as an alternative for zzso In this system, zzso zzso levels and zzso activity increased depending on the amounts of zzso infected for the individual expression of zzso or zzso in zzso zzso Similar results were observed in the system with zzso of zzso and zzso When zzso cells were infected with zzso for zzso and that for zzso simultaneously at a ratio of zzso the ratio of their zzso levels was similar to that observed in human zzso and the zzso profile of zzso in the system was almost identical to that observed in zzso These results indicate that this zzso system makes it possible to zzso prepare cells expressing multiple zzso at a desired ratio, suggesting a possible use of this system in zzso zzso tests for a drug zzso particularly to assess the influence of zzso variation in zzso zzso
