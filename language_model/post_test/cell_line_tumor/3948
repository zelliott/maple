zzso zzso leukemia zzso patients with deletion of zzso zzso where the zzso gene is located, often develop more aggressive disease with poor clinical zzso To investigate the underlying mechanisms for the highly zzso zzso of zzso zzso and to facilitate in zzso evaluation of potential drugs against zzso with zzso zzso we have generated a mouse model with zzso zzso These mice develop zzso leukemia at an early age with an early appearance of zzso zzso zzso B cells in the zzso cavity and zzso and exhibit an aggressive path of disease development and drug resistance zzso similar to human zzso with zzso zzso The zzso leukemia cells exhibit higher survival capacity and are more drug resistant than the leukemia cells from zzso zzso Analysis of zzso expression reveals that zzso deletion resulted in a decrease of zzso and zzso leading to an elevated expression of zzso zzso leukemia cells from zzso patients with zzso deletion also show a decrease in zzso and an increase in zzso Our study suggests that the zzso axis may be an important zzso that regulates zzso expression and contributes to drug resistance and aggressive zzso in zzso cells with loss of zzso
