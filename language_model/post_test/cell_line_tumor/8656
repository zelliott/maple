zzso is widely zzso in cancer cells and believed to be essential for the maintenance of zzso zzso zzso zzso by small molecules has shown promise in solid and zzso zzso which likely involves degradation of client zzso in a zzso zzso In this study, we found that structurally unrelated zzso zzso induce DNA damage and zzso via zzso induction of zzso which indirectly triggers zzso zzso and zzso dysfunction in colon cancer zzso zzso in zzso zzso or zzso at lesser extent, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso dysfunction, and enhanced zzso cell zzso Furthermore, suppression of zzso zzso induction or enhanced zzso zzso zzso with zzso to induce zzso zzso Finally, zzso was found to mediate zzso and therapeutic responses to the zzso analog zzso in zzso These results show an important role of the zzso axis in zzso zzso killing of zzso zzso cells, and have important implications for their clinical zzso
