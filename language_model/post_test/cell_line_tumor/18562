Clinical studies have shown that tumor zzso is associated with invasive growth and zzso and may be an important zzso factor adversely influencing survival in patients with zzso To investigate the mechanisms involved in zzso invasive growth and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cellular zzso and zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso were measured in a prostate cancer cell line, zzso The levels of zzso expression and cellular zzso were increased in hypoxic zzso zzso cellular zzso was blocked by an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were also more extensive in hypoxic cells than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso with a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso and a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell growth also increased in hypoxic zzso From these results, zzso increased tumor cell invasion by zzso zzso zzso which might be zzso through zzso and zzso zzso signaling pathways in zzso prostate cancer cell zzso
