Suicide genes such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso products that convert nontoxic substances zzso into toxic zzso Studies in recent years indicated that zzso expression was associated with the biological behaviors of gastric zzso In the present study, targeted killing effects of double CD and zzso suicide genes controlled by zzso promoter on gastric cancer cell were investigated, the zzso zzso zzso containing CD and zzso genes driven by sur promoter was constructed and zzso into zzso zzso After adding the zzso and zzso the effects of double suicide genes on cell growth, cell cycle and proliferation were determined by zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso The results showed that sur promoter could specifically drive the expression of double zzso gene in zzso cells, whereas not in the normal zzso zzso After using zzso and zzso the growth of zzso cells was zzso zzso phase proportion was significantly higher in zzso cells zzso with double suicide genes than the zzso zzso These results suggest that CD and zzso double suicide genes driven by sur promoter could provide a new approach for enhancing selective suicide gene therapy of zzso for the treatment of advanced gastric zzso
