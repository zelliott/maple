Acute intermittent zzso zzso is a zzso disease caused by a dominant inherited zzso in zzso zzso zzso We investigated the expression and the degradation of the human zzso zzso zzso and zzso following zzso into human zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins exhibited reduced protein expression compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso as revealed by Western zzso The zzso levels assessed by real-time zzso of these zzso species were identical to those of the wild zzso zzso zzso revealed reduced cellular distribution of the zzso zzso in the zzso and the nucleus in comparison to the zzso zzso zzso cellular zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso was detected following zzso of the zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso protein levels was either achieved by zzso or zzso zzso On the other hand, enhanced zzso degradation was achieved by lead poisoning of zzso in the zzso cells zzso with acceleration of zzso activity, most probably by zzso participation in zzso regulation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso is identical to zzso acid zzso J zzso zzso 1994; zzso Our results suggest that the difference in expression between the zzso and zzso proteins appears to be regulated on the level of protein zzso In conclusion, we demonstrate that the zzso cellular pool is controlled by the zzso activity, which in turn is down regulated by zzso or zzso by zzso
