As an important zzso and therapeutic target, zzso has attracted considerable attention concerning its detection and zzso Here, we present a zzso and surface enhanced zzso scattering zzso zzso zzso activity detection method, which has several distinctive zzso First, zzso functionality allows rapid preliminary discrimination of zzso activity by the naked zzso Second, the employment of zzso technique results in greatly improved detection zzso Third, the combination of zzso and zzso into one detection system can ensure highly zzso and sensitive screening of numerous zzso Besides, the avoidance of zzso chain reaction zzso procedures further guarantees fine reliability and zzso Generally, the presented method is realized by an zzso and zzso zzso To be specific, gold zzso modified with zzso molecules and zzso repeat complementary zzso are employed as the zzso zzso reporting zzso while magnetic zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso are used as the capturing zzso zzso can zzso and zzso zzso repeats onto the capturing zzso The zzso zzso repeats subsequently facilitate capturing of the reporting zzso via zzso between zzso repeat and its complementary zzso The captured zzso can cause a significant difference in the color and zzso intensity of the zzso separated zzso Thus both the color and zzso can be used as indicators of the zzso zzso With fast screening ability and outstanding sensitivity, we anticipate that this method would greatly promote practical application of zzso zzso cancer zzso
