zzso zzso zzso and zzso vascular environments have been implicated in the zzso of zzso The cellular and molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying this process, however, are not fully zzso In the present study, we employed zzso zzso analysis to investigate global gene expression patterns in human vascular zzso cells after treatment with zzso Our results showed that zzso levels of a total of 106 genes were significantly zzso and 41 genes significantly zzso with more than a zzso zzso The majority of these genes are critically involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses, zzso signal zzso zzso factors, and zzso functions of the remaining genes are zzso The changes in gene expression of selected genes related to inflammatory zzso such as vascular cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were verified by quantitative real-time reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment also significantly increased the adherence of inflammatory cells to zzso cell zzso in a zzso zzso These results may help determine the molecular mechanisms of action of zzso in human vascular zzso In addition, a better understanding of zzso vascular injury at the level of gene expression could lead to the identification of new therapeutic strategies for zzso
