zzso zzso cells are frequently used to analyze zzso zzso zzso These experiments require genetic manipulation of the cells and several chemical and physical methods have been employed in the zzso Recently, zzso has been suggested as the best method to zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso gene transfer into zzso cells is highly efficient, cheap and zzso In addition, zzso gene transfer efficiently zzso stable expression of small hairpin zzso Finally, zzso gene transfer can be used to implant zzso reporter genes into the zzso of the cells, allowing promoter studies using templates that are embedded into the zzso structure of the zzso
