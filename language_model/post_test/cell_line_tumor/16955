zzso therapy zzso plays a critical role in the zzso control of head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso However, the efficacy of zzso in treating zzso is limited by severe normal tissue zzso predominantly zzso One pharmacological approach for increasing the clinical response to zzso is the use of radiation response zzso that zzso sensitize tumor zzso Previously we demonstrated that zzso a natural plant zzso increased the radiation sensitivity of zzso cells and that the observed zzso was dependent on zzso zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso a key zzso regulator of zzso zzso Here, we examined zzso radiation zzso in zzso cell lines with differing zzso status and expressing different levels of zzso in zzso The intrinsic radiation resistance of the zzso zzso cell lines was significantly higher than the zzso zzso cell lines used in our zzso zzso all of the zzso zzso cell lines expressed high levels of zzso and exhibited higher intrinsic resistance to zzso While zzso was effective at increasing the radiation response of the resistant zzso zzso cell lines it had no effect on the zzso zzso zzso Based on these findings we employed an zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor model in zzso nude mice to examine the effect of combining zzso with zzso zzso in zzso The combination of zzso feeding and zzso zzso had a significant effect on tumor doubling time and overall animal zzso We therefore propose that zzso and zzso should be considered as a first line treatment of zzso zzso zzso
