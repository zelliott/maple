The aim of this study was to explore the zzso potential of a zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso in zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso High performance zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso was a homogeneous zzso and had a molecular weight of 22 zzso Total zzso content in zzso was determined to be zzso without the presence of protein and zzso zzso zzso suppressed the proliferation of zzso cells in a zzso and zzso zzso Cell cycle analysis revealed that exposure to zzso zzso zzso caused a zzso cell cycle arrest in zzso zzso Moreover, treatment with zzso at zzso zzso for zzso induced a significant zzso zzso cells compared to zzso control cells, as determined by flow zzso with zzso zzso double zzso Additionally, zzso treatment promoted the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso coupled with increased expression of death zzso zzso and zzso and reduced expression of zzso Taken together, our data demonstrate that zzso shows potent zzso activity in human zzso zzso zzso largely through induction of zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso zzso of both zzso and death zzso zzso pathways is involved in the zzso of zzso
