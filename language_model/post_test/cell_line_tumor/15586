The purpose of the present study was to examine the expression of zzso zzso and zzso receptors and to evaluate the effects of zzso on human pancreatic zzso We examined the expression of zzso and its two receptors zzso and zzso in 40 surgically zzso human pancreatic cancer zzso and in three different human pancreatic cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso The zzso analysis using specific zzso demonstrated that positive zzso for zzso zzso and zzso in surgically zzso human pancreatic cancer was 50, 55 and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of these cases were positive for both zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso signals for those proteins were extremely suppressed in normal pancreatic zzso All of the pancreatic cancer cell lines expressed zzso and zzso receptors at the zzso and protein zzso zzso binding experiments using zzso zzso showed that zzso cells had specific binding sites for zzso The cell proliferation zzso demonstrated that zzso did not affect the growth of the three cell zzso However, treatment with zzso enhanced the zzso into zzso and increased the activity of zzso zzso zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso and zzso receptors are zzso in pancreatic cancer, and suggest that zzso regulates zzso activity and plays an important role in the zzso of human pancreatic zzso
