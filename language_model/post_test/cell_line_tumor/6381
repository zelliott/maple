zzso zzso zzso was zzso from the zzso of the social zzso zzso zzso It has an zzso sequence zzso and possesses potent zzso activity against both zzso and zzso zzso In this study we zzso zzso studied its zzso on tumor cells and proposed its possible zzso Our results revealed that zzso exerts its zzso efficacy by zzso the integrity of cell zzso Furthermore, molecular dynamics zzso simulations were employed to investigate the mechanism of membrane zzso Both the MD simulations and the experimental data indicated that zzso takes a standard zzso zzso in the zzso These findings together with the other experimental results support a speculation of mechanism similar to the zzso zzso
