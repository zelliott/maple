The effect of seven natural zzso zzso in DNA synthesis of two human breast cancer cell lines, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, was zzso zzso with an zzso group at zzso and a ring linking zzso and zzso presented a zzso effect in DNA synthesis of zzso zzso zzso and displayed a stimulation at low zzso zzso zzso whilst at higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso No stimulation was observed in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, all the zzso exhibited an zzso effect in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso of DNA synthesis was accompanied by a high capacity of these cells to reduce zzso which was concurrent with the appearance of an intense zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso product in these zzso could justify the enhancements of zzso zzso The characterization of these zzso with the zzso marker zzso zzso is consistent with zzso zzso which led to the suggestion that these zzso could induce zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso breast cancer cell zzso
