zzso of zzso zzso zzso the interface between T cells and zzso presenting cells, is a crucial step in T cell zzso This zzso formation results in the zzso and segregation of a set of membrane bound and zzso zzso including that of the T cell zzso into membrane zzso It was showed earlier that zzso the dominant zzso zzso channel of T cells redistributes into the IS on interaction with its specific zzso In the present experiments we investigated the functional consequences of the zzso of zzso channels into the IS formed between mouse helper T zzso and B zzso zzso characteristics of zzso zzso current in zzso cells zzso or ones in IS zzso were determined using zzso zzso of standard zzso zzso zzso zzso recordings showed that the zzso of zzso current slowed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso rate increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in cells being in IS compared to the zzso zzso The equilibrium distribution between the open and the closed states of zzso zzso of zzso zzso was shifted toward the zzso zzso in T cells engaged into IS zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, segregation of zzso channels into the IS zzso the gating properties of the zzso Application of protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that increase in the zzso rate can be explained by the zzso of the channel zzso However, the slower zzso zzso of zzso in IS is likely to be the consequence of the zzso of the channels into distinct membrane zzso
