A zzso complex was zzso zzso to a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which contains zzso zzso groups, to form a zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso was assembled into zzso The zzso complex, the zzso carrier and the zzso were characterized zzso In zzso release experiments showed that drug release from the zzso zzso follows an acid responsive and zzso sensitive zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso can be released from the zzso under an zzso plus a reductive condition which is available inside a zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso display higher zzso against zzso tumor cells than both zzso and zzso zzso This enhanced zzso is attributed to effective zzso of the zzso by the cells via zzso zzso which was observed by zzso imaging and by direct determination of the platinum zzso by the zzso This zzso zzso is a promising zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso It can protect the zzso complex against blood zzso It can enter zzso cells via zzso mechanism and then zzso can be zzso zzso this zzso zzso of zzso is expected to find clinical applications in the zzso
