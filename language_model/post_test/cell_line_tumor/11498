In zzso forming zzso were developed from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso derivatives through zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso were soluble at 37 zzso in zzso buffer zzso pH zzso 10 zzso at total zzso zzso ranging from 20 to 60 zzso % but formed fluorescent zzso upon 365 zzso zzso zzso at an intensity of zzso zzso or 60 zzso The zzso times ranged from zzso 50 s to 5 zzso and storage zzso varied from zzso to zzso zzso depending on zzso zzso and degrees of zzso substitution in zzso zzso The cell experiments via an indirect contact zzso demonstrated that these zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The high specificity of zzso reaction renders thus obtained zzso zzso particularly interesting for controlled protein zzso zzso in zzso release studies showed that zzso c zzso zzso zzso and zzso human zzso zzso all were released from zzso zzso in a sustained and quantitative manner over a period of zzso zzso zzso released zzso and zzso exhibited comparable biological activities to native zzso and zzso zzso These results confirm that zzso zzso reaction is highly compatible with these loaded zzso This zzso specific, efficient, and zzso click chemistry provides a new and versatile strategy to in zzso forming zzso that hold tremendous zzso for protein delivery and tissue zzso
