zzso T cells recognize zzso peptides bound to major zzso complex zzso class I molecules on normal zzso cells zzso as well as on zzso cells or zzso cells zzso At least two zzso types participate in recognition of these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The former molecules react with zzso zzso and variable regions of zzso class I zzso whereas the latter molecules react with constant zzso regions of zzso class I zzso As the zzso of both zzso interactions is low, it is believed that zzso and zzso zzso collaborate in zzso zzso We have established a zzso capture zzso which can measure the interaction of zzso with zzso molecules and with zzso zzso The major findings are: zzso zzso complexes derived from in zzso activated T cells and captured by zzso zzso do bind specific zzso and zzso zzso T cells express at least three forms of zzso zzso single zzso zzso and zzso zzso Only the latter complexes are associated with zzso zzso and the quantity of zzso complexes relative to total zzso molecules appears to increase and to be selected into zzso zzso as a function of zzso zzso zzso
