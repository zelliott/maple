Many genetically engineered viruses have been evaluated for their potential as therapeutic agents in the treatment of zzso zzso We applied a spontaneously generated, highly attenuated zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso to the treatment of breast zzso In this study, we investigated the ability of zzso to zzso and lyse human and zzso breast cancer cells in zzso and tested its efficacy in an zzso animal model of breast zzso 

To assess the therapeutic efficacy of zzso against subcutaneous tumors in zzso mouse breast cancer cells were injected into the backs of mice, which were then treated with zzso zzso volume and survival rate were used as measures of the zzso effect in the in zzso zzso In zzso viral zzso zzso and replication zzso were also performed in human breast cancer cell zzso 

In the in zzso study, tumor growth was suppressed and long-term survival rates were zzso zzso was effective in producing zzso effects in zzso at various zzso of infection zzso in all cell lines zzso 

zzso demonstrated zzso effects in our animal zzso The viral growth and zzso effect of zzso in the human breast cancer cell line suggest that zzso is potentially effective in the clinical treatment of human zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso hold significant promise as cancer therapeutic zzso
