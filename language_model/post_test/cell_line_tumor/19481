The zzso zzso zzso zzso controls cell migration, differentiation and zzso and contributes to the zzso of human zzso In order to investigate the sensitivity of cancer cells to zzso agents, we developed a zzso zzso zzso a three-dimensional zzso in which cells can invade and zzso We have studied three cell lines zzso zzso and zzso from primary tumors and zzso that migrated into the zzso zzso and proliferated giving rise to clusters and zzso zzso we studied the growth of these cell lines in a usual zzso culture zzso In these two models, increasing zzso of zzso and zzso were evaluated for their ability to inhibit tumor cell growth and colony zzso Taken together, our data suggest that the cancer cells were more resistant in the three-dimensional model than in zzso cell zzso The zzso drugs were efficient after zzso of treatment in the zzso cultures, whereas they were significantly efficient only after one week of incubation in the zzso zzso zzso we show that this zzso zzso provides a three-dimensional model particularly appropriate for investigating mechanisms involved in cancer cell line sensitivity to zzso zzso
