zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso signaling is required for zzso and proliferation of gastrointestinal zzso We have previously shown successful targeting therapy for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso zzso expressing dominant negative zzso zzso in zzso is one of key factors in gastrointestinal zzso In this study, we sought to evaluate the effect of a new zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso on the progression of human gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We assessed the effect of zzso on signal zzso zzso and survival in six gastrointestinal cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso including zzso and pancreatic zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso Combination effects of zzso and chemotherapy were also zzso Then zzso was evaluated in the treatment of zzso in nude zzso 

zzso blocked zzso of zzso and its downstream zzso The zzso suppressed proliferation and zzso in all cell zzso zzso inhibited survival by itself and zzso chemotherapy zzso and zzso induced zzso Moreover, the combination of this agent and chemotherapy was effective against tumors in zzso The effect of zzso was not influenced by the zzso status of zzso zzso reduced expression of zzso but not insulin zzso in these zzso zzso The drug did not affect zzso body weight or blood zzso of zzso insulin, zzso binding protein 3, and growth zzso 

zzso might be a good molecular therapeutic target and zzso may thus have therapeutic value in human gastrointestinal zzso even in the presence of zzso zzso
