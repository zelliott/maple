A novel probe zzso method is developed to enhance loading of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso size zzso here as zzso zzso zzso zzso at 20 zzso for 60 zzso resulted in zzso loading efficiency of zzso zzso zzso and corresponding drug loading content of zzso zzso zzso zzso These are two folds higher than literature report of zzso loading in zzso The enhanced loading is attributed to increase in the rate of dissolution of zzso in zzso due to transmission of zzso order sonic waves which increases temperature and pressure in the medium due to formation and collapsing of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited pH responsive, swelling controlled in zzso release of zzso in simulated gastric fluid at pH zzso in simulated zzso fluid at pH zzso in simulated zzso fluid at pH zzso and in zzso buffer solution at pH zzso The zzso of zzso was measured by zzso B zzso zzso and its zzso was more than zzso for cancer cells of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso while it was zzso zzso for cancer cells of zzso zzso
