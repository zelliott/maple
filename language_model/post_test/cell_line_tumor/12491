zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso disease where gene expression and regulation are altered not only with disease progression but also between zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso regulates the growth of zzso zzso however, sensitivity to zzso zzso is short lived, yielding to emergence of zzso zzso zzso zzso prostate zzso continue to express the zzso a pivotal prostate regulator, but it is not known whether the zzso targets similar or different genes in different zzso zzso In this study, we investigated zzso binding and zzso zzso in two related zzso cell lines derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso and zzso cells had significantly different gene expression profiles individually and in response to zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso combined with promoter DNA zzso zzso studies showed that they have a similar zzso zzso zzso of the zzso study with zzso analysis identified direct zzso zzso The most prominent function of transcripts that were direct zzso targets was zzso regulation, although only one zzso regulator, zzso binding protein zzso was commonly regulated in both zzso Our results indicate that the zzso regulates the expression of different transcripts in the two lines, and demonstrate the versatility of the zzso gene expression program in prostate zzso
