In human cancer cells, zzso protein is known to sustain cell zzso Here, for the first time, we demonstrate the expression of zzso protein both in zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso cells, a zzso fully transformed cell line zzso bovine zzso virus zzso zzso Evidence of a possible involvement of zzso in zzso zzso zzso was obtained by zzso analysis of zzso zzso We found that most zzso samples stained positive for zzso even though to a different grade, while normal zzso zzso from healthy horses displayed very weak zzso pattern for zzso zzso By zzso technology, we demonstrate in zzso the role of zzso in zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was indeed shown to promote cell death and cell cycle arrest in zzso In addition, we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso a promising cancer zzso agent present in edible zzso zzso zzso such a zzso role of zzso was less marked in zzso zzso cells, an zzso zzso zzso cell line taken as a normal zzso zzso our findings might suggest a mutual cooperation between zzso and viral zzso to sustain cell zzso
