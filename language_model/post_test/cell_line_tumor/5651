The function of human zzso zzso in zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso and zzso domain zzso zzso was investigated in zzso zzso zzso cells where the zzso can be inhibited without zzso zzso We show that both zzso and zzso contribute to zzso of Pol II zzso zzso zzso on transcribed zzso zzso is also a major zzso of zzso zzso on Pol II at the zzso and U zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso in zzso suppressed the amount of Pol II accumulated at zzso ends on several genes including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicating reduced zzso pausing or zzso zzso into the zzso zzso with a zzso pausing zzso zzso zzso reduced recruitment of the negative zzso factor zzso at start zzso A role of zzso in regulating zzso is further suggested by enhanced zzso zzso zzso and diminished zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso marks of zzso genes when the zzso was zzso zzso with a new role for zzso at 3' ends, it was detected within genes and zzso regions, and zzso zzso delayed pausing and zzso zzso
