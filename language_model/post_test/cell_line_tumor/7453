The membrane zzso of zzso zzso cells is measured by using zzso zzso optical zzso The cells are treated with the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso 42, which is a zzso of 42 zzso acids related to the development of Alzheimer's zzso We find that both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso reduced the cell membrane zzso but the effect of zzso zzso was faster and stronger than that of the zzso We also apply zzso electric field zzso zzso on the zzso A zzso of 300 zzso can increase the membrane zzso under the treatment of zzso These results suggest that zzso can decrease the membrane compliance of live zzso cells, and zzso may counteract this zzso
