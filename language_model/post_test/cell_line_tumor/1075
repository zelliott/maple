A zzso screen for zzso protein zzso zzso signaling zzso identified two series zzso 1 and 2) of zzso zzso as potent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso These compounds had zzso cores, but differed in their respective zzso groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These compounds were competitive zzso of zzso binding by zzso zzso and they had minimal or no effect on zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso or zzso zzso at zzso zzso higher than those that inhibited zzso zzso Both class 1 and 2 compounds inhibited in zzso growth of human tumor cell zzso A class 2 compound zzso was the most potent inhibitor of human tumor cell growth in zzso and this effect was linked to distinct suppression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso status of other zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso nor did it affect overall zzso zzso level in zzso However, compound zzso did inhibit zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso was not due to a major effect on zzso zzso activity, because zzso zzso showed minimal zzso zzso zzso We believe compound zzso zzso zzso activity upstream of zzso and thereby affects zzso zzso in zzso Even with the dual effect of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso this compound was well tolerated and significantly inhibited growth of the human colon tumor cell line zzso (at 50 and 100 zzso zzso zzso in a nude mouse zzso zzso
