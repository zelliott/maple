In a zzso mouse brain tumor model, we tested the hypothesis that vaccination with tumor cells genetically modified to express zzso molecules zzso zzso T cells and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso cells zzso derived from a zzso mouse induced by zzso zzso zzso virus zzso were infected with an zzso zzso the zzso gene zzso To investigate the effects of zzso expression on the zzso of zzso cells, infected cells were implanted zzso into zzso zzso The zzso mice were vaccinated with zzso zzso injected zzso and 2 weeks later were challenged zzso with zzso zzso cells to determine whether or not the expression of zzso would enhance the zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso confirmed the expression of zzso and major zzso complex Class I zzso on the infected zzso The growth of subcutaneous tumors was markedly retarded in the zzso group, whereas tumors had formed and progressively increased in size in the other control zzso In the vaccine experiments, the mice zzso with zzso zzso survived longer than did the mice of the other groups, and a significant difference in survival times was zzso zzso revealed that brain tumors in mice previously vaccinated with zzso zzso had been infiltrated by a larger number of zzso zzso and that these zzso zzso contained not only zzso and zzso T cells but also zzso T zzso In addition, a zzso zzso confirmed that vaccination with the zzso zzso induced zzso zzso 

These results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of vaccination with tumor cells expressing zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso
