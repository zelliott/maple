zzso is an essential trace element in zzso but is toxic at high zzso It is best known for its cancer prevention activity, but cancer cells are more sensitive to zzso toxicity than normal zzso Since zzso treatment leads to zzso stress, and the zzso zzso system is a major zzso system, we examined the interplay between zzso zzso zzso 1) and zzso deficiencies and zzso toxicity in zzso cells, a zzso mouse cell line, and the corresponding parental zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were far more sensitive to zzso toxicity than zzso or control zzso In contrast, this effect was not seen in cells treated with hydrogen zzso suggesting that the increased sensitivity of zzso zzso to zzso was not due to zzso stress caused by this zzso Further analyses revealed that only zzso cells zzso strongly enhanced production and zzso of zzso which was associated with increased sensitivity of the cells to zzso The results suggest a new role for zzso cancer that is independent of zzso reduction and compensated for by the zzso zzso The results also suggest that the enhanced zzso toxicity of cancer cells and simultaneous zzso of zzso can provide a new avenue for cancer zzso
