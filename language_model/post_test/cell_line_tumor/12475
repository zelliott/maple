The clinical use of adoptive zzso with zzso T cells to treat established zzso is limited in part by the poor in zzso survival and function of the transferred T zzso Although administration of zzso zzso such as zzso can promote T cell survival, such strategies have many zzso activities and are often associated with zzso We show here that zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso b zzso a negative regulator of zzso zzso in zzso zzso T cells expanded ex zzso increased the efficacy of adoptive zzso of zzso leukemia in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the requirement for zzso zzso administration for tumor zzso in zzso In addition, zzso T cells lacking zzso demonstrated a lower threshold for zzso better survival following target recognition and zzso and enhanced zzso responses as a result of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in human zzso zzso T cell clones similarly restored zzso production and proliferation following target recognition independent of zzso zzso enhanced zzso production, and increased target zzso Thus, zzso zzso expression in zzso T cells may improve the efficacy of adoptive therapy of some human zzso
