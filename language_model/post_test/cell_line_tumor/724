To evaluate zzso imaging methods as zzso zzso of response to zzso in mouse models of zzso breast zzso The correlation between tumor zzso and molecular imaging of zzso zzso zzso and cellular proliferation was evaluated zzso in responding and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso tumors from zzso transgenic female mice were transplanted into zzso female zzso zzso human breast zzso cell line zzso were grown in zzso nude zzso zzso cell zzso zzso V zzso zzso metabolism zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and proliferation zzso zzso were evaluated throughout a biweekly zzso zzso Imaging metrics were validated by direct measurement of tumor size and zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso V accumulated significantly in zzso zzso and zzso tumors that ultimately zzso but not in zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso was not affected by zzso treatment in zzso or zzso zzso zzso imaging predicted zzso response in zzso tumors but not in zzso tumors, which exhibited modest zzso of zzso Close agreement was observed between imaging metrics and zzso zzso 

zzso imaging of zzso accurately predicts zzso zzso of zzso tumors and may warrant clinical exploration to predict early response to zzso zzso zzso does not seem to alter zzso metabolism substantially enough to afford zzso significant zzso value in this zzso Although promising in one zzso model, further studies are required to determine the overall value of zzso as a zzso of response to zzso in zzso breast zzso
