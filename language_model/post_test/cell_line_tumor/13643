Double emulsion has been used most often in zzso of zzso drugs by zzso of zzso zzso which has disadvantages such as low drug loading and low drug zzso efficiency due to the drug loss in the zzso The drug release may be too fast for sustained zzso We developed in this research a zzso zzso zzso 1000 zzso zzso zzso zzso system with zzso as a model zzso zzso We demonstrated that such a system can successfully deliver the model zzso drug with a low critical zzso concentration zzso of only zzso zzso a high drug load of zzso zzso and a zzso drug release zzso and higher cellular zzso in comparison with the original drug and the zzso zzso zzso The cell viability experiment showed great enhancement of the zzso chemotherapy, which is demonstrated by the zzso value reduced from zzso zzso zzso for zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso after 24, 48, 72 h culture with the zzso zzso cells, zzso Furthermore, such a zzso zzso zzso zzso showed significant zzso effects for the zzso chemotherapy, which is demonstrated by the greatly increased zzso value for the zzso zzso cells in comparison between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso can also be generalized to become a new strategy for zzso of zzso and zzso drugs and/or imaging zzso
