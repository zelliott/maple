The zzso barrier zzso is a biological unit comprised of specialized zzso zzso cells firmly connected by zzso tight junctions and zzso zzso zzso The zzso is essential for maintaining the retinal zzso and low zzso and is compromised in an early phase during the progression of diabetic zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso acid zzso zzso stimulants zzso act on zzso cells rather than zzso cells, resulting in the enhanced expression of zzso cell zzso zzso factor zzso through recruitment of the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso region of the gene zzso zzso zzso decreases expression of vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso These gene expression zzso zzso limit vascular zzso by modulating the tight junction function of zzso zzso in a zzso manner in zzso The zzso transformation of zzso cells zzso by zzso is sufficient for significant reductions of vascular leakage in the diabetic zzso suggesting that zzso zzso the loss of tight junction integrity induced by zzso These findings reveal that zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso regulate zzso function, zzso that the zzso cell can be a possible therapeutic target in diabetic zzso
