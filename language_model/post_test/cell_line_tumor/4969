We investigated the relations between the cell zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso using a dominant zzso zzso zzso cell line to evaluate the effects of zzso genes on zzso labeled zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso which contains a zzso marker, and zzso zzso zzso expression zzso were zzso zzso into zzso cell zzso zzso were zzso in zzso plates at zzso cells for 18 zzso zzso zzso (a beta zzso was added to the medium zzso zzso 37 zzso and incubated for 24 zzso We performed zzso to determine the cellular zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 60 zzso Cell zzso were determined by zzso blue zzso and flow zzso 

zzso cells showed zzso higher zzso zzso than zzso zzso cells in zzso condition, and the difference of zzso zzso was greater after zzso treatment ( zzso zzso zzso increased with zzso dose without a significant difference between zzso zzso zzso cells showed lower zzso zzso than zzso zzso cells in zzso condition, and the difference of zzso zzso was greater after zzso zzso By cell viability testing and zzso analysis, zzso cells showed lower viability and a larger zzso fraction zzso than zzso zzso cells after zzso zzso 

We speculate that zzso dysfunction increases zzso and decreases zzso metabolism in cancer cells and that this may be exaggerated by zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso could reflect tumor viability and zzso potential after zzso zzso treatment, whereas zzso could be a more useful PET zzso for assessing therapeutic response to zzso especially in cancer cells with an altered function of zzso
