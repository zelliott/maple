Previous studies have shown a zzso of the gene zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso in zzso zzso Here we provide evidence that zzso of the zzso gene is zzso by promoter zzso in primary human zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso 

zzso Western zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequencing were performed to assess the expression and zzso status of the zzso gene in primary zzso samples, zzso cell lines and zzso peripheral blood zzso The zzso cell line zzso was selected for treatment with a zzso inhibitor to restore zzso zzso In addition, cell zzso invasion and colony formation zzso were performed to assess the zzso effects of zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso expression in primary zzso samples zzso zzso was found to be significantly correlated with the zzso status of its promoter zzso island zzso zzso zzso by zzso treatment led to zzso of the zzso gene in the zzso cell zzso Additionally, zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells strongly suppressed its growth, invasion and colony formation zzso The high sensitivity zzso zzso and specificity zzso false zzso of detecting zzso promoter zzso in zzso zzso peripheral blood samples suggest that it could be employed as an zzso marker for zzso cancer diagnosis and recurrence zzso 

Our findings zzso that zzso zzso of the zzso gene promoter occurs frequently in zzso and that zzso of zzso might be zzso as a novel zzso strategy for the treatment of zzso zzso
