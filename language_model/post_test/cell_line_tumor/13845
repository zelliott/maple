To determine the relationships between zzso induced by transforming growth factor beta zzso and zzso in human zzso cell zzso 

Three human zzso zzso cell lines, involving different status of the zzso gene respectively, were used in this zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cell lines was zzso using the terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso zzso For identification of the mechanism of zzso induced by zzso these cell lines were zzso with a zzso zzso reporter zzso containing zzso binding elements zzso and zzso gene using zzso then were treated with zzso Relative zzso activity was zzso zzso 

Among three cell lines studied with zzso zzso addition of zzso induced zzso only in zzso cells zzso type zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell lines lacked zzso The detection of zzso activity indicated that zzso cells dramatically increased the response to zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines significantly lowered zzso zzso 

zzso cells were highly susceptible to zzso zzso compared with zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso may be a central zzso of the zzso signaling zzso zzso
