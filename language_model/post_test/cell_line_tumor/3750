Treatment options of zzso zzso are limited due to the zzso barrier zzso In this study, we investigated the utility of zzso zzso delivery as a means of transporting stem zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso stem cells zzso delivered via zzso application could impart therapeutic efficacy when expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso in a model of human zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso were zzso to track zzso within the brain and associated zzso We demonstrate that zzso can penetrate the brain from zzso cavity and zzso zzso zzso zzso in a mouse zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso mice tripled the penetration of zzso zzso in the brain with a fivefold increase in zzso zzso increase in zzso expression was observed in zzso zzso zzso implicating a zzso mechanism of zzso migration towards zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso expressing TRAIL improved the median survival of zzso mice bearing zzso zzso zzso zzso in comparison with zzso and zzso control zzso zzso our data suggest that IN delivery of stem zzso zzso is a feasible and highly zzso treatment zzso allowing for repeated application of modified stem cells to target zzso zzso
