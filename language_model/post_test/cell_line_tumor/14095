zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso that is highly resistant to current therapeutic zzso We established four zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso from Japanese patients, with the latter two from the same patient with zzso characteristics of zzso showing zzso and zzso zzso respectively, in cell zzso These cells grew well in zzso medium supplemented with zzso fetal bovine serum under zzso zzso zzso and expression analyses demonstrated that the tumor zzso gene zzso which is known to be one of the most frequently zzso in zzso is zzso in zzso We detected zzso deletion of zzso in all four zzso cell zzso However, zzso of other tumor zzso zzso including zzso and zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not found in these cell zzso zzso chain reaction amplification of the zzso virus 40 sequence did not detect any zzso We also analyzed genetic zzso of six other zzso cell lines and confirmed frequent zzso of zzso and zzso To characterize the biological differences between zzso and zzso we carried out zzso zzso analysis and detected genes that were zzso expressed in these two cell zzso Thus, our new zzso cell lines seem to be useful as new models for studying various aspects of the biology of human zzso as well as materials for the development of future zzso
