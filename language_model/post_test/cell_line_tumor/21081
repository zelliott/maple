The zzso zzso zzso and biological studies of a zzso zzso zzso compound containing the zzso zzso are zzso The zzso zzso with three donor nitrogen zzso was zzso by zzso of zzso with zzso The zzso complex, with formula zzso zzso zzso zzso where zzso zzso zzso was structurally determined on the basis of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A straightforward strategy to fully characterize the zzso compound using advanced zzso zzso is zzso This new complex is a zzso for a series of new zzso zzso and zzso compounds with improved zzso zzso likely to be modified in a desirable manner due to the relatively facile zzso modification of the zzso and their molecular zzso The present zzso complex is the first example of this family of zzso zzso compounds with the aimed zzso zzso Although the zzso itself is moderately active in selected cell lines zzso and zzso the activity of the zzso zzso complex has increased significantly for a broad range of cancer cell lines tested in zzso zzso 50 values zzso 11 approximately 17 zzso zzso of the zzso species with the DNA model base zzso zzso was found to produce in a zzso reaction the species zzso zzso zzso 4) 2 zzso as zzso which was studied in solution and also in the solid state, by X-ray zzso The structure comprises the as yet unknown zzso zzso
