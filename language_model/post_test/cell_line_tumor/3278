zzso activity of a new highly active promising zzso zzso zzso was studied in mice with model cervical zzso zzso The reference drug was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso used in zzso The new preparation introduced zzso in a dose of 1 zzso per mice inhibited the model tumor growth by zzso which was zzso zzso zzso zzso more effective than the action of the reference drug zzso The effect of the new zzso was also studied in zzso with respect to human breast zzso of the zzso line and human cervical zzso zzso The viability of the tumor cells was studied during a zzso incubation with the drug at a concentration of zzso M zzso zzso The reference compounds were zzso and zzso These drugs suppressed the growth of both zzso and, in higher zzso of zzso zzso inhibited the growth of zzso in all zzso Thus, the new zzso zzso is capable of suppressing the viability of human breast zzso and human cervical zzso being comparable or even more effective than the reference zzso
