In order to zzso and improve the efficacy of zzso zzso by zzso it is essential to fully understand the mechanisms of cell entry and zzso trafficking by these zzso Previously, we have shown that gene delivery by zzso is dependent from cholesterol and membrane zzso The zzso of zzso by treatment with zzso III suggested that gene delivery might be occurring by a zzso zzso We therefore investigated the zzso and zzso properties of zzso using cell lines zzso and zzso that express few zzso We show that, in contrast to other cells, cholesterol depletion does not affect the ability of zzso to zzso these zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso pathways also failed to inhibit zzso of these cells and zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso 1 resulted in an increased rate of zzso zzso into zzso zzso and zzso cells, and increased zzso zzso Furthermore, in zzso cells, zzso zzso demonstrated zzso of zzso and zzso zzso These data highlight that zzso may use different zzso pathways in different cells, and that zzso form a preferential route for gene delivery by this zzso zzso
