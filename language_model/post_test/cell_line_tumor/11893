G zzso receptors zzso have proven to be a rich source of therapeutic zzso therefore, finding compounds that regulate these receptors is a critical goal in drug zzso The zzso technology zzso the zzso of zzso labeled zzso from the zzso to zzso receptors at the plasma membrane to monitor zzso the zzso or zzso of zzso Here, we show that the zzso technology can be zzso on the zzso zzso system zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso which binds zzso with high zzso and the zzso zzso zzso which binds zzso with low zzso zzso cells zzso expressing an zzso fluorescent protein zzso and either the zzso or the zzso were zzso in zzso plastic plates and analyzed by the zzso at a screening rate of 5 zzso per zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso ratios of approximately zzso and zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso values agreed closely with zzso values reported in the literature for the different zzso zzso In addition, small amounts of zzso zzso induced by zzso doses of zzso were distinguished from the background noise of zzso zzso Furthermore, differences in the magnitude of zzso zzso distinguished partial zzso from full zzso and zzso values for these zzso were zzso These data show that the zzso technology, combined with an automated image analysis system, provides a zzso zzso and universal zzso for high zzso screening of known and orphan zzso
