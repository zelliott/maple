There is a large body of scientific evidence suggesting that zzso zzso a compound derived from the zzso of zzso which is abundant in zzso vegetables, harbors zzso activity in zzso and in zzso zzso evidence suggests that zzso protein zzso zzso plays an essential role in cellular energy zzso and tumor development and that targeting zzso may be a promising therapeutic option for cancer treatment in the zzso We previously reported that a formulated zzso zzso zzso referred as zzso with higher zzso was able to induce zzso and inhibit cell growth, zzso and invasion of prostate cancer zzso However, the precise molecular zzso for the zzso effects of zzso have not been fully zzso In the present study, we investigated whether zzso protein zzso zzso is a molecular target of zzso in human prostate cancer zzso Our results zzso for the first time, that zzso could activate the zzso signaling pathway, associated with suppression of the zzso target of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and induction of zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso also activates zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso prostate tumor zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso could be used as a potential zzso agent in the clinic for prevention and/or treatment of prostate cancer regardless of zzso zzso although functional zzso may be zzso
