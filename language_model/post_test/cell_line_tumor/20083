DNA zzso patterns have been zzso as zzso markers with high potential for clinical zzso We aimed at identifying zzso variations that differentiate between breast zzso and other breast tissue entities to establish a signature for zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso in 117 zzso breast zzso which included cancer, benign and normal breast zzso from patients as well as material from healthy zzso A zzso DNA zzso signature was identified by zzso analysis in a test set of samples zzso zzso 52, p zzso zzso zzso zzso and its performance was assessed through zzso zzso in an independent validation set zzso zzso 65, p zzso zzso zzso zzso The signature is associated with zzso and zzso zzso and exhibited significant zzso in zzso zzso breast zzso from cancer patients were also zzso at these zzso but to a markedly lower zzso This occurrence of zzso DNA in normal breast tissue of cancer patients is indicative of an zzso field zzso zzso diagnosis, receiver operating characteristic zzso and the corresponding area under the curve zzso analysis demonstrated a very high sensitivity and specificity of zzso and 100 zzso respectively, for the zzso zzso pattern zzso zzso To date, this represents the DNA zzso marker of the highest sensitivity and specificity for breast cancer zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in a cell line model reduced breast cancer cell invasion without affecting cell viability upon stimulation of cells with zzso Our data suggest a link between zzso zzso of zzso and breast cancer cell zzso
