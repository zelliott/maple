On the basis of the fact of the zzso of zzso in zzso tumor cells and zzso and the advantage of zzso zzso zzso as the drug carriers, a zzso zzso zzso zzso was anchored on the surface of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso of zzso in order to enhance the zzso delivery of zzso zzso drug into the tumor cells and its zzso Toward this goal, zzso zzso without or with zzso zzso loaded with zzso zzso or zzso were prepared and zzso The results revealed that zzso zzso were stable in solution, with small diameters zzso and a low critical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso facilitated the zzso zzso of zzso into the zzso melanoma zzso cells and human zzso vein zzso cells zzso via zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso and the zzso was zzso to the ratio of zzso modification in certain zzso Meanwhile, zzso zzso displayed higher zzso and zzso activities against both cells than zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso may be the promising zzso targeting carriers for efficient delivery of zzso agents into tumor cells and zzso
