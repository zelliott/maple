In breast and certain other zzso zzso zzso zzso including the zzso growth factor I zzso zzso play an important role in promoting the zzso zzso The zzso is therefore an important target for developing new zzso cancer zzso An initial screening of a chemical library against the zzso in breast cancer cells identified a zzso zzso compound as a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso This class of compounds has not been studied as zzso of the zzso We studied the effectiveness of one zzso zzso compound, zzso at zzso zzso signaling and zzso breast cancer cell growth in culture and in zzso zzso inhibited zzso of the zzso in cultured human zzso cells with an zzso of 12 zzso and zzso of the isolated zzso domain of the zzso with an zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso inhibited the growth of cultured breast cancer cells in serum at 10 zzso zzso was even more effective at zzso zzso growth of zzso cells zzso 6 zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso was associated with a decrease in zzso signaling through the zzso zzso zzso zzso hours of treatment with 15 zzso zzso induced zzso zzso In zzso treatment with zzso zzso injection zzso a week) reduced the growth rate of zzso cells implanted into zzso These studies indicate that zzso zzso compounds are potential new agents to test in the treatment of breast and other zzso zzso
