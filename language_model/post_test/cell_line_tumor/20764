We previously demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso cancer zzso cell zzso zzso zzso stimulates invasion similar to zzso acid zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the mechanisms through which zzso affects zzso cell zzso invasion, and zzso in two cultured zzso zzso cancer cell zzso 

zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso toxin zzso and zzso binding protein zzso by zzso zzso zzso media of zzso and zzso cells were evaluated via gel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity zzso and Western zzso for zzso Cell invasion was analyzed in zzso zzso zzso was localized via zzso zzso 

zzso revealed zzso in zzso media of zzso cells regardless of zzso zzso activity was increased by zzso zzso In zzso cells this effect was zzso and zzso zzso In all zzso and control zzso cells, zzso enhanced zzso suggesting an zzso zzso via zzso zzso was decreased zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly zzso zzso enhancement and zzso reduction of zzso zzso and zzso activity in zzso media of invading cells correlated zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells treated with zzso zzso zzso or 10 zzso zzso 

zzso influences zzso invasion by regulating zzso and zzso attachment via zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, this study illustrates that the net effect of zzso on each of these processes reflects a complex interplay of multiple zzso pathways involving zzso and downstream zzso
