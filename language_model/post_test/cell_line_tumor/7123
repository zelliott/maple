zzso zzso of gene expression by zzso signaling is driven by the association of zzso with zzso factors and the recruitment of zzso zzso It has been shown that the zzso protein zzso and the zzso zzso individually stimulate zzso zzso activity and that zzso is zzso by zzso Here, we report that zzso and zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso from zzso promoters and that the zzso activity of zzso was involved in the zzso zzso zzso directly with zzso predominantly through the zzso domain but not the zzso zzso domain, and different regions of zzso were involved in zzso and zzso zzso We provided evidence for the formation of a zzso complex by zzso zzso and zzso and for zzso of the three proteins in the zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso was markedly reduced, and this zzso could be restored by zzso expression of zzso However, zzso were still able to zzso the zzso complex in zzso cells, suggesting that zzso is zzso for the zzso function of zzso on zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso significantly increased zzso of zzso by zzso in zzso Finally, we showed that zzso zzso and zzso could zzso activate zzso zzso transcription, indicating that the synergistic zzso function is not restricted to zzso
