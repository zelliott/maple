The hypoxic response in humans is regulated by the zzso zzso factor system; zzso of zzso factor zzso activity has potential for the treatment of zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso family of natural products, zzso the interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso studies employing both natural and synthetic zzso derivatives reveal that only the structurally unique zzso core is required and sufficient to block the interaction of zzso and zzso In support of both zzso and animal work showing that the zzso effect of zzso is reduced by the addition of zzso through an unknown zzso our zzso studies reveal that zzso react with zzso causing zinc zzso zzso Cell studies with both natural and synthetic zzso demonstrated a decrease in vascular zzso growth factor and zzso effects that were zzso by zinc zzso The results have implications for the design of selective zzso and for the interaction of zzso with other zinc zzso protein targets involved in gene zzso
