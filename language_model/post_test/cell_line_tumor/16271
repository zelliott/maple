The regulation of zzso zzso zzso dynamics is a key aspect of cellular zzso zzso concentrate zzso and associated zzso elements as well as a large number of regulatory zzso including zzso zzso and small zzso of the zzso zzso We have recently shown that activated zzso can zzso to zzso and can initiate the zzso of the adapter protein zzso zzso at zzso As reported by several groups including zzso this zzso requires zzso zzso at zzso presumably by zzso Here we provide additional data regarding this process and briefly review recent zzso Finally, we incorporated the different pieces of available information into a zzso zzso This model proposes that local zzso zzso zzso a series of events that involve zzso traffic of zzso and zzso targeting these proteins to or near zzso Next, within specific membrane zzso zzso can mediate the zzso of zzso at zzso 14, which is important for the stable zzso zzso of zzso Finally, zzso of zzso may represent a key step required for zzso zzso turnover and cell zzso
