zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso is elevated in lung cancer and has been proposed as having zzso value and related to resistance to chemotherapy and zzso In addition, zzso has several functions in zzso zzso In this study, the authors investigated the effect of zzso depletion on cell cycle progression and proliferation in zzso cells, a lung cancer cell zzso 

A zzso zzso containing zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso was zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and Western zzso were used to examine zzso gene zzso Cell proliferation was evaluated by direct cell counting and zzso zzso zzso Cell cycle and zzso were examined by flow zzso zzso of zzso was detected by zzso and the zzso rate zzso by zzso agents was determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

After zzso into zzso cells, zzso reduced zzso zzso by zzso for 24 hours and by zzso for 48 zzso zzso protein was significantly decreased simultaneously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso changes of cells and growth zzso were observed in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso index was zzso 48 hours after zzso which was significantly lower than that of the control groups zzso zzso zzso Forty-eight hours after zzso there showed absence of zzso zzso and zzso abnormalities in zzso for zzso zzso cells showed a strong zzso arrest and zzso 72 hours post zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso groups was significantly higher than that of the other groups zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso depletion interferes with zzso formation, zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso and consequently zzso cell proliferation in zzso zzso Moreover, it zzso lung cancer cells to zzso
