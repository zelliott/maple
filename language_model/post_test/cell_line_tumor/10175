Human natural killer zzso cells are zzso that destroy tumor cells, zzso cells, and zzso zzso zzso A zzso is used both as a zzso and as an additive flame zzso in a variety of materials and appears to contaminate the zzso zzso has been found in human blood samples and if it interferes with zzso cell function, this could increase the risk of tumor development and/or viral zzso The present study examines the effects of exposure to various zzso of zzso for 24 zzso 48 zzso and 6 days on the zzso function, zzso function, and zzso levels of zzso zzso These same parameters were also monitored in zzso cells that were exposed to zzso for 1 h followed by 24 zzso 48 zzso and 6 days in zzso zzso A zzso exposure of zzso cells to 5 zzso zzso caused a zzso decrease in zzso zzso function, a zzso decrease in binding function, and a zzso decrease in zzso levels in zzso zzso Exposure to zzso zzso zzso for 24 h decreased zzso function by zzso binding function by zzso and had no effect on zzso zzso Exposure of zzso cells to 5 zzso zzso for 1 h followed by 24 h in zzso media caused a progressive and persistent loss of zzso function zzso while not affecting either binding ability or zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso decrease the zzso function of human zzso cells and that an initial brief (1 zzso exposure can cause a progressive loss of zzso In addition, the data also indicate that zzso loss of zzso zzso function can occur at a concentration of zzso that does not affect zzso ability and zzso levels of zzso zzso
