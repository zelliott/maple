zzso zzso leukemia viruses zzso recognize the third zzso loop of the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso type 1 zzso The zzso protein contains two zzso zzso zzso sites in the third zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso infection of zzso cells, but that of the zzso does not afford the cells this zzso As compared to the zzso zzso the zzso and zzso proteins possess three and six zzso acid zzso respectively, in the third zzso zzso To determine whether these inserted zzso acids are associated with zzso zzso infection zzso by zzso several zzso of zzso and zzso receptors were zzso Of all the zzso generated in the present study, only zzso zzso 1 exhibited zzso protein expression zzso The zzso zzso zzso human zzso cells were more susceptible to zzso by zzso zzso zzso than the zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso increased zzso zzso in the zzso zzso cells, but did not do so in the cells expressing either the zzso or zzso zzso zzso An zzso acid substitution in the zzso site of the zzso zzso zzso higher infection zzso but that of the zzso zzso 1 did zzso As with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso were detected on the cell surface by zzso zzso zzso treatment did not affect cellular distribution of the zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso or zzso zzso These results indicate that the extra zzso acids in the zzso (as compared to the zzso are associated with zzso of zzso zzso infection by the zzso zzso
