We have recently demonstrated that a zzso gene therapy strategy that contains two zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso and two zzso genes zzso zzso zzso factor and zzso zzso has a considerable zzso effect on large tumors in a zzso zzso zzso The current study further investigates the underlying mechanisms for the zzso effect observed by using small zzso zzso We found that zzso alone increased zzso cells in large tumors over time, whereas the zzso therapy contained in the zzso strategy alleviated zzso and made tumors vulnerable to zzso thus resulting in a synergistic zzso zzso
