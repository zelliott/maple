Our expression signatures of human cancer including zzso cancer zzso revealed that the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso is significantly reduced in cancer zzso In the human zzso zzso and zzso are located on the same zzso region zzso and zzso on zzso and zzso and zzso on zzso called zzso In this study, we identified the novel molecular targets commonly regulated by zzso and zzso in zzso zzso molecular target search and zzso reporter zzso showed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are directly regulated by zzso and zzso zzso of these two genes significantly inhibited cell proliferation and invasion, and increased zzso in BC zzso zzso showed that zzso expression levels were significantly higher in BC compared to normal zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified as new target genes regulated by the zzso and zzso cluster in zzso These genes may function as zzso contributing to cell proliferation and invasion in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso novel molecular targets may provide new insights into the potential mechanisms of BC zzso
