zzso and zzso have been implicated in the formation of zzso which may account for the zzso and release of zzso molecules in single zzso The in zzso existence of zzso and their protein composition is still zzso zzso on these matters are complicated by the lack of adequate negative zzso In search for such essential controls, the authors have investigated transformed zzso line) and primary zzso zzso Here, the authors report that these cells, which express zzso and zzso 1, cannot be shown to display functional zzso as evaluated by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso whether in the presence or absence of zzso zzso following stimulation of zzso zzso and after exposure to zzso zzso and zzso lack of zzso release of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso recordings indicated the absence of zzso zzso 1 currents evoked by membrane zzso above zzso zzso Thus, zzso cells are expected to provide a useful tool in the further characterization of zzso zzso properties, and zzso zzso
