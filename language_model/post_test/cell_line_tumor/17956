Various in zzso and in zzso experimental models have been used for the discovery of genes and pathways involved in melanoma and other types of zzso However, in many cases, the results from various tumor models failed to be validated successfully in clinical zzso Limited information is available on how closely these models reflect the in zzso zzso zzso In this study, a comprehensive zzso approach was used to systematically compare the expression patterns of snap frozen samples obtained from patients with primary melanoma, zzso zzso zzso and distant zzso and compare these patterns to those of their corresponding cell lines and tumor zzso in nude zzso The GE Healthcare zzso human zzso array was used and the expression data was zzso and analyzed using zzso zzso zzso Based on the expression analysis, the correlation rate between the snap frozen primary patient samples zzso derived cell lines was zzso with zzso zzso expressed zzso The correlation rate between the snap frozen primary patient samples and the tumor zzso was zzso with zzso zzso expressed zzso and the correlation rate comparing tumor zzso to derived cell lines ranged between zzso and zzso These results demonstrated significant gene expression differences between tumor materials with different in zzso and in zzso growth zzso Such studies can help us to distinguish between genes zzso or zzso as a result of the zzso and those zzso expressed independently of the tumor zzso With the extensive use of cell lines and zzso in cancer research, the information obtained using our approach may help to better interpret results generated from different tumor models by understanding common differences, as well as similarities at the gene expression level, information that may have important practical and biological zzso
