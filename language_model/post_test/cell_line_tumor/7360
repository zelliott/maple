To identify candidate genes involved in human zzso zzso we constructed the gene expression profiles of 50 zzso zzso zzso and 12 normal zzso zzso using a zzso zzso specially constructed for zzso zzso zzso analysis and principal component analysis could clearly distinguish the gene profiles of cancer zzso from those of normal zzso Our results confirm there are indeed differences in gene expression between cancer and normal zzso Our zzso zzso identified 22 zzso genes and 32 zzso genes in zzso Many of these genes have been previously identified in relation to human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso validation of selected genes by serial analysis of gene expression and reverse zzso zzso chain reaction, demonstrated expression patterns that were almost identical to our zzso zzso Using a zzso larger sample relative to that used in our previous study, candidate genes involved in human zzso zzso were zzso zzso Further studies of comprehensive gene expression using our technique may zzso the mechanism of zzso zzso
