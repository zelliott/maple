The zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically homes to tumors by binding to zzso and zzso zzso plasma proteins in tumor zzso Previous results show that zzso zzso iron oxide particles can cause additional zzso in tumor vessels, which creates more binding sites for the zzso We have used this zzso zzso system to develop zzso zzso that simultaneously serve as an imaging agent and inhibit tumor growth by zzso tumor circulation through blood zzso The zzso zzso were combined with zzso coated with another zzso zzso zzso and zzso with an zzso shape zzso were used for improved binding zzso The efficacy of the zzso zzso was then increased by replacing some zzso with zzso counterparts, which increased the stability of the zzso in the zzso Treatment of mice bearing zzso human prostate cancer tumors with the targeted zzso caused extensive zzso in tumor vessels, whereas no zzso was observed in the vessels of normal zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed zzso targeting of the zzso and ultrasound imaging showed reduced blood flow in tumor zzso Treatment of mice with prostate cancer with multiple doses of the zzso induced tumor necrosis and a highly significant reduction in tumor zzso
