Many tumors show dependence on zzso for growth and establishment of drug zzso We examined the effects of zzso on cervical cancer cells exposed to zzso agents including drugs used for zzso 

We tested the effect of zzso on zzso in three cervical cancer cell zzso zzso was measured by zzso degradation of zzso zzso was measured by Western zzso 

zzso reduced the percentage of cells undergoing zzso after exposure to the zzso agents zzso zzso and zzso Protection against zzso zzso was zzso Protection was independent of zzso gene zzso and not specific to zzso induced by DNA damage, since zzso significantly reduced the number of zzso cells produced after exposure to zzso zzso a zzso zzso effective in preventing zzso zzso Higher zzso of zzso overcame the zzso effect of zzso Treatment with zzso resulted in loss of the survival protein zzso and zzso partially reversed this zzso 

zzso protects cervical cancer cells treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso For zzso which zzso zzso and is zzso the amount of zzso versus survival and the level of zzso depend on the zzso zzso
