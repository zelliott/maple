Despite intensive research efforts, the distinct biological roles of two closely related zzso zzso zzso and zzso are only partially zzso zzso zzso selective for either of two zzso are useful research tools because they allow for exerting a desired subset of biological effects zzso by only one of the zzso Here we report on the synthesis of a new class of potent and selective zzso for zzso represented by a series of zzso zzso bearing zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso were zzso by zzso cross zzso reactions of zzso or zzso with zzso zzso were tested in both zzso and zzso modes using a panel of stable steroid zzso reporter cell lines established in zzso cells and consisting of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Some of the compounds are potent and selective zzso of zzso exhibiting weak partial to no zzso zzso activity on zzso zzso zzso is the most zzso selective zzso of the prepared compounds because it activates zzso but zzso zzso In addition, some compounds are pure zzso on zzso but show mixed zzso profile on zzso which is a typical pattern observed for selective zzso zzso zzso zzso
