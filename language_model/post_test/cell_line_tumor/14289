To study the effect of zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA damage in zzso zzso 

zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso 23 and 46 zzso for 24 hours and then exposed to B zzso P zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso was used as zzso zzso Single cell gel zzso zzso and zzso liquid zzso detection zzso zzso were applied to detect DNA zzso breaks and zzso zzso in zzso cells, zzso 

Average Oliver tail moment zzso and zzso level in zzso cells were significantly increased in B zzso P treated group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than that in zzso control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso treated group zzso zzso zzso zzso average zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A concentration of 46 zzso zzso caused a significant increase of zzso level as compared with the zzso zzso After zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso B zzso P induced more DNA strand breaks zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells than B zzso P zzso 

zzso might enhance B zzso zzso DNA damage in zzso cells, which should imply a synergistic effect of zzso on the zzso of B zzso zzso
