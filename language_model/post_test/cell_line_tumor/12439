The zzso zzso zzso zzso protein implicated in cancer progression and zzso is modified by zzso zzso zzso zzso in colon cancer cells, zzso shown to contribute to cancer zzso To zzso the role of zzso in colon cancer, we examined its expression and function in human colon tumors and colon zzso cell zzso zzso analyses of colon tumors revealed elevated expression of zzso in all samples analyzed compared to normal zzso To examine the function of zzso in colon cancer, we carried out protein and cell binding zzso using zzso zzso from zzso cells colon zzso cells infected with zzso zzso virus expressing zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso collagen IV, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso but poorly to collagen I and zzso As expected, binding of zzso to zzso was dependent on zzso since it was zzso by zzso and zzso and a zzso zzso zzso from zzso cells treated with the zzso inhibitor zzso bound poorly to zzso Unlike zzso isolated from other cell types, zzso isolated from colon cancer cells failed to mediate zzso of colon cancer and normal cell lines, possibly due to zzso specific zzso of zzso and/or its putative cellular zzso However, at low zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso cell zzso while at high zzso it inhibited cell zzso Thus, a possible mechanism by which zzso may contribute to colon cancer progression is by modulating tumor cell zzso to zzso zzso including zzso
