The adherence of zzso zzso to gastric zzso cells is required for prolonged persistence in the stomach and for induction of zzso Here, we first reported a new role of the zzso for advanced zzso zzso zzso on the adherence of zzso zzso to gastric zzso cells, assessed by different methods and binding to immobilized zzso zzso zzso in zzso cell line markedly reduced not only the zzso of zzso zzso but also the levels of zzso transcripts and protein released in response to zzso These data suggest that zzso may represent a new factor on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
