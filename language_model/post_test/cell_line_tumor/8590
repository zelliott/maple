The zzso zzso zzso and zzso were prepared via zzso reaction of zzso with zzso zzso and obtained in very good zzso An zzso reaction of zzso and zzso with either zzso or zzso gave new zzso and zzso complexes zzso The compounds were characterized by zzso analysis, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The molecular structures of 2, 3 and 4 were confirmed by X-ray zzso All the three molecular structures zzso in zzso zzso space zzso The coordination geometry around the palladium and platinum atoms in respective structures exhibited distorted square zzso geometry at the metal zzso The complexes were evaluated in zzso for their zzso activity against human breast zzso and human colon zzso cancer cells, and they exhibited growth zzso activities and selectivity that were superior to the standard compound zzso
