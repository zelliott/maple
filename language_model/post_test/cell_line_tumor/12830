The zzso release of zzso acid zzso from gold zzso zzso resonant zzso such as zzso shows great promise for gene delivery in living zzso Here we show that zzso zzso release can be performed on molecules that associate with the DNA in a DNA zzso complex bound to zzso zzso zzso a bright blue fluorescent zzso that binds zzso to zzso DNA, was chosen to zzso this zzso zzso release zzso zzso of zzso complexes at their zzso resonance wavelength zzso the DNA, releasing the zzso molecules within living cells, where they diffuse to the nucleus and associate with the cell's zzso zzso The low laser power and zzso times required for molecular release do not compromise cell zzso This highly controlled zzso of zzso molecules accompanying the zzso could have broad applications in the study of cellular processes and in the development of zzso targeted zzso
