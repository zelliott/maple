zzso zzso zzso zzso belongs to a class of highly lethal and poorly differentiated zzso zzso arising mainly in human zzso zzso zzso is caused by the zzso zzso fusion of the zzso zzso protein in zzso gene on zzso 15 to a few other zzso most frequently the zzso gene on zzso zzso The mechanism by which the zzso fusion product blocks zzso cellular differentiation and contributes to zzso remains zzso In this study, we show that zzso and zzso zzso in discrete nuclear zzso that are zzso but zzso zzso zzso recruits zzso zzso to induce zzso zzso in these zzso zzso which provide zzso sites for zzso of additional zzso and associated zzso zzso zzso zzso factor b) complexes in the zzso inactive zzso zzso These molecular events lead to repression of a zzso downstream target gene zzso a component of zzso protein 1 zzso that directly regulates zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells zzso the zzso inactive zzso zzso and releases the zzso zzso to stimulate zzso zzso leading to restoration of cellular zzso Our study provides a novel mechanism by which the zzso zzso zzso zzso functions to block cellular differentiation and to contribute to the zzso progression in the highly aggressive zzso
