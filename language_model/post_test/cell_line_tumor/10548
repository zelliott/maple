zzso zzso is zzso in various types of human zzso including zzso zzso cell zzso zzso However, a subset of zzso either do not express zzso or show low level of zzso It is well established that promoter zzso is a major mechanism that mediates zzso zzso of zzso in gastric and zzso cancer, but the data on zzso are very zzso In this study, we attempted to determine whether zzso expression was also regulated by promoter zzso in human zzso cell zzso We examined the zzso status of the zzso promoter in five human zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso sequencing zzso Western zzso analysis was used to determine zzso zzso zzso real-time zzso chain reaction was used to determine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected by zzso The promoter was densely zzso in zzso and zzso zzso which had a low level of zzso expression and less zzso in other three cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso with high level of zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso a DNA zzso zzso zzso the promoter and zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso production in zzso and zzso zzso However, no such effects were observed in zzso zzso protein was negative, but zzso was positive in zzso After treatment with zzso both zzso zzso and protein level had zzso These findings suggest that the promoter zzso may be one of the mechanisms that regulate zzso expression in zzso
