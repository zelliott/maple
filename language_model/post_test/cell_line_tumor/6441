Small zzso zzso of zzso zzso that arrest cells in zzso with zzso zzso are promising zzso drug zzso Clinical trials of zzso revealed zzso zzso or loss of zzso for which the molecular mechanism is zzso We investigated the effects of a zzso on zzso cells, a human zzso leukemia cell line that is often used to model dividing zzso zzso in cell zzso We found zzso treatment caused unusually rapid death of zzso cells exclusively during zzso zzso This zzso death occurred via the intrinsic zzso zzso with molecular events that include zzso c leakage into the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protected from zzso We zzso zzso physiology to find candidate triggers of zzso c release, and observed a decrease of membrane potential zzso before zzso outer membrane zzso zzso Interestingly, this loss of zzso was not blocked by zzso zzso suggesting it might be a cause of zzso zzso not a zzso Taken together, these results show that zzso zzso intrinsic zzso during zzso arrest in zzso with loss of zzso as an upstream event of zzso
