zzso is an important risk factor for zzso zzso zzso and elevated serum zzso is characteristic of zzso We hypothesized that zzso may have biological effects in promoting zzso zzso and examined the effects of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed by zzso and zzso incorporation zzso and zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso signaling was examined using specific pharmacological zzso and direct detection of zzso active zzso zzso of the long and short zzso receptors by zzso cells was confirmed by zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation in a zzso manner and inhibited zzso These effects were dependent on zzso zzso and zzso by adding zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso and zzso were abolished by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were activated upstream of zzso zzso whereas the zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were downstream of zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in an zzso zzso manner, and zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso required protein zzso C, zzso and zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso stimulates cell proliferation and zzso zzso in zzso cells via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso are essential to the zzso zzso These effects may contribute to the greatly increased risk of zzso zzso in zzso
