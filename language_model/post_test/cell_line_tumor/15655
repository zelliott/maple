zzso transmission electron zzso offers enhanced contrast compared to regular transmission electron zzso and thicker samples, up to 1 zzso or more, can be zzso since the depth of focus and zzso scattering are not zzso In this study, we combine this novel imaging approach with state of the art zzso preparation by using novel light transparent sapphire zzso carrier for zzso freezing and a freeze substitution protocol for better contrast of zzso This combination allows for imaging zzso and other zzso structures with zzso zzso This is demonstrated with zzso where the inner and outer zzso zzso as well as the zzso in the zzso appear in very close zzso with a minimal zzso zzso These findings zzso well with old observations using freeze zzso In zzso thick sections of zzso the three-dimensional structure of membrane sheets could be observed in the virtual sections of the zzso zzso zzso and intermediate filaments could be zzso within one zzso Intermediate zzso however, could even be better observed in zzso using surface scanning electron zzso
