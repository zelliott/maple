To establish a single zzso organ zzso zzso model of human zzso zzso zzso in the nude zzso 

Using the limited dilution method, zzso and zzso cell lines were used to generate eight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and five zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso single zzso zzso cell lines, zzso The zzso cell lines were seeded into zzso nude mice, and three weeks later the zzso subcutaneous tumor zzso were zzso transplanted into the zzso of nude zzso At six weeks after zzso lung and zzso zzso were extracted for analysis of the zzso zzso zzso area and pathology to assess the number of zzso zzso 

Among the 13 mice implanted with the established zzso cell lines, six grew subcutaneous zzso When zzso zzso the six tumors showed remarkably different zzso potential and organ zzso zzso The zzso areas of lung zzso zzso were: zzso 80 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 36 zzso 210; and zzso 508 zzso 272 zzso less than zzso no zzso zzso zzso were found for these zzso For zzso the zzso areas of lung and zzso zzso zzso zzso were 435 zzso zzso and 1 254 zzso zzso zzso 

We successfully established several zzso cell lines and nude mouse models of zzso with different zzso potential and organ zzso Among them, zzso zzso zzso and zzso have zzso zzso to zzso The zzso line exhibits dual zzso zzso to lung and zzso zzso These zzso cell lines and nude mouse models may represent useful tools for study of zzso zzso zzso
