To extract the active component from the root of zzso zzso zzso and to investigate the effects on zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso 

Total zzso was extracted from the root of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were treated with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were also treated respectively with zzso at different zzso for 24 h in wound healing and zzso zzso and the effects of zzso on zzso and zzso cells mobility and zzso abilities were zzso Meanwhile, the effects of zzso on invasion and migration of zzso and zzso cells were also investigated by zzso chamber in invasion and migration zzso 

zzso at zzso zzso inhibited zzso cell proliferation with zzso ratios zzso of zzso zzso zzso at 24, 48, and 72 zzso zzso Meanwhile, zzso inhibited zzso proliferation in a zzso manner from zzso to zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso at zzso zzso at 24 zzso For zzso zzso and zzso the zzso was lower than zzso at zzso zzso at 24 zzso In the wound healing zzso mobility abilities of zzso and zzso cells in zzso treated groups were significantly weaker than those of the control zzso After zzso for 24 h with zzso zzso abilities were reduced in both zzso and zzso cells, with zzso of zzso and zzso at 200 zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso cells in the migration zzso were zzso and zzso at 200 zzso In the invasion zzso zzso were zzso and zzso at 200 zzso 

Of all zzso cells, the highest zzso by zzso was seen for zzso zzso zzso could restrain zzso invasion, mobility, and migration abilities of zzso and zzso cells in zzso
