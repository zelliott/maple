To investigate the zzso expressions of zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso and beta zzso receptors and zzso zzso in oral zzso cell zzso zzso 

A total of 60 cases of zzso (30 from males and 30 from zzso were retrieved and submitted to zzso Also, steroid expression was studied in two zzso cell lines using Western zzso and zzso 

zzso demonstrated that zzso was expressed in almost zzso of the cases and zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso were less commonly zzso Only zzso presented statistically significant differences between zzso Western zzso and zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso was abundantly expressed in the zzso of both cell lines and zzso zzso presented a zzso zzso 

The detection of steroid hormones, especially zzso can indicate a role of these proteins in the process of zzso of some zzso Further studies of the mechanisms involved may provide important biological information regarding therapeutic zzso
