The zzso zzso of human zzso zzso identical to zzso is expressed in a variety of cells and zzso such as zzso brain, zzso liver, zzso skeletal muscle, primary blood zzso cells and cancer zzso We observed previously that the zzso region of the zzso zzso which has been identified in the zzso region between zzso and zzso could respond to serum stimulation following the zzso of human zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso region also contains two copies of the zzso zzso zzso binding motif zzso In this study we performed characterization of the zzso gene expression in response to hypoxic zzso Both zzso mobility shift and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso reporter with zzso expression zzso indicated that zzso binds to the zzso element zzso of zzso thereby zzso its gene zzso In addition, we demonstrated using zzso zzso that a complete tandem repeat of the zzso binding motif with a zzso interruption is required for full induction of zzso expression (up to zzso under hypoxic conditions, and that this response is much stronger than that of the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the sequence zzso in the zzso zzso is the authentic zzso consensus motif that mediates increased transcription, under hypoxic conditions, via zzso
