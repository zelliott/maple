zzso zzso has an important role in tumor zzso and has a contemplated use in tumor zzso We have previously engineered the fusion protein zzso composed of the zzso zzso acids zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso alpha coupled via a zzso to zzso and shown that it displayed far better efficacy than zzso in zzso In this report, we investigated in zzso whether zzso would be a better alternative than zzso and zzso for cancer treatment using two distinct animal zzso zzso mouse melanoma cells were injected in zzso mice either zzso or zzso for lung or liver zzso zzso zzso human zzso cancer cells were injected in the zzso of nude zzso We show that zzso has a higher efficiency than zzso or zzso to reduce lung and liver zzso and enhance survival in the mouse zzso melanoma model, a result that was associated with a higher zzso in zzso We also found that the zzso effect of zzso was completely abolished by in zzso depletion of natural killer cells using zzso zzso Moreover, zzso was also efficient to reduce by 50% tumor growth and the progression of zzso of human colon zzso cells in an zzso nude mouse zzso The fusion protein zzso has revealed strong zzso effect in two different cancer models overcoming the limited effect of zzso by increasing its zzso and zzso These findings hold significant importance for the use of zzso as a potential zzso
