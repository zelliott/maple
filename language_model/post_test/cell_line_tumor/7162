We investigated whether zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso could be involved in the zzso of the zzso cascade causing Alzheimer's zzso zzso expression or zzso zzso using synthetic zzso of the zzso family results in a dramatic decrease in the levels of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso medium of zzso and zzso zzso zzso does not affect expression or activity of any of the zzso involved in the generation of the zzso zzso but zzso a fast, zzso clearing mechanism responsible for the removal of the zzso zzso from the zzso Although zzso expression is generally low in the zzso induction of zzso expression during inflammation could be beneficial for inducing zzso zzso We confirm that the zzso clearance mechanism can indeed be induced by zzso zzso in primary zzso zzso and cortical zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso mechanisms should be explored further as potential drug targets for Alzheimer's disease zzso
