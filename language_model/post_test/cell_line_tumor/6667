zzso originally termed zzso is a novel zzso family gene that is expressed at high levels in zzso tumors as compared to normal zzso The present study was conducted to assess the clinical significance of zzso expression in zzso cell lung cancer zzso 

zzso of zzso protein was estimated by zzso and zzso zzso expression was investigated using quantitative reverse zzso zzso 

We assessed zzso expression in zzso zzso and was found to be zzso in tumor zzso compared with normal lung zzso zzso zzso values, zzso for tumor zzso and zzso for normal lung zzso zzso However, there was no significant difference in zzso expression among different pathological zzso The zzso activity of tumor cells was significantly higher in high zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso for high zzso tumor levels and zzso for low zzso tumor zzso zzso In addition, a high zzso expression was more frequently seen in zzso cell zzso than in zzso zzso and less frequently in zzso tumors than in moderately to poorly differentiated tumors zzso There was no difference in the zzso survival between low and high zzso patients zzso survival rates, zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso plays some roles in tumor cells proliferation in zzso but zzso expression status did not provided a zzso zzso
