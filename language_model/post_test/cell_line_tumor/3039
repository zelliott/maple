In the design of zzso that can target disease tissue in zzso parameters such as targeting zzso density, type of target zzso and zzso shape can play an important role in determining the extent of zzso zzso a systematic study of these parameters for the targeting of mouse zzso tumors is performed using zzso iron oxide as a model zzso zzso The type of targeting zzso zzso cell surface versus zzso zzso the surface coverage of the zzso its attachment chemistry, and the shape of the zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso circulation times and in zzso zzso efficiencies are zzso in two zzso models of human tumors zzso human zzso and zzso human zzso It is found that the in zzso zzso ability of the zzso is superior to that of the zzso that the smaller, neutral zzso targeting group is more effective than the larger, positively charged F3 zzso that a maximum in zzso efficiency and blood zzso is observed with approximately 60 zzso peptides per zzso for either the zzso or the zzso tumor types, and that incorporation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso improves targeting to both tumor types relative to a short zzso It is concluded that the blood zzso of a targeting zzso ensemble is a key consideration when selecting the appropriate zzso and zzso chemistry for tumor zzso
