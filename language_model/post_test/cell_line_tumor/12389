zzso instability leads to tumor zzso which in turn provides a source of cell zzso responsible for drug zzso However, the source of resistant cells during the process of acquired resistance is poorly zzso Our aim has been to characterize the mechanism by which acquired resistance to zzso emerges during the course of cancer cell treatment in zzso We recently demonstrated that, in zzso zzso colon cancer cells become zzso sensitive to zzso by depleting the zzso milieu of survival zzso on the other hand, the cell population under treatment can zzso adapt to grow below a critical cell density in the presence of the zzso Here, we show that this adapted cell population gives rise to permanent resistant populations through repeated cycles of cell death and zzso This increased cell zzso but not merely cell zzso is required for the appearance of increasing degrees of stable resistance that are progressively selected by drug zzso Such a process, taking place in multiple steps, is here designated zzso zzso The analysis of sensitive and resistant zzso cell populations revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso amplification and zzso zzso zzso to a low-level amplification of the zzso zzso arm as one of the earliest genetic events selected during zzso zzso this model provides a mechanism by which a tumor cell population lacking resistant zzso before treatment is able to acquire the genetic changes required for stable drug zzso
