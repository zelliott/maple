zzso was identified using a computer-based virtual screen and the known crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso Treatment of multiple cell lines with zzso resulted in the loss of zzso zzso zzso activity as measured by zzso mobility shift zzso within zzso Overnight exposure to zzso resulted in zzso of total zzso protein as well as known zzso zzso The effects of zzso treatment on different cell lines varied but included a reduction in cell proliferation and an increase in zzso zzso induced zzso in a manner distinct from zzso and zzso zzso mouse embryonic zzso were less sensitive than zzso counterparts to the zzso activity of the compound, revealing its biological zzso zzso cells were extremely sensitive to the zzso activity of the compound in two-dimensional culture, and zzso was a potent inhibitor of zzso proliferation and subsequent invasion in a three-dimensional tissue culture model zzso Together, these results suggest that interference with zzso activity using small molecules may have clinical application in cancer zzso
