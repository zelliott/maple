In the present investigation, we report on the possible underlying mechanism for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso 5, zzso 6, and zzso zzso 7 in the human lung zzso cancer cell line, using Ray zzso Human zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso array results showed differential zzso proteins expression in the extracts of cells treated with compounds zzso Western zzso demonstrated that compound 5 induced zzso and caused cell death in the zzso cell line via an increase zzso in zzso protein expression zzso zzso and a slight decrease zzso in zzso protein expression zzso zzso after 6 h of zzso These observations may provide valuable information on the mechanism by which these zzso zzso derivatives induce zzso in the human lung zzso cancer cell zzso
