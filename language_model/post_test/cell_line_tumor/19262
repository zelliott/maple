The nuclear zzso export factor zzso family proteins have been implicated in various aspects of zzso gene zzso This study shows that mouse zzso exhibits zzso zzso zzso zzso associates with translating zzso stress zzso zzso and processing bodies zzso the latter two of which are believed to be zzso sites of storage, degradation and/or sorting of zzso By zzso zzso zzso a series of zzso nuclear zzso zzso were identified as possible binding partners for zzso Among them, zzso A3, which is believed to be involved in zzso control and/or zzso zzso of certain zzso formed a stable complex with zzso in zzso Although zzso A3 was not associated with translating zzso it was zzso with zzso in zzso After exposing to zzso stress, zzso zzso to zzso whereas zzso A3 did zzso In differentiated zzso zzso cells, zzso was zzso with zzso A3 in cell body and zzso The zzso terminal half of zzso which was required for stable complex formation with zzso A3, coincided with the region required for zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso plays a role in zzso transport and/or storage of zzso through interactions with zzso zzso
