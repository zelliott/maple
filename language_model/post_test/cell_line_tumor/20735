Heat shock triggers a transient and ubiquitous response, the function of which is to protect cells against zzso zzso The zzso response is controlled by a key zzso factor known as heat shock factor 1 zzso We have developed a zzso zzso correlation zzso setup to measure the dynamics of zzso during the course of the zzso zzso The system combines a spatial light zzso to address several points of interest, and an zzso zzso camera for fast zzso recording of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso resolution of 14 zzso were analyzed before and after heat shock on zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the dynamic parameters of a zzso model showed a slower zzso diffusion after heat zzso It is also observed that the zzso rate decreases after heat zzso whereas the association rate is not zzso In addition, thanks to the zzso zzso correlation zzso system, up to five spots could be simultaneously located in each cell zzso This made it possible to zzso the zzso zzso of the diffusion constant of zzso which is higher than that of zzso zzso molecules and increases after heat zzso This finding is consistent with the fact that zzso response is associated with an increase of zzso interactions with DNA and cannot be explained even partially by zzso modifications of nuclear zzso
