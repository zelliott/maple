To determine the mechanism for differential effects of low oxygen tension on human zzso gene zzso in zzso and zzso zzso 

Human zzso reporter clones and real-time zzso were used to compare the effects of zzso on gene zzso in human zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso function and zzso assessments of zzso zzso interactions were used to characterize zzso response mechanisms regulating zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is specifically inhibited by low oxygen tension in zzso but is induced in some zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells or zzso of zzso function in hypoxic cells did not significantly alter zzso patterns of the zzso gene in either cell zzso 

These results suggest that zzso repression of zzso gene expression occurs in human zzso exposed to low oxygen tension but that zzso zzso is zzso in certain hypoxic zzso zzso However, regulation of zzso zzso is not zzso by functional zzso activity in either cell zzso
