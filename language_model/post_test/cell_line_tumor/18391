zzso resistance, the phenomenon zzso a primary zzso zzso the growth of zzso zzso is likely caused by the production of zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of the zzso zzso zzso expressed by primary sites of zzso on zzso zzso 

Two zzso models were zzso In one, the growth of a second primary tumor in mice with an already established primary tumor was compared with tumor growth in nave zzso In the other, the growth of liver zzso arising spontaneously from a subcutaneous tumor was compared in mice in which the primary tumor was either excised or left in zzso zzso zzso levels and zzso cell density, zzso and degree of zzso in the secondary tumors and liver zzso were zzso 

zzso tumors in mice with zzso zzso were significantly smaller than in mice without an established primary zzso systemic zzso levels at the time of tumor zzso in mice with zzso tumors were nearly 3 times that of nave zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso were seen in the secondary tumors of mice with zzso zzso Similarly, the weight of liver zzso was significantly less in mice in which the primary tumor was left in place as compared with those in which the primary tumor had been zzso zzso zzso levels in this model paralleled the status of the primary zzso levels decreased with primary tumor zzso but increased when the primary tumor was retained and allowed to zzso Although no difference in zzso density was seen between groups in the liver zzso more tumor cell zzso was seen in liver zzso when the primary tumor was zzso Thus, the presence of an established primary zzso had a significant zzso effect on the growth of secondary disease in both models and was associated with elevated systemic zzso zzso 

zzso zzso resistance occurred in these experimental zzso models of zzso and appears to be caused, at least in part, by zzso zzso zzso by zzso elaborated from primary zzso
