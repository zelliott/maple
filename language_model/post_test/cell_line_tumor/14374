The zzso growth factor zzso zzso is a zzso zzso implicated in the development and progression of different tumors, including zzso zzso is a common feature of zzso zzso Since zzso zzso zzso contribute to zzso in tumors, we addressed whether zzso signaling might zzso selective growth advantage to zzso zzso The effects of the zzso inhibitor zzso on proliferation and zzso signaling were compared in zzso and zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso and from two other zzso tumors zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso cells were twofold more sensitive to zzso zzso effects than the zzso zzso cells, and two- to zzso more sensitive than five unrelated zzso cell zzso The other two paired cell lines were equally zzso zzso of zzso cells correlated with zzso of the zzso zzso and with zzso zzso zzso which was prevented by zzso zzso specifically inhibited zzso but not zzso or stem cell zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso in zzso cells, but not in zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso effects were partially reverted by zzso active zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso protein zzso zzso zzso resulted in enhanced growth zzso in zzso zzso Our results suggest that increased zzso signaling may sensitize zzso zzso cells to zzso suggesting a therapeutic potential for zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso blockade of zzso and zzso or zzso zzso may enhance therapeutic targeting in zzso
