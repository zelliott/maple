Increased expression of zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is frequently associated with various types of zzso zzso HB zzso growth factor has been reported to promote the zzso progression of zzso zzso Based on this finding, zzso of zzso activity with zzso is now under phase I clinical zzso On the other hand, zzso expressed in zzso zzso cells is thought to promote invasion and growth of tumor cells by degrading the zzso zzso However, we recently demonstrated that zzso of zzso and zzso in gastric zzso cells leads to zzso of zzso within its zzso zzso region, converting it into a potent zzso growth zzso In this study, we evaluated the importance of regulation of zzso by zzso in clinical samples of zzso zzso We detected zzso of zzso and zzso in clear cell zzso zzso zzso particularly at the invasion front and in tumor cells that had zzso into the zzso whereas zzso alone was expressed in zzso borderline zzso tumor zzso Furthermore, a soluble zzso zzso that zzso to that processed by zzso was detected in zzso zzso obtained from patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells that express zzso and zzso exhibited enhanced cell growth in a zzso zzso and zzso growth in zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso with zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso the activity of zzso to promote invasive tumor growth and spreading in zzso
