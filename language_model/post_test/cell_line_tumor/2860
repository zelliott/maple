We previously reported on the zzso and characterization of a functional zzso DNA replication complex (the DNA zzso from human cells and zzso The zzso is fully competent to zzso all zzso of the DNA replication process in zzso In this study, DNA zzso a component of the zzso is examined to determine its activity and zzso in the in zzso synthesis and extension of zzso zzso Our results show that zzso activity in the zzso fraction of the zzso is zzso higher than that of crude cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso that are zzso zzso long and DNA zzso that are zzso zzso long using a zzso template of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso can be zzso by zzso coli DNA zzso I to form the complementary DNA strands on the zzso zzso In addition, the zzso also supports the synthesis of native zzso zzso in zzso using an zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso analysis demonstrates that native zzso zzso are zzso of zzso zzso in length and the zzso are zzso link to DNA to form zzso nascent DNA of zzso zzso Our study reveals that the zzso model is capable of zzso and continuing DNA zzso The ability of the zzso to zzso and extend zzso zzso in zzso zzso the organizational and functional properties of the zzso as a potentially useful replication apparatus to study the function of zzso and the interaction of zzso with other replication zzso
