During the past few years, a number of studies reported that different melanoma cell lines could be extensively zzso in zzso by zzso zzso cells at appropriate zzso zzso Here, we show, by zzso evaluation of different melanoma zzso that zzso ratios compatible with those allowing efficient melanoma cell killing in zzso are hardly reached at the tumor zzso We then investigated the outcome of zzso established at low zzso cell zzso After initial zzso zzso residual melanoma cells acquired resistance to zzso zzso zzso This reflected primarily an increased zzso on melanoma cells, of classical and zzso zzso class I zzso accompanied by a partial zzso of zzso and was dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso melanoma zzso showed a higher zzso class I expression on tumor cells that were zzso to zzso zzso zzso In long-term zzso the zzso zzso acquired by melanoma cells was lost over zzso However, this phenomenon was zzso by zzso of relevant zzso receptors in zzso zzso zzso Analysis of different zzso zzso indicated that zzso can partially overcome this novel tumor escape mechanism suggesting that zzso rather than zzso may be eligible for zzso zzso
