zzso (also known as zzso is a member of the zzso class of zzso agents, which has a well-known mechanism that blocks cell zzso and kills tumor cells, that is often used in clinics to treat zzso However, some zzso such as breast, zzso and zzso lung zzso are often resistant to zzso zzso In this study, we used a zzso zzso library against the entire human zzso to identify genes associated with sensitivity to zzso We isolated two zzso clones carrying the zzso specific to zzso 10 zzso and to budding zzso by zzso zzso The relation of budding zzso by zzso 3 to zzso sensitivity has already been established, but that of zzso remains zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso increased zzso sensitivity to zzso we also found that zzso is an important regulator for zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso tumors had decreased expression of zzso Thus, zzso may be a novel candidate zzso that acts as a good indicator of zzso zzso
