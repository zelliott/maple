A series of zzso zzso zzso zzso were designed and zzso on the basis of our previously built zzso zzso zzso zzso All the zzso compounds were evaluated for their zzso activities in an isolated zzso rabbit zzso and selected compounds were evaluated for their zzso activities in zzso against four human cancer cell zzso Biological results showed bulky and negative zzso at zzso position improved the zzso potency obviously, which completely zzso to the theoretical models, while those at zzso position thoroughly deviated from the zzso zzso Most of the screened compounds showed less than 1 zzso zzso potency and high selectivity against zzso zzso of which zzso is the most potent zzso zzso and twofold more active than zzso zzso zzso Cell viability indicated zzso zzso zzso at zzso or zzso position was not favorable to the cellular zzso Especially for the two zzso cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso inhibited them at the level of less than 10 zzso and was more potent than the control zzso It is being considered a promising new lead to be developed for the treatment of various zzso
