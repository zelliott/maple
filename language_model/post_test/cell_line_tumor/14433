We zzso in human cell line zzso the action of individual dietary zzso fatty acids zzso on the expression of several zzso metabolism zzso The effects of zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso were studied alone and with vitamin E zzso zzso zzso and AA zzso zzso and zzso proteins of zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulatory element binding protein zzso two major factors involved in zzso fatty acids zzso zzso affected zzso zzso less markedly than zzso and zzso zzso did not affect these products, both when individually added or together with fatty zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso of phase II drug metabolism with relevant actions within zzso zzso resulted also zzso zzso zzso did not essentially reduce zzso zzso expression while zzso and AA produced a considerable zzso Nevertheless, when these zzso were combined with zzso which by itself did not produce any effect, the result was a reduction of zzso zzso with zzso an increase reverting to zzso level with zzso and no variation with zzso zzso regulations did not result to be zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data indicate that major dietary zzso and zzso are zzso and selectively able to affect the expression of genes involved in zzso zzso The different actions of these slightly different molecules could be associated with their zzso role as relevant zzso zzso
