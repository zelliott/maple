zzso is a selective heat shock protein 90 zzso inhibitor which can exert a potent zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso on zzso melanoma cells in zzso and in zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso zzso inhibited the growth of zzso cells, and induced zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso Western zzso revealed that zzso lead to the degradation of zzso client proteins including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, we assessed the zzso effect of zzso in zzso using a zzso model in zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso significantly inhibited the growth of zzso tumors in mice, with a zzso zzso observed at dose of 80 zzso for 15 days, compared to control zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso showed that zzso also inhibited zzso and lead to a lower blood vessel density in the tumors, compared to the control zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso can exhibit a potent zzso activity against zzso melanoma cells both in zzso and in zzso by zzso cell proliferation and inducing cell cycle arrest and zzso in a mechanism dependent on the degradation of zzso client zzso
