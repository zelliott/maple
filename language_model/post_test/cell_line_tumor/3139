zzso an inhibitor of the zzso protein zzso zzso suppresses zzso zzso in intact cells and is frequently used to define a role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in cellular or animal models of zzso allergy, cancer, and cardiovascular zzso Here we show that zzso also interferes with the activities of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited isolated zzso zzso zzso and blocked the formation of the zzso products zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso in washed human zzso in response to collagen as well as from zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso was less affected zzso zzso and in zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso failed to suppress zzso zzso zzso zzso The distinct zzso of zzso towards zzso and zzso is apparent in automated molecular zzso studies that indicate a preferred binding of zzso to zzso into the active zzso zzso (10 zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso induced by collagen or zzso acid whereas zzso or zzso zzso zzso was not zzso Since zzso and zzso share zzso properties in the development and regulation of zzso zzso and vascular functions, caution should be used when interpreting data where zzso is used as tool to determine the involvement of zzso and/or the zzso zzso in respective experimental zzso
