zzso zzso hormones induce zzso in zzso and zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso zzso requires a threshold level of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and increasing the zzso zzso levels in ALL cells would augment their hormone zzso A protein zzso domain zzso approach was used to accomplish zzso We produced an zzso zzso zzso domain fusion protein zzso that potentially competes for the degradation of zzso protein by the zzso system and should thus increase its zzso levels by zzso the zzso We also designed a fusion zzso for the zzso DNA binding domain, zzso zzso since the biological function of this zzso as a dominant negative inhibitor of the zzso protein was already zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso and zzso exhibited highly efficient zzso into cultured ALL cell lines including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso As expected, the zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso stimulation of a zzso zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso zzso effectively increased zzso zzso levels in the zzso zzso cell line, zzso and in the zzso zzso cell zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso rendered zzso zzso cells sensitive to steroid killing and further zzso zzso cells to zzso The use of zzso zzso zzso may eventually lead to innovative therapeutic zzso to improve the clinical response of patients suffering from zzso and zzso acute zzso leukemia by increasing steroid responsiveness and perhaps converting zzso leukemia to a zzso zzso
