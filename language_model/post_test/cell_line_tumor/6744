The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso signal regulated zzso zzso is activated in most human zzso often through zzso zzso of zzso and zzso family zzso Using zzso zzso of zzso and an integrated genetic and zzso analysis, we find that zzso of zzso is associated with enhanced and selective sensitivity to zzso zzso when compared to either zzso cells or cells zzso a zzso zzso This zzso dependency was observed in zzso zzso cells regardless of tissue zzso and correlated with both zzso of zzso D1 protein expression and the induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso completely zzso zzso growth in zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso were only partially zzso These data suggest an exquisite dependency on zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso and offer a rational therapeutic strategy for this genetically defined zzso zzso
