zzso C virus zzso is capable of zzso different zzso of zzso metabolism and lipids have been shown to play a crucial role in the viral life zzso The aim of this study was to examine the effect zzso infection has on the zzso zzso zzso cells were infected using virus produced by the zzso zzso cell culture system and cells were harvested 24, 48, and zzso following zzso zzso profiling was performed using a zzso multiple platform methodology combining zzso performance liquid zzso mass zzso zzso and gas zzso zzso zzso There was a significant increase in a number of zzso involved in zzso synthesis and zzso replication during early zzso zzso zzso levels were also significantly increased along with several zzso zzso A number of zzso zzso pathways were disrupted by zzso infection, resulting in an increase in cholesterol and zzso levels, altered zzso metabolism and a possible disruption in zzso fatty acid zzso zzso in zzso levels were also noted, along with zzso in the zzso synthesis zzso These results highlight a number of previously zzso zzso interactions and give a more in depth insight into the effect zzso has on host cell zzso zzso
