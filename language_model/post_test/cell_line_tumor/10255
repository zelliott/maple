zzso zzso is widely used in prostate cancer zzso The dose and schedule employed are well zzso but about 50% of patients develop zzso Several studies have shown a significant reduction of the troublesome effects when zzso is zzso administered with zzso However, the results reported in the literature seem to be preliminary and possible zzso could be zzso In order to clarify the molecular mechanisms of the combination of the two drugs, we have investigated whether the expression of the proteins belonging to nuclear zzso zzso one zzso of hormone action, is altered by zzso and/or zzso zzso in zzso zzso We focused above all on zzso nuclear zzso K zzso zzso a zzso protein with a key role in prostate zzso 

zzso proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional gel zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso K were studied by Western zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso analysis revealed that there is a similarity in the changes of the zzso proteins zzso by drugs alone but that their combination does not result in a simple additive zzso Moreover, we found that in the zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso K zzso in a complex that is highly zzso to DNA and that both proteins were zzso modulated by zzso and/or zzso zzso 

This study confirm the pivotal role of zzso K in prostate zzso and suggest that this role might be played by the interaction with the zzso zzso
