To evaluate the therapeutic effects of a zzso in the treatment of a zzso zzso 

Thirty male zzso mice were divided into two groups: treated and zzso zzso tumors were induced in both groups by injecting zzso melanoma at about 10 zzso zzso zzso developed zzso days after transplantation and the zzso was applied on palpable tumors of the treated zzso zzso growth was followed up in both groups by measuring tumor size with a zzso After the follow-up period, the animals were killed and tumor samples of the treated and control groups were collected for zzso study by preparing zzso sections stained with zzso 

The zzso showed the absence of zzso leakage in zzso and the homogeneous distribution of the zzso The skin surface at the application site of the zzso appeared zzso and zzso developed, but reversed to normal after a few days in the treated zzso Control of tumor growth was achieved in the treated group compared with the control group, although complete zzso did not zzso 

The zzso tested for the treatment of a zzso melanoma model showed its zzso as tumor growth was retarded after application of the patch Nevertheless, adjustment of some therapeutic parameters and/or combining the patch with other treatment zzso may be necessary to achieve complete zzso The zzso represents a powerful tool to zzso the treatment of zzso
