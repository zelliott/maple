The zzso of the central nervous system is highly controlled by zzso cells and is dramatically altered in the case of zzso In this respect, the complex connection between cell size and division is of particular importance and needs zzso In order to investigate this connection, cell number and volume were measured in zzso rat zzso cells under different experimental conditions, including continuous cell culture, zzso channel zzso and zzso and in the presence of an zzso zzso medium collected from cell cultures or in a medium containing a low level of fetal calf zzso The rate of cell proliferation changed with cell volume in a zzso manner, so that it is optimal within a cell volume window and appears to be controlled by low and high cell size zzso The cell zzso relationship can be defined by zzso zzso which may reflect the effects of zzso crowding on proteins controlling the cell cycle zzso Altogether, these observations indicate that zzso cell proliferation is controlled predominantly but not exclusively by cell zzso zzso
