zzso are key regulators of cellular energy and are the focus of a large number of studies examining the regulation of zzso dynamics and zzso in healthy and diseased zzso One approach to monitoring zzso zzso is to measure the rate of zzso DNA zzso zzso We developed a sensitive technique to zzso newly zzso zzso in individual cells to study zzso replication within zzso compartments of zzso The technique combines the incorporation of zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso into zzso together with a zzso signal amplification zzso zzso this technique, we zzso and measured zzso zzso in individual zzso The labeling procedure for zzso allows for more comprehensive results by allowing the comparison of its incorporation with other zzso zzso because it does not require the harsh acid or zzso zzso necessary to recover the zzso zzso In addition, the zzso of both zzso and zzso permits sequential zzso experiments to follow the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The ability to zzso zzso zzso provides an essential tool for investigating the zzso in zzso dynamics involved in the zzso of multiple cellular disorders, including zzso and neurodegenerative zzso
