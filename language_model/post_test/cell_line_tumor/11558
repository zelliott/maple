In tumor zzso interactions among multiple cell types are critical for cancer zzso zzso proteins are responsible for zzso among these cells within tumor zzso To zzso the interactions of tumor and zzso we zzso colon cancer cell line zzso with normal human colon zzso zzso cell line zzso to mimic tumor zzso in zzso and investigated the differential expression pattern of zzso A quantitative zzso approach based on stable isotope labeling by zzso acids in cell culture zzso and zzso zzso was used for zzso zzso zzso 45 proteins were altered over zzso in zzso cellular zzso between equal amounts of zzso and zzso cells, compared with zzso zzso These differential zzso proteins involve in multiple zzso biological zzso The zzso level and acting pattern of zzso zzso and zzso were changed along with different zzso cell number ratios between zzso and zzso cells, simulating early, middle or advanced stage of colon zzso zzso a quantitative zzso profiling based on a zzso system can track zzso protein changes and their associated biological roles between tumor and zzso which gives a new insight on communications between tumor and zzso as well as cancer zzso by zzso cell zzso 

zzso zzso is a complex system and comprised of cancer cells and host zzso zzso The growth and progression of tumor have been recognized were affected by zzso interactions of zzso proteins zzso which were produced by the cells within tumor zzso Focus on general zzso molecules of living cells via zzso tools, is promising for investigating cell zzso zzso isotope labeling by zzso acids in cell culture zzso is a zzso labeling strategy for quantitative analysis, which is gaining popularity because of its ease of zzso the high quality of quantitative data zzso zzso and zzso with existing experimental zzso zzso zzso quantitative zzso analysis was employed for investigating interactions between zzso and tumor by in zzso modulating colon cancer zzso with established zzso system, which simplified the complexity of cancer zzso also tracked zzso protein changes and their associated biological roles between zzso and cancer zzso A series of tumor associated zzso proteins was zzso and investigated in our zzso So, the results give a new insight on communications between tumor and zzso as well as cancer zzso by zzso interactions of zzso
