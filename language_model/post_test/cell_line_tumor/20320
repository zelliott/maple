Several treatments for skin zzso are available today, but few of them are completely adequate, especially zzso to the zzso potential attributed to classical drugs like zzso zzso and zzso zzso To provide an alternative and safer technology for zzso we developed two zzso compounds originated from Brazilian zzso an extract of zzso zzso zzso and a zzso acid fraction isolated from zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of these compounds was assessed using zzso zzso and in zzso models including cellular zzso and equivalent zzso The results showed that zzso zzso extract is able to reduce the zzso activity in zzso and the combination of this extract with zzso acid is able to decrease the level of zzso produced by zzso cells cultured with zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was also reduced in human zzso zzso zzso zzso treated with the zzso The combination of the compounds may provide a synergistic positive zzso effect rather than their isolated zzso Finally, we demonstrated that the performance of these mixed compounds is comparable to classical molecules used for skin zzso as zzso zzso This new natural mixture could be considered an alternative therapeutic agent for treating zzso and an effective component in zzso zzso
