Global zzso modification patterns correlate with tumor zzso and zzso factors in multiple tumor zzso Recent studies suggest that zzso zzso modifications play an important role in zzso However, the effects of global zzso zzso on cell functions remain poorly zzso In this study, we show that the zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso zzso is clearly involved in regulating cell migration in zzso zzso of zzso zzso but not zzso inactive zzso activated migration in breast and zzso cancer zzso zzso migration was reduced by zzso of zzso or chemical zzso by zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso was specifically increased in invasive regions of zzso cancer zzso Moreover, the presence of zzso positively correlated with zzso zzso zzso in zzso cancer zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso drove zzso in zzso resulting in a considerable decrease in survival zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso plays an important role in human zzso cancer zzso possibly by promoting collective cell zzso
