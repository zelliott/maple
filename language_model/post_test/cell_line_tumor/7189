The expression of the zzso zzso protein fragile zzso zzso zzso is often impaired in many human zzso and its restoration in zzso cancer cell lines suppresses zzso and zzso zzso Although the zzso function of zzso is well zzso little is known about its precise mechanism of action and further studies are needed in order to zzso the putative therapeutic properties of this zzso To this end, we have engineered the lung cancer cell line zzso in order to express different molecules involved in the control of zzso zzso zzso of these cells with an zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene zzso revealed that complete protection from zzso was zzso by the inhibitor of zzso zzso response modifier A zzso and by a zzso form of the adapter protein zzso death domain zzso and partial protection by a zzso form of zzso while cells over expressing zzso zzso of the zzso response such as zzso or zzso that are resistant to treatment with zzso remained highly susceptible to cell death triggered by zzso gene zzso In line to what was observed in zzso cells, zzso efficacy was not affected by zzso zzso also in two other lung cancer cell lines zzso and zzso Analysis of zzso c release also confirmed that in zzso or zzso cells zzso could be detected by terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso before any evidence of zzso membrane zzso In conclusion, our analysis indicates that the zzso protein exerts its zzso activity through induction of an zzso mechanism that seems to be zzso dependent, zzso zzso and independent from zzso zzso
