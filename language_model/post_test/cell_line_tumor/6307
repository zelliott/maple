A novel type of zzso acid zzso zzso derivatives zzso which designed the combination between zzso as the backbone and various zzso zzso acid as the side chain, have been zzso and their biological activities were evaluated within zzso zzso zzso and then potent zzso zzso zzso zzso 42 demonstrated the most potent zzso activity zzso zzso for zzso which could be zzso as a potential zzso inhibitor in the further zzso zzso simulation was performed to position compound 42 into the zzso active site to determine the probable binding zzso Analysis of the binding zzso of 42 in active site displayed compound 42 was stabilized by hydrogen bonding interactions with zzso which was different from other zzso In the further study, zzso 43 and 44 had been zzso and their biological activities were also zzso which were the same as that we zzso zzso 43 has demonstrated significant zzso zzso zzso and tumor growth zzso activity as a potential zzso zzso
