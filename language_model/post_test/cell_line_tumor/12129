A new family of zzso factors named zzso vascular zzso growth factors zzso zzso have been recently described as predominantly expressed in zzso zzso Whether the normal and zzso zzso prostate cells and zzso express zzso and zzso and their receptors is still zzso We studied the expression of zzso and zzso and their receptors zzso and zzso in human prostate and their involvement in zzso Using zzso Western zzso and zzso we determined the expression of zzso in normal prostate zzso and zzso prostate zzso zzso in zzso cell primary cultures from normal prostate zzso and zzso prostate zzso and in a panel of prostate cell zzso In zzso zzso and in zzso a zzso human prostate zzso cell line, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels were evaluated by quantitative zzso zzso transcript was found in zzso in zzso in zzso and in zzso whereas it was detected at low level in zzso and in zzso zzso was absent in zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso confirmed that zzso protein expression was restricted to zzso and zzso prostate zzso localized in the zzso zzso cells, and progressively increased with the prostate cancer zzso score zzso zzso and zzso were zzso expressed in zzso and zzso On the other hand, their transcripts were highly detected in zzso zzso and zzso were found in zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso showed a significantly zzso zzso zzso higher expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso compared with zzso and zzso We demonstrated that zzso and their receptors are expressed in human prostate and that their levels increased with prostate zzso It may imply that zzso could be involved in prostate zzso probably regulating zzso Thus, the level of zzso could be useful for prostate cancer outcome evaluation and as a target for prostate cancer treatment in the zzso
