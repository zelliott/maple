zzso large B cell zzso zzso is the most common form of zzso zzso In the least zzso (ABC) zzso of zzso survival of the zzso cells is dependent on zzso zzso of the nuclear zzso zzso signaling zzso In normal B cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso requires zzso a zzso scaffolding zzso To determine whether zzso contributes to zzso we zzso the zzso gene in human zzso zzso We detected zzso zzso in 7 of 73 ABC zzso zzso zzso all within zzso zzso the zzso zzso Experimental introduction of zzso zzso domain zzso into zzso cell lines resulted in zzso zzso zzso and enhanced zzso activity upon zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is a bona fide zzso zzso providing a genetic rationale for the development of pharmacological zzso of the zzso zzso for zzso zzso
