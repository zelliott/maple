The zzso zzso gene specifically functions in DNA zzso zzso zzso repair, and its role has been suggested to be separate from other DNA repair zzso In zzso there are three zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso family zzso whose functions are largely zzso We disrupted each of the zzso family genes in the chicken zzso line zzso Both zzso and zzso cells were sensitive to zzso but not to X-rays, whereas zzso cells exhibited sensitivity to zzso but not to zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso protein formed zzso nuclear zzso depending on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to physically interact with zzso and they zzso at nuclear zzso Point zzso in the zzso domain, which disrupted the interaction with zzso led to zzso of zzso in the nucleus and loss of zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest that interaction between zzso and zzso is required for zzso zzso
