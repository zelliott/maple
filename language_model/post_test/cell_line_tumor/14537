zzso a natural zzso from the traditional Chinese zzso has shown promise as an efficient zzso of zzso The present study aims to investigate zzso cellular destruction of zzso zzso cells in the presence of zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso cell line zzso cells were incubated by zzso zzso and then were treated by ultrasound for zzso at the intensity of zzso zzso was evaluated using zzso zzso and light zzso zzso damage was analyzed using a zzso laser scanning zzso with zzso 123 and zzso changes were observed using a transmission electron zzso zzso 

zzso zzso showed that zzso induced by ultrasound treatment alone and zzso treatment alone was zzso and zzso zzso The zzso induced by the combined treatment of ultrasound and zzso significantly increased up to zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso swollen zzso and zzso zzso body were observed in the cells treated by ultrasound and zzso zzso The significant collapse of zzso membrane potential zzso was markedly observed in the zzso cells after the combined treatment of zzso and zzso 

Our findings demonstrated that ultrasound zzso in the presence of zzso significantly killed the zzso cells and induced zzso damage and the dysfunction of zzso suggesting that ultrasound treatment remarkably induced cellular destruction of zzso zzso cells in the presence of zzso
