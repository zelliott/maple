Members of the zzso zzso family are targets of a growing numbers of small molecules and zzso zzso zzso currently under development for the treatment of zzso Although historical efforts have been directed against zzso zzso and zzso zzso emerging zzso have pointed to zzso as a key zzso in the zzso of zzso pathways from the zzso zzso family and have fueled enthusiasm toward the clinical development of zzso zzso In this study, we have evaluated the potential therapeutic efficacy of a set of three recently generated zzso zzso zzso zzso A3 and zzso in human primary melanoma zzso We show that in melanoma cells expressing zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso activate the zzso pathway, and this leads to increased cell proliferation and zzso While zzso A3 and A4 are able to zzso inhibit zzso zzso proliferation and migration, zzso zzso is unable to exert this zzso In attempt to understand the mechanism of action and the basis of this different behavior, we zzso through a series of combined approaches, that zzso efficacy strongly zzso with zzso zzso zzso degradation and zzso of zzso recycling to the cell zzso Finally, fine zzso mapping studies through a zzso array show that zzso zzso zzso zzso have a dramatically different mode of binding to the to the zzso zzso zzso Our study confirms the key role of zzso and points to exploitation of novel combination therapies for treatment of zzso zzso
