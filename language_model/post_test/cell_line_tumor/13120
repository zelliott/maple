The relative biological effectiveness zzso of passive scattered zzso and pencil beam scanned (PBS) zzso beam delivery techniques for uniform beam zzso was determined by zzso zzso The zzso impact of modulated beam zzso on cell survival occurring zzso or zzso for both delivery techniques was determined with zzso communication intact or physically zzso Cell survival responses were compared to those observed using a 6 zzso zzso beam produced with a linear zzso zzso cells showed no significant difference in survival response to zzso beams delivered by zzso and PBS or 6 zzso photons taking into account a zzso of zzso for zzso at the zzso of the spread out Bragg zzso zzso zzso effects similar to those observed for 6 zzso photons were observed for both zzso and PBS zzso deliveries with cell survival decreasing to zzso survival for scattered doses of zzso and zzso zzso for passive scattered and pencil beam scanned beams zzso The observed zzso responses were shown to be dependent on zzso communication between the zzso and zzso cell zzso These data zzso for the first time, a similar zzso between passive and actively scanned zzso beams and confirm that zzso effects may be important zzso of cell survival following exposure to modulated zzso and zzso zzso
