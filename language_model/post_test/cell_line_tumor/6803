The genetic disease zzso zzso zzso is caused by loss of function of the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso affect equivalent zzso in the highly zzso zzso motifs that are essential components of the zzso sites of zzso Both zzso severely disrupt zzso channel gating by decreasing mean burst duration zzso and zzso greatly the zzso zzso zzso To identify small molecules that rescue the gating defects of zzso and zzso and understand better how these agents work, we used the patch clamp technique to study the effects on zzso and zzso of zzso B, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso three agents that strongly enhance zzso channel zzso zzso B (5 zzso zzso robustly zzso zzso channels by altering both zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso B (5 zzso decreased the zzso of zzso but this effect was insufficient to rescue zzso channel zzso zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso zzso and was without effect on the zzso zzso zzso However, by altering both zzso and zzso albeit with different zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso domain zzso model of zzso channel zzso we suggest that zzso B, zzso and zzso alter channel gating by distinct zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso have distinct pharmacological profiles and speculate that drug therapy for zzso is likely to be zzso
