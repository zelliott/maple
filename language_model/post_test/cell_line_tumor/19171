This study characterized cancer stem cells zzso in zzso zzso zzso cell lines, tumor zzso and blood zzso The zzso cells, but not the zzso cells, from zzso cell lines displayed zzso zzso All the tumor specimens and zzso of blood samples from liver cancer patients bore the zzso population, which could generate tumor zzso in zzso zzso The zzso cells demonstrated a more aggressive zzso than the zzso counterpart and formed zzso zzso in the lung of zzso zzso zzso blockade prevented the formation of local and zzso tumor zzso by the zzso zzso zzso gene expression profiles were identified in the zzso and zzso cells isolated from tissue and blood samples from liver cancer patients and zzso
