zzso also known as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a putative tumor zzso based on diminished expression in some solid zzso such as zzso zzso However, zzso is zzso in some tumors such as zzso cell lung zzso To clarify the mechanism of action of this cell zzso zzso we studied zzso zzso that has a spectrum of zzso and variable behavior allowing separation of proliferation from invasion and zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso cell lines derived from tumors that exhibit aggressive zzso Introduction of zzso into zzso deficient zzso cells resulted in reduced cell cycle progression associated with zzso zzso and diminished zzso zzso zzso zzso expression enhanced zzso zzso and migration and promoted tumor zzso zzso small interfering zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso cells accelerated cell cycle progression and significantly enhanced tumor size in zzso zzso zzso is not appreciably expressed in normal zzso tissue or benign zzso zzso In a human zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso was associated with zzso spread but not with increased tumor zzso These findings identify zzso as a unique zzso that restricts tumor growth whereas increasing zzso zzso Our data highlight a complex repertoire of actions providing a putative mechanism underlying the spectrum of zzso behaviors associated with zzso zzso
