zzso zzso plays important roles in the development of different zzso In this study, we investigated the roles and mechanisms of zzso in human cervical zzso 

zzso expression was detected in cervical cancer tumors and cell lines by zzso The zzso status in the promoter region of zzso was examined by zzso zzso The functional effect of zzso was determined by both in zzso and in zzso zzso 

zzso was frequently zzso in cervical cancer tumors and cell zzso This zzso of zzso was associated with zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor alpha zzso expression by directly targeting its zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso suppressed cervical cancer cell zzso tumor growth, and zzso in nude mice, whereas forced expression of zzso rescued this zzso zzso 

Our collective findings indicate that zzso functions as a tumor zzso by targeting zzso resulting in the zzso of tumor growth and zzso Thus, zzso may be a potential therapeutic target and zzso marker in cervical zzso
