We demonstrate that zzso of the zzso protein of a human influenza A virus occurs not only at the zzso zzso at position 215 but also at zzso zzso specifically at positions 42 and zzso By generating zzso influenza zzso zzso viruses that zzso zzso zzso zzso we determined the roles of these zzso in virus zzso At position 215 only a zzso substitution attenuated zzso whereas other zzso zzso to E to mimic zzso zzso T to zzso and T to zzso the zzso acid in avian influenza A virus zzso zzso had no zzso We conclude that zzso resulting from the zzso substitution at position 215 is attributable to a deleterious structural change in the zzso protein that is not caused by other zzso acid zzso and that zzso of zzso does not affect virus zzso At position 48 neither an zzso substitution nor an zzso substitution that mimics zzso zzso affected virus zzso In contrast, at position 42, an zzso but not an zzso substitution caused zzso The zzso substitution eliminates zzso zzso zzso binding by the zzso zzso accounting for zzso of virus zzso We show that protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the only zzso of the zzso protein of this human influenza A virus that regulates its replication is zzso zzso zzso by zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso or zzso in the zzso protein of the 2009 zzso pandemic virus was not zzso indicating that zzso zzso probably does not play any role in the replication of this zzso
