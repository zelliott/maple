A combined zzso zzso zzso and zzso optical zzso zzso zzso is developed, which can provide zzso zzso zzso and vascular information of tissue specimens in zzso This combined system is implemented by adding an zzso zzso zzso method to the previous combined zzso and zzso and then is applied to in zzso tissue zzso Two animal models, a mouse brain zzso window model and a mouse ear cancer model, are zzso Both zzso cellular information at local regions of zzso and zzso vascular information at relatively larger regions are zzso in the same zzso In zzso tissue zzso are better zzso by the combined zzso and zzso zzso
