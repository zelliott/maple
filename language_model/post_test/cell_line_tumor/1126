The zzso of the human brain is a cause of cognitive decline in the elderly and the major risk factor for Alzheimer's zzso The time in life when brain zzso begins is zzso Here we show that zzso profiling of the human frontal zzso from individuals ranging from 26 to 106 years of age defines a set of genes with reduced expression after age zzso These genes play central roles in synaptic zzso zzso transport and zzso zzso This is followed by induction of stress response, zzso and DNA repair zzso DNA damage is markedly increased in the promoters of genes with reduced expression in the aged zzso Moreover, these gene promoters are selectively damaged by zzso stress in cultured human zzso and show reduced zzso DNA zzso Thus, DNA damage may reduce the expression of selectively vulnerable genes involved in learning, memory and zzso survival, initiating a zzso of brain zzso that starts early in adult zzso
