This article zzso the nature of the zzso relationship of human tumor cell lines with a wide range of agents including zzso toxic substances zzso environmental zzso zzso drugs, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso dose responses were commonly reported and demonstrated in 136 tumor cell lines from over 30 tissue types for over 120 different zzso zzso features of these zzso dose responses were similar, regardless of tumor cell line or agent zzso That is, the magnitude of the responses was generally modest, with maximum zzso responses typically not greater than twice the control, while the zzso of the zzso concentration range was usually less than zzso zzso attention was directed to possible molecular mechanisms of the zzso nature of the dose response, as well as clinical implications in which a low concentration of zzso agent may stimulate tumor cell zzso Finally, these findings further support the conclusion that zzso dose responses are broadly zzso being independent of biological model, zzso measured, and zzso agent, and represent a basic feature of biological responsiveness to chemical and physical zzso
