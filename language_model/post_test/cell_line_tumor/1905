The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of zzso from a Chinese herb zzso zzso on the growth of breast cancer cells, and to zzso cellular and molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso showed the zzso effect on the growth zzso of breast cancer cells in zzso with zzso I zzso the most potent zzso zzso was also the only zzso to have potent activity in zzso the growth of the zzso breast cancer cell line zzso zzso caused cell cycle arrests of both zzso and zzso cell lines associated with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and induced breast cancer cell zzso associated with zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso and Aurora zzso Among these associated zzso Aurora A showed the most consistent pattern with the zzso activity of zzso zzso of Aurora A was also verified in breast zzso The gene function zzso showed that zzso of Aurora A by zzso dramatically reduced the zzso and zzso activities of zzso suggesting Aurora A as an important functional target of zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso had much less adverse effects on normal zzso zzso zzso zzso mechanism studies showed that zzso of Aurora A gene in breast cancer cells was not regulated by gene promoter DNA zzso but by zzso zzso zzso treatment significantly reduced zzso levels of zzso zzso associated with Aurora A zzso Our results supported the potent activity of zzso in zzso the growth of breast cancer cells in zzso in part by zzso of Aurora A gene zzso Our previous studies also demonstrated that zzso had potent zzso activity and minimal side effects in zzso Altogether, this study warrants further investigation to develop zzso as an effective and safe agent for the therapy and prevention of breast zzso
