zzso plays an important role in zzso metabolism by zzso the transport of zzso fatty acids across the zzso inner membrane followed by fatty acid zzso It is known that members of the zzso family play an important role in zzso transport in the zzso Investigation of zzso or zzso interaction in the zzso is important for establishment of safety drug medication during zzso The aim of this study was to determine the effects of zzso zzso of zzso on zzso transport in the zzso which is known to have a high expression level of zzso We investigated the zzso effect of five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso transport zzso by zzso in zzso cell line zzso zzso We found that all of the zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso being the strongest zzso We also found that the zzso effects of zzso and zzso depended on their existence ratio of zzso forms as, we reported zzso Furthermore, we zzso the zzso transport mechanism in zzso zzso zzso was transported actively by zzso However, we found that zzso transport was zzso and zzso had no zzso effect on zzso zzso suggesting that zzso acts as inhibitor of zzso not as a zzso for zzso
