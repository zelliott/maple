Fluorescent zzso zzso represent an important class of zzso zzso and allow the examination of cellular processes in real-time with minimal impact upon these zzso Such zzso zzso are becoming increasingly used for the examination of membrane transport zzso as they are zzso cost effective probe zzso for a number of membrane protein zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso has been used to examine membrane transport by the zzso gene product, zzso zzso is viewed as the zzso drug transport zzso and is able to zzso a large number of clinically relevant zzso In addition, zzso activity of zzso has been associated with the development of multiple drug resistance zzso which results in a poor patient response to therapeutic zzso It is thus important to be able to examine the potential for novel compounds to be zzso zzso Given the increasing use zzso 123 as a zzso dye for zzso a full zzso of its spectral properties in a range of in zzso zzso media is zzso zzso we determine zzso for zzso and zzso or zzso 123 and its zzso zzso 110 in commonly used zzso and extraction zzso demonstrating that zzso is highly dependent on the chemical zzso zzso parameters are zzso zzso methanol in zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso the zzso of zzso 123 into cells, via both passive and active zzso and demonstrate that this occurs primarily through zzso facilitated transport at zzso below 2 zzso and via zzso passive diffusion above zzso Finally, we zzso the zzso zzso and metabolism of zzso zzso demonstrating that these are both cell zzso factors that may influence the interpretation of transport zzso
