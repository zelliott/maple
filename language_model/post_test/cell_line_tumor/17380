Big zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso is regulated zzso by a series of upstream zzso zzso zzso zzso in a signaling zzso zzso activate their downstream zzso by zzso of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is the upstream zzso zzso and exists as naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso and zzso The full-length zzso zzso is 89 zzso acids longer than zzso at the N zzso but the precise functional difference between the two zzso zzso is not zzso zzso zzso site zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 315 zzso zzso zzso activated zzso but the corresponding dual zzso sites zzso of zzso could not induce zzso zzso zzso or nuclear zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited zzso growth zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso individually zzso with zzso but the presence of zzso prevented association of zzso with zzso suggesting a zzso basis for the zzso behavior of zzso on zzso zzso The ratio of zzso to zzso expression was higher in cancer cell lines, and zzso of zzso zzso DNA zzso These data suggest that alternative zzso of zzso and zzso may play a critical role in zzso zzso and subsequent cell zzso
