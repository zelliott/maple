The zzso testing battery is highly sensitive for detection of chemical zzso However, it features a low specificity and provides only limited zzso information required for risk assessment of positive zzso This is especially important in case of positive findings in the in zzso zzso damage zzso because zzso damage may be also induced zzso to cell zzso An increasing body of evidence indicates that zzso analysis of cellular stress responses provides an insight into mechanisms of action of zzso To evaluate the utility of such a zzso analysis we evaluated gene expression profiles of zzso cells treated with four model zzso agents using a targeted high density real-time zzso approach in a zzso project coordinated by the Health and Environmental Sciences Institute Committee on the Application of zzso in zzso zzso zzso We show that this gene profiling technology produced zzso data across laboratories allowing us to conclude that expression analysis of a relevant gene set is capable of distinguishing compounds that cause DNA zzso or double strand breaks from those that interfere with zzso zzso function or that cause zzso damage as a consequence of zzso Furthermore, our data suggest that the gene expression profiles at early time points are most likely to provide information relevant to mechanisms of zzso damage and that larger gene expression zzso will likely provide richer information for zzso molecular mechanisms of action of zzso Although more compounds need to be tested to identify a robust molecular signature, this study confirms the potential of zzso analysis for investigation of zzso zzso
