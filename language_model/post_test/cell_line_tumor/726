The zzso growth factor zzso zzso is zzso in several tumor types, and its expression is influenced by the length of a zzso zzso repeat zzso the longer the zzso the lower the zzso zzso repeats accumulate zzso types of zzso in tumors with zzso zzso We designed this study to estimate the occurrence of these zzso in zzso and their relevance in zzso of zzso zzso colon and gastric zzso 

We analyzed the frequency of zzso zzso in zzso in 55 zzso and 14 gastric zzso zzso zzso and in zzso in zzso clone cultures of zzso zzso colon tumor cell line zzso zzso clone cultures with different repeat lengths were analyzed by zzso cell zzso for zzso zzso zzso A correlation analysis was done between zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso 

Unlike zzso clone cultures, which exhibited higher rate of deletions compared with zzso most of zzso zzso in colon and gastric tumors were zzso zzso zzso correlated with lower zzso zzso expression in zzso clone zzso In colon zzso the zzso of the repeat was associated zzso with zzso in zzso and zzso but not in zzso 

The zzso zzso observed in tumors cannot be explained by an intrinsic property of this repeat favoring insertions versus zzso Instead, a selection for repeat zzso occurs in zzso zzso tumors, leading to zzso zzso These findings suggest that in zzso zzso tumors current therapies targeting zzso zzso may have either no effect or an opposite to the expected zzso
