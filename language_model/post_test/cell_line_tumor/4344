Advanced zzso protein products zzso a novel protein marker of zzso damage, have been confirmed to accumulate in patients with inflammatory zzso disease zzso as well as those with diabetes and chronic kidney zzso However, the role of zzso in the zzso zzso remains zzso This study was designed to investigate whether zzso have an effect on zzso zzso cell zzso death and zzso zzso zzso rat zzso zzso zzso cells and normal Sprague zzso rats were treated with zzso prepared by incubation of rat serum zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso cell death, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso oxygen species zzso generation, zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected both in zzso and in zzso In addition, we measured zzso deposition and zzso death in 23 subjects with Crohn's disease zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso in zzso zzso The triggering effect of zzso was mainly zzso by a zzso pathway, including zzso zzso zzso generation, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso administration to normal rats resulted in zzso deposition in the zzso zzso cells and in inflammatory cells in the zzso zzso These changes were zzso with zzso death, inflammatory cellular zzso and zzso zzso Both cell death and zzso injury were ameliorated by chronic treatment with zzso Furthermore, zzso deposition was also observed in zzso and inflammatory cells in the zzso zzso of patients with zzso The high zzso score of zzso showed increased zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso trigger zzso death and zzso tissue injury via a zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso may represent a novel zzso factor that contributes to zzso zzso zzso zzso cellular mechanisms might emerge as a promising therapeutic option for patients with zzso
