Despite the comparably high cure rates observed for zzso zzso there is still a great need for specific tumor zzso due to the often severe side effects resulting from intense zzso We recently demonstrated that zzso zzso cell lines are characterized by a zzso in DNA zzso break repair associated with a pronounced zzso Here we tested whether zzso of this zzso zzso by the zzso of zzso results in specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso were performed with five zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and two zzso and zzso zzso cell lines, as well as two normal human zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by the selective inhibitor zzso Cell cycle distribution was determined by flow zzso zzso via Western zzso and cell survival by colony formation zzso 

With the exception of zzso the zzso of zzso was found to abolish the pronounced zzso zzso in all zzso cells zzso All tumor cell lines that demonstrated the zzso of zzso also demonstrated zzso zzso in zzso normal human zzso no zzso was zzso 

zzso of the zzso checkpoint through the zzso of zzso may be used to selectively increase the cellular zzso of zzso zzso without affecting the surrounding normal zzso
