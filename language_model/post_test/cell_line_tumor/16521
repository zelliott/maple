Although human embryonic stem cell zzso hold therapeutic potential, zzso formation has deterred clinical zzso zzso zzso enters metabolically active cells through zzso calcium channels and zzso zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that serial zzso zzso would have zzso effect to assess zzso survival, zzso formation, and zzso zzso reduction through zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were transplanted into severe combined zzso mouse zzso to form zzso The chemotherapy group was injected with zzso zzso three times a zzso The control group was given zzso only prior to zzso zzso zzso evaluation by zzso zzso and zzso imaging was zzso The chemotherapy group showed significant reduction in the zzso volume and zzso activity at weeks 6 and zzso zzso revealed increased proportion of dead cells and zzso 3 positive cells in the chemotherapy zzso zzso administration of zzso enabled simultaneous monitoring and elimination of zzso zzso cells by higher zzso zzso of zzso
