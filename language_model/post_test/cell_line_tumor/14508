The zzso to zzso transition zzso is a zzso process enabling zzso cells to gain a migratory zzso zzso In cancer, this process contributes to zzso however the regulatory signals and zzso details are not fully zzso Here, we sought to identify the subset of genes regulated in lung cancer by zzso an zzso zzso zzso known to induce zzso Using an zzso expression database of 38 zzso cell lung cancer zzso cell lines, we identified 324 genes that correlated zzso with zzso and 142 that were positively zzso A zzso gene pattern zzso zzso high zzso or zzso was significantly associated with zzso and zzso but not with zzso zzso zzso or zzso Among eight genes selected for zzso seven were confirmed to correlate with zzso by quantitative real-time zzso in a series of 22 zzso cell lines, either zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or positively zzso zzso In addition, zzso or zzso of zzso led to corresponding changes in gene zzso demonstrating that these genes are also regulated by zzso either directly or zzso Of note, the combined zzso of zzso and zzso led to apparent synergistic responses in gene zzso Furthermore, these responses were not restricted to artificial settings, since most genes were similarly regulated during a zzso induction of zzso by zzso plus zzso Finally, the absence of zzso zzso was linked to zzso zzso in lung cancer tissue zzso zzso that the regulation observed in zzso applies to the human zzso In zzso this study identifies a new set of zzso genes in human lung cancer cells and supports the hypothesis that zzso and zzso are key regulators of the zzso process in this zzso
