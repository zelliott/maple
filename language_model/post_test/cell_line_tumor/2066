zzso expression of zzso has been frequently reported in cancer zzso However, the expression and mechanism of its function in gastric cancer remains zzso zzso real-time zzso was carried out to detect the relative expression of zzso in gastric cancer cell lines and zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso zzso or zzso to investigate the role of zzso in cell zzso Higher expression of zzso in gastric cancer zzso was associated with tumor size, a higher clinical stage, and was also correlated with shorter overall survival of patients with gastric zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression significantly suppressed the in zzso zzso zzso zzso and colony formation of gastric cancer cells, and zzso zzso expression significantly enhanced the development of tumors in nude zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso inhibited zzso expression by targeting one binding site in the zzso region zzso of zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso verified that zzso reduced zzso expression at both zzso and protein zzso The zzso repression in cell proliferation was reverted by zzso zzso zzso A reverse correlation between zzso and zzso expression was noted in gastric cancer zzso Our study shows that zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso could contribute to gastric zzso and would be targets for gastric cancer therapies and further developed as potential zzso zzso
