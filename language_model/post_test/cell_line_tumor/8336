Previously, we designed a zzso zzso targeting the human zzso zzso zzso which efficiently zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso This zzso blocked the zzso of zzso cells and abolished their ability to form zzso tubes in zzso In our present study, we demonstrate that zzso effectively inhibited zzso in zzso plugs zzso mice, zzso and solid human zzso tumors developed in nude mice zzso nude zzso zzso using prostate zzso cells zzso zzso and colon zzso cells zzso zzso When injected zzso it significantly reduced the tumor size and number of zzso developed by both zzso and zzso cells within the 3 weeks of experiment zzso Thus, zzso targeting zzso zzso genes can inhibit multiple key zzso processes in zzso and in zzso and may serve as useful zzso zzso
