We previously constructed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso fluorescent protein zzso zzso the replication of which is regulated by the human zzso reverse zzso zzso By zzso injection, these viruses could replicate within the primary tumor and subsequent zzso zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possibility of systemic administration of these zzso zzso We assessed the zzso efficacy of zzso and the ability of zzso to deliver zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso colon cancer nude mouse zzso We showed that zzso administration of zzso significantly inhibited colon cancer liver zzso and zzso implanted zzso Further, we showed that zzso could zzso liver zzso by zzso expression of the zzso gene after portal zzso or zzso zzso Thus, systemic administration of these zzso zzso should have clinical potential to treat and detect liver zzso and zzso
