zzso is generally regarded as an inactive zzso because of its low zzso zzso However, zzso appears to regulate zzso development in animal zzso In this study, we evaluated whether zzso may zzso bind to and activate the two insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso because zzso is a relatively zzso zzso that is prevalent in fetal and cancer cells and is able to mediate the growth effects of zzso Mouse zzso zzso devoid of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso either human zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso Three human cancer cell lines were also zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso of zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and displaced zzso from zzso with a similar zzso In contrast, zzso zzso values for stimulation of zzso zzso and for zzso displacement from zzso were approximately zzso zzso zzso did not bind or activate zzso or zzso zzso Via zzso zzso activated the zzso zzso to a similar degree as insulin but zzso a weaker zzso zzso Despite its low zzso activity, zzso was almost zzso as insulin in inducing cell proliferation and migration in cells expressing various zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso is a selective zzso zzso and may induce biological effects through this zzso zzso
