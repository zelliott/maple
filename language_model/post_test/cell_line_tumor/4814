We introduce a general test of the zzso importance of zzso zzso zzso zzso modular kinetic analysis of zzso zzso in zzso from zzso cells with constant nuclear DNA but different zzso We have applied this test to the hypothesis zzso zzso Brandon, zzso and Wallace zzso Science zzso zzso that particular zzso zzso zzso combinations of zzso that cause lowered zzso efficiency, leading to generation of less zzso and more heat, were positively selected during zzso of modern humans into colder zzso zzso to the predictions of this hypothesis, zzso from Arctic zzso had similar or even greater zzso efficiency than zzso from tropical zzso
