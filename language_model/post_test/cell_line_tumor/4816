zzso zzso inhibitor zzso acid zzso was recently shown to enhance proliferation and zzso of normal zzso stem cells, raising the possibility that zzso may also support growth of zzso zzso cells zzso Here, zzso maintains a significantly higher proportion of zzso zzso and colony forming units compared to control cultures in six zzso samples, but selectively reduces zzso cell numbers in another zzso sample with expression of zzso Our data suggest a differential effect of zzso on the small population of zzso zzso cells and the bulk of zzso differentiated blasts in the majority of zzso samples zzso
