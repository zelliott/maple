In order to investigate the impact of zzso proteins on the zzso and zzso behavior of zzso cells, we zzso the zzso procedure of human zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and of primary cells obtained from a patient's tumor using zzso technology in conjunction with zzso zzso We describe the zzso zzso show that a high percentage of the cells can be zzso and that zzso does not cause zzso zzso of the zzso zzso we conclude that zzso is a highly efficient tool to deliver plasmids for transient protein zzso and zzso for specific protein zzso to different zzso cell lines or primary zzso
