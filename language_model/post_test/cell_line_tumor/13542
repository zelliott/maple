zzso zzso have shown promising efficacy in clinical trials targeting prostate zzso that frequently develop resistance to all current zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso defective in zzso have been demonstrated to zzso with the current standard of care, zzso and zzso in prostate cancer zzso While expression of the early viral zzso gene is essential for the enhanced cell killing, the specific zzso required for the effects are zzso Here, we demonstrate that replicating zzso deleted in small zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso sensitize human prostate cancer cells zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso Through generation of zzso zzso we demonstrate that the small zzso protein is sufficient to zzso sensitize all prostate cancer cells to the drugs even in the absence of viral replication and the zzso zzso domain, zzso region zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso domain in zzso is essential for zzso in the absence zzso but not in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso also failed to increase zzso and zzso of cells in zzso All zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso enhance cell killing to the same degree as wild type zzso In zzso zzso in zzso the zzso zzso significantly zzso time to tumor progression that is further enhanced in combination with zzso Neither zzso nor zzso replicates in normal human zzso cells zzso These findings suggest that additional zzso might be included when developing more potent zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso to further enhance potency through synergistic cell killing in combination with current zzso
