zzso zzso and zzso increase cell membrane zzso eventually leading to cell zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso toxicity and membrane zzso can be reversed using the membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso The data indicate that zzso zzso toxicity is caused by defects in the zzso zzso of the type that are sealed by zzso zzso Our results also suggest the possibility of using zzso membrane zzso to prevent or reverse zzso zzso toxicity in zzso Because the ability to zzso zzso is a generic property of zzso zzso this therapeutic approach may be effective for the treatment of many degenerative diseases caused in part by the interaction of zzso proteins with cell zzso as in Alzheimer's disease, type II diabetes, and a host of zzso
