The zzso system combines advances in zzso technologies with a novel optical architecture for high sensitivity and zzso imaging of cells in zzso The sensitivity and dynamic range as well as a methodology for spectral compensation of imagery is zzso 

zzso fluorescent beads were run on the zzso and a flow zzso Four single color fluorescent control samples of cells were run to zzso spectral zzso An additional sample, labeled with all colors was run and compensated in six spectral zzso 

Analysis of empirical data for sensitivity and dynamic range matched theoretical zzso The zzso system demonstrated zzso sensitivity comparable to a zzso flow zzso A methodology for addressing spectral zzso individual zzso anomalies, and multiple imaging zzso was demonstrated for spectral compensation of zzso zzso zzso is shown zzso and zzso 

Unlike intensity zzso made with conventional flow zzso object size impacts both dynamic range and zzso sensitivity in systems that zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging of alternate zzso can be employed to increase fluorescent zzso zzso compensation of complex zzso imagery spanning six spectral bands is accomplished in a zzso zzso
