The advent of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has revolutionized the treatment of chronic zzso leukemia zzso However, resistance zzso due to zzso zzso and other zzso Furthermore, patients with blast crisis zzso are less responsive and zzso zzso stem cells are insensitive to these zzso We found that zzso a zzso at zzso zzso promoted equally significant death of zzso cells, a cell line derived from a zzso blast crisis zzso patient and zzso cells, an zzso zzso zzso bearing the zzso zzso Similarly, zzso cells harboring zzso zzso were as sensitive as zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso induced zzso in primary samples from blast crisis zzso patients, who showed resistance to zzso zzso in zzso with less toxicity to normal zzso zzso decreased zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein levels in zzso zzso and zzso cells and in cells from blast crisis zzso zzso It zzso zzso but not zzso cells to zzso More importantly, zzso also induced death of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, a major problem in the therapy of zzso with zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso zzso zzso blast crisis zzso cell death independent of the cellular responses to zzso zzso suggesting that zzso could eradicate residual zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso patients and benefit zzso blast crisis zzso zzso
