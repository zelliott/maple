Platinum resistance is the most crucial problem for treatment of zzso zzso zzso evidence points towards zzso zzso as a zzso reason for this clinical zzso The present study evaluates the effect of zzso and zzso of zzso on the sensitivity to zzso in a zzso human zzso cancer cell line and the corresponding zzso parental cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso cancer cell lines were zzso zzso with an zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was evaluated by western zzso zzso zzso effects of zzso were evaluated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by western zzso converted zzso zzso into zzso cells as shown by zzso zzso zzso platinum resistance of zzso cells could be reversed by zzso of zzso as demonstrated by zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our data provide strong evidence that zzso resistance in zzso cancer is zzso by zzso zzso and can be overcome by zzso zzso thus, providing a rationale for clinical phase zzso studies combining zzso zzso with zzso
