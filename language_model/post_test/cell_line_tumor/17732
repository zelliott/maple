zzso zzso T zzso zzso generated by zzso with zzso cells or viral infection are able to lyse zzso or zzso infected in zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, it is reported that zzso T cells are not essential for zzso rejection zzso heart and zzso and that clearance of influenza or the zzso virus from zzso respiratory zzso is normal or only slightly delayed after a primary viral challenge of zzso zzso To address this controversy, we generated zzso zzso zzso by a mixed zzso culture and examined the zzso of a panel of zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso A zzso and zzso skin components were found to be resistant to zzso zzso This resistance did not appear to be related to a reduced expression of zzso class I zzso and all these cells could block the recognition of zzso targets by zzso in cold target zzso zzso We extended our observation by persistently infecting the same panel of cell lines with zzso zzso virus zzso The zzso A and zzso lines infected with a zzso zzso virus were resistant to zzso by zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso A and zzso lines were able to block the zzso of zzso zzso targets by zzso in cold target zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that not all in zzso zzso may be sensitive to zzso zzso
