The zzso zzso zzso zzso triggers multiple zzso signaling zzso regulating cell cycle progression and cellular zzso We therefore hypothesized that zzso imaging could allow zzso detection of response to the zzso inhibitor zzso in zzso 

The effects of zzso treatment on the zzso expression and the zzso profile were analyzed in the human zzso zzso cancer cell line zzso In zzso zzso changes of pathways regulating cell cycle progression and zzso zzso and zzso metabolism were correlated to the results of cell cycle analysis and the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso under zzso zzso In zzso the tumor metabolism under zzso was monitored by zzso PET of zzso zzso 

zzso treatment resulted in the zzso zzso of various zzso pathways with consecutive zzso of zzso expression and a zzso zzso In zzso zzso treatment resulted in the decreased expression of genes regulating zzso zzso and zzso zzso with a subsequent reduction in the functional activity of the corresponding zzso In zzso zzso imaging with PET was able to assess changes in the zzso zzso metabolism profile as early as 3 d after initiation of zzso zzso 

We describe a zzso imaging approach for the zzso detection of successful zzso zzso Our results suggest that PET may be useful for identifying patients who respond to zzso early in the course of zzso
