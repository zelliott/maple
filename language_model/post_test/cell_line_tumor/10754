We assessed the zzso association states of the Parkinson's disease related protein zzso zzso in living cells by zzso with a functional zzso zzso protein zzso bearing a zzso tag binding the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso states of zzso were assessed by in zzso zzso of molecular zzso mobility with zzso zzso recovery after zzso and of local molecular density with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recovery was quantitative and rapid in regions of free zzso whereas AS in larger zzso zzso zzso A small zzso recovery characterized by an apparent diffusion constant of zzso zzso was attributed to the dynamics of smaller, associated forms of zzso and the exchange of mobile species with the larger immobile zzso By zzso the larger zzso exhibited high brightness and very low zzso consistent with zzso between closely packed zzso for which a zzso distance zzso of zzso zzso was zzso Other bright regions had high zzso values, close to that of zzso zzso and indicative of zzso protein with both low mobility and low degree of zzso The zzso intensity correlations also revealed regions of free protein or of small zzso zzso by conventional zzso imaging zzso The combined strategy zzso provides a highly sensitive means for zzso both the dynamics and structural features of protein zzso and other zzso complexes in living cells, and can be extended to other zzso systems and to drug screening zzso
