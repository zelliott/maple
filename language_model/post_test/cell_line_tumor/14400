zzso (also called zzso and zzso was identified as a zzso for nuclear receptors and is linked to multiple types of human cancer due to its frequent zzso However, the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso and its function independent of nuclear receptors remain to be zzso We demonstrate here that zzso is required for both normal and zzso human cells to effectively enter S zzso zzso zzso depletion and zzso zzso zzso show that zzso zzso directly controls the expression of genes important for initiation of DNA zzso which include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, consistent with its critical role in cell cycle control, zzso expression appears to be cell cycle zzso which involves zzso Interestingly, zzso is recruited to its own promoter at the zzso transition and activates its own zzso suggesting a positive feedback mechanism for zzso action in the control of cell cycle progression and for its zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso of zzso alone zzso human zzso zzso cells, which requires its association with zzso These findings reveal a novel role for zzso in cell cycle control and support the notion that the ability of zzso zzso to zzso the cell cycle through zzso zzso its zzso in human zzso
