zzso natural zzso cell zzso zzso is associated with the zzso virus and has distinct zzso features, such as zzso and zzso zzso infiltrates that contain too many cell types, including tumor and inflammatory zzso We have shown previously that zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso cells, and that soluble zzso zzso is significantly increased in patients' zzso However, the functional role of zzso remains zzso In this study, we found that zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso enhanced the growth of zzso cells in a zzso zzso In comparison, zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as the zzso blocker zzso caused a zzso reduction in the number of viable zzso zzso Double zzso zzso of zzso zzso confirmed that zzso positive zzso cells zzso zzso Moreover, serum zzso levels in zzso patients decreased after treatment, suggesting that the levels reflected disease zzso We conclude that zzso cells zzso zzso that acts as an zzso factor for zzso zzso and suggest that zzso could be a potential candidate to treat zzso
