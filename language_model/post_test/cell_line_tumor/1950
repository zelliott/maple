In this study, the effect of zzso and zzso zzso a standard zzso zzso inhibitor zzso toward the growth of pancreatic cancer cell lines was zzso Thus, we examined for the first time, the zzso family gene expression levels before and after drug zzso 

Several human pancreatic cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso and a normal human pancreatic duct immortalized zzso cell line zzso were used as target zzso The cell growth was measured by zzso zzso cell cycle zzso membrane zzso exposure, DNA zzso zzso membrane potential loss, zzso and Western blots were done using standard zzso The effect of drugs on tumor growth in zzso was studied using subcutaneous zzso zzso 

Except in the case of certain zzso zzso cell line couples: zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells or zzso zzso zzso there were no major significant changes of zzso genes zzso in cells upon drug zzso However, significant variation in zzso and zzso protein expression levels could be seen among individual cell zzso The in zzso results showed that zzso zzso exhibited similar tumor reduction efficacy as the commercial drug zzso 

Our data demonstrate that zzso induced the death of pancreatic tumor cell by zzso In line with its in zzso activity, zzso achieved a significant reduction in tumor growth in zzso pancreatic tumor cell line subcutaneous zzso mouse zzso Furthermore, exploring the impact of zzso on zzso zzso genes expression revealed for the first time that some of them, depending on the cell line considered, seem to be regulated during zzso
