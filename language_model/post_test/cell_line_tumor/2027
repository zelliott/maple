zzso and insulin resistance are the major reasons for a higher prevalence of several cancer entities in type 2 diabetes zzso and zzso zzso exerts a zzso effect by reducing zzso and by a direct cellular zzso 

We investigated the effect of zzso on growth of differentiated human zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso cells, a zzso zzso zzso cell line, and zzso cancer stem zzso 

The zzso effect of zzso was studied in zzso cells derived from zzso and in zzso zzso cell lines by analysis of cell growth, cell cycle zzso and zzso Furthermore, the influence of zzso with insulin or with zzso agents on zzso growth zzso was investigated in zzso zzso cells, in a zzso zzso zzso cell line, and in derived zzso stem zzso 

zzso showed an zzso effect by zzso of cell cycle progression and induction of zzso In addition, zzso antagonized the zzso effect of insulin, inhibited zzso cell growth, reduced zzso cancer sphere formation, and zzso the zzso effect of zzso agents such as zzso and zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso was even found in a zzso zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso effect of zzso was, however, not restricted to differentiated zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso cells but was also demonstrated in zzso zzso cancer stem zzso 

zzso markedly diminished growth stimulation by insulin and showed an additive zzso effect to zzso zzso zzso our results suggest this drug as zzso treatment for zzso cancer in type 2 diabetic zzso
