zzso are exposed to a mixture of dietary zzso with a variety of potential beneficial and harmful zzso zzso are zzso zzso acting both at zzso level and by interfering with steroid hormone zzso Due to a high dietary intake and the potential to cause mixture effects, assessment of combined exposure of zzso is zzso We have studied effects on zzso zzso testosterone and zzso zzso of the individual zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso and the mixture of the three zzso in human zzso zzso zzso The most vulnerable targets of the zzso were the zzso of cortisol and testosterone, which were inhibited by zzso and zzso with zzso values below 1 zzso An zzso mixture of the zzso caused zzso of zzso zzso and testosterone zzso in an additive zzso The observed mixture effect was described well by both concentration addition zzso and independent action zzso prediction zzso Both prediction models underestimated the effect on zzso zzso We conclude that the three zzso exhibit specific effects on steroid hormone zzso A mixture of the zzso caused additive effects emphasizing the need to assess zzso together as a zzso The prediction models are valuable tools for mixture zzso
