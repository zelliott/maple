zzso protein zzso like 1 zzso is a member of the zzso zzso protein zzso family, and it is an important zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the role of zzso in gastric zzso zzso expression pattern of zzso in gastric cancer zzso and cell lines was found in protein and zzso levels, although there was no statistically significant relationship between zzso and zzso zzso Restored expression of zzso induced by DNA zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso A zzso implied that zzso expression is regulated by zzso zzso The biological role of zzso in gastric zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso showed suppression of cell proliferation due to cell zzso zzso enforced expression of zzso zzso significantly the gastric cancer cell transformation zzso These findings demonstrated that decreased zzso expression is a characteristic of gastric cancer and regulated by zzso zzso zzso may be a functional tumor zzso involved in gastric zzso This study provides novel insights into the biological role of zzso in gastric zzso
