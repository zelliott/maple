The zzso system, composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exerts a wide range of activities in cellular zzso control, zzso function, cell zzso and zzso Recently, the zzso zzso zzso zzso has emerged as a new target for zzso drug development because zzso and zzso are zzso in many aggressive tumors and the tumor cells seem to be more dependent on zzso system than normal zzso Here we have investigated the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso which have been presumed to be cancer zzso agents because of their zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to have strong zzso effects on zzso zzso with zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso was shown to be zzso zzso and time dependent and involved an attack on the reduced zzso zzso active site of zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced the zzso effect whereas zzso conditions attenuated zzso zzso analysis suggested that the zzso might perform their zzso effects via zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso had the potential to inhibit the growth of zzso cells with the same potency as zzso of zzso zzso activity in the cell zzso was reduced on treatment with zzso zzso zzso which coincided with the zzso of zzso The cell cycle was arrested in S phase by zzso and an zzso of cells in zzso was observed in response to zzso Thus, the zzso activity of zzso and zzso may be due to zzso of zzso consequently inducing cell zzso
