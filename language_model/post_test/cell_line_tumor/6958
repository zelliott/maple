Studies have indicated the role of zzso zzso zzso factor 1) in zzso the zzso of some zzso shock zzso zzso zzso factor 1) was an inhibitor of zzso protein with the effect of zzso the zzso role of zzso zzso expression was lower in gastrointestinal zzso than in normal zzso with the mechanism zzso Here we showed that gastrointestinal cancer zzso expressed higher levels of zzso than matched normal zzso The expression of zzso and zzso was zzso correlated in gastrointestinal cancer cell zzso Stress zzso including heat, zzso and zzso significantly suppressed the expression of zzso whereas the zzso of zzso expression zzso correlated with zzso zzso We cloned varying lengths of the zzso region of the zzso gene into zzso reporter zzso and we evaluated their promoter zzso A zzso zzso was found between the zzso and zzso region that was rich in zzso elements (where zzso indicates G, A, zzso or zzso A high affinity and functional zzso element within the zzso region was determined by zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso zzso by either zzso zzso or an zzso zzso zzso restored the promoter activity of the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso with antioxidants suppressed zzso binding activity and increased the zzso activity and expression of zzso These findings suggested that zzso stress pressure in cancer cells sustained the high level expression of zzso and subsequently suppressed zzso zzso implicating the zzso effect of two zzso protein families, zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso under stress zzso
