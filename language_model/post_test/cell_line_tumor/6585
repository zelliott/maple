zzso zzso zzso is an aggressive zzso resistant to standard treatment zzso Previously, we have reported that zzso zzso protein zzso contributes to the zzso transformation of zzso In this study, we zzso a recently established zzso model of PC to determine if molecular targeting of zzso can serve as the basis for a novel PC zzso In a subcutaneous tumor model, zzso administration of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso tumor zzso Furthermore, in a zzso tumor model, systemic administration of zzso resulted in a significant decrease in the number of zzso zzso and increased survival zzso We assessed the efficiency of in zzso delivery and observed significant levels of zzso zzso in zzso containing PC, as well as a bystander effect that was amplifying the efficacy of zzso gene zzso This bystander effect was also active in zzso and was shown to be at least partially independent of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso gene therapy is an effective novel therapy for PC and that the zzso efficacy is dependent on both direct and bystander zzso
