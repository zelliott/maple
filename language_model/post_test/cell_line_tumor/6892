zzso 8 is a key zzso factor in the zzso zzso zzso Absent zzso 8 expression is shown to correlate with poor prognosis in zzso Paradoxically, the zzso 8 gene can produce as zzso zzso and novel inhibitor of zzso zzso The presence of zzso 8 alone in tumors may not necessarily portend a good zzso We sought to determine whether zzso zzso is present in zzso and whether zzso of this protein could inhibit zzso zzso zzso Six of 6 zzso zzso and 2 of 5 differentiated zzso tumors expressed the zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso was absent in 3 of 3 zzso Seven human zzso cell lines were zzso Two of the 5 cell lines that expressed zzso 8 also expressed the zzso zzso zzso and both were of a less differentiated zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in cell lines afforded protection against zzso but not against zzso induced zzso zzso blockade of zzso zzso in cells that express this zzso zzso made them more sensitive to zzso induced cell zzso We demonstrate the zzso zzso zzso is present in zzso and appears to be associated with zzso cell lines and zzso Furthermore, it suppresses zzso zzso zzso
