A series of new zzso zzso derivatives of the type zzso zzso 1; zzso 2; zzso 3) were prepared in high yield by addition of the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso to the coordinated zzso zzso in zzso The solution zzso of 1-3 has been studied in zzso zzso 400 zzso zzso and zzso 500 zzso zzso zzso The zzso complexes 1-3 were evaluated for their zzso properties against a panel of human tumor cell lines containing examples of zzso zzso breast zzso lung zzso and colon zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso complexes were tested for their zzso against normal human zzso zzso For comparison purposes, the zzso of zzso was examined under the same experimental zzso The results obtained showed that zzso and zzso behave as good zzso to carry out biological zzso with platinum complexes which are zzso and unstable in zzso zzso 2 and 3 exhibited a biological activity comparable to that of zzso
