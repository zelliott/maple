zzso development of zzso drugs for cancer therapy is zzso zzso monitoring of zzso zzso can help clinicians determine the effectiveness of zzso zzso Blood oxygen level dependent zzso effect has been widely used for functional imaging and zzso zzso zzso In this study, the zzso effect is investigated under different levels of oxygen inhalation for the development of a novel zzso zzso technique, blood oxygen level dependent zzso zzso Under short-term zzso zzso generalized zzso induced by inhalation of zzso zzso we measure zzso contrast as high as zzso from vessels at zzso using a simple zzso echo zzso pulse zzso This produces high-resolution zzso and zzso maps of normal and zzso brain zzso in less than 10 zzso Additionally, this technique reliably detects zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso provides a sensitive research tool for zzso of zzso under normal and pathological zzso Thus, it may be applied as a simple monitoring technique for measuring the effectiveness of zzso drugs in a zzso zzso
