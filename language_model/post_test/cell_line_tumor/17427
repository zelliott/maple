zzso zzso a zzso H zzso zzso the zzso step in zzso zzso Two zzso of zzso have been zzso zzso and zzso We examined the expression of zzso and zzso in zzso normal zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso 

The expression of zzso and zzso in 80 surgically removed zzso due to zzso as well as in 5 human zzso SCC cell lines was zzso using zzso and Western zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso were zzso expressed in the SCC cell zzso Higher zzso expression was noted in 31 zzso of the 74 specimens of normal zzso in none of the 40 specimens of zzso zzso and in 15 zzso of the 80 specimens of zzso the frequency being significantly higher in normal zzso than in zzso or SCC zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly higher in zzso SCC than in moderately or poorly differentiated SCC zzso zzso zzso Higher zzso expression was noted in none zzso of the specimens of normal zzso in 12 zzso of the specimens of zzso zzso and in 41 zzso of the zzso of zzso the frequency being significantly higher in SCC than in normal zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is expressed in normal zzso zzso and is occasionally induced in zzso zzso whereas zzso expression is more characteristic of zzso and zzso than of normal zzso zzso a possible association with cell differentiation in the former, and zzso zzso in the zzso
