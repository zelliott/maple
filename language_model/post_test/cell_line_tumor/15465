zzso formation is the first step that precedes cell movement of zzso zzso zzso control of zzso zzso is necessary to achieve directional zzso during cell zzso Here we show that the spatial coordinators zzso and zzso regulate zzso zzso during leading edge zzso by regulating the zzso barbed end distribution and zzso The distribution of zzso activity and proper balance of zzso zzso achieved by zzso and zzso determines the direction of final zzso zzso These findings provide a new insight into the dynamic plasticity in the zzso and distribution of barbed ends, which can be modulated by zzso zzso activity by upstream zzso and zzso for directed cell zzso
