Recent studies have identified the existence a portion of cancer cells, called zzso stem zzso within the entire cancer zzso Cancer stem cells harbor highly zzso and zzso zzso which lead to recurrence or zzso of the tumor after zzso The mechanisms that regulate the zzso of cancer cells remain largely zzso We hypothesized that zzso a zinc zzso regulates the zzso in pancreatic cancer zzso 

We established two stable zzso pancreatic cancer cell lines in which zzso expression was knocked down by the introduction of zzso against zzso zzso of cancer stem zzso molecules was examined by quantitative real-time zzso zzso of zzso cassette zzso G member 2 was also determined by flow zzso zzso culture was performed in zzso coated zzso Cell migration was determined by using a modified zzso migration zzso In zzso tumor formation was assessed in nude mice after the subcutaneous injection of cancer zzso The zzso zzso zzso was used to identify zzso expressed zzso 

zzso of zzso expression resulted in zzso decreased expression of cancer stem zzso molecules such as zzso and zzso cassette zzso G member 2, zzso decreased zzso ability, zzso decreased migration, zzso decreased zzso of tumor formation in nude mice, and zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso might act as a novel regulator of zzso in pancreatic cancer zzso
