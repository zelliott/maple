Previously, we have reported frequent zzso of the expression of zzso by genetic and zzso mechanisms in zzso zzso cell zzso As the same events might be involved in the zzso of zzso we examined zzso zzso zzso expression levels, and zzso status in the zzso island of this zzso zzso deletion was detected in only 1 of 18 zzso zzso lines, whereas the expression of zzso zzso was silenced in 8 of 17 zzso zzso lines without zzso zzso An inverse correlation between zzso expression and zzso status of the zzso zzso island was clearly observed in zzso lines, and zzso zzso expression was restored by treatment with zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoter was also observed in primary zzso Taken together, the results suggested that frequent zzso of zzso mainly occurs by means of zzso mechanisms in zzso which might play an important role in oral zzso
