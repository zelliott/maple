Cancer stem cells are implicated in resistance to zzso radiation zzso and zzso zzso a zzso compound has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for treating various zzso In this study, we determined the ability of zzso to enhance the sensitivity of colon cancer stem cells to zzso The combination of zzso and zzso suppressed proliferation and colony formation while inducing zzso of colon cancer cells in zzso There were also reduced numbers and size of zzso which was coupled with reduced expression of cancer stem cell marker protein zzso zzso zzso studies confirmed that the zzso combination reduced the number of zzso zzso In addition, there were reduced levels of activated zzso its zzso zzso and the downstream target gene zzso Furthermore, expression of components of the zzso zzso zzso complex, zzso 1, zzso zzso and zzso was also zzso On the other hand, the zzso effects were zzso when the zzso zzso domain was zzso To determine the effect of zzso combination on tumor growth in zzso nude mice tumor zzso were administered zzso zzso and exposed to zzso The zzso combination significantly inhibited tumor zzso zzso In addition, there were reduced levels of zzso and the zzso zzso proteins in the zzso zzso Together, these data suggest that zzso is a potent inhibitor of colon cancer growth that targets the stem cells by zzso the zzso complex and the zzso signaling zzso These studies warrant further clinical evaluation for the combination of zzso and zzso for treating colon zzso
