To study the effect of zzso on zzso 

The zzso effect was evaluated by zzso zzso for proliferation of zzso zzso The concentration of vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso growth factor zzso from human zzso zzso zzso cells were detected by zzso linked zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was conducted to detect the expression of zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso in the cancer cells were examined by flow zzso The zzso effect of zzso on the growth of human zzso zzso zzso in nude mice was zzso 

zzso was shown to inhibit the proliferation of primary cultured bovine zzso zzso cells in a concentration dependent manner in range of zzso - zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso value was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown that treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso resulted in an zzso of zzso production released by zzso and the zzso rate was zzso zzso and zzso zzso After exposure to zzso zzso of zzso a decrease in the expression and activity of zzso and zzso was observed by zzso zzso The concentration of zzso and zzso zzso by zzso cells were lower following zzso treatment as shown by flow zzso Treatment with zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso the zzso rates were zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso and zzso for zzso zzso The zzso rate of zzso to the growth of the transplant tumor in nude mice were zzso zzso and zzso respectively at the dose of 100 zzso 150 zzso and 200 zzso 

zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso and zzso expression and production in human zzso zzso zzso cell, and may be a promising zzso zzso
