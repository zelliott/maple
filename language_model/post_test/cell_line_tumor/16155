zzso abnormal DNA zzso represents a zzso relevant strategy for cancer treatment as demonstrated by the US Food and Drug Administration approval of the DNA zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso But their use is associated with increased zzso of bone zzso zzso zzso zzso has emerged as a potential DNA zzso agent for clinical zzso While zzso is much safer than zzso it requires high zzso to be effective in DNA zzso in suppressing cancer cell zzso Thus, our laboratories have embarked on the pharmacological exploitation of zzso to develop potent DNA zzso zzso through lead zzso 

We report the use of a DNA zzso zzso enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter system as a screening platform to identify novel DNA zzso zzso from a compound library containing zzso zzso 

A lead agent zzso which exhibits substantially higher potency in zzso DNA zzso with lower zzso in zzso cells relative to zzso and zzso was identified by the screening zzso 

Our data provide a zzso that zzso could be zzso exploited to develop novel DNA zzso zzso of which the zzso potential in cancer zzso is currently under zzso
