Despite the advances in the detection and treatment of lung cancer, the overall zzso survival is only zzso zzso evidence suggests that zzso a calcium channel zzso is a potential zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso is a key therapeutic target in many types of cancer, whereas zzso is a putative zzso zzso zzso In this study, the effect of zzso on the expression of zzso and zzso in zzso human lung cancer cells was investigated by quantitative real-time reverse zzso reaction and zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso was also determined in lung cancer zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso expression at both the zzso and protein levels in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso also significantly increased the protein levels of zzso in these cells zzso zzso zzso although the zzso levels of zzso were not changed after zzso zzso Furthermore, the expression of zzso in human lung cancer zzso was significantly higher than in normal lung zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the expression of zzso was not different between lung cancer and normal zzso Our data suggest that zzso may regulate the expression of zzso and zzso in lung cancer cells by zzso and zzso levels, zzso zzso may be a promising therapeutic molecular target for lung cancer treatment using zzso and/or zzso zzso
