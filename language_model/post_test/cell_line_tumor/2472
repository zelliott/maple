Recent studies in zzso zzso zzso have demonstrated their potential as gene carriers with high zzso efficiency and low zzso in the in zzso settings to deliver drug, zzso and zzso zzso Yet their safety and efficacy in zzso remain to be a challenge, and require further zzso In our previous work, zzso was zzso as a novel zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso segment on zzso which displayed higher zzso efficiency than zzso in a number of cell lines in zzso Here, we reported the favorable zzso displayed by zzso complex both in zzso and in zzso Furthermore, when therapeutic gene zzso was zzso to zzso and administered zzso to a zzso zzso model, significant tumor zzso was induced with concurrent tumor growth zzso indicating that zzso zzso expression of zzso gene in solid tumors with not zzso side effects on the zzso zzso These data demonstrated that zzso warrants further investigation as a promising cancer gene delivery zzso
