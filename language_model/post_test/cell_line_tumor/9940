Virtually all of the zzso human zzso are stored as inactive zzso and are strictly zzso We report the identification and characterization of the first small molecules that directly activate zzso the zzso zzso and zzso It is surprising that these compounds induce zzso zzso by stabilizing a zzso that is both more active and more susceptible to zzso zzso These zzso zzso bypass the normal upstream zzso signaling zzso and induce rapid zzso in a variety of cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses identified a cluster of zzso in zzso that resist zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso that induce gain of function are rare, and the zzso reported here will enable direct control of the executioner zzso in zzso and in cellular zzso More generally, these studies zzso the discovery of other zzso zzso to explore fundamental processes of zzso zzso and their zzso roles in zzso
