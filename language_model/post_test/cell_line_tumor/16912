The role of the E6 zzso from high-risk members of the zzso human zzso zzso in zzso cancer has been well zzso However, far less is known about the E6 protein from the zzso human zzso zzso zzso Some zzso potentially play a role in zzso skin cancer development, although they are not required for tumor zzso Instead, they may act as a zzso that enhances the zzso potential of zzso zzso Indeed, the E6 protein from certain zzso zzso 5 and 8) promotes the degradation of zzso a zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso damage zzso Here, we show that the expression of zzso 5 and 8 E6 increases zzso zzso persistence as well as the likelihood of a zzso induced double strand break zzso zzso we provide a mechanism for the increased DNA damage by showing that both extended zzso zzso persistence as well as elevated zzso levels are dependent on the ability of zzso 8 E6 to promote zzso zzso We further demonstrate that zzso 5 and 8 E6 expression reduces the zzso and protein levels of zzso a zzso zzso family member that plays a key role in zzso damage zzso but that these levels remain zzso in cells expressing a zzso zzso 8 E6 incapable of promoting zzso zzso We confirm that the degradation of zzso leads to a reduction in zzso protein levels, by showing that zzso levels rebound when a zzso zzso resistant to zzso 8 zzso degradation and zzso 8 E6 are zzso zzso we show that zzso protein levels are reduced when zzso is targeted for degradation by zzso Moreover, we show the reduced zzso levels in zzso 5 and 8 E6 expressing cells results in delayed zzso zzso and an attenuated ability of cells to zzso and as a result zzso zzso in response to zzso exposure, leading to significantly reduced cell cycle zzso In conclusion, these data demonstrate that zzso E6 expression can enhance the zzso potential of zzso exposure by promoting zzso degradation, resulting in a reduction in zzso levels, which leads to increased zzso zzso persistence and increased zzso induced zzso
