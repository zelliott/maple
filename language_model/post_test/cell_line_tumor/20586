zzso analysis of phase shift using zzso laser zzso zzso revealed that the laser phase shifts of primary normal human prostate zzso cells zzso and human zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso cells during the zzso phase were markedly higher than those in the zzso The phase shift of zzso cells during the zzso was markedly lower than that of zzso throughout the cell zzso In conclusion, it was proposed that adherent zzso cancer cells could be zzso zzso from normal adherent zzso by the zzso measurement of phase shift using zzso during zzso
