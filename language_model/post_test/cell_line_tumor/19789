zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein whose function and regulation is largely zzso Our previous results have shown that zzso zzso markedly affects zzso iron zzso in zzso zzso Using tumor zzso we examined the effects of zzso zzso on tumor iron metabolism and zzso The expression of zzso dramatically reduced implanted tumor growth in nude zzso zzso iron deposition in zzso tumors was directly observed by transmission electron zzso A zzso iron zzso zzso in zzso tumors was revealed by increased zzso activity of iron regulatory zzso and zzso both an increase in zzso zzso levels and a decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso also led to decreases in total cellular zzso content and zzso zzso zzso In addition, elevated zzso in tumors was also associated with a decrease in total zzso activity and lower zzso protein zzso In conclusion, our study shows that high zzso levels can significantly affect tumor iron zzso by zzso iron into zzso iron zzso resulted in partially deficient zzso and zzso cluster zzso It is likely that deprivation of iron in the zzso is the cause for the significant zzso of zzso tumor zzso
