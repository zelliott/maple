zzso regions harboring tumor zzso and zzso are often deleted or zzso zzso comparative zzso zzso detects zzso DNA copy number zzso in tumor DNA relative to a normal zzso The recent development of a bacterial artificial zzso zzso which spans the human zzso in a zzso path manner with zzso zzso has facilitated whole zzso profiling at an unprecedented zzso Using this technology, we zzso describe and compare the zzso of 28 commonly used zzso cell lung zzso zzso cell models, derived from 18 zzso zzso 9 zzso cell zzso and 1 large cell zzso Analysis at such resolution not only provided a detailed zzso zzso template for each of these model cell lines, but revealed novel regions of frequent zzso and zzso zzso a detailed analysis of zzso 7 identified 6 distinct regions of zzso across this zzso implicating the presence of multiple novel zzso zzso on this zzso As well, a comparison between the zzso and zzso cells revealed zzso common to both zzso such as the loss of zzso and gain of zzso in addition to multiple hotspots more frequently associated with only 1 zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso which is known to be amplified in both zzso showed 2 distinct regions of zzso 1 frequently altered in zzso and 1 more frequently altered in zzso In zzso our data demonstrate the unique information generated by high resolution analysis of zzso zzso and uncover the presence of genetic zzso prevalent in the different zzso zzso
