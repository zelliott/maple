Our group is developing a novel technology, zzso cancer imaging and therapy zzso that aims to zzso zzso compounds within solid tumors for zzso tumor detection and zzso In this approach, a zzso zzso zzso is zzso in zzso to a highly zzso compound by an zzso zzso zzso by tumor zzso We have zzso and characterized the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is readily zzso by alkaline zzso an zzso expressed by many tumor cell lines, to a zzso drug, zzso zzso In the course of our study, we discovered that ammonium zzso an intermediate in the zzso of the zzso exists as two zzso (3 and 4) whose zzso zzso respectively, to zzso and zzso These zzso have different in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 is not zzso by alkaline zzso zzso whereas 5 is highly soluble zzso in zzso solution and is rapidly zzso in the presence of zzso to 1, a zzso zzso zzso Mouse zzso studies indicate that zzso has high zzso in kidney and liver and zzso has very low zzso in all normal zzso zzso 3 and 6 are zzso respectively, to 4 and 5 after incubation in zzso The stability of 5 in human serum is zzso The minimum zzso concentration needed to zzso 5 is much greater than the zzso level in the blood of patients with cancer, and the latter should not affect the zzso of the zzso zzso of 5 with viable human and mouse zzso zzso not with normal human cells and mouse zzso to its zzso and the formation of large zzso of zzso We expect that 5 will also be zzso in zzso by tumor cells that express zzso activity zzso and anticipate the specific zzso of zzso 1 within tumor cell zzso This should lead to high zzso ratios and enable imaging zzso and zzso therapy of solid zzso
