The zzso zzso is an zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso and plays crucial roles in the organization of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso expression of this zzso zzso on tumor cells is associated with their invasive and zzso zzso In the present study, we analyzed the elements essential for zzso zzso gene expression in various tumor cell lines with different tissue origins by zzso zzso An approximately zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region of the mouse zzso zzso gene zzso relative to the major zzso start zzso showed strong promoter activity in all six examined tumor cell zzso However, we found that these cell lines could be divided into two groups according to the level of dependency on the putative zzso factor binding motif located at zzso This motif was previously shown to be crucial for zzso zzso expression in zzso gastric zzso zzso The gene expression in one group of cell lines was zzso mainly by the zzso zzso whereas that in the other group was less dependent on the zzso zzso We then zzso that additional regulatory elements were responsible for the expression of zzso zzso and found that a zzso motif at zzso was another important zzso An zzso mobility shift zzso using specific zzso and a Western zzso analysis of nuclear proteins revealed that the zzso factor bound to this zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso and zzso zzso factors zzso regulate zzso zzso gene expression and that the contribution of each element depends on the type of tumor zzso
