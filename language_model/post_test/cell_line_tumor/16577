zzso particles formed with zzso DNA zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated highly effective zzso ability compared to zzso block zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso used as an analog of zzso and zzso were prepared in this work aiming at maintaining adequate zzso efficiency while solving the stability issues of the zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso possessing a zzso zzso zzso linkage between the zzso zzso and the zzso block was used as a substitute for zzso during zzso complex formation to investigate whether the zzso ability of the zzso zzso system could be enhanced by triggered release of zzso zzso from the zzso The zzso complexes showed significant improvement in terms of stability against zzso zzso compared to zzso complexes, although the gene delivery ability dropped with the amount of zzso used for zzso By manipulating the difference in zzso potential between the zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso complexes achieved higher zzso compared to the zzso zzso moreover, the zzso zzso exhibited comparable stability to the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso complexes could provide satisfactory zzso efficiency without zzso the zzso stability of the zzso
