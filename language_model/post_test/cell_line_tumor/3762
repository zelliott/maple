The interaction between zzso cancer cells and zzso zzso zzso has a major role in cancer progression and eventually in zzso In zzso cancer zzso zzso are present in high zzso but their origin and functional interaction with zzso tumor cells has not been zzso In this study we observed strong zzso of the transforming growth zzso zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso accompanied by decreased signaling in zzso tumor zzso We evaluated the zzso response and the expression of target genes including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor zzso of various zzso zzso cell lines and primary zzso in zzso zzso stimulation caused high zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Next we showed that incubation of zzso with zzso medium zzso from zzso cancer cells led to zzso of the zzso signaling pathway, enhanced expression of target genes like zzso and the expression of zzso muscle zzso zzso We propose that the interaction of tumor cells with resident zzso results in zzso zzso signaling and subsequent zzso of the zzso into zzso zzso In turn this leads to cumulative production of zzso and zzso within the tumor zzso creating a zzso feedback zzso
