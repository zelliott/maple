The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the zzso zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in human pancreatic cancer cells was associated with accelerated cancer cell zzso 

In zzso zzso cells were zzso with the zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and growth of zzso cells was compared with that of zzso zzso and empty zzso zzso zzso expression was confirmed by zzso and zzso In zzso zzso nude mice bearing human zzso pancreatic zzso were treated for 28 days with either an zzso zzso specific to the zzso zzso the same zzso sequence arranged in a scrambled fashion zzso zzso or vehicle zzso 

In culture, zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso for the zzso zzso were reduced in cell number zzso compared with zzso and zzso cell cultures at 6 zzso this difference was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso zzso cells did not respond to zzso zzso with growth as did zzso zzso zzso of mice treated with the zzso zzso for zzso were zzso smaller in volume and zzso reduced in weight zzso zzso zzso compared with the control zzso 

These studies indicate that the zzso zzso is functional and plays a crucial role in growth of human pancreatic zzso
