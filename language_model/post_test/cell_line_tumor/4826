Potential mechanisms for the synergistic zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1 zzso in zzso human breast cancer cells were zzso The role of zzso was determined using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was visible following 24 h of combination treatment while flow zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso was zzso greater following 36 h of combination treatment compared to zzso The zzso appearance of cells in zzso did not correlate with zzso and thus was not considered to be a viable mechanism for the enhancement of zzso While zzso was a weak competitive inhibitor of zzso zzso activity zzso 95 zzso it did not alter the metabolism of zzso as the rate of disappearance of zzso from the media was the same for cells treated with either zzso or zzso + zzso Additionally, the metabolism of zzso was not shifted toward the production of active zzso zzso as neither zzso nor zzso zzso zzso were zzso toward zzso zzso In conclusion, the synergistic zzso zzso by the combination of zzso and zzso results from an earlier induction of zzso but this was not caused by an increase in zzso or zzso changes in the metabolism of zzso
