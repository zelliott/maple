zzso zzso zzso is a growing human health problem zzso Limited treatment and poor prognosis of this disease emphasize the importance in developing an effective zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been associated with zzso Although zzso zzso have been tested for zzso of colon cancer, it remains unknown whether these agents possess zzso effects as zzso The present study assessed the effects of a selective zzso zzso zzso on proliferation of human zzso cells in association with zzso zzso and the possible zzso In four tested human zzso cell lines, zzso of zzso was confirmed in zzso zzso and Chang liver cells, but not in zzso zzso zzso of 50 zzso M zzso resulted in both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, addition of 50 zzso M zzso to zzso zzso zzso cells resulted in only a mild reduction of cell zzso zzso with this, a zzso culture of zzso cells with 50 zzso M zzso caused a significant decrease of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the same zzso treatment showed only a mild suppression of zzso production in zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso suppression of zzso proliferation appears zzso by decreased zzso zzso zzso We also found that zzso zzso of zzso proliferation was associated with decreased zzso zzso zzso suggesting a reduced cell cycle progression in zzso zzso zzso treatment also enhanced the zzso rate in zzso expressing zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso Our findings confirmed an effective zzso effect of zzso on proliferation of zzso expressing human zzso cells through a decreased zzso activity that is associated with altered cell cycle progression and zzso zzso
