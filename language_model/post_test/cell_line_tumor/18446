Previously, we reported that zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso activity by stimulating the immune zzso In this study, we zzso zzso zzso from the soluble protein layer zzso of zzso zzso and determined their basic chemical zzso We also investigated the zzso and zzso activities of the zzso zzso zzso We found that intravenous zzso administration of zzso dramatically inhibited zzso of zzso zzso cells to the lung in a zzso zzso In zzso analysis showed zzso to enhance the proliferation of zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso which was followed by the production of various zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, the production of these zzso was partially blocked when zzso zzso was cultured with the zzso zzso against zzso The depletion of zzso cells by rabbit zzso zzso serum partly abolished the zzso effect of zzso on lung zzso of zzso zzso Using gel zzso zzso an active zzso zzso is isolated from zzso While both zzso and zzso zzso the zzso of zzso of normal mice, zzso showed higher zzso activity and more zzso zzso the proliferation of zzso compared to zzso These results suggest the use of zzso the zzso zzso from zzso zzso can be used as a zzso zzso to prevent or inhibit tumor zzso
