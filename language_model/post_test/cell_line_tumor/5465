The zzso zzso virus zzso zzso protein acts to overcome intrinsic cellular defenses that repress viral alpha gene zzso In that zzso viruses that have zzso in zzso zzso finger or are deleted for the gene are sensitive to zzso as they fail to direct degradation of zzso leukemia protein zzso a component of host nuclear domain zzso While zzso virus is also insensitive to zzso zzso its zzso zzso failed to degrade zzso A zzso virus with each coding region of the gene for zzso replaced with sequences zzso zzso was zzso This virus was compared to an zzso deletion zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso only zzso and not zzso and grew to higher zzso than its zzso zzso parental virus, but it was sensitive to zzso like the virus from which it was zzso This analysis permitted us to compare the activities of zzso and zzso in identical backgrounds and revealed distinct zzso roles for these zzso
