The modification of zzso zzso with side chains containing aromatic groups was found to lead to an increase of the stability of the complex with the zzso drug zzso zzso The formation zzso evaluated by zzso were several orders of magnitude larger than that of the unmodified zzso zzso For the CDs with aromatic zzso connected by zzso containing a zzso group, the formation zzso of the complexes at pH zzso and zzso were very zzso At lower zzso binding was much weaker as a result of zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso The drug was then released from the zzso zzso modeling of the zzso system revealed different possible interactions between zzso and zzso The observed pH dependence of the complex formation constant can be exploited for drug delivery to the targeted zzso The zzso of the zzso complexes and each of the complex components were tested by the zzso zzso on two cell lines, the human lung zzso and human cervical cancer cell zzso
