Complex zzso zzso are frequently observed in cancer but their impact on tumor molecular biology is largely zzso Recent studies have identified a new phenomenon involving the simultaneous generation of tens to hundreds of zzso zzso called zzso To understand the molecular consequences of these events, we zzso the zzso and zzso of two prostate tumors exhibiting evidence of zzso We identified several complex fusion zzso each containing sequence from three different zzso originating from different parts of the zzso One such zzso fusion transcript appeared to be expressed from a chain of small zzso zzso Furthermore, we detected zzso fusion transcripts in the prostate cancer cell line zzso suggesting they may represent a common zzso Finally in one tumor with zzso we identified multiple zzso in the zzso signaling pathway, expanding on recent work zzso zzso DNA damage response mechanisms with zzso Overall, our data show that zzso can manifest as zzso rearranged zzso The implication that zzso changes can give rise to zzso fusion transcripts is potentially of great significance to cancer zzso
