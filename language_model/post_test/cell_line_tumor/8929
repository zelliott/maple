Biological effects of man-made electromagnetic fields zzso have been studied so far by experimental approaches exposing animals and cell cultures to zzso However, the evidence for cell toxicity induced by zzso magnetic field zzso is still zzso We investigated the effects produced by the exposure of human zzso zzso cells to a uniform magnetic field at zzso of zzso zzso which is less than the recommended public exposure limits set by the International Commission on zzso zzso Protection zzso A decrease of membrane zzso potential up to zzso was measured after 24 h of exposure to zzso in zzso cells, and this effect was associated with zzso oxygen species production zzso zzso transform infrared zzso zzso analysis showed that exposure to a zzso magnetic intensity around zzso zzso changed the secondary structure of cellular proteins and zzso zzso The zzso bands relative to the zzso group increased significantly after 4 h of exposure, whereas further exposure up to 24 h produced evident shifts of zzso I and II modes and a relative increase in zzso contents with respect to zzso zzso Our study demonstrated that a moderate zzso causes zzso in cell zzso as indicated by zzso zzso observations of changes in protein structures that are part of cell response to magnetic field zzso
