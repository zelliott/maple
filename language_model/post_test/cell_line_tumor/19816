zzso human zzso infection is common and only a minor fraction of infected subjects develop progressing cervical zzso zzso or zzso zzso local immune responses is important for the development of cervical zzso In this work we determined the zzso pattern in samples from patients with cervical zzso Thus, we examined the local zzso expression profile of helper T cell type 1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cervical cancer zzso by reverse zzso chain zzso Our data indicate that zzso of the tumors expressed low levels of zzso zzso with all of them expressing higher zzso zzso zzso Most tumors expressed zzso zzso and zzso zzso and, most importantly, all of them expressed transforming growth factor zzso and zzso gamma zzso None of the tumors studied expressed zzso zzso or tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso analysis identified zzso only in tumor cells and zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso suggesting that zzso cells are those transformed by zzso We found a correlation between zzso for zzso protein and the level of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso from zzso cell cultures contained zzso and zzso zzso Our findings indicate a zzso expression of zzso zzso which might help zzso zzso immune responses in the zzso of the zzso This information may be useful for cervical cancer zzso or for therapeutic vaccine design against Human zzso
