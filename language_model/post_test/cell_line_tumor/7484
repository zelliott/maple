zzso zzso zzso as a permanent growth arrest can be induced by various zzso including zzso zzso zzso emerged as a promising strategy to overcome resistance zzso However, zzso cancer cells might regain proliferation activity in zzso or even zzso zzso zzso zzso successful exploitation of zzso in cancer treatment simultaneously requires the development of effective strategies to eliminate zzso cancer zzso zzso aims to selectively hit tumor cells, thus a combination with zzso drugs was zzso As a model, we chose zzso vaccine virus zzso which does not interfere with cellular zzso by zzso In different tumor cell types, such as zzso pancreatic and zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate efficient viral replication and zzso after zzso by zzso zzso or zzso zzso real time imaging, we even found an accelerated zzso of zzso cancer cells, supporting an enhanced viral replication with an increase in zzso and released infectious zzso zzso In zzso we show as a zzso that zzso tumor cells can be efficiently exploited as virus host cells by zzso zzso These observations open up a new field for zzso and clinical research to further investigate zzso and zzso viruses as an attractive zzso future treatment zzso
