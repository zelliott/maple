zzso zzso and zzso zzso loss of function is the most common genetic aberration in zzso zzso zzso In addition to its zzso role in cell zzso zzso is involved in the maintenance of zzso zzso Loss of zzso function causes defects in repair of DNA zzso breaks by zzso zzso and, therefore, zzso cells to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we determined the zzso status of eight zzso zzso zzso cell lines and correlated it with in zzso sensitivity to the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso cells showed a significantly greater sensitivity to zzso than the two zzso zzso zzso cell lines with zzso zzso The cell lines lacking zzso expression were unable to elicit a zzso zzso damage response as zzso by zzso focus function (a marker of competent zzso zzso DNA zzso upon zzso and treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells resulted in reduced zzso zzso formation after DNA damage and increased sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cell lines resulted in enhanced zzso zzso formation and in relative resistance to zzso Given that up to zzso of zzso zzso zzso lack zzso zzso our results suggest that zzso zzso may be zzso useful for a subset of zzso zzso zzso
