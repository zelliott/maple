Despite aggressive zzso therapy, most zzso patients zzso and survival rate remains zzso zzso of alternative therapeutic zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso revealing optical zzso in the zzso region, warrant their merits in zzso zzso In order to specifically target zzso zzso zzso on the surface of zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso zzso To examine the fate of zzso bound zzso after incubation with zzso cells, zzso B was labeled on zzso zzso zzso with and without zzso Our results illustrated that zzso zzso were extensively zzso by zzso cells via zzso zzso In addition, we showed that zzso bound zzso were not zzso by zzso cells without zzso zzso After zzso zzso zzso were incubated with zzso cells for 6 h and zzso by the cells, zzso zzso cells were further zzso with an zzso zzso zzso zzso laser with intensity ramping from zzso to 6 W zzso for 10 zzso which was then maintained at 6 W zzso for an additional 5 zzso zzso laser exposure, and after being examined by zzso zzso zzso cells were all found to undergo zzso while zzso expressing zzso cells all remained zzso Based on the in zzso study, zzso bound with zzso have the potential to be zzso as a therapeutic zzso zzso agent that generates heat sufficient to selectively kill zzso cells under zzso laser light zzso
