Despite functional evidence for zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso the zzso details pertaining to such process zzso zzso and sites of zzso zzso remain largely zzso To address these questions directly, we have zzso a previously zzso fluorescent folate zzso zzso zzso zzso that changes zzso from red to green upon zzso bond zzso Using this zzso we have observed that zzso zzso zzso occurs with a zzso of 6 h after zzso zzso zzso begins in zzso and does not depend significantly on zzso machinery located on the cell surface or within the zzso or the zzso apparatus, zzso occurs independently of zzso zzso trafficking along zzso and zzso yields products that are subsequently sorted into distinct zzso and zzso in different zzso Finally, zzso of folate and zzso receptors suggest that conclusions derived from this study may apply to other zzso zzso
