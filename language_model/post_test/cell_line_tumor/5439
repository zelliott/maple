Many important biological processes are controlled through zzso zzso including the colonization of zzso tumor cells and the control of differentiation of stem cells within their zzso Despite the crucial importance of the cellular environment in regulating cellular zzso in zzso methods for the study of such interactions are difficult and/or zzso 

We report on the development of an zzso method for distinguishing two cell types grown in zzso Furthermore, cells of one type that are in direct contact with cells of a second type zzso zzso can be analyzed separately from cells that are not within a single zzso Changes are evaluated using population statistics, which are useful in detecting subtle changes across two zzso We have used this system to characterize changes in the zzso prostate zzso cell line when grown in contact with human vascular zzso cells zzso We find that the expression and zzso of zzso is reduced in zzso cells when grown in direct contact with zzso zzso zzso signaling has been associated with reduced zzso or expression of zzso and zzso We find that zzso levels are also reduced in zzso cells grown in contact with zzso but we did not observe such a change in zzso zzso 

We find that the method described is statistically robust and can be adapted to a wide variety of studies where cell function or signaling are affected by zzso zzso zzso zzso a potential challenge to the method is its high level of sensitivity is capable of zzso events as statistically significant zzso to the high number cells evaluated zzso when the biological effect may be less zzso The methodology would be best used in conjunction with additional methods to evaluate the biological role of potentially subtle differences between zzso However, many important events, such as the establishment of a zzso zzso occur through rare but important changes, and methods such as we describe here can be used to identify and characterize the contribution of the environment to these zzso
