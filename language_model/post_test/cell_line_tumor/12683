zzso is a 90 zzso zzso zzso originally identified in zzso zzso cells, with a distribution restricted to zzso zzso and certain zzso In this paper, we first analyzed the expression of zzso zzso and protein in human fetal zzso zzso and human zzso zzso cell lines by zzso real-time zzso and Western zzso zzso The zzso zzso and three zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed highly variable zzso zzso levels and zzso Second, we showed that the expression of zzso zzso was zzso related to the zzso abilities to differentiate and zzso Then, we investigated the regulation of zzso zzso in zzso after zzso treatment and in mouse primary zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso but did not affect the expression of other important markers of differentiation such as zzso In addition, zzso zzso was zzso zzso in zzso by zzso Finally, the zzso of zzso and its partially zzso with collagen zzso zzso and protein was studied in mouse zzso and zzso zzso using in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, the present study provides novel observations related to the zzso distribution and regulation of zzso in bone cells and zzso zzso
