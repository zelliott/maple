zzso zzso zzso and zzso glass zzso zzso zzso zzso composite zzso were obtained on a strong zzso to improve zzso the mechanical strength and biological zzso zzso zzso and zzso mixed powder zzso were coated on the zzso zzso and subsequently heat-treated to obtain zzso and zzso composite zzso The effects of glass composition zzso zzso zzso zzso mixing ratio of glass to zzso zzso zzso 50% zzso and heat treatment temperature zzso degrees C, 900 degrees C, 1000 degrees zzso on the coating properties were zzso After heat treatment, additional calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso resulting in the formation of zzso calcium zzso zzso surrounded by a glass zzso The relative amounts of the zzso zzso varied with coating zzso The higher heat treatment temperature and glass amount, and the lower zzso content in the glass composition rendered the composite zzso to retain the higher amounts of zzso and zzso while the initial zzso zzso These appearance of additional zzso zzso and reduction of zzso amount were attributed to the combined effects, zzso the zzso of zzso and the reaction between glass liquid phase and zzso powder during zzso zzso As a result of the glass phase in the composite zzso their zzso became much denser when compared to the pure zzso zzso In particular, a completely dense structure was obtained at coating conditions with large amount of glass addition zzso zzso at the glass composition of lower zzso content zzso zzso zzso and the following heat treatment above 800 degrees C for zzso As a result, the zzso strengths of the composite coating layers were significantly improved when compared to the pure zzso zzso The highest strength of the composite coating was approximately 40 zzso an improvement of approximately zzso with respect to the pure zzso zzso The composite zzso showed much higher dissolution rates than the pure zzso coating due to the newly formed zzso zzso and zzso and the remaining glass zzso The zzso cells grew and spread actively on the composite coating zzso The proliferation numbers and alkaline zzso zzso activities of the cells on the composite zzso were improved by approximately zzso when compared to zzso control and zzso zzso and were comparable to the pure zzso zzso These findings suggested that the zzso and zzso zzso are potentially useful for hard tissue coating system, due to their zzso and mechanical integrity, enhanced zzso and favorable responses to the zzso zzso
