zzso is a member of the inhibitor of zzso protein zzso family, which has been implicated in zzso of zzso and control of zzso zzso The finding that zzso is zzso in most human tumors but absent in normal adult zzso has led to the proposal of zzso as a promising therapeutic target for zzso zzso We decided to evaluate the effects of a zzso strategy for zzso zzso in zzso human prostate cancer zzso We constructed a zzso zzso zzso expressing a zzso targeting the 3' end of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso within zzso zzso zzso zzso cell populations obtained by infection with the zzso zzso of two zzso human prostate cancer cell lines zzso and zzso were selected for the zzso zzso prostate cancer cells were characterized by a significant reduction of zzso expression compared to parental cells zzso with a control zzso the cells became zzso underwent zzso zzso and showed an altered pattern of gene zzso as detected by zzso array zzso zzso zzso also increased the zzso of prostate cancer cells to zzso zzso and prevented tumor formation when cells were zzso in zzso nude zzso These findings suggest that manipulation of the zzso zzso zzso may provide a novel approach for the treatment of zzso prostate zzso
