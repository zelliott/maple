zzso zzso has been used as an effective zzso drug for a long zzso zzso it is accepted that zzso and zzso acid are transported by folate receptors zzso in zzso cells, but the exact mechanism of zzso zzso in human leukemia is zzso The objective of this study was to investigate different transport systems for zzso and zzso and to delineate their zzso mechanism in zzso zzso zzso leukemia cells and normal human T zzso In zzso zzso of zzso was higher than zzso similar to that of zzso zzso and normal T zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso was maximum at pH zzso whereas zzso zzso was maximum at pH zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was significantly inhibited by zzso suggesting zzso transport zzso zzso zzso was found to be energy dependent whereas zzso zzso was energy zzso zzso and zzso results demonstrated the presence of reduced folate carrier as well as zzso coupled folate zzso and absence of zzso in zzso and normal T zzso These data suggest the existence of two separate and independent zzso transport systems for the zzso of zzso and zzso in normal and zzso human T zzso
