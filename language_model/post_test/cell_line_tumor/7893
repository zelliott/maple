zzso and differentiation were assessed in a series of human colon zzso cell lines in response to a zzso extract derived from the red marine algae, zzso zzso The extract contains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso amounts of 72 trace zzso but essentially no organic zzso The red algae extract was as effective as zzso zzso alone in suppressing growth and inducing differentiation of colon zzso cells that are responsive to a zzso level of zzso zzso zzso However, with cells that are resistant to zzso alone, the extract was still able to reduce proliferation and stimulate zzso
