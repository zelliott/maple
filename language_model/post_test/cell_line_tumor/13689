Philadelphia zzso results of a zzso zzso between zzso 9 and zzso The zzso generates a zzso zzso which, depending on the precise location of the fusion causes chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso or acute zzso zzso ALL zzso The difference between zzso and zzso resides in the unique presence of the zzso domain in zzso zzso cells are not zzso but acquire spontaneous zzso upon zzso expression of either zzso or zzso Whereas zzso cells present typical zzso zzso zzso cells zzso appears dependent on rolling zzso Both zzso types are triggered by zzso in complex with zzso and dependent on zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso specific zzso zzso domain regulates the zzso mode by shifting zzso from a rolling type toward an zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso cells assemble zzso structures zzso as dense zzso dots containing the zzso zzso machinery and bestowed with zzso degradation zzso The formation of these structures is driven by the reduction of zzso activity associated with the loss of the zzso domain in zzso and zzso with an increase in zzso zzso Such zzso could also be obtained by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso formation in association with zzso zzso characterizes zzso zzso zzso The description of zzso in cells harboring the zzso zzso presents a novel feature of these highly invasive zzso cells and provides a novel therapeutic drug target to treat the zzso
