This study investigated the clinical significance of zzso protein expression in oral zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso its zzso significance in zzso zzso 

A total of 88 zzso cases were used to assess zzso zzso out of which 70 were for zzso and 18 paired tumors vs normal zzso were for Western zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells were used to assess the effects of zzso zzso for cell zzso zzso invasion, and protein zzso 

zzso of zzso protein was significantly zzso in zzso zzso compared with the normal zzso and zzso zzso was associated with advanced tumor clinical stages and zzso zzso zzso ex zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso inhibited zzso cell viability and invasion but induced zzso by regulating expression of the zzso zzso 

The data indicated that zzso may play an important role in zzso zzso Further studies will investigate whether a target of zzso expression could be a novel therapeutic strategy for clinical control of zzso
