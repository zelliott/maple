zzso D1 zzso is a common feature of many human zzso zzso deletion analysis has demonstrated a key role for zzso D1 in cellular zzso zzso and cellular zzso To investigate the mechanisms contributing to zzso D1 functions, we zzso zzso zzso complexes by affinity zzso and identified the zzso 2 zzso zzso C and zzso zzso zzso in zzso 2) protein by mass zzso The zzso 2, but not the related zzso 1 and 3, directly bound zzso zzso D1 zzso zzso at the zzso zzso and failed to bind zzso zzso the alternative zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso induced cellular migration and reduced cell spreading in zzso cells expressing zzso zzso In zzso zzso mouse embryonic zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso reduced the cell spreading to a polarized zzso zzso 2 had no effect on cellular migration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso restored the migratory ability of zzso zzso zzso which was further enhanced by knocking down zzso 2 with zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, regulates cell spreading and migration, which are dependent on zzso D1 zzso
