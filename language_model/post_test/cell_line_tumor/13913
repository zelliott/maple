The expression of specific zzso zzso may uniquely reflect the biological state of a cell because it reflects the integrated outcome of both zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we constructed a zzso array to examine approximately 1,500 zzso zzso from a panel of genes previously implicated in prostate cancer and identified a large number of cell zzso zzso zzso We also developed a novel zzso profiling strategy to simultaneously zzso changes in zzso and transcript zzso the results revealed extensive zzso between zzso and zzso in prostate cancer zzso Taking advantage of the ability of our technology to analyze zzso from zzso zzso zzso we derived a specific set of zzso zzso zzso for prostate cancer using independent panels of tissue samples for feature selection and zzso A number of zzso zzso switch events were further validated by laser capture zzso zzso changes in zzso stability and qualitative differences in zzso ratio may thus be combined to characterize zzso programs and signature zzso zzso may serve as unique zzso for tumor diagnosis and zzso
