zzso factor zzso tumor 1 zzso was originally identified as a tumor zzso for zzso zzso but it is also zzso in a variety of cancer cells, suggesting a potential zzso function of zzso It is important to understand molecular mechanisms underlying these dual functions of zzso in zzso In the current study, we report a synergistic role for signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso and zzso in tumor development, including zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso through its zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso When zzso is zzso expression of zzso enhances zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso increases the expression level of zzso target zzso including zzso D1 and zzso which results in an advantage of cell zzso Our results suggest that in the presence of activated zzso zzso promotes cell proliferation instead of suppressing cell zzso zzso zzso zzso to the nucleus and interacts with zzso in a variety of primary zzso tumor cells, raising the hypothesis that zzso and activated zzso in zzso tumor accelerate zzso
