The zzso of zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso and zzso is one mechanism by which cancer cells develop resistance towards zzso zzso the zzso of these four genes could zzso zzso cancer zzso cells towards zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso were inhibited using zzso one zzso or all four targets zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso After 24 zzso cells were treated with zzso C or zzso Treatment effects were zzso regarding cell zzso cell count and zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso as well as the simultaneous zzso of all four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells towards zzso C and zzso 

Since the contribution of one zzso gene to chemotherapy response can vary between zzso cell lines, the simultaneous zzso of multiple zzso of zzso might represent a more promising option for enhancing chemotherapy efficacy in zzso zzso
