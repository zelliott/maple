We have identified a novel class of zzso as potent and selective zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity, with zzso values in the zzso zzso These compounds inhibited the growth of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso human tumor cell lines in zzso Using zzso models of the same cell lines, we found that the compounds given orally inhibited in zzso tumor growth significantly compared with control zzso
