zzso is one of the most commonly used zzso agents for zzso zzso In this study, array comparative zzso zzso zzso was used to identify genes associated with zzso resistance in a human zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso cell line was derived by zzso selection using zzso The genetic aberrations of the zzso parental cell line and the zzso cells were analyzed using zzso zzso was used to detect the expression of the altered genes revealed by zzso The sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso was determined by using the zzso zzso zzso was detected using flow zzso and western zzso zzso The zzso 50 value of zzso in zzso cells was five times higher than its zzso 50 in zzso zzso The zzso cells lost at least one copy each of the zzso and zzso zzso and both zzso and zzso were zzso deleted in zzso zzso The zzso cells gained two to three copies of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was studied in 12 zzso cell lines, and expression was positively correlated with the zzso 50 of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso expression was also positively correlated with the zzso 50 of zzso in 91 clinical zzso zzso Additionally, treatment with zzso human zzso zzso enhanced zzso resistance and increased the relative growth rate of the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso induced by zzso could be inhibited by zzso In conclusion, our results suggest that zzso may play an important role in zzso resistance in zzso
