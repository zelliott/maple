Stem cells play a critical role in normal tissue zzso and zzso in these stem cells may give rise to zzso We zzso that melanoma develops from a zzso stem cell and therefore residual stem cell characteristics should be able to be identified in melanoma cell zzso We studied three zzso melanoma cell lines that exhibited multiple zzso forms in culture and demonstrated the capacity to zzso We used the ability to zzso zzso zzso zzso a technique known to enrich for stem cells in many zzso to segregate cell zzso The cells with the greatest ability to zzso the dye were zzso small in size, zzso had the capacity to give rise to larger cell forms, and zzso had the greatest ability to expand in zzso The small cells were found to have a decreased zzso rate and were less zzso Large zzso cells that appeared to be zzso were identified in zzso Treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso expanded the large cell population but the residual zzso capacity, both in zzso and in zzso remained concentrated in the smaller cell zzso zzso zzso patterns were variable and zzso zzso (a neural stem cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso favored the smaller cell population, while nerve growth factor zzso often labeled larger zzso zzso and zzso zzso remained intact after zzso zzso These findings are consistent with the behavior expected for a tumor based on stem cell zzso this finding has diagnostic and therapeutic implications for zzso zzso
