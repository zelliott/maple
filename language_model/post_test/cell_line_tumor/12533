zzso is an zzso agent that acts as a zzso II zzso however, it can also be activated by zzso to form DNA zzso zzso a zzso with terminal primary zzso groups in its side zzso forms zzso zzso with DNA more efficiently than zzso zzso modeling studies indicated that extension of the zzso region of zzso side arms would allow the terminal primary zzso greater flexibility and thus access to the zzso zzso on the opposite DNA zzso New derivatives based on the zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and these incorporated primary zzso groups as well as extended side zzso The stability of DNA zzso increased with increasing side chain length of the zzso A zzso zzso bearing extended side chains zzso formed the most stable zzso with zzso enhanced stability compared to zzso This finding is of great interest because zzso zzso zzso are expected to zzso zzso functions at all stages of the cell zzso
