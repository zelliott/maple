zzso delivery of zzso has demonstrated enhanced zzso zzso mainly through the mechanisms of both passive and active zzso zzso we report other than these zzso mechanisms, rationally designed zzso can efficiently deliver drugs to cancer stem cells zzso which in turn contributes significantly to the improved zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso gold zzso via a zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso bond mediate potent zzso delivery to breast zzso which reduces their zzso formation capacity and their cancer initiation activity, zzso marked enhancement in tumor growth zzso in zzso zzso The drug delivery zzso by the zzso also markedly zzso tumor growth during zzso stage by reducing breast zzso in tumors, while the therapy with zzso alone zzso evokes an enrichment of breast zzso Our findings suggest that with zzso drug delivery system, the conventional zzso agents are promising for cancer stem cell zzso
