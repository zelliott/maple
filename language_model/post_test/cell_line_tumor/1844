zzso to identify novel zzso markers for neuroendocrine zzso of the zzso the two-dimensional gel zzso method was used to analyze zzso zzso in patients with small cell lung zzso zzso and large cell neuroendocrine zzso zzso Several zzso were revealed and zzso zzso was detected only in zzso of zzso zzso Since Hu family proteins including zzso are well-known causes of zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso as well as zzso zzso and their proteins was studied in 11 lung cancer cell zzso The expression of zzso and zzso zzso and proteins was only detected in zzso and zzso zzso To validate the existence of zzso and zzso zzso we studied a large number of zzso including those from lung cancer patients employing dot zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected only in zzso cases with or without zzso and not in the zzso of zzso zzso The mechanism leading to different zzso and zzso zzso production between zzso and zzso is zzso however, the results from the present and previous studies suggest that zzso and zzso zzso are novel differential zzso markers for zzso from zzso
