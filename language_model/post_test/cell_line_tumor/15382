zzso zzso small zzso zzso that regulate gene expression zzso are involved in many complex cellular zzso Several zzso are zzso expressed in zzso zzso and play important roles in normal zzso but, when zzso zzso contribute to the abnormal proliferation and differentiation of zzso zzso Recently, we reported that a small subset of zzso is zzso expressed in acute zzso leukemia zzso blasts and is modulated by treatment with zzso acid zzso In particular, zzso blasts from zzso patients display lower levels of zzso zzso a member of the zzso family, than normal zzso and its expression increases after zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso in acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso We found that zzso expression of zzso promotes zzso differentiation of zzso cell lines and primary zzso Moreover, we identified zzso a well-known zzso protein whose zzso expression enhances zzso zzso as a novel zzso target that may contribute to the zzso zzso Together, these studies raise the possibility that zzso of the zzso zzso may have a therapeutic value in zzso
