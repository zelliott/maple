zzso zzso are prominent components of solid tumors and exhibit distinct zzso in different zzso We have recently found that tumors can alter the normal zzso process of zzso to trigger transient zzso of zzso but the underlying regulatory mechanisms are incompletely zzso Here, we showed that the protein expression of zzso factor zzso was markedly elevated in zzso zzso both in zzso and human tumors in zzso The expression of zzso protein correlated with zzso production in zzso zzso Moreover, we found that zzso expression was regulated at the zzso level and correlated with sustained reduction of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso is a potential target of zzso and zzso zzso confirmed that zzso translation is suppressed by zzso through interaction with the zzso of zzso zzso Further analysis showed that induction of zzso suppressed zzso protein expression as well as zzso production in zzso zzso an effect which could be zzso by zzso of zzso These results indicate that tumor environment causes a sustained reduction of zzso in zzso which in turn regulates the functional activities of zzso by releasing the zzso zzso of zzso factor zzso
