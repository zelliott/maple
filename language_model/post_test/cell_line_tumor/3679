The zzso zzso zzso zzso is frequently zzso in invasive breast cancer zzso Moreover, these zzso cells have unstable zzso zzso which zzso zzso from interacting with its zzso zzso which is anchored to the membrane of adjacent zzso This zzso is important because zzso binding causes zzso to transmit signals that zzso regulate tumor cell growth and survival, whereas the absence of zzso binding favors these same zzso In our present study, human zzso type 5 zzso zzso were engineered to express zzso of zzso These zzso were used to zzso zzso human breast cancer cells, or zzso human breast zzso cells providing matched zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso domain of human zzso attached to zzso portion of human zzso heavy zzso caused increased zzso zzso and turnover and consequently decreased tumor cell viability in soft zzso zzso zzso with this zzso infection of zzso cells with zzso prevented tumor formation in zzso zzso Furthermore, therapeutic modeling via zzso zzso revealed that zzso significantly inhibited subsequent tumor growth as compared to matched zzso These results suggest that targeting of zzso with zzso zzso may have therapeutic zzso
