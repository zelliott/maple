A characteristic of cancer cells is the generation of zzso from zzso in spite of adequate oxygen for zzso zzso This property - known as the zzso zzso or zzso zzso - contrasts with zzso zzso which is triggered in hypoxic normal zzso The Warburg effect is thought to provide a means for cancer cells to survive under conditions where oxygen is limited and to generate zzso necessary for cell zzso The shift from zzso zzso to zzso in response to zzso is zzso by the production of zzso factor zzso - a zzso factor family that stimulates the expression of proteins involved in zzso zzso and zzso We reported previously that elevated zzso D zzso activity in zzso and breast cancer cells is required for the expression of the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso We report here that the zzso zzso observed in human breast and zzso cancer cells is dependent on the elevated zzso zzso zzso the effect of zzso on the Warburg zzso was dependent on the zzso target of zzso complex 1 zzso in the breast cancer cells and on zzso in the zzso cancer zzso These data indicate that elevated zzso zzso which is common in human cancer cells, is critical for the zzso shift to zzso zzso
