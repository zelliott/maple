zzso zzso zzso extract zzso is used either alone or in combination with chemotherapy or zzso in the treatment of tumor zzso In this study the effects of zzso album zzso zzso zzso extract zzso zzso zzso and 6 zzso zzso in various doses were investigated in an in zzso model with tumor zzso three multiple myeloma zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and three B cell zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso None of the three B zzso cell lines and none of the three multiple myeloma cell lines produced zzso zzso spontaneously or after treatment with VA zzso zzso All three multiple myeloma cell lines expressed surface zzso and zzso the B cell zzso expressed only zzso zzso zzso extract markedly zzso the membrane expression of zzso and zzso in zzso (down to zzso and zzso and the expression of zzso in zzso (down to zzso There was a marked reduction of viable cells of zzso (down to zzso and zzso (down to 8 zzso at 100 zzso cells zzso There was a clear relationship between the zzso of proliferation and zzso the percentage reductions of the viable cells at 48 and 72 h were similar to those of proliferation at 24 and 48 zzso zzso This means that zzso the proliferation of the tumor cell is inhibited and then afterwards these cells die by zzso or zzso The zzso effect of VA zzso on the proliferation can be termed zzso on the survival zzso VA zzso was more effective in cells having a high proliferation rate than in those with a low proliferation zzso The effective dose range lay between 25 and 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for all zzso
