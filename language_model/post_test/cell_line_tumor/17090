The cellular zzso and retention of a new zzso zzso zzso compound, zzso zzso zzso by two human zzso cell lines, zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso which is an extremely zzso compound, was formulated into zzso and incubated with two human zzso tumor cell lines and one human normal zzso cell zzso The amount of zzso zzso by the cells was measured by high performance liquid zzso The effects of zzso concentration in the culture medium and the incubation time on the cellular zzso of zzso were zzso In addition, zzso zzso by tumor cells was examined in the presence and absence of zzso in the culture zzso It was found that the amount of zzso taken by the zzso cell lines was much more (up to 14 zzso than that by the normal zzso cell zzso The cellular zzso of zzso was related to the amount of zzso in the medium as well as the incubation zzso The cellular zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso cells after 16 h of incubation was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso The majority of zzso taken up in tumor cells was retained after the subsequent zzso In the presence of zzso the cellular zzso of zzso by zzso tumor cells was about four times as much as that in the absence of zzso In conclusion, the cellular zzso of zzso by zzso cells was about 14 times higher than by normal zzso zzso The zzso in zzso cells was up to 10 times higher than that required for successful cancer treatment and zzso was well retained in the tumor zzso zzso seemed to have an important role in the zzso zzso by zzso zzso
