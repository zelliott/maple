zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso gastric zzso cells has been zzso as one of the key mechanisms in the development of gastric zzso AID is zzso in the cells through nuclear factor zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso can zzso the expression of zzso zzso a zzso zzso is known for its zzso activity via zzso zzso zzso it was hypothesized that zzso might suppress AID zzso via zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso gastric zzso zzso 

zzso or zzso cells and zzso zzso strain zzso isolated from gastric cancer patient were used for zzso zzso zzso were zzso with or without zzso zzso of zzso zzso was determined by DNA fragmentation zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed to evaluate the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso chain reaction was employed to evaluate the expression of AID zzso zzso zzso was performed for the analysis of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso complex regulation with or without zzso 

The zzso of zzso zzso to gastric zzso cells was not inhibited by zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso with zzso concentration of zzso zzso the expression of AID induced by zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso also zzso the zzso expression of zzso Moreover, zzso zzso or zzso zzso has suppressed zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso AID expression in gastric zzso cells, probably via the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso can be considered as a potential zzso candidate against zzso zzso gastric zzso
