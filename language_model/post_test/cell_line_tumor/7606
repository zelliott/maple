The age of zzso flow zzso zzso is fast becoming a zzso One of the most exciting applications of zzso zzso zzso is zzso analysis using sampling volumes as small as 10 zzso while matching the zzso data collection of conventional flow zzso We outline several innovative protocols for analyzing zzso cell death and cell cycle zzso profile using a fully integrated zzso flow zzso system, zzso The first protocol describes the use of a new plasma zzso marker, zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso to track zzso zzso during programmed cell zzso Also outlined is the use of zzso zzso in conjunction with the zzso membrane zzso probe zzso to track dissipation of inner zzso zzso zzso Another protocol adds the ability to measure dissipation of zzso inner membrane potential zzso zzso zzso in relation to the cell cycle profile zzso zzso zzso in living zzso zzso Finally, we describe the combined use of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso probe to measure zzso zzso in relation to the cell cycle profile in living tumor zzso
