In this investigation, a zzso zzso zzso zzso was prepared by zzso human serum zzso zzso as a model protein and zzso block zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso From the zzso potential zzso the zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso charge conversion from neutral to positive when pH decreases from zzso to zzso It was envisioned that the zzso positively charged zzso zzso could enhance the protein delivery efficiency and, zzso target to the zzso zzso such as zzso tissue or zzso The zzso particle size and scattering intensity were also measured and showed zzso zzso particle zzso zzso the circular zzso zzso zzso confirmed that the secondary structure of zzso was unaffected during the pH changing zzso The in zzso zzso for the zzso zzso was evaluated on zzso cell lines and no obvious toxicity could be observed when the zzso concentration was below 200 zzso To assess the ability of this zzso positively charged zzso zzso as a vehicle for protein delivery to in zzso zzso zzso we zzso a disease rat model of cerebral zzso that produced an zzso tissue due to its zzso zzso The rat was zzso injected with the zzso zzso zzso zzso We found a gradual increase in zzso signals of the brain zzso area, indicating that the zzso positively charged zzso zzso zzso could be effective for targeting the zzso environment and diagnostic zzso
