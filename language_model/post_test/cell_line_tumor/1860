Three new zzso zzso complexes zzso zzso zzso and I) with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso from the reaction of zzso zzso with zzso in zzso zzso The complexes were characterized by zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Analysis zzso Crystal structures of the zzso zzso and its complexes 1-3 were determined with single crystal X-ray zzso zzso zzso 1-3 and zzso were evaluated for their in zzso zzso activity against zzso zzso and human breast zzso zzso tumor cell zzso zzso complexes 1-3 exhibit strong zzso activity against both cell lines zzso The higher such activity was found for 3 with zzso values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are 60 and 10 times respectively, stronger than that of zzso The influence of these complexes 1-3 and zzso upon the zzso zzso of zzso acid to zzso acid by the zzso zzso zzso was zzso and theoretically zzso The results were shown negligible zzso activity of 1-3 against zzso
