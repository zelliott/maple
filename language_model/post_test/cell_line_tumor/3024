zzso promotes zzso and zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso We investigated whether these effects are related to each other and to the impact of the zzso on zzso fluidity and zzso membrane zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso zzso with or without cholesterol, zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities were studied with an zzso zzso zzso fluidity was characterized with zzso zzso zzso and membrane affinity by equilibrium zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased the fluidity of zzso zzso to the same level as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso decreased the fluidity to lesser zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso increased the zzso membrane zzso While zzso cholesterol zzso enhanced the zzso zzso activity, none of the other constituents had a similar zzso In contrast, zzso stimulation of zzso zzso activity was not only enabled by cholesterol but also by zzso and zzso zzso had no zzso In conclusion, cholesterol exerts distinct effects on zzso and zzso zzso zzso The influence on zzso zzso activity is zzso while its effect on zzso zzso activity is unspecific and not related to its influence on membrane fluidity and on zzso membrane zzso
