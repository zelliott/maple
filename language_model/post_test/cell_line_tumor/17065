High expression of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso in breast zzso zzso a growth advantage to the tumor zzso The zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso has clinical activity in a wide range of tumor types, although the zzso by which it exerts its zzso activity effects remain zzso We analyzed the ability of zzso to induce zzso and/or zzso of proliferation in breast zzso cell lines, as well any association between this ability and the zzso activity of zzso and zzso two recently proposed markers of zzso zzso zzso survival, and zzso of zzso and zzso were evaluated in six human breast cancer cell lines expressing various levels of zzso and zzso and exposed to zzso zzso and zzso expression levels were determined using specific zzso zzso and zzso zzso The effects of zzso were independent of zzso expression levels, but were influenced by high zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced the rate of zzso incorporation in the four sensitive cell lines, while zzso was also induced in two of these cell zzso No correlation was found between the zzso or zzso effects of zzso and its ability to zzso zzso and zzso activity in the tumor cell zzso Our data suggest that the zzso activity of zzso is due to a zzso effect, and involves zzso induction in a subset of sensitive cells only, and that neither zzso nor zzso is a reliable marker of zzso zzso
