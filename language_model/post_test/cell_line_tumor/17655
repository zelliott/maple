zzso copper, and zinc complexes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and characterized by means of zzso zzso zzso and a zzso complex zzso were also characterized by X-ray zzso Biological studies, carried out in zzso on human zzso cell lines TOM 1 and zzso have shown that both zzso and some copper and zzso complexes are active in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibit DNA synthesis and act constantly with time between 0 and 72 zzso The cell cycle analysis has highlighted a reduction in the number of cells in phase S of about zzso The same compounds present only a precocious action on cell line zzso and therefore their activity is cell target zzso
