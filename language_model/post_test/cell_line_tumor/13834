zzso cancer remains the second leading cause of zzso death in the zzso zzso zzso infection, a major risk factor for gastric cancer, generates high levels of zzso oxygen species zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso a plasma zzso member and a major scavenger of zzso zzso the reduction of hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso by reduced zzso To study the expression and gene regulation of zzso we examined zzso gene expression in 9 gastric cancer cell lines, 108 primary gastric cancer samples and 45 normal gastric zzso adjacent to zzso using quantitative real-time zzso zzso or zzso of zzso was detected in 8 of 9 cancer cell lines, zzso zzso gastric zzso samples, as compared to zzso adjacent normal gastric samples ( zzso zzso of zzso promoter demonstrated DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso level determined by zzso zzso in 6 of 9 cancer cell lines and zzso of gastric cancer samples zzso zzso zzso We also detected a significant loss of DNA copy number of zzso in gastric zzso ( zzso Treatment of zzso and zzso cells with zzso zzso restored the zzso gene expression with a significant zzso of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso expression and zzso promoter zzso were significantly associated with gastric cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso We also observed zzso DNA copy number losses, and promoter zzso of zzso in approximately one-third of zzso normal gastric tissue samples, suggesting the presence of a field zzso in areas near tumor zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells reduced the capacity of cell migration, as measured by scratch wound healing zzso Taken together, the dysfunction of zzso in gastric cancer is zzso by genetic and zzso zzso suggesting impairment of mechanisms that regulate zzso and its possible involvement in gastric zzso and zzso
