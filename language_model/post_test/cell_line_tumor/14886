Recently, zzso has been extensively employed to increase the circulation time of zzso and enhance their zzso in tumor tissue via the enhanced zzso and retention zzso zzso however, zzso zzso zzso is zzso for the zzso of zzso by tumor cells because of its zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso zzso modified zzso were used to solve this zzso Before arrival at the tumor zzso zzso presents on the surface of zzso which is useful for passive zzso in tumor zzso Upon reaching the tumor zzso the zzso chain could be removed by a safe zzso zzso zzso zzso and thus, the zzso hindrance of zzso could be overcome zzso To further improve the zzso of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was attached to the zzso end of a shorter zzso zzso anchored to the surface of the zzso which could be zzso by zzso zzso during zzso upon arriving at tumor zzso zzso was removed and thus the zzso zzso zzso was exposed, and then zzso could mediate the zzso of the zzso with high zzso In this study, zzso zzso zzso was zzso via a zzso bridge, zzso was zzso by zzso reaction, and then zzso labeled zzso composed of zzso zzso and various amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were prepared, with particle size around 100 zzso and slightly negative zzso These zzso showed good stability in the presence of zzso zzso Their zzso by tumor cells zzso in zzso was assessed zzso and zzso zzso modified with zzso zzso and zzso zzso were regarded as the optimal zzso In this preparation, nearly no zzso could be observed before addition of zzso which meant zzso zzso during circulation could be avoided, while the zzso upon addition of zzso was 4 times as high as that in the absence of zzso For the zzso in zzso zzso loaded and zzso labeled zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso modified zzso were injected zzso into zzso tumor bearing zzso zzso laser scanning zzso zzso showed that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso modified zzso was much higher than that of zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso modified zzso in the presence of zzso Thus, tumor targeted delivery could be achieved efficiently by the zzso drug delivery system developed here in a controlled zzso
