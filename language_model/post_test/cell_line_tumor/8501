zzso zzso zzso factor activity occurs in the vast majority of human tumors and has been solidly implicated in disturbances of cell cycle control, zzso and zzso zzso zzso regulatory activity is often caused by impairment of control through zzso function, but little is known about the interplay of other zzso with zzso Here we show that zzso zzso factor zzso resulting from disease driving zzso in Ewing zzso zzso and prostate cancer zzso are one such class of zzso We performed an zzso study of zzso zzso and zzso data in zzso expressing zzso and zzso containing PC zzso zzso by promoter activity and zzso zzso we demonstrate that a large fraction of zzso target genes are zzso zzso by these zzso zzso zzso We propose that the zzso effect of zzso fusion zzso is in part zzso by the disruptive effect of the zzso interaction on cell cycle zzso Additionally, a detailed analysis of the regulatory targets of the characteristic zzso fusion in zzso identifies two functionally distinct gene zzso While synergistic regulation in concert with zzso in the promoter of target genes has a generally zzso effect, zzso binding independent of zzso is predominantly associated with zzso differentiation zzso Thus, zzso appears to promote zzso by simultaneously promoting cell proliferation and zzso zzso
