zzso plays an important role in zzso of gastric zzso zzso has been reported to inhibit migration of gastric cancer zzso However, the role of zzso zzso in zzso cell migration and the potential of drugs targeting zzso zzso remains zzso We found that zzso activated zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells expressing zzso fusion protein with zzso resulted in generation of zzso zzso which provided direct evidence of zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso by zzso but not zzso blocked zzso of zzso and zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso inhibitor blocked the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso by zzso zzso increased after zzso stimulation and zzso protein inhibitor zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso of zzso Further studies demonstrated that zzso targeting the zzso zzso significantly blocked the zzso responses of zzso cells triggered by zzso which might be attributed primarily to zzso of zzso and related to prevention of zzso reorganization as well as zzso of active zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso and the expression of zzso which might form a positive feedback loop to further abolish upstream signaling leading to cell zzso Finally, we found cells expressing high levels of zzso were sensitive to zzso in its activity zzso migration as well as zzso In zzso we found that the zzso zzso played an important role in zzso cell migration and proposed that drugs targeting the zzso zzso may be used for the therapy of zzso gastric cancer expressing high levels of zzso
