zzso zzso zzso tumor cells zzso transplanted under the kidney capsule of zzso rats resulted in zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were isolated from these zzso zzso zzso and 106 cells were implanted under the kidney zzso zzso growth after this zzso could be traced within six zzso India ink was implanted to prove that there is a connection between the zzso vessels of the kidney capsule and the zzso zzso zzso The distribution of the zzso zzso in different zzso also provided evidence that the zzso zzso zzso are the primary sites of zzso tumor zzso zzso growth was followed after zzso sections of zzso of normal, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso embedded in zzso The progression of tumor formation was seen as a frontline between the healthy and tumor bearing zzso This zzso line was sharp at the beginning of the invasion and at the peripheral regions of the zzso while the central region infiltrated into the healthy kidney zzso The initial invasion gradually turned to an zzso resulting in the disruption of the zzso zzso especially at the zzso zzso of lipids and flow of blood to the zzso vessels was due to the lack of zzso leading to an increased pressure of the zzso zzso zzso damage ultimately led to the appearance of blood and the growth of tumor cells in zzso zzso zzso The kidney zzso zzso zzso complex is proposed as a suitable zzso model for the isolated in zzso examination of tumor development and for the analysis of secondary zzso
