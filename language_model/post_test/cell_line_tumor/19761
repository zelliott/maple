zzso zzso a zzso of zzso is a novel zzso and zzso drug candidate in phase I and II clinical trials for the treatment of a broad range of tumor zzso zzso binds to zzso at or near the zzso site and zzso the zzso of zzso in zzso suggesting that it may work by interfering with normal zzso zzso However, the role of zzso zzso in its zzso mechanism of action has been zzso To determine the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso arrest, we analyzed its effects on zzso zzso in zzso and its effects on dynamic instability both in zzso and in living zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited assembly of zzso zzso in a zzso manner, with zzso zzso zzso at 200 zzso zzso However, with zzso zzso zzso significantly higher zzso zzso were required to zzso zzso and zzso mass was reduced by only zzso at 500 zzso zzso In zzso dynamic instability was inhibited at lower zzso Specifically, 4 zzso zzso reduced the mean growth rate by zzso and zzso by zzso In living zzso zzso cells at the zzso for zzso arrest zzso zzso zzso significantly suppressed the mean zzso growth rate, duration and zzso and the overall zzso consistent with its effects in zzso and without any zzso zzso of zzso Taken together, the results suggest that the major mechanism of zzso arrest at the lowest effective zzso of zzso is suppression of zzso dynamics rather than zzso zzso per zzso
