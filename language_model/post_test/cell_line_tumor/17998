zzso one of the most commonly zzso genes in human zzso is thought to be associated with cancer zzso zzso screening and identifying natural or synthetic compounds with zzso activity via zzso zzso is one of the most challenging tasks for scientists in this zzso zzso zzso zzso is a small zzso synthetic zzso agent, with unknown zzso In this study we have demonstrated that the zzso activity of zzso is associated with zzso induction via zzso zzso We found that zzso of human colon cancer zzso cells with zzso inhibited zzso cell zzso growth in zzso and zzso in nude mice and also induced a cell zzso response, both in the cell culture model and in a zzso nude mouse zzso Further studies showed that zzso zzso was dramatically impaired in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, whereas the zzso of zzso or zzso did not show any zzso zzso The zzso zzso induction by zzso was confirmed in other colon cancer and zzso cell zzso In addition, our results showed an induction of zzso zzso and zzso c release from the zzso to the zzso in zzso cells, demonstrating that the compound zzso zzso through a zzso zzso zzso These studies provide a molecular basis for the therapeutic application of zzso against human zzso with zzso zzso
