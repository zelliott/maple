zzso zzso are small zzso zzso zzso the regulation of gene expression in various biological zzso including zzso Here, we screened putative associations between 34, 45, and 103 zzso and zzso zzso and 81 zzso via zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso experiments in a colon cancer cell zzso We used a combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso that were zzso with zzso or zzso were used for zzso parallel small zzso and zzso zzso The detected zzso and zzso were further associated with one another based on in zzso target zzso Analysis of the putative associations indicated that, although zzso and zzso shared a similar repertory of zzso the zzso possibly regulated by those zzso seemed zzso The zzso detected with zzso zzso were indicated to be frequently associated with genes having zzso cellular functions, regulated by a smaller number of zzso and appeared to receive more stringent zzso zzso In contrast, putative zzso associations detected with zzso zzso appeared to be related to signal zzso zzso which had a larger number of possible zzso binding zzso We then conducted a similar analysis using the colon cancer cells cultured under zzso and identified potential zzso zzso associations, which included several zzso zzso genes as novel putative zzso zzso
