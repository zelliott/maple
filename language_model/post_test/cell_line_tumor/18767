zzso interference zzso is a powerful new tool with which to perform zzso genetic screens in lower organisms and can greatly facilitate the identification of components of cellular zzso zzso In zzso cells, such screens have been hampered by a lack of suitable tools that can be used on a large zzso We and others have recently developed expression zzso to direct the synthesis of short hairpin zzso zzso that act as short interfering zzso zzso molecules to zzso suppress gene zzso Here we report the construction of a set of zzso zzso zzso zzso distinct zzso which target zzso different human genes for zzso We use this zzso library in human cells to identify one known and five new zzso of zzso proliferation zzso zzso of these genes zzso resistance to both zzso and zzso proliferation arrest, and zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we describe zzso zzso screens to rapidly identify individual zzso zzso associated with a specific zzso These new tools will greatly facilitate large-scale zzso genetic screens in zzso zzso
