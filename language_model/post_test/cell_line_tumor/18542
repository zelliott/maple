The zzso zzso of nuclear factor zzso zzso helps a variety of tumors to resist zzso and zzso them to chemotherapy, but the causes are still largely zzso We have zzso this phenomenon in eight zzso cell lines derived from human zzso cells, selected for zzso expression of a marker zzso and also in seven zzso cell zzso zzso media from all of these cells zzso the zzso of zzso (up to zzso in indicator cells carrying an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso factors as the cause of zzso zzso seems to be zzso The zzso zzso several different zzso and growth factors were greatly zzso in the tumor and zzso zzso The pattern of zzso was distinct in each cell line, indicating that the phenomenon is zzso Two zzso factors whose roles in the zzso zzso of zzso are not well defined were investigated further as pure zzso transforming growth factor zzso zzso and zzso growth factor 5 zzso were both highly expressed in some zzso clones and tumor cell lines, each activated zzso alone, and the combination was zzso Our data indicate that a group of different factors, expressed at zzso high levels, can contribute zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso in all of the zzso and tumor cell lines we zzso Since several zzso target genes zzso zzso proteins that induce zzso zzso zzso are likely to be zzso important in the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso We provide the first evidence of the general, complex, and synergistic zzso of zzso in tumor and zzso cell lines through the action of zzso factors and suggest that the same explanation is likely for the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso
