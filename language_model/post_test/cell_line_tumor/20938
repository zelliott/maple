zzso therapy zzso for cancer is a therapeutic zzso in the treatment of tumors in which visible light is used to activate a zzso Cell zzso have been identified as an important zzso target for zzso oxygen produced during the zzso zzso This study analyzed the zzso in specific cellular targets of a zzso used in zzso in zzso The zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso were studied on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were zzso with a zzso laser working at 670 zzso energy density of zzso zzso and power density of 45 zzso Fluorescence microscopic analysis of the zzso showed changes in membrane zzso After zzso treatment, the zzso and zzso zzso presented basic zzso in zzso The combined effect of zzso zzso and red light in the zzso cell line induced zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso filaments in the zzso
