zzso cells are zzso cells derived from the neural crest and are commonly used as models for studying neural zzso Mouse zzso zzso cells are derived from zzso tissue and provide a model for studying the zzso of neural zzso As growth hormone zzso has been implicated as an zzso or zzso involved in neural regulation and in the induction or progression of cancer, the possibility that zzso cells are sites of zzso production and zzso action was zzso Using zzso cultured zzso cells were found to express the mouse zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that both of the translated proteins zzso and its zzso were abundantly present in the zzso of these cells and their zzso was established by zzso zzso zzso action in these cells was determined in cells cultured for 72 h in the presence or absence of zzso M or zzso M mouse zzso which induced zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso In zzso the expression of zzso and its zzso in zzso responsive zzso zzso zzso cells suggests they provide a useful experimental model to assess zzso actions in neural function or neural zzso
