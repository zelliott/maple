Working with zzso mouse tumor models, we had previously demonstrated that vaccination with zzso tumor cells can protect against tumor challenge, an observation that supports the involvement of zzso in zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was shown to result from zzso zzso of the T zzso zzso immune zzso The protective effect is likely to be zzso by the interaction of tumor zzso zzso with zzso which then trigger the release of zzso recruitment of zzso cells, cell killing and tumor zzso zzso It was therefore of utmost importance to demonstrate the strict dependence of the protective effect on zzso zzso zzso First, the protective effect of zzso was confirmed in a zzso tumor model, in which zzso modified zzso zzso tumor cells proved to be an effective cellular zzso However, the protective effect was lost in zzso (but not in zzso knockout mice, showing the zzso interaction to be zzso Moreover, human zzso (not effective in zzso zzso had a protective effect in the humanized zzso mouse zzso zzso This finding suggests that the zzso effect of zzso could be exploited for human zzso
