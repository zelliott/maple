We recently showed that zzso withdrawal from the zzso high zzso breast zzso cells zzso reduced zzso protein levels while increasing zzso zzso and junction zzso Here we compared these cells with the zzso and low zzso zzso cells and with the normal zzso zzso cell line zzso not expressing zzso or zzso All cell lines expressed normal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso treatment increased zzso levels in both zzso and zzso cells and led to the formation of zzso zzso This treatment led to the zzso of junctions and zzso of zzso components to the zzso in zzso and zzso cells, while in zzso cells zzso proteins redistributed to zzso zzso treatment decreased zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso regardless of zzso zzso zzso was zzso in the zzso zzso cells while it was activated in zzso zzso Our data show that zzso and zzso zzso can induce growth zzso effects via the sustained zzso of signaling pathways that regulate cell survival, cell death and differentiation in the absence of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso may alter the functional interactions among these pathways in response to zzso which also may provide a potential explanation for the observation that zzso zzso tumors have a better zzso
