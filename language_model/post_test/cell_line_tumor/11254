zzso zzso zzso is one of the most effective agents in the treatment of acute zzso leukemia zzso but has no significant efficacy in other forms of zzso The mechanisms of relative resistance of zzso cells are not well zzso but emerging evidence suggests that zzso of negative feedback regulatory zzso and pathways contributes to such zzso We provide evidence that a signaling cascade involving the zzso zzso is engaged in a negative feedback manner during zzso of cells and exhibits regulatory effects on growth and survival of zzso cells in response to treatment with zzso Our data demonstrate that pharmacological zzso or molecular disruption of expression of zzso enhances zzso zzso and/or growth zzso of zzso zzso zzso combination of a pharmacological inhibitor of zzso and zzso results in enhanced suppression of primary zzso zzso zzso Altogether, our findings suggest an important regulatory role for zzso in the generation of the effects of zzso in zzso zzso They also raise the potential of zzso targeting in combination with zzso as a novel approach to promote zzso zzso
