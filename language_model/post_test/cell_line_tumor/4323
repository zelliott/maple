zzso of the zzso remains one of the most lethal human zzso The high mortality rates associated with this form of cancer are subsequent to late-stage clinical presentation and diagnosis, when surgery is rarely possible and of modest zzso zzso Survival rates following diagnosis with advanced pancreatic cancer are very zzso typical mortality rates of 50% are expected within 3 months of zzso However, zzso chemotherapy improves the prognosis of patients even after zzso surgery, and successful newer zzso zzso zzso have recently been zzso For patients whose zzso appear zzso chemotherapy remains the only zzso During the past two decades, the zzso analogue zzso has become the zzso chemotherapy for pancreatic zzso In this study, we aim to increase the delivery of zzso to pancreatic zzso by exploring the effect of zzso for zzso drug delivery of zzso in an zzso zzso mouse model of pancreatic zzso 

An zzso zzso mouse model of zzso expressing zzso zzso cells was developed, exhibiting disease development similar to human pancreatic zzso zzso two groups of mice were treated with zzso alone and zzso combined with zzso zzso mice were used as a control zzso A custom-made focused ultrasound zzso using clinically safe acoustic conditions in combination with zzso ultrasound contrast agent was used to induce zzso in the zzso region of the primary zzso zzso zzso disease development was measured using zzso imaging, and primary zzso development was measured using zzso zzso 

Following just two treatments combining zzso and zzso primary zzso volumes were significantly lower than control zzso Additional therapy dramatically inhibited primary zzso growth throughout the course of the disease, with median survival increases of up to zzso demonstrated in comparison to the control zzso 

Combined zzso and zzso therapy significantly zzso primary zzso development in an zzso zzso model of human pancreatic cancer, suggesting additional clinical benefits for patients treated with zzso in combination with zzso
