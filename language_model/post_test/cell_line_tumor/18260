We have previously demonstrated that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso resulted in increased zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, and that the regulatory zzso zzso of zzso was physically associated with the zzso Because there exists additional examples of zzso serving as negative regulators of multiple members of zzso protein zzso zzso pathways in zzso and zzso we hypothesized that zzso may serve a zzso function in zzso cells zzso the regulation of additional upstream zzso in the zzso zzso In human zzso zzso of zzso by zzso proceeds through the zzso zzso zzso zzso and, zzso the zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso Using the human zzso cell line zzso we show that pharmacological manipulation of the activity of zzso seemed to regulate not only zzso but also the upstream zzso zzso and zzso Using zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and bacterial zzso strategies, evidence for physical interactions between the structural zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso was zzso These studies suggest that the target of regulation by zzso includes upstream zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso seems to serve as a structural protein to foster zzso interactions zzso specificity of the regulation among members of this zzso zzso zzso
