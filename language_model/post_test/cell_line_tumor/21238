In the present study, we investigated the effects of zzso zzso zzso on cell cycle progression in zzso cells used as a model of zzso lung zzso zzso were treated with various zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso for 24, 48 or 72 zzso Cell proliferation was determined with zzso zzso and zzso index measurement and zzso was measured by flow zzso The results showed that zzso inhibited zzso cells proliferation in a zzso and zzso manner, and induced zzso in zzso zzso When zzso cells obtained by serum zzso were incubated with zzso zzso of zzso in the presence of zzso serum for several time zzso the disruption of cell cycle progression was zzso The zzso arrest was induced by zzso treatment at 16 h and the arrest maintained for 8 zzso Following the zzso arrest, zzso blocked the cells at S phase at 28 h and the S phase arrest maintained for at least 4 zzso And moreover, zzso inhibitor zzso was able to prolong the duration of zzso arrest induced by zzso zzso zzso of western zzso zzso revealed that cellular zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels decreased in zzso cells at both 20 and 28 zzso In addition, the decreasing of zzso A level and the increasing of zzso and zzso were also induced by zzso treatment at 20 zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso E and zzso proteins was not altered in zzso cells at both 20 and 28 zzso Our results indicate that zzso orderly zzso zzso and S phase arrest in zzso cells, the decreasing of zzso zzso and zzso A, and the increasing of zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso might be responsible for the zzso arrest, and the decreasing of zzso and zzso levels for the S phase zzso
