High zzso expression had been reported to have close association with zzso zzso zzso zzso of gastric zzso However, the zzso significance of highly expressing zzso in zzso of human gastric cancer and the role in the zzso remain zzso Our study examined zzso expression both in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the primary zzso zzso zzso zzso of gastric cancer, and compared the overall survival zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso expressing artificial zzso zzso was employed to zzso zzso expression in human zzso gastric cancer zzso Invasion zzso and migration zzso in zzso were conducted to determine the role of zzso in the zzso The role of zzso in the proliferation of zzso cells and tumor growth were also zzso We observed that high zzso expression was more frequently detected in the zzso than in the matched primary zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Furthermore, the overall survival rate of the patients with high expression of zzso in the zzso was significantly less than those with zzso expression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso can significantly reduce both invasion and migration zzso of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and significantly suppressed the proliferation of zzso cells and slowed down the tumor growth zzso zzso zzso It was concluded that high expression of zzso in the zzso had a negative impact on the prognosis of the patients, and plays important roles in zzso of gastric cancer and the tumor growth, which can be a potential therapeutic target and a zzso zzso
