zzso zzso zzso is an zzso neutral zzso that mediates zzso zzso zzso and promotes tumor zzso In this study, we examined the zzso of zzso gene expression in zzso lung zzso cells zzso with the inflammatory zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso levels were zzso following 16 hours of zzso stimulation and that this correlated with the expression of the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression with short hairpin zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso An established zzso element in the zzso promoter was found to be required for zzso and zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso showed that zzso binds to this promoter element zzso 16 hours after zzso zzso DNA affinity zzso studies showed that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso bind to the zzso zzso site in the zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso promoter, whereas zzso had no zzso zzso of zzso at zzso peaked at 16 hours in zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso inhibited this zzso and reduced zzso gene zzso These studies establish zzso as an important zzso of zzso gene zzso during inflammatory responses in lung cancer cells and highlight the different regulatory roles of zzso zzso
