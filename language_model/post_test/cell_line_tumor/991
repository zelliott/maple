We report in this paper that a novel small zzso zzso induced growth and differentiation of zzso zzso cells and improved zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso proliferation of zzso cells, a cell line highly sensitive to zzso zzso and exhibited full efficacy comparable to zzso with an approximate zzso zzso effective zzso value of zzso zzso whereas little proliferation was observed in a zzso cell line, zzso and human zzso cell line, zzso Signal zzso studies revealed that zzso induced zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso 5 zzso in zzso cells as well as zzso zzso increased the number of zzso marker, zzso and zzso cells in cultures of mouse and human bone zzso cells, respectively, and the zzso unit zzso in mouse bone zzso zzso In zzso experiments in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso mice demonstrated that zzso injected zzso at 30 zzso showed significantly higher zzso number at zzso and accelerated zzso recovery without affecting white blood cell zzso These data suggest that zzso is a novel zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso and in zzso with zzso zzso activities and that it is useful for the treatment of zzso
