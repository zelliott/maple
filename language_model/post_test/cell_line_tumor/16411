zzso and characterize the side population zzso cells with potency of stem cells from human gastric zzso cell line zzso 

SP and zzso cells were sorted from zzso cells by zzso cell sorting zzso using zzso zzso The zzso ability of the SP cells was assessed by in zzso transplantation into non-obese zzso combined zzso zzso 

SP cells were isolated from zzso cells in a proportion of zzso to zzso with respect to the whole cell zzso The colony formation zzso showed that the colony formation rate of the SP cells was significantly higher than that of the zzso cells zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The drug sensitivity test showed that the SP cells showed stronger drug resistance to zzso than the zzso zzso The in zzso transplantation of SP cells in mice showed that the tumor weight was zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly higher than that of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso g zzso zzso zzso 

The results of this study indicate the existence of cancer zzso SP cells in the human gastric cancer line zzso zzso Further characterization of this SP cell population may provide new insights for diagnosis and treatment of gastric zzso
