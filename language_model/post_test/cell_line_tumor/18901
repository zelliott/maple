zzso zzso induce fetal rat zzso and zzso zzso aromatic hydrocarbon zzso induction of this zzso in zzso and in isolated rat zzso To establish whether induction was due to zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso were tested in zzso zzso with zzso zzso Using a reporter construct containing approximately zzso zzso of the zzso region of the zzso leader zzso zzso zzso increased zzso activity 3- to zzso in cells zzso with an expression zzso for zzso zzso increased gene expression zzso but the presence of zzso only induced zzso expression by zzso suggesting interaction between zzso and the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was a partial zzso that increased, rather than zzso zzso activity zzso zzso analysis defined the zzso for a functional zzso unit between base pairs zzso and zzso relative to the zzso start zzso This region contains the zzso zzso response element zzso and both zzso and zzso gene zzso were lost when this area was zzso zzso of a single base pair located in the zzso region simultaneously reduced induction by zzso and increased zzso zzso Thus, the sequences of both the zzso and zzso response elements seem to zzso suggesting that zzso zzso binding may decrease zzso induction due to interactions of these two zzso zzso zzso of a putative zzso located between base pair zzso and zzso reduced, but did not completely zzso zzso induction of the reporter, suggesting that a zzso mechanism of induction is involved in this zzso
