zzso leukemia 1 zzso identified as part of the zzso zzso specific to acute zzso zzso is highly expressed in differentiated muscle cells and promotes muscle differentiation by zzso serum response factor zzso Here we show that zzso expression is zzso during zzso zzso differentiation and that enforced zzso of zzso enhances zzso zzso When the human zzso zzso cell line is induced to differentiate with zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in an increased number of zzso with a concurrent increase in zzso zzso zzso also promotes zzso differentiation of primary human zzso cells cultured in the presence of zzso The effect of zzso is zzso when zzso is knocked down, suggesting that zzso acts through zzso zzso with these findings in human cells, knockout of zzso in mice leads to reduced zzso counts in peripheral blood, and reduced zzso in bone zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso promotes zzso maturation of human and zzso zzso
