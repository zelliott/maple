We used colony formation zzso in the soft zzso media or the zzso media, the methods of identifying zzso cells and the SP cells as well as the zzso test in zzso mice, respectively, to analyze tumor stem like cells in the zzso cell zzso The results showed that a few zzso cells were capable of forming colonies in the soft zzso media, contained zzso strand in the zzso cell zzso The zzso cells in the zzso media gained higher zzso in the zzso mice than the zzso cells cultivated in the complete media zzso Overall, only a few of the zzso cells were found to possess the characteristics of tumor zzso cells, such as high zzso zzso more zzso and stronger zzso or greater similarity to the tumor stem cells zzso zzso The biology of tumor zzso cells contributes to the identification of molecular targets important for future tumor zzso
