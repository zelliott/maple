zzso zzso an orally active synthetic zzso zzso of the marine zzso zzso is currently undergoing clinical evaluation for cancer zzso zzso inhibited proliferation of zzso breast cancer cells with an zzso of 63 zzso and inhibited zzso with an zzso of 72 zzso in the absence of zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso approximately 30 zzso However, it strongly suppressed the dynamic instability behavior of the zzso at their plus ends at zzso approximately 5 to 10 times below those required to inhibit zzso Its major actions were to reduce the zzso rate, the switching frequency from growth to zzso zzso zzso and the fraction of time the zzso zzso In contrast with all other zzso drugs thus far examined that can inhibit zzso zzso did not inhibit the growth zzso In contrast to stabilizing plus ends, zzso enhanced zzso dynamic instability at minus ends, increasing the zzso zzso the fraction of time the zzso zzso and the catastrophe frequency and reducing the rescue zzso zzso zzso the major zzso zzso of zzso altered dynamic instability of zzso zzso in a zzso similar manner to zzso but was 10 to 30 times more zzso The results suggest that the principal mechanism by which zzso zzso cell proliferation is by suppressing zzso zzso zzso zzso may be a relatively weak zzso for the functionally active zzso zzso
