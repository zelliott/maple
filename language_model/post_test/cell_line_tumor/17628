zzso and zzso zzso zzso blockers, have previously been shown to inhibit zzso zzso zzso release from zzso cells, a zzso mast cell zzso We therefore used selective zzso of zzso and other zzso channels to determine if there was a role for these channels in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso release with zzso values of 133 zzso and 84 zzso zzso zzso also inhibited the zzso phase of the zzso zzso change in the membrane potential zzso 84 zzso zzso zzso and increase in free zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had no effect on zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso play a significant role in zzso release from zzso that these zzso are of the intermediate zzso zzso zzso channel zzso type, and that they are somewhat similar to those which have been described in red blood cells, though they are much less sensitive to zzso
