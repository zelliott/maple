zzso separation of the zzso extract of the leaves of zzso zzso led to the isolation of a zzso characterized as a zzso zzso by extensive zzso zzso and mass spectral zzso zzso zzso zzso in a dose dependent manner with zzso zzso zzso against acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso cell zzso The compound showed significant DNA binding properties as evidenced by the enhancement of melting temperature and zzso of the characteristic zzso in CD evidence of calf zzso zzso The DNA binding was also characterized by zzso zzso where a predominantly zzso driven binding to CT DNA was zzso
