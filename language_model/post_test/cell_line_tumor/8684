zzso has been shown to improve the survival outcomes of zzso positive breast cancer zzso However, a significant proportion of zzso patients are either inherently resistant or develop resistance to zzso We assessed the effects of zzso an irreversible zzso zzso in a panel of 36 breast cancer cell zzso We further assessed its effects with or without zzso in several sensitive and resistant breast cancer cells as well as a zzso zzso zzso We confirmed that zzso was significantly more active in zzso than zzso zzso cell zzso zzso decreased the zzso of the 4 zzso receptors and inhibited downstream zzso However, zzso and zzso were zzso at 24 hours, which was prevented by the combination of zzso and zzso zzso also decreased zzso and zzso in acquired zzso resistant zzso zzso in combination with zzso had a greater growth zzso effect than either drug alone in 4 zzso positive cell zzso Furthermore, zzso in combination with zzso was growth zzso in zzso and zzso cells which had acquired resistance to zzso as well as in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resistant cell lines showed sensitivity to zzso but the combination did not enhance response compared to zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso showed a direct correlation with sensitivity to zzso Our data indicate that zzso is an effective zzso therapy and zzso both innate and acquired zzso resistance in zzso positive breast zzso Our results suggest that combined treatment with zzso and zzso is likely to be more effective than either treatment alone for both zzso breast cancer as well as zzso tumors with acquired resistance to zzso
