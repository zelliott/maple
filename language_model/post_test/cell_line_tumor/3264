Signaling by the zzso factor nuclear factor zzso B zzso involves its release from inhibitor zzso B zzso in the zzso followed by zzso into the zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso represents a delayed negative feedback loop that drives zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging and zzso modeling of zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso following cell stimulation that decreased in frequency with increased zzso zzso zzso of target genes depended on zzso zzso involving cycles of zzso zzso and zzso The functional consequences of zzso signaling may thus depend on number, period, and zzso of zzso
