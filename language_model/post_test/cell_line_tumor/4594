We performed a zzso analysis of proteins of the newly established spontaneously immortalized zzso cell line zzso derived from a primary zzso of zzso zzso breast zzso zzso cells may represent zzso of the zzso zzso cells spontaneously immortalized in early phase of zzso We compared the protein profile of zzso line with proteins from populations of normal zzso zzso cells zzso and determined the zzso of both types of zzso zzso cells are a mixture of both main cell types in breast zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso breast cancer cell line has a unique zzso zzso We identified proteins that are differently expressed in these zzso zzso 16, zzso 19, zzso cell zzso zzso 1, zzso B and zzso 14 were predominantly expressed by zzso zzso zzso 13, zzso zzso of zzso 5, zzso zzso of zzso zzso channel protein 1, zzso 1 and zzso zzso were predominantly expressed by zzso zzso The proteins zzso in zzso cells may represent potential protein markers of zzso zzso cells zzso and may be important in early phase of zzso
