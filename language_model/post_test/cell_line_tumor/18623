Exposure of zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso The increase in zzso zzso levels occurred by zzso regulation and by zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso resulted in an increase of zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso Since the zzso regulation of several genes involved in zzso during zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso it was conceivable that zzso expression might be regulated by the same zzso zzso However, our data showed that pharmacological zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not affect zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and its zzso counterpart zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso These results indicated that zzso zzso expression may be independent of the zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso or pharmacological zzso of zzso zzso we showed that zzso zzso zzso but could not account completely for zzso expression during zzso In addition, zzso zzso an increase of zzso zzso expression and a parallel increase in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased the hypoxic induction of zzso and the hypoxic induction of zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso Similarly, zzso but not zzso zzso treatment decreased hypoxic induction of zzso zzso and this effect was reversed by zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso and zzso were able to stimulate zzso under zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso may play an important role in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso
