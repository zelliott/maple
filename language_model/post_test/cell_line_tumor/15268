The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of zzso solid zzso on the zzso of zzso in zzso Solid zzso zzso zzso was prepared with zzso zzso to improve the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso its zzso effect on zzso zzso cellular zzso was examined by using zzso cells zzso zzso Compared to the zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced the cellular zzso of zzso a zzso zzso by approximately 3 folds in zzso zzso The oral and intravenous zzso of zzso were also determined in rats zzso zzso in the different zzso Compared to the control given zzso alone, zzso solid zzso significantly ( zzso increased the oral exposure of zzso in rats, while it did not affect the intravenous zzso of zzso The zzso and zzso of oral zzso increased by zzso and zzso respectively in the presence of zzso solid zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso did not affect the oral zzso of zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso should be effective to improve the in zzso effectiveness of zzso as an zzso zzso leading to the improved oral exposure of zzso
