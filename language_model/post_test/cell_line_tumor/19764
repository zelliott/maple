zzso are expressed by numerous tumor types including breast cancer, in which they play a crucial role in tumor growth and zzso In this study, we evaluated the ability of zzso zzso a zzso capped zzso derived from the zzso region of zzso that binds to zzso and zzso in zzso to block breast cancer growth and zzso 

zzso human breast cancer cells were zzso zzso in the right flank, or cells zzso with green fluorescent protein zzso were zzso into the left zzso of female zzso zzso mice, resulting in the development of skeletal zzso Animals were treated with vehicle alone or by zzso infusion with zzso zzso zzso zzso a week) for 10 zzso zzso volume was determined at weekly intervals and tumor zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were harvested for zzso zzso 

Treatment with zzso caused a significant zzso decrease in tumor volume and either completely blocked or caused a marked decrease in the zzso and number of skeletal as well as soft tissue zzso This was confirmed zzso as well as zzso using X-ray and zzso zzso Treatment with zzso resulted in a significant decrease in the expression of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso density, and cell proliferation in tumors grown in zzso 

These studies show that zzso can block breast cancer growth and zzso and provides a rationale for the clinical development of zzso for the treatment of breast zzso
