The zzso of nuclear organization during differentiation and the dramatic zzso of nuclear organization associated with cancer development are well zzso However, the importance of tissue architecture in the control of nuclear organization remains to be zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells into functional tissue structures, in three-dimensional culture, is characterized by a specific tissue architecture zzso a zzso polarity zzso cell cycle exit and maintenance of cell zzso Here we show that induction of partial differentiation zzso zzso polarity only, cell cycle exit and cell zzso by zzso mechanisms in zzso breast cells is sufficient to restore features of zzso nuclear organization, including zzso zzso large zzso factor zzso and distinct nuclear zzso apparatus protein zzso zzso Upon zzso of nuclear organization using an zzso against zzso differentiated zzso cells undergo zzso whereas partially differentiated zzso cells enter the cell zzso zzso cells cultured under conditions that prevent the establishment of zzso polarity also enter the cell cycle upon zzso zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that the differentiation status rather than the zzso or zzso origin of cells controls nuclear organization and suggest a link between nuclear organization and zzso mechanisms dictated by tissue architecture for the control of cell zzso
