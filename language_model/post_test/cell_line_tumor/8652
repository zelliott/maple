The human zzso zzso plays a major role in the development and progression of prostate cancer and represents a well-established drug zzso All clinically approved zzso zzso zzso possess similar chemical structures and exhibit the same mode of action on the zzso zzso Although initially effective, resistance to these zzso zzso zzso usually develops and the cancer quickly zzso to zzso and zzso zzso Yet even in these late-stage patients, the zzso zzso is critical for the progression of the zzso Thus, there is a continuing need for novel chemical classes of zzso zzso zzso that could help overcome the problem of zzso In this study, we implemented and used the zzso combination of virtual and experimental screening to discover a number of new zzso that not only effectively inhibit zzso zzso zzso activity, but also induce almost complete degradation of the zzso zzso Of these zzso zzso a lead compound zzso was identified that showed strong zzso displacement zzso effectively inhibited zzso zzso zzso activity, and possesses a profound ability to cause degradation of zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited significant activity against prostate cancer cells that have already developed resistance to the second-generation zzso zzso (formerly known as zzso zzso also showed strong zzso zzso activity in the zzso in zzso zzso zzso These results provide a foundation for the development of a new class of zzso zzso zzso that can help address the problem of zzso resistance in prostate zzso
