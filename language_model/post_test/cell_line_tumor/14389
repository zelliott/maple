Advanced and zzso prostate cancer has long been considered as a zzso zzso Recently, it was found that zzso expression increases as prostate tumor progresses, and that zzso contributes significantly to drug resistance in breast zzso zzso thus, hypothesized that advanced and zzso prostate zzso may have an increased level of zzso which in turn may contribute to drug resistance in advanced and zzso prostate zzso In this study, we tested this hypothesis and found that, indeed, the expression level of zzso in zzso prostate cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso are much higher than that in the zzso cell line zzso and that the zzso cells are more resistant to zzso and zzso than the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso and zzso by zzso interference significantly zzso these cells to zzso and zzso by zzso zzso checkpoint and increasing zzso whereas restoring zzso expression in zzso cells enhanced drug zzso We also showed that zzso zzso caused nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso upon DNA zzso Based on these studies, we propose that therapeutic intervention targeting zzso may be useful for zzso zzso prostate zzso to chemotherapy by both zzso checkpoint zzso and zzso zzso
