zzso is an zzso focal zzso protein that regulates the zzso zzso Patients suffering from zzso syndrome have a zzso zzso of the zzso gene and develop skin zzso zzso disease, and zzso complications because of deficient zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We investigated zzso zzso in zzso tissue and its functions in cultured zzso and showed that zzso zzso with zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso cells of oral zzso and in cultured zzso The zzso oral zzso tissue from a patient with zzso syndrome showed a complete lack of zzso and reduced zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso directly zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso led to an altered distribution of zzso focal zzso reduced cell zzso decreased cell zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso cells further reduced cell zzso suggesting that zzso can partially compensate for zzso zzso zzso supported mature zzso zzso zzso of zzso as zzso of zzso expression significantly reduced the zzso zzso In zzso zzso interacts with zzso and plays a crucial role in zzso zzso cell zzso essential for zzso and zzso zzso
