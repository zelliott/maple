zzso fatty acids zzso and their biological zzso including the zzso have numerous roles in physiology and zzso Although some zzso are known to act through zzso the molecular actions of many zzso remain zzso As the three-dimensional structure of zzso allows them to specifically bind and activate their zzso we hypothesized that the same structure would allow other proteins to associate with zzso and zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso of zzso acid and its zzso derivatives zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso can be used to pull down associated zzso zzso of proteins by two-dimensional gel zzso indicated that a large number of proteins bound each zzso and that proteins could distinguish between two zzso of zzso Individual zzso identified by zzso assisted laser zzso of flight mass zzso included proteins that are known to bind zzso including zzso and zzso zzso as well as several novel zzso These include zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and G protein signaling zzso such as zzso zzso zzso inhibitor 1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso This method, then, represents a relatively simple and straightforward way to screen for proteins that directly associate with, and are potentially modulated by, zzso and their zzso
