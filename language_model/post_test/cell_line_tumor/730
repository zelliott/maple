In previous work, we have described an zzso and ultraviolet B zzso zzso zzso in human zzso which can be completely inhibited by zzso zzso We now compared this response of primary human zzso with the response of two zzso zzso cell zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso to an zzso zzso zzso In these cell lines, both the zzso zzso zzso status and the zzso response to zzso zzso strongly from the response of healthy primary zzso Even more, a remarkable correlation was found between the zzso Although a zzso dual zzso of zzso rendered the zzso SCC cell line completely resistant to the zzso and zzso zzso pathway, deficient zzso zzso of zzso in the SCC cell line zzso led to a greatly zzso sensitivity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the preservation of a healthy zzso zzso is essential for a zzso zzso zzso response in skin, and suggest that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso response to zzso is an important event in the zzso transformation of zzso
