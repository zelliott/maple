Our previous work suggested that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso through a zzso zzso In this study, we have identified zzso and zzso as the zzso B receptors for this zzso The zzso B zzso without the zzso motif and zzso a zzso B zzso with the zzso zzso induced less zzso than did native zzso B, suggesting that the zzso motif is critical for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B binding zzso and zzso analysis showed that zzso B specifically zzso with zzso zzso zzso partially inhibited zzso zzso zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso In addition, zzso binding to zzso B was verified in an affinity column and an zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso manner, suggesting that zzso zzso zzso zzso also occurs zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso were activated by zzso B and zzso with a little delay by the zzso After zzso B zzso the cell surface level of zzso but not of zzso was zzso The decreased zzso level was restored by treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso suggesting a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso via the zzso zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso is zzso through zzso zzso and zzso in a synergistic zzso
