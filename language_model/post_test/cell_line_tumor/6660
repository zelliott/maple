The contribution of zzso proteins to zzso virus zzso zzso gene expression and replication in zzso cells was zzso zzso zzso cell lines zzso expressed zzso and had limited zzso zzso while the zzso gastric cancer cell line expressed significant levels of both zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso cycle in zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso and sodium zzso treatment led to a transient stimulation of zzso expression and a prolonged increase in zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso and zzso proteins were detected associated with the zzso and zzso promoters but not the zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso confirmed binding of zzso proteins to multiple sites in the zzso and zzso zzso The response of these promoters in reporter zzso to zzso zzso and zzso proteins was consistent with the promoter binding zzso and emphasized the relative importance of zzso for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoter zzso zzso site had little effect on zzso zzso of the promoter in a reporter zzso However, this zzso impaired zzso DNA zzso suggesting a separate zzso contribution for zzso zzso Finally, the overall importance of zzso proteins for zzso gene expression was demonstrated using zzso to antagonize zzso DNA binding zzso Introduction of zzso significantly impaired induction of the zzso zzso and zzso proteins in chemically treated zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso expression are associated with zzso induction in zzso cells, and expression of zzso proteins in zzso cells may contribute to the tendency of these cells to exhibit zzso low-level zzso promoter zzso
