Cancer zzso arise following zzso of circulating tumor cells with certain tumors exhibiting high organ zzso Here, we developed a zzso zzso model to analyze the specificity of human breast cancer zzso to bone, zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso with human zzso bone zzso zzso stem cells and zzso zzso The zzso system allowed us to study the zzso migration of highly zzso breast cancer cells and to monitor their behavior within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after cancer cell injection, was significantly higher in the zzso zzso zzso compared to collagen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the migration distance was also significantly greater zzso zzso zzso zzso cells proliferated to form zzso of various sizes containing 4 to more than 60 cells by day zzso We demonstrated that the breast cancer cell zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso play a major role in the zzso process, influencing zzso rate and traveled zzso Our study provides novel zzso zzso quantitative data on zzso and zzso generation of breast cancer cells within a zzso zzso and demonstrates the potential value of zzso systems to better understand cancer biology and screen for new zzso
