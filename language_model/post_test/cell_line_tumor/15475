zzso membrane zzso zzso is highly expressed in prostate cancer, and zzso zzso targeting zzso rapidly detect the location and extent of zzso Here we evaluated zzso 4 novel zzso zzso zzso of zzso with the potential for clinical translation for molecular imaging of prostate cancer in zzso 

Four zzso zzso derived from the zzso or zzso zzso zzso to zzso or TIM zzso were zzso with zzso and evaluated in zzso and in zzso 

zzso zzso binding to zzso on zzso cells was observed with zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso did not bind human prostate cancer zzso cells, which lack zzso demonstrating zzso and binding was abolished with zzso acid zzso a structurally unrelated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were shown to zzso at 37 zzso zzso in zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso injected dose per gram at 1 h after injection and from zzso to zzso at 4 zzso with zzso ratios ranging from zzso to zzso and zzso muscle ratios ranging from zzso to zzso at 4 zzso zzso exhibited the best combination of high tumor zzso and rapid clearance from kidney and zzso zzso zzso specifically bound to zzso in zzso as demonstrated by the absence of zzso in zzso zzso and by competition with zzso zzso imaging zzso the tissue distribution results, demonstrating zzso only in zzso kidney and tumor tissue and clearance through the urinary zzso 

These zzso zzso targeting zzso may provide a zzso molecular imaging option to assist in the initial diagnosis of prostate cancer and the management of patient care by monitoring disease zzso
