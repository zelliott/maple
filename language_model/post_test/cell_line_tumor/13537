zzso activity plays a key role in prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso is the main zzso of zzso activity in the zzso through its ability to act as a zzso zzso Here we performed a zzso analysis of human zzso binding to promoters in the presence of an zzso or zzso in an zzso dependent prostate cancer cell zzso Many of the zzso bound promoters are bound in all examined conditions while others are bound only in the presence of an zzso or zzso Several motifs are enriched in zzso bound zzso including the zzso Response zzso zzso zzso and recognition elements for the zzso factors zzso and zzso This suggests that these 3 factors could define a module of zzso zzso factors in the zzso Interestingly, zzso bound promoters are zzso located in AT rich zzso zzso Analysis of zzso expression identified chicken zzso upstream zzso factor 1 zzso as a direct zzso target gene that is zzso upon binding by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso of zzso in zzso of human zzso dependent prostate cancer, but not in adjacent benign prostate zzso zzso cells both in human and mouse prostate show nuclear zzso zzso We further show that there is an inverse correlation between zzso expression in prostate zzso cells and the rising levels of zzso with advancing zzso This study extends the pool of recognized putative zzso targets and identifies a zzso regulated target of zzso - zzso - which could possibly play a role in human prostate zzso
