zzso zzso is a zzso expressed by zzso cells and is zzso zzso by multiple myeloma zzso zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of various inflammatory zzso We found that zzso zzso by human zzso cell lines zzso both the classical and zzso pathways of complement, without influencing alternative zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso is due to direct interactions with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso through the zzso zzso of zzso whereas zzso binds additionally to zzso protein zzso zzso between zzso and zzso as well as zzso are diminished in the presence of zzso zzso type zzso In addition, we localized the zzso site to the zzso stalk of zzso zzso between zzso and zzso as well as zzso are zzso in character and only the interaction with zzso was found to be partially dependent on the presence of zzso We found the serum levels of zzso to be elevated in patients with zzso compared to healthy zzso Moreover, we found that zzso expressed from myeloma plasma cells protects these cells from complement zzso induced by treatment with zzso zzso This might protect myeloma cells during zzso and promote survival of zzso zzso
