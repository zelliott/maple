zzso which contain an zzso sequence in their binding zzso are zzso of zzso such as zzso The purpose of this study was to compare a range of zzso with different zzso zzso for their binding behavior in zzso to vascular zzso cells bearing zzso and to cultured tumor cells which express zzso 

Five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso zzso zzso were zzso with zzso and tested for binding to cells in zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso had the highest zzso zzso had moderate zzso and zzso and zzso had low binding to zzso The observed binding was attributed to zzso to various zzso zzso zzso Cancer cells zzso bound zzso after zzso but zzso cells did zzso After binding to zzso cells, zzso was not displaced by competing zzso or plasma zzso 

These data suggest that zzso zzso zzso and zzso may have advantages over labeled zzso and small zzso peptides for targeting zzso in zzso Since zzso zzso is not zzso by zzso cells, zzso may provide an advantage for targeting zzso on zzso because they bind strongly to surface receptors and are not readily zzso
