zzso zzso is an zzso zzso hormone of the zzso system with zzso and zzso zzso Human zzso zzso and zzso cells as well as zzso lung cancer zzso cells were treated with serum in the presence and absence of zzso to determine whether zzso zzso the growth of lung cancer zzso zzso caused a significant reduction in zzso growth in all three lung cancer cell zzso Treatment with zzso resulted in both a zzso and zzso reduction in zzso DNA synthesis in all three cell lines, with zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked the zzso of the zzso DNA synthesis of zzso cells by zzso while neither zzso nor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented the response to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso for zzso was detected in the three lung cancer cell lines, suggesting that the zzso effect of zzso in the cancer cells may be zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Other zzso peptides zzso I, zzso II, zzso zzso and zzso did not zzso zzso DNA synthesis of zzso cells, demonstrating that zzso selectively zzso zzso cancer cell zzso zzso of zzso cells with 10 zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicating that the zzso effects may occur, at least in part, through zzso of the zzso signal zzso zzso The results of this study suggest that zzso zzso lung cancer cell growth through the zzso of an zzso zzso zzso and may represent a novel zzso and zzso treatment for lung zzso
