zzso 61 zzso a zzso protein which belongs to the zzso family, has been found to be zzso expressed in many zzso and to be involved in tumor zzso The expression of zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso has only recently been zzso but the roles of zzso in zzso cells still remained zzso In this study, we have shown that there are high levels of zzso in zzso cell zzso Furthermore, using zzso interference zzso we zzso silenced the expression of zzso in zzso cells, an zzso cell zzso The colony formation, zzso cell migration, cell zzso and cell zzso zzso were employed to address the roles of zzso in the growth, migration and zzso of zzso zzso The results have shown that zzso zzso by zzso leads to a significant reduction of colony formation and cell zzso The migration and zzso ability of zzso cells were also suppressed with the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of the zzso cells was decreased in the zzso zzso cells compared to the control zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso may play crucial roles in regulating zzso progression of zzso
