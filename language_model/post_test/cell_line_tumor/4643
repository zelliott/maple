zzso is one of the most potent inhibitor of zzso Loss of zzso was found in human prostate tumors and associated with the progression toward a zzso zzso To test the therapeutic potential of zzso we constructed a zzso zzso zzso capable of efficient zzso and expression of zzso zzso in zzso prostate zzso zzso As controls, we used zzso expressing zzso zzso We showed that zzso of zzso inhibited proliferation of cells and zzso zzso in zzso cells, in comparison with zzso Furthermore, zzso suppresses zzso growth cells in soft zzso and tumor formation in zzso nude mice associated with decreased zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that 56 out of zzso genes were found to be zzso and zzso in the zzso infected with zzso as compared with zzso The zzso expressed genes cover a broad range of functional activities including zzso activity, protein zzso signal zzso activity and cell zzso Among them, zzso and zzso were confirmed to be zzso with real-time zzso and Western zzso suggesting a possible association with zzso signaling for cell zzso and zzso These results can contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of treatment strategies of zzso for prostate zzso
