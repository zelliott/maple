Triple negative breast cancer zzso has increased recurrence and poor survival, despite a high response rate to zzso zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether current drug zzso eliminates bulk of tumor cells, but it has a minimal effect on cancer stem cells zzso leading to tumor zzso We studied the effects of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso plus TRAIL on zzso derived from zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso The zzso data indicate that zzso plus zzso treatment was most effective in eliminating zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Treatment with zzso plus TRAIL also zzso zzso signaling and its downstream target, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso reduced proliferation and zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso significantly reduced the ability of zzso to form zzso compared to zzso However, maximum effect was seen in zzso plus zzso zzso Taken together the data suggest that zzso plus TRAIL treatment has the potential of providing a new strategy for improving the therapeutic outcome in zzso zzso
