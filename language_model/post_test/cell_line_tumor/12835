zzso infection with zzso zzso zzso is the strongest risk factor for the development of gastric zzso The zzso gene product zzso is injected into gastric zzso cells and zzso cellular functions by physically interacting with and zzso a variety of cellular signaling zzso zzso is a tumor zzso in many zzso and it is frequently zzso in gastric zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso infection zzso the gastric tumor zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso directly associates with zzso through a specific recognition of the zzso motif of zzso by a WW domain of zzso zzso of the WW zzso of zzso or zzso of the zzso motif in zzso zzso the ability of zzso to induce the zzso and degradation of zzso thereby zzso its ability to inhibit the zzso zzso of zzso Our studies identify zzso as a novel cellular target of zzso zzso zzso and also reveal a mechanism by which zzso functions as an zzso by blocking the activity of gastric tumor zzso zzso
