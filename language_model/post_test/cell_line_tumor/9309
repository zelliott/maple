zzso of zzso in the course of treatments with platinum drugs remains a major hurdle to zzso zzso zzso We have previously shown that acquisition of zzso resistance by zzso zzso zzso cells was associated with the loss of zzso zzso in response to zzso To try to sensitize this cell line by restoring zzso zzso we tested a new synthetic compound, zzso zzso which was described to induce zzso zzso and to display zzso zzso 

We treated four zzso zzso cell lines with zzso alone or combined with zzso We characterized its effects on zzso induction and proliferation and correlated them with molecular zzso 

We showed that zzso induced cell death and zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso manner in zzso zzso zzso zzso was also associated with the zzso of zzso expression and, to a less extent, with that of zzso Treatment with zzso also zzso a strong zzso cell cycle arrest, accompanied with zzso zzso All of these effects revealed to be zzso Moreover, zzso exerted a zzso effect on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells, the sensitivity to zzso appearing in particular linked with a low zzso level of zzso Finally, we showed that zzso increased the zzso effect of zzso in zzso resistant zzso 

Our results emphasized the potential interest of zzso used alone or combined with zzso for zzso zzso zzso The absence of zzso zzso may constitute a zzso marker of response to this novel zzso
