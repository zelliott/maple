Biological clock components have been detected in many zzso zzso of the zzso tract of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting the existence of peripheral zzso clocks that may be zzso by zzso Our aim was to investigate the expression of main peripheral clock genes in zzso of healthy humans and in human colon zzso cell zzso The presence of clock components was investigated in single intact zzso zzso isolated by zzso from the zzso of 25 patients zzso of any sign of zzso zzso undergoing routine zzso and in cell lines of human colon zzso zzso and zzso clone zzso zzso zzso and clock zzso were detected by real-time zzso The three-dimensional zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins were recorded along zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate the presence of zzso zzso and clock zzso in samples prepared from zzso zzso of 5 patients and in all cell zzso We also demonstrate the presence of two zzso clock zzso zzso and zzso in human zzso on zzso isolated from 20 patients (15 patients for zzso and 6 for zzso and in colon zzso zzso zzso the presence of clock proteins in human zzso zzso is the first step toward the study of the regulation of the zzso zzso clock by nutrients and feeding zzso
