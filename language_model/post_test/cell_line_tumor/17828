Novel zzso zzso zzso with defined structure, high zzso efficiency, and low zzso were designed and zzso as zzso gene delivery zzso Michael addition between zzso zzso zzso and three zzso protected zzso ( zzso zzso and zzso followed by zzso zzso under zzso condition resulted in final zzso zzso with zzso bonds, zzso zzso groups in main zzso and zzso primary zzso groups in side zzso zzso structures were confirmed by zzso zzso and their molecular weights were in the range zzso zzso with narrow zzso zzso as determined by size exclusion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso possessed superior zzso capacity to zzso zzso 25 zzso in the pH range zzso which may facilitate the escape of DNA from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that significant zzso zzso was observed in the presence of zzso zzso zzso within 1 zzso suggesting rapid DNA release in the reduction condition such as zzso due to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by these zzso zzso were zzso zzso length zzso The zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso had comparable zzso efficiency to zzso 25 zzso in the tested cell lines, zzso zzso cells, zzso cells, and zzso zzso This same zzso zzso zzso zzso higher zzso expression than zzso 25 zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso cell zzso a cell line difficult to zzso with many zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso indicated that all three zzso zzso zzso were significantly less toxic than zzso zzso
