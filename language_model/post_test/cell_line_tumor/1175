Transport of the zzso protein zzso through zzso was studied in zzso cells expressing zzso zzso and zzso It was shown that zzso and zzso functional zzso of early zzso are involved in zzso zzso zzso enters cells by both zzso and zzso zzso The main pool of zzso toxin accumulates in early zzso and remains associated with them for a long zzso In contrast to earlier zzso current observations indicate that the majority of zzso avoids transport to zzso The low level of zzso association with zzso as well as with zzso accumulated in the zzso recycling compartment shows that the compartment is not responsible for keeping zzso away from degradation in zzso zzso from degradation in zzso is assumed to result from the zzso of zzso to form zzso within zzso
