zzso blockade protocols are effective in zzso zzso survival in animal models and are entering clinical trials, but how environmental zzso affect graft survival remains largely zzso We used a zzso blockade protocol consisting of a zzso zzso and zzso zzso to address this zzso We observed that zzso zzso virus infection at the time of zzso zzso and zzso zzso shortens zzso zzso zzso zzso virus 1) activates innate zzso 2) zzso zzso T cells, and 3) generates zzso responses, all of which may adversely affect zzso zzso To investigate the role of innate zzso mice given zzso blockade and skin zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso blockade prolonged skin zzso survival that was shortened after zzso by zzso zzso To investigate underlying mechanisms, we used zzso mice which circulate trace populations of zzso transgenic zzso zzso T zzso In zzso mice treated with zzso zzso zzso of all four zzso zzso prevented deletion of zzso zzso T cells and shortened skin zzso zzso These zzso zzso T cells 1) expressed the proliferation marker zzso 2) zzso zzso and 3) failed to undergo zzso zzso and zzso mice treated with zzso blockade plus zzso also exhibited short skin zzso survival whereas similarly treated zzso and zzso mice exhibited prolonged zzso zzso We conclude that zzso signaling abrogates the effects of zzso blockade by preventing zzso zzso T cell zzso through a mechanism not dependent on zzso or zzso zzso
