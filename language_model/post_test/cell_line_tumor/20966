The zzso regulatory zzso protein zzso family member zzso is a critical zzso regulator of cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism and has been implicated in insulin resistance, diabetes, and other zzso zzso We globally identified the promoters occupied by zzso and its binding partners zzso and zzso in a human zzso cell line using zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso zzso zzso We find that zzso occupies the promoters of zzso target genes involved in diverse biological zzso including novel targets with roles in zzso metabolism and insulin zzso We also identify a zzso zzso zzso motif in zzso target zzso and we demonstrate that many zzso target genes are zzso activated by treatment with insulin and zzso using gene expression zzso Finally, we show that zzso zzso extensively with zzso and zzso throughout the zzso and that unique combinations of these factors target distinct functional zzso Our results provide insight into the regulatory zzso in which zzso and its network partners coordinate a complex zzso response in the liver with cues from the zzso
