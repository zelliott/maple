zzso signaling plays an important role in vascular development and tumor zzso It has been shown that disruption of zzso zzso signal zzso effectively zzso tumor growth, but this treatment also results in the formation of vascular zzso In this study, we investigate the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso melanoma cells on tumor cell proliferation and tumor growth in zzso and in zzso Our results showed that zzso of zzso could activate zzso signaling in tumor cells, and promote tumor cell proliferation in zzso In contrast, growth of zzso tumors in zzso was reduced, due to abnormal tumor vessel zzso zzso tumor zzso enhanced zzso and necrosis in tumor zzso leading to retarded tumor zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso signaling may serve as an zzso strategy in the treatment of zzso zzso
