Although zzso functions and the clinical significance of zzso tumor 1 zzso have been extensively studied in acute zzso the regulatory mechanism of its zzso still remains to be zzso We found a significant correlation among the amounts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso from leukemia and solid tumor cell zzso zzso and small interfering zzso zzso zzso experiments of zzso and zzso showed that these zzso zzso factors could induce zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso promoter did not explain the different zzso zzso levels between cell zzso The 3' zzso especially the zzso sites out of six putative zzso binding sites located within the region, but not the zzso 3 zzso were essential for the zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso showed both zzso and zzso bound to these zzso zzso Besides acute leukemia cell lines, solid tumor cell lines including, zzso also showed a high level of zzso zzso We showed that zzso expression is a zzso of zzso zzso expression in both zzso cells and zzso cells without zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso and/or zzso binding to a zzso site of the 3' zzso of zzso played an important role in zzso gene zzso
