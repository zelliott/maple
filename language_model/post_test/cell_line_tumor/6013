The nuclear zzso zzso X zzso zzso is activated by a range of zzso including zzso drugs, and has been suggested to play a role in the development of tumor cell resistance to zzso zzso zzso also has been implicated as a regulator of the growth and zzso of colon zzso Here, we have used a zzso model of colon cancer to define a molecular mechanism that might zzso zzso colon tumor growth and zzso zzso of zzso was found to be sufficient to enhance the zzso zzso including cell growth, invasion, and zzso of both human colon tumor cell lines and primary human colon cancer tissue zzso into zzso zzso Furthermore, we were able to show that this zzso zzso required zzso zzso zzso bound to the zzso promoter in both human colon tumor cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, while both cell types proliferated in response to zzso zzso the zzso promoter was activated by zzso only in cancer zzso Taken together, these data indicate that colon cancer growth in the presence of a specific zzso zzso results from zzso induction of zzso These observations may lead to improved therapeutic regimens for colon zzso
