Since the initiation of the global zzso zzso program in 1988, the number of zzso polio cases decreased from 350,000 to fewer than 500, and the number of polio endemic countries declined from more than 125 to zzso The last case of polio in South Africa caused by a zzso zzso zzso occurred in zzso The live attenuated oral zzso vaccine zzso has been effectively used in the reduction and control of zzso However, as zzso strains are zzso in stools after zzso this vaccine could become a source of dissemination of zzso in the environment and the potential cause of zzso zzso the aim of the study was to determine the occurrence of zzso strains in selected sewage and river water zzso During the period between 2001 and 2003, 138 samples of river water and zzso samples of settled sewage were collected from selected areas of South zzso A total of 860 plaques were zzso which consisted of 703 plaques from the sewage and 157 plaques from the river water zzso Using a reverse zzso zzso zzso 49 zzso were successfully distinguished from 176 zzso zzso zzso The 176 zzso consisted of 50 zzso B2 viruses zzso followed by 39 zzso 11 zzso 25 zzso 21 zzso 15 zzso 14 zzso A6 viruses zzso 7 zzso 2 zzso 2 zzso and 1 zzso which was in agreement with the prevalence of these zzso in other parts of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso revealed the presence of 29 zzso zzso type 1, 8 zzso zzso type 2, and 12 zzso zzso type 3 zzso Buffalo green monkey kidney and primary liver zzso cell cultures allowed the amplification of a broad spectrum of zzso whereas human zzso zzso cells were more selective for zzso This study addressed some of the issues regarding the prevalence of zzso strains in the zzso The identification of 49 viable zzso zzso confirmed the presence and circulation of zzso vaccine strains in sewage and river zzso The extent of the potential health risk constituted by these zzso zzso remains to be zzso
