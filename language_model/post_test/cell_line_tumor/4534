We previously reported that zzso II zzso activated the proliferation of prostate cancer cells, and its zzso an zzso zzso type 1 zzso blocker zzso inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer in zzso and in zzso In the present study, we investigated whether zzso an zzso has a unique feature as a zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso and its zzso potential on prostate cancer zzso 

Cell count or zzso zzso were carried out for growth suppression of prostate cancer zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso specific expression of prostate specific zzso zzso and zzso were investigated by western zzso To confirm the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso using zzso promoter and zzso response elements zzso plasmids was zzso 

The results showed that cell proliferation and signal zzso were inhibited by zzso zzso Also, zzso of zzso expression by zzso was confirmed by western zzso and zzso zzso indicating that an zzso acted in a similar way such as an zzso agent in prostate cancer zzso 

The present study showed zzso especially those possessing a zzso zzso structure, have a potential zzso effect on zzso and zzso prostate zzso
