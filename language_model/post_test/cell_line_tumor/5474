zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso is expressed on zzso cells, found in inflamed zzso of allergic diseases, and is therefore suspected to be involved in the zzso of allergic diseases by controlling zzso cell migration into inflamed zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the zzso effect of a selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the recruitment of zzso T cells to the airway of mice with zzso allergic airway zzso zzso was administered to mice in which zzso T cell zzso was zzso by multiple zzso of zzso zzso zzso significantly and zzso inhibited the recruitment of zzso T cells with an zzso zzso of 44 zzso zzso twice zzso The zzso potential of zzso was also demonstrated by the fact that zzso suppressed the zzso of zzso zzso and airway zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso can control in zzso migration of zzso cells which express zzso and, presumably, serve as a new class of therapeutic agent for zzso
