Lyn is the only member of the zzso family expressed in zzso B cells, which provide a unique model to study the singular contribution of this protein zzso zzso zzso family to cell zzso In these cells, gene zzso of Lyn leads to defective B cell zzso zzso zzso DNA array analysis of zzso zzso cells shows that the absence of Lyn leads to zzso of numerous genes zzso proteins involved in B cell zzso zzso zzso control of transcription, zzso response, and zzso zzso Most of these expression changes have not been previously associated with Lyn zzso zzso They include zzso in zzso levels of zzso zzso nuclear protein zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso binding factor 1, zzso H chain, zzso and zzso Changes in zzso expression were also confirmed in zzso mice, suggesting that Lyn zzso has a unique function not compensated for by other zzso zzso Because zzso mice have impaired development of zzso centers in zzso the decreased expression of zzso in the zzso zzso cell line and zzso mice suggests that Lyn controls the formation and proliferation of zzso centers via zzso zzso promoter activity was higher in zzso vs zzso zzso zzso of the zzso binding site reduced activity in zzso cells and had no effect in zzso zzso The presence of Lyn enhanced zzso expression in a Northern zzso Thus, the following new signaling zzso has been zzso zzso
