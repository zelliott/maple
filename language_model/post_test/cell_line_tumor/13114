zzso a novel zzso shows transforming activity in mouse embryonic zzso However, the zzso role of zzso in tumor cells has not been fully zzso To extend understanding of how this protein operates in zzso we aimed to identify the effect of zzso on zzso cell zzso Here, we found that zzso was highly expressed in zzso tumor samples and cell zzso We found that the majority of zzso protein can be detected in the nucleus as reported in other zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso attenuated zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso resulted in zzso cell zzso which was accompanied by changes in cell zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso plays an zzso role in the proliferation of zzso cells and could be a novel target for the treatment of zzso
