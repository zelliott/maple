The zzso delivery of zzso acids faces many zzso and zzso hurdles on the way from injection site to the site of zzso Among these, zzso in the blood stream and rapid elimination by the zzso zzso system zzso represent strong obstacles towards successful development of these promising therapeutic zzso Even the state-of-the-art solutions using zzso show low zzso efficiency due to limited zzso and hindered zzso zzso Engineering the carriers with zzso coats reduces zzso and zzso due to the effective zzso while the controlled zzso at the desired site of action enhances the zzso and zzso zzso This work reports for the first time the use of zzso starch zzso for the controlled zzso of zzso zzso with different zzso masses, was grafted to zzso zzso and characterized using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were used to generate zzso with the zzso zzso DNA zzso and were characterized by zzso and zzso potential zzso zzso was tested in zzso by zzso potential zzso and, zzso zzso zzso upon addition of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso The addition of AA led to gradual increase in the zzso potential of the zzso over zzso to zzso and to a higher zzso tendency for zzso due to the degradation of the zzso and exposure of the zzso positive zzso In zzso zzso experiments were conducted in 2 zzso in the culture zzso The zzso zzso complexes showed up to 2 orders of magnitude higher zzso levels compared to the zzso zzso zzso while AA had no effect on the zzso of zzso or zzso zzso Finally, flow zzso showed that the addition of AA increased the amount of delivered DNA per cell for the zzso zzso This study shows that decorating zzso with zzso can be a promising tool for the controlled zzso of zzso
