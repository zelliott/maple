zzso zzso disorder zzso continues to be a devastating and potentially life-threatening complication in organ transplant zzso zzso is associated with zzso infection and can result in zzso B cell zzso Here we demonstrate that the zzso zzso is highly activated in zzso B cell zzso lines derived from patients with zzso Treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso partially inhibited the proliferation of zzso B cell zzso Resistance to zzso treatment correlated with high levels of zzso zzso An zzso inhibitor and a zzso dual inhibitor suppressed zzso zzso and showed a greater zzso effect on zzso B zzso lines compared to zzso zzso B cell zzso lines expressed high levels of zzso We demonstrate that zzso is responsible for zzso zzso in zzso B cell zzso and that selective zzso of zzso by either zzso or a small zzso zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso on zzso B cell zzso These results suggest that zzso is a novel, potential therapeutic target for the treatment of zzso zzso and that combined blockade of zzso and zzso provides increased efficacy in zzso proliferation of zzso B cell zzso
