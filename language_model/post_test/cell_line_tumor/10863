The human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso is a candidate gene for schizophrenia and an important drug target for cognitive deficits in the zzso zzso of the zzso results in opening of the channel and entry of zzso and zzso zzso including zzso that zzso zzso to neurotransmitter release and zzso to zzso changes in gene zzso zzso patients have low levels of zzso as measured by binding of the zzso zzso zzso The structure of the zzso zzso is zzso During evolution, zzso was partially duplicated as a zzso gene zzso which is expressed in the human brain and elsewhere in the zzso The association between a zzso deletion in zzso and schizophrenia suggested that this duplicate gene might contribute to cognitive zzso To examine the putative contribution of zzso on zzso function, zzso of zzso and the duplicate genes was carried out in cell lines and zzso zzso zzso of the duplicate alone yielded protein expression but no functional zzso and zzso with zzso caused a significant reduction of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso current zzso was not correlated with a reduction of zzso zzso suggesting the presence of zzso zzso zzso This hypothesis is supported by a larger increase of the zzso current by the zzso zzso zzso zzso in cells expressing the duplicate than in the zzso These results suggest that zzso acts as a dominant negative zzso of zzso function and is critical for zzso regulation in zzso
