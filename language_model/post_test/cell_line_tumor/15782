zzso zzso is an aggressive cancer of the zzso with poor zzso There is a need to identify new zzso and therapeutic targets for this invasive and fatal zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso can promote zzso zzso through multiple zzso zzso zzso binding proteins zzso regulate zzso zzso by targeting the growth factor into the zzso zzso from where it can be released and zzso We investigated here the expression patterns of different zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and in 2 established zzso zzso cell zzso All zzso were zzso but zzso was the main zzso in healthy zzso and in cultured zzso zzso zzso We observed zzso of zzso expression in zzso zzso which was associated with high zzso levels indicative of zzso activity specifically in the tumor zzso Small interfering zzso suppression of zzso expression in zzso cells increased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso on the other hand, was markedly strong in the tumor zzso which showed significantly lower levels of zzso A strong negative correlation between zzso and zzso zzso was found, zzso that zzso is not likely to contribute directly to the increased levels of zzso activity in zzso zzso Current results suggest that zzso 1 and 3 may have specific roles in zzso zzso zzso through the regulation of zzso zzso in the tumor tissue and the structure of the tumor zzso
