Despite the discovery of multiple zzso only a limited number is available for clinical application, particularly against zzso zzso In this study we searched for novel zzso using expression profiles of gastric cancer examined with zzso zzso and identified the zzso gene as a zzso zzso was confirmed to be expressed in five out of seven gastric zzso with zzso zzso With Northern zzso analysis, it was detected abundantly in the zzso and zzso but it was barely zzso in 14 other normal human adult zzso Colony formation zzso revealed that its zzso expression is associated with promoted cell zzso As these expression profiles and functional features of zzso appeared to be compatible with the characteristics of the hypothesized ideal zzso we examined whether zzso protein contains zzso zzso peptides restricted to zzso We zzso the candidate peptides derived from zzso and tried to induce zzso with each zzso The zzso clones were successfully induced with a zzso zzso zzso and they zzso not only the zzso targets but also the tumor cells expressing both zzso and zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso is an zzso zzso restricted to zzso Furthermore, we zzso an zzso zzso zzso V zzso in which zzso at position 9 was zzso for zzso to increase the binding affinity to the zzso zzso The zzso clones induced by zzso V also recognized tumor cells expressing its natural zzso protein zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso is a novel zzso and these zzso both native and zzso may be zzso for cancer vaccines to treat gastric zzso
