zzso zzso are zzso zzso molecules designed to inhibit gene expression by zzso specific zzso zzso We investigated the potential of synthetic zzso to inhibit zzso expression in zzso defective zzso zzso zzso A chemically stabilized zzso zzso has been targeted to the zzso zzso element of zzso zzso that is involved in zzso gene zzso during zzso The design of the zzso was based on the results of probing accessibility of the zzso target in cellular extracts with zzso zzso The zzso was zzso to a zzso zzso human zzso cell line zzso The cellular zzso of this zzso resulted in a marked reduction of both zzso zzso and zzso protein levels and dramatically increased cellular death by zzso Our results suggest a potential therapeutic application of such zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso
