The zzso nuclear zzso K is an ancient zzso protein that is involved in multiple processes that compose gene zzso The zzso action of K protein reflects its ability to interact with different classes of factors, interactions that are regulated by zzso zzso We used affinity zzso and zzso to better define the repertoire of K protein zzso We identified a large number of new K protein partners, some typically found in zzso zzso such as plasma zzso where K protein has not previously been zzso zzso zzso showed K protein in the nucleus, zzso zzso and in vicinity of plasma zzso These observations greatly expanded the view of the landscape of K zzso interaction and provide new opportunities to explore signal zzso and gene expression in several zzso zzso
