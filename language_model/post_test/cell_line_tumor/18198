zzso zzso are zzso zzso that are often found as major components in many traditional zzso zzso Recently, a number of naturally occurring zzso zzso have been shown to exert zzso activity against several strains of human cancer zzso Use of these zzso compounds for cancer treatment is hampered due to the lack of understanding of their action mechanism as well as limited access to such structurally complicated zzso In the present paper, we have prepared a group of zzso zzso zzso which contain a zzso zzso having different zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is found for most zzso against zzso zzso cells, breast cancer zzso cells, and cervical cancer zzso zzso The analogue 13 that contains an zzso acid zzso exhibits the highest potency against all three cancer cell lines with zzso ranging from zzso zzso in zzso cells to zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso investigation with one zzso analogue (10) shows that the compound zzso cell cycle arrest at zzso phase in zzso cells, but the same compound zzso cell cycle arrest at zzso phase in zzso zzso This result suggests that the zzso activity of these zzso zzso may involve different action mechanisms in cell lines derived from different cancer zzso
