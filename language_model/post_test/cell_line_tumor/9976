To assess the potential of using the residual zzso of zzso zzso zzso after zzso as a marker of zzso in zzso 

zzso cell cultures of zzso and zzso human zzso cell zzso lines were zzso with graded single zzso zzso hours after zzso cells were seeded for standard colony forming zzso zzso In zzso zzso for zzso was performed to zzso the residual zzso 

In the zzso zzso showed a higher zzso than zzso After analysis of the residual zzso data, we constructed zzso survival zzso using two different zzso First, the proportion of zzso with zzso zzso was found to correlate closely with the observed surviving fraction zzso in zzso with a slight zzso of the true zzso in zzso Second, there was a strong linear correlation of the mean number of residual zzso and observed zzso Based on zzso analysis, we calculated the zzso for both cell lines based on the mean number of residual zzso zzso This second approach again led to a good correlation of predicted and observed zzso values in zzso and a zzso zzso in zzso 

In the two cell lines investigated the mean number of residual zzso of zzso can be used to predict differences in the radiation dose response relationship in zzso
