The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso has been implicated largely in stress responses, but an increasing body of evidence has suggested that zzso also plays a role in cell proliferation and zzso We examined the effect of zzso zzso using either zzso or specific zzso zzso on cell proliferation and cell cycle zzso zzso was selective for zzso in zzso and in zzso versus other zzso tested including zzso zzso zzso protein zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso activity and zzso cell proliferation with the same dose zzso suggesting that zzso of proliferation was a direct consequence of zzso zzso zzso of proliferation by zzso was associated with an increase in the zzso and zzso zzso of cells but was not associated with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso but not zzso caused highly significant zzso of cell zzso zzso mouse zzso responded similarly with proliferation zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso were zzso to the effects of zzso suggesting that zzso signaling to zzso is required for cell zzso Studies in synchronized zzso cells indicated that zzso delayed transit time through S and zzso zzso zzso zzso activity increased in late S phase and peaked in late zzso zzso During zzso zzso zzso zzso B levels increased zzso with zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the presence of zzso zzso progression was zzso and zzso zzso was zzso but neither zzso nor zzso zzso was zzso However, the zzso inhibitor zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso and more specifically the zzso zzso plays a key role in cell proliferation and cell cycle zzso In addition, conclusive evidence is presented that a zzso other than zzso most likely zzso or a zzso zzso is responsible for zzso zzso zzso
