The zzso derived growth factor zzso zzso is an important target for novel zzso zzso but agents targeting zzso have been associated with zzso zzso zzso signaling in zzso hearts zzso zzso zzso via a zzso zzso Tight regulation of zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso stimulation is a critical part of any such zzso The objective of the present study was to characterize the early and late regulation of zzso following zzso stimulation and define a potential role for zzso zzso predicted to interact with the zzso of zzso in feedback zzso Using two zzso model systems zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso we observed that in response to stimulation with zzso levels of zzso declined beginning at one hour, zzso for 48 zzso zzso zzso levels declined beginning at zzso after zzso zzso zzso but not late zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were significantly increased in zzso cells and zzso beginning zzso after addition of zzso In response to pressure overload, zzso levels were significantly reduced in the hearts of zzso zzso knockout zzso zzso reporter zzso demonstrate that zzso directly interacts with its predicted seed in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso levels reduces levels of zzso resulting in a reduction in the zzso zzso capacity of zzso consistent with the established function of zzso zzso zzso increase of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, we have identified zzso as an zzso regulator of zzso expression in zzso that is part of a negative feedback loop which serves to zzso zzso expression upon zzso through direct interaction with the zzso of zzso This article is part of a Special zzso entitled zzso zzso
