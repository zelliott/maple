Previously we showed that mild zzso stress increased natural killer zzso zzso zzso zzso and that this could be blocked by zzso or zzso zzso zzso complex zzso class I related chain zzso zzso Here, we investigated the role of the zzso factor heat shock factor 1 zzso in zzso regulation of zzso expression in zzso cells in zzso and in zzso 

zzso experiments were conducted in zzso and in mice using a target temperature of zzso zzso cells and zzso cells in zzso were zzso by use of the zzso zzso or expression of zzso zzso Using zzso cells, zzso message was blocked zzso zzso while zzso reporter zzso were used to measure the activity of the zzso promoter in zzso Cell surface zzso was measured by flow zzso 

Following whole body zzso zzso zzso zzso showed an increase in zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso stress resulted in a transient increase in surface zzso and enhanced zzso zzso of the zzso colon cancer cell zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells prevented the zzso enhancement of zzso message and surface protein levels, with partial loss of zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso of the zzso binding site on the zzso promoter implicated zzso in the zzso enhancement of zzso zzso but not all, zzso colon zzso derived zzso also exhibited an enhanced zzso message expression after zzso 

zzso of zzso expression in zzso cells and enhanced sensitivity to zzso cell killing following mild zzso stress is dependent upon zzso
