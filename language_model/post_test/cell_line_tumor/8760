Many cancer research efforts focus on exploiting zzso features that may be targeted for zzso zzso features of the zzso zzso also represent useful therapeutic zzso Here we investigate the presence of low oxygen tension and sensitivity to zzso zzso of zzso zzso as potential zzso features that may be targeted by hypoxic zzso a class of zzso currently under zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso zzso mediates central vascular dysfunction in zzso zzso is a hypoxic zzso that is also a competitive inhibitor of zzso Here we further investigated the zzso activity of zzso by combining it with zzso inhibitor zzso or with low oxygen content gas zzso zzso were analyzed via multiplex zzso zzso that revealed irreversible loss of zzso and enhanced zzso cell death when zzso was combined with either low oxygen or a zzso zzso zzso growth rate was reduced by zzso + zzso zzso and zzso previously resistant to zzso vascular dysfunction were zzso by low oxygen zzso Additional mapping analysis suggests that zzso with reduced zzso zzso may have greater sensitivity to these zzso These results indicate that poorly zzso zzso vessels, also being zzso organized and with inadequate smooth muscle, may be successfully targeted for significant zzso effects by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso This strategy illustrates a novel use of zzso zzso zzso as vascular targeting agents, and also represents a novel mechanism for targeting zzso zzso
