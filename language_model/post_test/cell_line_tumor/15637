We have used an zzso strategy to test the hypothesis that the Class III zzso zzso factor zzso is rate limiting in the control of the level of expression of the zzso zzso gene in the zzso nucleus of the rat zzso zzso studies in mice have suggested that zzso may contribute to the control of the level of VP gene expression in the adult zzso However, we show here that in zzso cell lines, zzso zzso neither the zzso promoter of the rat VP zzso nor a novel reporter construct consisting of the rat VP structural gene and 3 and 2 zzso of upstream and downstream zzso zzso We zzso that this maybe due either to the lack of zzso elements within the confines of the reporter zzso used, or to the absence in zzso cells, of factors required for zzso zzso As no cell lines exist that zzso to VP zzso we devised an zzso zzso delivery strategy that enabled efficient zzso of zzso in the zzso nucleus of the intact zzso zzso zzso of zzso had no effect on VP zzso zzso Neither did we detect zzso releasing factor zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso in zzso This was unexpected as zzso zzso the zzso zzso promoter in zzso zzso zzso is required for the development of the zzso structures that express VP and zzso these data suggest that this zzso factor is not required, or is not rate limiting, for expression in the zzso
