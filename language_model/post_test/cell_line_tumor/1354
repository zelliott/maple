To investigate the effect of a new zzso zzso zzso zzso therapy on proliferation of human zzso zzso cells in zzso 

Human zzso zzso cells were prepared as 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso suspension, and 1 zzso cells were transferred into 60 zzso culture dish, then treated with 5 different zzso zzso zzso 2, 4, 8, 16 zzso of zzso followed by zzso therapy or dark reaction for 10 zzso The survival rate of the cells and the mode of cell death were detected by flow zzso with the stain of zzso zzso The effect on proliferation of survival cells was observed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso therapy induced the zzso of zzso human zzso cells in the way of late zzso or becoming naked nucleus zzso More than zzso zzso cells in zzso group were dead under the treatment of zzso zzso zzso The survival rates of zzso zzso zzso group were steadily less than zzso The optical zzso did not increase with extension of culture time in zzso zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso There were 16 survival alive cells found occasionally in 2 zzso zzso group, but no colonies found in other zzso 

zzso zzso zzso therapy totally zzso human zzso zzso cells in zzso with the dosage more than 4 zzso
