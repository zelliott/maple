The involvement of the zzso B virus X zzso protein in zzso modifications during zzso has not been previously zzso The aim of the present study was to identify the involvement of zzso in regional zzso and global zzso during the formation of zzso zzso zzso 

Liver cell lines were zzso or zzso zzso with an zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso promoter activity changes were examined by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso status of zzso growth factor binding zzso was examined by zzso zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso Global DNA zzso levels were examined using zzso dot zzso and zzso Southern zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso abnormalities were confirmed in patient zzso samples using zzso zzso chain reaction and zzso dot zzso zzso 

zzso expression increased total zzso activities by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and selectively promoted regional zzso of specific tumor zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso zzso growth zzso expression through de zzso zzso via zzso and zzso and by zzso zzso binding via recruiting zzso zzso binding protein 2 to the newly zzso zzso binding zzso zzso also induced global zzso of satellite 2 repeat sequences by zzso zzso The prevalence of these specific zzso abnormalities by zzso was significantly correlated with zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso deregulation of zzso by zzso promotes both specific regional zzso and global zzso These zzso zzso by zzso may suggest a mechanism for zzso zzso during zzso zzso
