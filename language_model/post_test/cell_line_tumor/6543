zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso in the de zzso synthesis of zzso zzso is a major therapeutic zzso A zzso uncompetitive inhibitor of zzso zzso acid zzso is the active form of zzso zzso zzso a widely used zzso zzso We have found that zzso interacts with zzso zzso in zzso to alter its mobility on zzso zzso zzso also zzso a striking zzso change in zzso protein in intact cells, resulting in the formation of zzso zzso of protein with zzso zzso of zzso zzso These zzso are not associated with any known zzso zzso and are zzso by zzso cells with zzso which zzso zzso zzso or with zzso zzso also restores zzso zzso Treatment of highly zzso zzso with zzso also results in the formation of large zzso of zzso a process that is both prevented and reversed by the addition of zzso Finally, zzso binds to zzso at zzso zzso zzso the formation of linear zzso of zzso zzso and prevents the zzso of protein induced by zzso We conclude that zzso zzso acts as an zzso to zzso by directly binding to zzso and reversing the zzso changes in the zzso
