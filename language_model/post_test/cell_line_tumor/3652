Two relatively recent discoveries stand behind our current effort to investigate the effects of the zzso agent, zzso on the proliferation and survival of zzso zzso The first is that certain zzso compounds such as sodium zzso have zzso ability to catalyze the zzso of zzso and simultaneously generate zzso The second lies in the exquisite zzso of zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso oxygen species zzso zzso due to less efficiency of the cellular defense zzso In this study, we demonstrated that sodium zzso could induce zzso in zzso cells via the classic zzso zzso involving zzso zzso and zzso zzso An increase in the zzso cellular zzso zzso content rendered zzso cells resistant to zzso zzso but could sensitize zzso cells to sodium zzso Moreover, combined treatment of zzso cells with zzso trans zzso acid zzso at low concentration and sodium zzso exhibited a synergistic effect on zzso zzso Together, our results suggest that zzso is a promising candidate for treatment of acute zzso leukemia zzso and the mechanism underlying its zzso effects warrants further zzso
