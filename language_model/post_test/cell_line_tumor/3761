zzso zzso and zzso is an essential regulator of the zzso zzso repair zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso factor in the zzso zzso However, the role of zzso zzso at zzso 196 by zzso has been zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso enhances zzso stability by zzso zzso zzso and subsequent zzso We analyzed stabilization of zzso with zzso of zzso 196 either to zzso zzso a zzso zzso or to zzso zzso a zzso zzso Upon ultraviolet damage, zzso facilitated zzso zzso from the zzso complex to induce zzso zzso However, this regulation was zzso in zzso zzso cells due to persistent association of zzso with this zzso complex, resulting in enhanced zzso of zzso zzso the zzso substitution showed delayed degradation zzso compared with the zzso and less binding with zzso resulting in reduced zzso of zzso We also found that zzso zzso enhanced the zzso retention of zzso the interaction with its binding partners following DNA zzso Taken together, our study presents a novel control mechanism in the zzso zzso by regulating the zzso level of zzso through zzso modifications by which zzso zzso zzso zzso stabilization by zzso zzso zzso zzso
