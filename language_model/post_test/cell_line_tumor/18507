zzso zzso and several zzso zzso zzso have been investigated as a new class of zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso studies in zzso zzso zzso in zzso breast cancer cells show that zzso zzso M zzso of compounds containing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso groups were active, whereas zzso hydrogen, zzso zzso or zzso groups were inactive as zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso was inhibited in zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso induced interactions of zzso with steroid zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso and zzso hormone zzso protein 220 but not with zzso zzso In contrast, zzso but not zzso induced interactions of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibit zzso rat zzso tumor growth, induce differentiation in zzso zzso inhibit zzso cell growth and zzso phase zzso induce zzso and zzso zzso D1 protein and zzso zzso alpha in breast cancer zzso These compounds are a novel class of synthetic zzso zzso that induce responses in zzso cells similar to those observed for zzso
