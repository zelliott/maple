The zzso gene zzso region on the Y zzso was isolated in 1990 and is known as the zzso factor on the Y zzso The zzso has been considered as a zzso factor since it contains an zzso box, which functions as a zzso zzso However, a direct target for zzso remains to be zzso We have investigated the function of zzso through zzso and zzso approaches, and by using two stable zzso cell lines zzso and zzso in zzso cells derived from human zzso zzso cell zzso The results of zzso gel zzso show that zzso zzso causes a considerable zzso of many zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso which is important for zzso cell zzso Additionally, zzso analysis shows that zzso zzso zzso many zinc finger proteins and zzso cellular growth factors with S or zzso arrest of the cell cycle and zzso of cellular zzso
