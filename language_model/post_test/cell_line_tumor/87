zzso zzso class B type I zzso as well as its human zzso zzso plays an important role in reverse cholesterol transport zzso as high density zzso zzso zzso Using a previously developed zzso screening model for zzso zzso zzso was shown to present activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, three other zzso including zzso zzso and zzso were also shown to zzso zzso zzso activity in the zzso reporter zzso The effects of zzso on zzso zzso expression were demonstrated at both zzso and protein levels, and validated by its increasing of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso responsible for the zzso zzso effects were mapped to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso promoter in zzso zzso These findings might provide a new molecular mechanism by which zzso potentially prevent zzso
