A number of zzso derivatives have been zzso and tested as zzso zzso zzso zzso with the aim of obtaining compounds capable to elicit zzso activity at zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso acid zzso resulted one of the most potent and selective derivatives in acutely infected zzso cells zzso and zzso values of 2 and 40 zzso zzso In zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso this compound proved able to inhibit both zzso and disintegration with zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In order to develop a model capable to predict the anti zzso activity and useful to design novel zzso we performed a comparative molecular field analysis zzso like zzso In our model the zzso were described zzso in the zzso program, and the model was zzso by selecting only the most zzso variables in the zzso zzso We found the zzso ability of the model to increase significantly when the number of variables was reduced from zzso to zzso A zzso of zzso was obtained with the final model, confirming the zzso ability of the zzso By studying the zzso zzso in zzso 3-D zzso zzso ideas for the synthesis of new compounds could be zzso
