To investigate the toxic mode of action of zzso zzso the four compounds zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and tested as single chemical entities for their effects on the human zzso cell line zzso zzso and on isolated and cellular zzso zzso zzso The two zzso substances zzso and zzso significantly decreased the amount of total cellular zzso zzso in a dose and time dependent zzso zzso an increase in the level of zzso zzso zzso was zzso The resulting shift in the zzso ratio zzso the breakdown of the cellular zzso reduction potential was accompanied by zzso zzso changes like swelling of the plasma membrane and subsequent zzso of the zzso Additionally, zzso and zzso were found to inhibit cellular zzso in the cells in a concentration dependent zzso The zzso zzso in terms of zzso zzso comparison of the zzso structures zzso and zzso with their zzso and less active zzso zzso and zzso identified the chlorine zzso and the resulting reaction mechanisms to be the key structural zzso of the observed toxic zzso Furthermore, differences in the activity of both zzso substances could be explained using the zzso approach to link the zzso and the intrinsic zzso of the compounds to the expected target site zzso inside the zzso
