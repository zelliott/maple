zzso zzso an active ingredient of zzso zzso has been reported to exhibit zzso zzso and zzso activities through zzso that is not fully zzso In this study, we report the zzso effects of zzso on breast cancer cells, and its potential effect on the zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso exerted strong zzso effect in breast cancer cells and, when combined with zzso and zzso increased zzso zzso was found to increase zzso zzso and zzso positive zzso indicating zzso zzso In addition, zzso activated zzso 8, 9 and 7 in a zzso zzso zzso and invasive properties of zzso cells were also reduced in the presence of zzso Interestingly, we report for the first time that zzso was able to increase zzso activity and zzso the expression of the genes for zzso zzso and zzso in breast cancer zzso More importantly, the increase in zzso activity was prevented in the presence of zzso specific inhibitor and zzso dominant negative zzso suggesting that zzso may act as a zzso of zzso Also, we observed using molecular zzso analysis that zzso indeed formed interactions with 7 polar zzso and 6 zzso zzso within the zzso pocket of zzso that are reported to be critical for its zzso Taken together, our novel observations suggest that zzso may have potential implication in breast cancer prevention and treatment, and show for the first time that the zzso effect of zzso may also be zzso through zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
