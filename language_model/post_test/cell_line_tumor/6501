One of the main functions of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso family is induction of zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso is zzso in highly zzso tumors such as zzso large cell zzso zzso and Hodgkin's zzso zzso zzso stimulation leads to zzso and growth arrest in cultured zzso but not in zzso zzso To identify changes in the zzso program responsible for these opposing effects, we performed gene expression analysis in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines using zzso zzso zzso genes were validated by real-time zzso zzso zzso was applied to the whole zzso and separated the cell lines clearly with respect to their zzso In zzso there were only minor zzso zzso whereas zzso unequivocally showed a pronounced zzso zzso zzso zzso genes zzso of total) were zzso by more than a factor of two after zzso stimulation in zzso zzso The majority of genes identified are involved in cell cycle regulation and zzso zzso expression patterns further indicate that in contrast to zzso zzso stimulation in zzso zzso cell death via the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso These data provide a detailed view on the zzso changes upon zzso stimulation and may explain the observed functional differences of zzso and zzso
