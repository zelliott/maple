zzso zzso zzso have proven safety records with promising clinical zzso However, strategies to improve efficacy are still zzso Here we report greatly improved zzso efficacy for both attenuated zzso and highly potent zzso zzso zzso in combination with the current standard of care for late-stage zzso prostate zzso zzso or zzso In agreement with previous reports, zzso had superior potency compared with zzso both as a single agent and in combination with zzso zzso The zzso zzso caused significant synergistic cell killing in both zzso and zzso prostate cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso respectively, when combined with zzso or zzso The magnitude of the synergistic response was greatest for zzso whereas overall efficacy was greatest for zzso and the latter was also more zzso in zzso in prostate cancer zzso In zzso and zzso cells increased viral zzso (up to zzso and zzso respectively), zzso zzso and altered cell cycle progression contributed to the synergistic cell zzso A similar trend was also detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was essential for the zzso In zzso zzso models zzso and zzso tumor growth zzso was improved when zzso doses of zzso and viral zzso were zzso These findings demonstrate that the efficacy of highly potent zzso zzso such as zzso that target the zzso protein zzso zzso could be further enhanced even with low drug doses, and support the deletion of the zzso region in future candidate zzso for treatment of zzso prostate zzso
