We explored how to assess the zzso potential of zzso particles with a well validated zzso the in zzso zzso zzso zzso detecting both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of three different sizes zzso 60 and 104 zzso and zzso lung zzso cells were selected as zzso Cellular zzso of zzso was monitored by zzso At zzso doses the smallest particles showed a slightly higher fold induction of zzso zzso When considering the three zzso together, particle number and total surface area appeared to account for zzso induction as they both correlated significantly with the zzso of the zzso Using nominal or cellular dose did not show statistically significant zzso Likewise, alkaline comet zzso and zzso probing of zzso indicated a weak and not statistically significant induction of zzso DNA damage, zzso breakage and zzso zzso This line of investigation will contribute to adequately design and interpret zzso zzso
