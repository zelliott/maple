A variety of zzso including zzso zzso show zzso zzso of zzso which plays a pivotal role in negative regulation of zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso of zzso signals would improve the efficacy of T cell adoptive transfer therapy by reversal of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso treatment of zzso cells with zzso a zzso zzso reversed highly zzso status of zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso in zzso zzso mice, but not zzso mice, resulted in prolonged survival, suggesting a role of zzso immunity in the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso promoted maturation of zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso of zzso zzso T cells, enhanced zzso cells and zzso production of zzso a critical zzso for attraction of zzso zzso When zzso zzso administration was combined with zzso transfer of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice exhibited prolonged survival compared with zzso zzso or zzso zzso therapy zzso zzso zzso analyses of brain zzso zzso revealed that zzso enhanced the zzso of zzso transferred zzso cells in a zzso zzso zzso zzso administration also zzso serum zzso levels, and promoted the persistence of transferred zzso in the zzso These data suggest that systemic zzso of zzso signaling can reverse the zzso zzso environment of zzso tumor bearing mice both zzso and locally, thereby promoting the efficacy of adoptive transfer therapy with zzso
