Local zzso is a characteristic feature of zzso that makes surgical zzso nearly impossible and accounts in large part for its poor zzso To identify mechanisms underlying zzso invasion and zzso we used zzso invasion chambers to select for a more zzso invasive zzso of zzso human zzso zzso The stable population of tumor cells zzso obtained through this in zzso selection process were three times more invasive than parental zzso cells and demonstrated faster zzso wound healing and enhanced zzso zzso from cell zzso This enhanced zzso was associated with an zzso increase in zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso No differences in expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were zzso However, zzso cells exhibited zzso zzso of tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso and protein relative to parental zzso zzso addition of comparable levels of zzso zzso to parental zzso cells increased zzso zzso and zzso Similarly, zzso cells engineered to zzso zzso at the same levels as zzso cells also demonstrated increased zzso zzso indicating that an increase in zzso levels of zzso can promote zzso zzso and invasion in zzso zzso However, zzso administration or zzso zzso of higher amounts of zzso in zzso cells resulted in zzso of zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the complex balance between zzso and zzso is a critical zzso of zzso invasion, and indicate that increasing zzso in zzso patients may potentially cause adverse effects, particularly in tumors containing high levels of zzso and zzso
