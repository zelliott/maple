zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso may play a role in prostate cancer zzso We found previously that, in prostate cancer cells, zzso is zzso by both zzso and zzso via a zzso zzso We now show that, in prostate cancer cells, stimulation with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso by inducing zzso zzso response zzso protein zzso zzso Both sex steroids zzso zzso at zzso in a zzso manner in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, whereas only zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso involved zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso but not protein zzso A, protein zzso C, or zzso zzso II, and occurred also in cells zzso with zzso or zzso zzso zzso that do not zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and promoter zzso We also showed that zzso binds to zzso promoter region and identified the relevant zzso site at the zzso region zzso of zzso zzso In conclusion, we describe a novel mechanism of zzso zzso and promoter activity by zzso zzso induced by sex steroids, through a zzso zzso
