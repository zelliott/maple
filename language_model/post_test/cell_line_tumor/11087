To investigate the distribution of regulatory zzso in the zzso zzso with zzso zzso tumor cells, as compared with that of zzso tumor cells, to investigate the mechanism underlining tumor zzso 

Three different zzso tumor cells were zzso with zzso zzso individually to mimic cancer immunity in zzso The proliferation response of zzso was measured by zzso zzso The distribution of zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso T cells and zzso zzso T cells were analyzed by flow zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso was measured by zzso zzso 

The stimulation Index of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso was much higher than that of poorly zzso melanoma zzso In each group, stimulation Index of zzso zzso with zzso tumor cells was higher than that of the corresponding tumor immunity zzso In addition, compared with those of zzso tumors, there were more zzso zzso and less zzso zzso T cells in the zzso and higher zzso and lower zzso levels in the zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso tumor cells can induce the proliferation of zzso cells, which may play an important role in tumor zzso
