zzso zzso zzso zzso which was zzso with a zzso zzso zzso the zzso single chain zzso zzso was zzso in order to effectively deliver zzso zzso into zzso zzso This zzso was zzso first with zzso iron oxide zzso zzso to get a zzso targeted zzso zzso zzso and then with zzso zzso to form zzso showing low zzso The targeting capacity of zzso was successfully verified in zzso and in zzso by magnetic resonance zzso The single chain zzso zzso targeted zzso was more effective in transferring zzso zzso than the zzso one in zzso cells, a human zzso cell line, resulting in a zzso zzso in the expression of zzso zzso zzso a high level of cell zzso up to zzso and a significant suppression of tumor growth were zzso which indicates that zzso is a promising magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso for targeted zzso zzso therapy and zzso
