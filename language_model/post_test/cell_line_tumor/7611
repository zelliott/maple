To screen the zzso expressed genes in human zzso zzso zzso zzso cells using suppression zzso zzso zzso and to explore their biological function and underlying mechanism in zzso zzso 

Total zzso were extracted from human zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso and human normal zzso cell line zzso cells, and zzso technology was used to construct a zzso cell library of differential expression genes and to screen the most zzso expressed zzso zzso interference zzso was constructed to silence the expression of the zzso expressed gene zzso in human zzso cell lines zzso and zzso zzso index was estimated by cell zzso zzso and tumor zzso zzso Cell cycle analysis was performed using zzso activated cell zzso Drug resistance potential to zzso was assessed by zzso 

A zzso zzso library of highly expressed genes in the zzso cells was constructed and 12 zzso expressed genes were screened from the zzso library, in which zzso was the most differently expressed gene in the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cells and clinical samples was confirmed by zzso and Western zzso zzso The zzso expression zzso targeting to zzso gene was constructed and zzso into zzso and zzso cells, resulting in zzso of zzso zzso zzso inhibited the cell proliferation zzso zzso zzso and zzso The tumor weights formed by zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso and that of negative control zzso was zzso zzso zzso The tumor weight formed by zzso cells was zzso zzso zzso and that of control zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells showed that more cells were arrested at zzso phase zzso zzso zzso than that in the negative control zzso cells zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The proportion of zzso phase in the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells was zzso zzso zzso significantly higher than that of zzso zzso zzso in the negative control zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and enhanced their sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso Silence of zzso caused zzso of zzso signaling and zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso 

A zzso expressed gene zzso in the zzso zzso zzso is successfully screened using zzso zzso zzso functions as an zzso in zzso and may become a novel molecular target for zzso diagnosis and zzso
