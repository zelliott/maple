zzso cluster zzso are disclosed to contribute to the development of multiple zzso and zzso but their roles in zzso development remains zzso In this study, we found that zzso a member of zzso was highly expressed in the pancreatic zzso cells, and zzso could target the 3' zzso of zzso zzso to decrease its protein and zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso exerted little effect on the proliferation of pancreatic zzso whereas it inhibited the expression of insulin 1, but not insulin 2 in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso can zzso insulin 1 expression through targeting zzso factor zzso and thus regulate the differentiation and function of zzso
