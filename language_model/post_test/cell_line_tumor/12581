zzso were extracted from tissue in tumor burden zones, zzso normal zones and interface zones between tumor and normal tissue of human breast zzso and the corresponding zzso were designated as zzso zzso zzso normal zone zzso zzso and interface zone zzso zzso The zzso between three types of zzso and breast cancer cells was evaluated using an in zzso direct zzso zzso We found that zzso grew faster and expressed higher levels of zzso zzso protein than did zzso and zzso Compared with zzso and zzso zzso grown with breast cancer cells were significantly more effective in inducing an zzso transition zzso in cancer cells, as indicated by induction of zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso This zzso process was also accompanied by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso promoted breast cell migration to a larger extent compared with zzso and zzso Taken together, these findings indicate that zzso isolated from the tumor interface zone exhibited more robust biological zzso activity than did zzso and zzso isolated from normal and tumor zones of the same tumor zzso suggesting that the interface zone of the tumor represents a dynamic region vital to tumor zzso
