The zzso system has been shown to zzso key zzso pathways involved in cancer cell zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited human breast cancer cell zzso being more effective in highly invasive zzso zzso cells than in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso effect was not accompanied by zzso or necrosis and was characterized by a zzso cell cycle arrest, decreased expression of zzso D and zzso and increased levels of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso We have also shown that zzso exerted a significant zzso action, in zzso by reducing the volume of zzso tumors induced by zzso injection in zzso On the other hand, at the concentration range in which we observed the zzso effect in tumor cells, we did not observe evidence of any zzso effect on normal zzso Our data also indicate that the zzso zzso effect requires zzso zzso integrity to zzso Indeed, we found that zzso zzso zzso is completely displaced from zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, and cholesterol depletion by zzso strongly prevented zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso zzso human breast cancer cell growth via a zzso zzso zzso zzso
