The zzso zzso sorting zzso of the zzso family have been proposed to mediate retrieval of zzso proteins from the zzso zzso In this paper, we describe a stable isotope labeling with zzso acids in zzso quantitative zzso approach that allows an zzso global identification of zzso zzso that are rescued from zzso degradation by zzso This screen revealed that several zzso required zzso for their stability, as depletion of zzso led to a loss of zzso and zzso zzso and associated a zzso from zzso cells as a result of increased zzso zzso zzso bound to the membrane zzso zzso motif in zzso zzso zzso tails, thereby preventing zzso degradation of zzso zzso and their associated a zzso Furthermore, zzso retrieval of zzso did not depend on the zzso zzso zzso with an effect on zzso recycling, depletion of zzso also caused zzso in cell zzso Our data provide zzso insight into the retrieval of zzso zzso from the zzso degradation pathway, a prerequisite for subsequent recycling of these zzso zzso
