The insulin zzso zzso zzso family plays important roles in cellular growth, zzso and survival in the zzso We identified zzso a member of the zzso family, also expressed in zzso zzso expression level significantly increased during zzso differentiation of zzso zzso To understand the mechanism of zzso gene expression and regulation during zzso zzso we first mapped the zzso start site of the mouse zzso gene and characterized its promoter zzso zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso promoter identified the zzso binding element responsible for the repression of zzso promoter zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso in the mouse heart allows zzso to be a zzso regulator of zzso zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso zzso zzso confirmed that zzso could bind to the zzso promoter, accompanied by zzso zzso from the nucleus to zzso zzso zzso could inhibit zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso expression by zzso zzso the expression of zzso and enhanced zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso Our results provide the first evidence that zzso the zzso downstream zzso acts as a zzso zzso to inhibit the expression of zzso zzso is involved in zzso differentiation by a zzso signaling zzso
