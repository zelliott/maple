zzso cells typically express zzso zzso yet they are notoriously resistant to zzso zzso Here, we show that sodium zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso in human melanoma cells in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso was associated with zzso induction of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso of zzso by an zzso zzso zzso the cells to zzso zzso whereas its zzso zzso resistance to this zzso Increased zzso levels and activity impaired zzso zzso of zzso promoter and zzso protein zzso Finally, using zzso melanoma cell line and zzso interference in cells expressing zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso induction and zzso zzso is zzso zzso
