zzso zzso plays an important role in tumor zzso growth, and zzso We have tested a targeted probe to zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso using zzso fluorescent zzso zzso 

A transgenic zzso mouse model zzso glioblastoma, which mimics the zzso growth pattern of human zzso and two human zzso zzso models zzso zzso with high zzso zzso expression and zzso with low zzso zzso zzso were zzso An zzso zzso probe, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was tested by in zzso and ex zzso zzso zzso 

We show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically binds to zzso zzso zzso is selectively localized to zzso tissue with zzso zzso receptors and is retained over prolonged periods of time; zzso is associated with minimal zzso and zzso because of imaging at 800 zzso zzso provides zzso of tumor tissue with high precision because of a high zzso brain zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso models, zzso P zzso zzso and zzso enables zzso zzso zzso zzso small zzso of residual zzso were observed after zzso was completed using white light imaging alone, and these fluorescent zzso were shown to represent residual tumor tissue by zzso 

zzso imaging with the zzso zzso probe provides a simple, zzso low-cost, zzso and highly zzso approach for improved zzso zzso zzso and zzso It also has the potential to serve as an imaging platform for zzso cancer detection and drug efficacy evaluation zzso
