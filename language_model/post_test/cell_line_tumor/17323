zzso zzso zzso are zzso tumors that are genetically characterized by the presence of zzso zzso that generate the fusion gene zzso or zzso For the study of the zzso consequences of such zzso several cell lines have been zzso However, established cell lines accumulate zzso and genetic aberrations that make it difficult to draw significant zzso We have applied a set of techniques that includes spectral zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso comparative zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the most commonly used cell lines carrying the two fusion genes that are present in zzso We have identified the bacterial artificial zzso that cover the zzso at genes zzso zzso and zzso which can be used as FISH zzso for the zzso The zzso cell line, positive for the zzso fusion zzso was found to be highly zzso wide range of zzso number, more than 50 zzso zzso amplification of the hybrid zzso 24 DNA changes detected by conventional zzso and 21 gene copy changes detected by zzso zzso (including several high-level zzso zzso cell line, positive for the zzso was in the zzso range with only zzso structural zzso amplification of the hybrid zzso 24 DNA changes by zzso and 8 gene copy changes, confirming the previously reported high-level amplification of zzso
