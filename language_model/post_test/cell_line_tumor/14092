In many zzso zzso zzso of zzso is considered the final zzso In this study, we studied zzso induced zzso zzso with zzso resonance energy transfer zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso was used as the zzso zzso zzso zzso images were collected after zzso or zzso induced zzso By analyzing the dynamic changes of zzso fluorescence, the results indicate that the zzso zzso started immediately after the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso disruption caused by zzso zzso started at zzso after zzso treatment, due to different signaling zzso The results have zzso for the first time, that zzso is a sensitive technique that can be used to investigate zzso zzso of zzso in real-time and in single zzso By choosing appropriate zzso zzso as zzso zzso it is likely that zzso technique will provide a new real-time means to study the mechanism of zzso at single cell zzso
