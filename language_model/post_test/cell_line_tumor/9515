zzso nuclear zzso zzso a zinc finger zzso is the most abundant zzso factor in the zzso zzso regulates a large number of genes involved in most aspects of zzso zzso The present study was undertaken to determine the role of zzso in zinc protection against tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso Mice were treated with zzso zzso via intravenous injection at 20 zzso body zzso 30 zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso body zzso Two doses of zinc zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso body zzso were administered at 36 and 12 zzso before zzso treatment via subcutaneous zzso zzso treatment after zzso induced liver injury as detected by plasma zzso zzso activity and zzso cell death in the zzso zzso zzso attenuated zzso liver zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso 3 and zzso 8 in the liver were significantly inhibited by zinc zzso The zzso and protein levels of zzso in the liver were remarkably decreased by zzso treatment, which was suppressed by zzso To determine if zzso depletion is involved in zzso zzso to zzso zzso mice were administered either zzso or zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso depletion in the liver is associated with zzso zzso but not zzso zzso To define the link between zzso depletion and zzso cell death, the effect of zzso the zzso gene by zzso zzso on zzso zzso was determined in zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that neither zzso nor zzso zzso zzso had a toxic effect, but zzso treatment after zzso zzso zzso caused zzso cell zzso These results suggest that zinc protects against zzso zzso at least zzso through preservation of the zinc finger protein zzso
