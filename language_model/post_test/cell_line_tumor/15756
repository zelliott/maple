zzso zzso zzso signaling has been directly linked to zzso zzso a common zzso brain tumor in zzso zzso is an zzso zzso inhibitor zzso currently under clinical investigation as an zzso zzso Treatment of a zzso patient with zzso initially zzso tumors, but this individual ultimately relapsed with a zzso resistance zzso in zzso zzso the molecular target of zzso To explore the role of the zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso function, we zzso zzso with every zzso acid and found that all functional zzso were resistant to zzso with positively charged zzso zzso potential zzso zzso zzso scan zzso of zzso further identified zzso as a novel prospective zzso site for zzso zzso To overcome this form of acquired resistance, we screened a panel of chemically diverse zzso and identified several zzso with potent in zzso activity against these zzso zzso zzso The zzso compound 5 was of particular interest, as it was able to inhibit tumor growth zzso by drug resistant zzso in a zzso zzso model of zzso However, focal zzso of the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and the zzso target gene zzso D1 zzso were observed in two additional resistant models, indicating that resistance may also occur downstream of zzso zzso these zzso resistant zzso zzso retained their sensitivity to zzso zzso presenting additional opportunities for the treatment of such zzso
