Studies with genetically modified zzso cells suggest that group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in amplifying zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso cells that zzso zzso for example, exhibit amplified zzso responses to zzso and zzso zzso To determine whether similar effects occur in whole animals, we prepared transgenic zzso mice in which the rat insulin 1 promoter zzso drives zzso zzso and two characterized zzso mouse lines exhibit similar zzso Their pancreatic zzso zzso expression is increased zzso as reflected by quantitative zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso microscopic studies of pancreatic sections confirm zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso without obviously zzso zzso zzso Male zzso mice exhibit lower blood zzso and higher plasma insulin zzso than zzso zzso mice when zzso and develop lower blood zzso levels in zzso tolerance tests, but zzso and zzso blood zzso levels do not differ in insulin tolerance zzso zzso from male zzso mice exhibit greater amplification of zzso insulin zzso by a zzso agent than zzso zzso In contrast, zzso from male zzso mice exhibit blunted insulin zzso and those mice have impaired zzso zzso zzso incorporation into and the zzso composition of zzso zzso are normal, but they exhibit reduced zzso delayed zzso current and prolonged zzso action zzso and zzso of zzso zzso concentration that suggest a molecular mechanism for the zzso role of zzso to amplify insulin zzso
