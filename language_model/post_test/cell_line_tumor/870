zzso cancer zzso progression from an zzso to an zzso state occurs in patients who undergo hormonal zzso There is evidence indicating that deregulation of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in this zzso In this study we addressed the question by zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso into the zzso zzso cell line zzso that expresses high levels of zzso The resulting cell line has been named zzso We showed that the introduction of the zzso restored positive zzso regulation of zzso cell growth and gene expression in zzso The zzso cells grown in culture medium containing zzso exhibited a transient zzso of zzso levels with a subsequent zzso This phenomenon was zzso upon addition of zzso zzso to the culture zzso but after prolonged zzso When the zzso repression is relieved in the presence of zzso the cells become more responsive either to zzso zzso growth or to zzso effect of zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso Moreover, we found a significant increase of the activated form of zzso zzso zzso in cells treated with zzso zzso blocked this zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso of zzso is an event dependent on zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that hormone sensitive zzso cells possess a mechanism able to limit zzso zzso zzso of zzso in response to long-term zzso treatment could represent an attempt to rescue cell growth through a zzso survival zzso
