The nuclear hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso is a key zzso factor regulating genes involved in zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso Moreover, zzso has been demonstrated to control proliferation and zzso in various cancer zzso We investigated the biological effects of zzso zzso by the oral zzso agent zzso in Barrett's zzso cells in zzso and in zzso 

zzso zzso and protein were zzso in zzso zzso of Barrett's zzso and the human Barrett's zzso cancer cell line zzso as compared to normal esophagus and stomach and the zzso zzso zzso cancer cell line zzso zzso zzso by zzso in zzso cells in zzso led to reduced cell growth by induction of zzso zzso of systemic zzso zzso by the zzso zzso on tumor cell proliferation and zzso were then assessed in zzso in nude mice bearing zzso Barrett's zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso enhanced growth of zzso derived zzso zzso was observed in zzso zzso mice upon systemic zzso treatment due to increased cell zzso 

These results indicate that zzso is involved in the molecular zzso of Barrett's zzso formation and zzso However, zzso of zzso exerts differential effects on growth of Barrett's zzso cells in zzso and in zzso emphasizing the importance of additional cell context specific factors and systemic zzso status for the zzso of zzso action in zzso
