Despite the high zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso gene amplification and zzso in zzso no suitable cell line exists that preserves these zzso in zzso and is zzso in zzso zzso On the basis of previous observations that zzso cells cultured with serum lose the zzso amplification rapidly and that zzso can inhibit the growth of zzso tumor cells, we hypothesized that zzso and zzso culture conditions could promote maintenance of the zzso zzso 

zzso from zzso zzso were taken into culture using neural stem cell conditions with zzso including varying oxygen zzso and omission of routine zzso zzso 

zzso zzso amplification was rapidly lost in 5 zzso cultures supplemented with zzso whereas it was preserved in cultures from the same tumors established without zzso zzso from 2 zzso developed into pairs of cell lines, with either stable maintenance or irreversible loss of high-level zzso amplification in the majority of zzso One zzso cell line preserved expression of the zzso zzso zzso Cell lines with high-level zzso zzso expression formed highly aggressive tumors in nude mice, whereas zzso cell lines were either zzso or grew significantly more zzso In contrast, zzso cell lines proliferated faster in zzso All cell lines responded to zzso with zzso of zzso zzso and proliferation but partly different effects on downstream signaling and zzso 

zzso zzso cell lines maintaining stable differences in zzso status can be derived by varying exposure to zzso zzso and reflect the zzso genetic zzso
