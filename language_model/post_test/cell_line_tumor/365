Here we report that zzso zzso variable degrees of zzso in human zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso multiple arms of the zzso zzso stress response, including zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso initiation factor alpha zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer cells to zzso zzso A similar result was obtained by the zzso of zzso using small interfering zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a significant zzso of zzso zzso of zzso indicating that zzso of zzso is a downstream event of zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso might be a novel mechanism underlying the resistance of zzso cancer cells to zzso zzso A combination of compounds capable of suppressing zzso might be a golden approach for improving the effectiveness of zzso
