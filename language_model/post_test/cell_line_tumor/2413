zzso vessel growth or zzso occurs during embryonic development and wound healing and plays an important role in tumor zzso and inflammatory zzso However, the possibility of zzso detection and zzso of zzso has been zzso Here, we present the zzso mouse model, where an zzso fusion zzso expressed under the zzso zzso control of the zzso zzso allows the monitoring of zzso and pathological zzso in zzso We show tracking of zzso vessel development during zzso as well as zzso induced by specific growth factors, during wound healing and in contact hypersensitivity zzso inflammation where we also monitor zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso the zzso allowed us to tracking zzso zzso at the tumor periphery and in zzso zzso in association with the zzso zzso This is the first reporter mouse model for zzso imaging of zzso It should provide an important tool for studying the involvement of zzso in pathological zzso
