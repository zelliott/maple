zzso of an zzso in a primary cell can, zzso block proliferation by inducing zzso or zzso through pathways that remain to be zzso Here we perform zzso zzso screening to identify 17 genes required for an activated zzso zzso zzso to block proliferation of human primary zzso and zzso Surprisingly, we find a zzso zzso zzso has a central role in zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in primary cells leads to synthesis and zzso of zzso which acts through zzso pathways to inhibit zzso signaling and induce zzso and zzso zzso results from zzso zzso of zzso a zzso zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso human melanoma cell lines, and zzso administered zzso markedly suppresses growth of zzso tumors in zzso zzso zzso analysis of human skin, zzso and melanoma samples implicates loss of zzso expression as a critical step in melanoma zzso
