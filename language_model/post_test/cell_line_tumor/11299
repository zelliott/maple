zzso zzso several zzso including zzso major zzso complex class I zzso zzso proteins A and B zzso and unique long zzso proteins zzso These zzso are present on cancer cells and are zzso by zzso in a zzso manner, triggering natural killer zzso cell zzso However, the mechanisms that control the expression of zzso zzso in zzso cells are poorly zzso zzso D3 zzso was recently shown to enhance the zzso of melanoma cells to the zzso of zzso zzso However, the function of zzso in other zzso and its potential mechanisms of action remain zzso 

The expression levels of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were evaluated using quantitative real-time zzso The targets of zzso and zzso were confirmed by zzso reporter zzso The killing effects of zzso cells against zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were examined using the zzso 96 zzso zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso and zzso B, which indicate the zzso of zzso cells, were also measured by zzso zzso zzso 

Treatment with zzso enhanced the zzso of both the zzso zzso cell line zzso and solid zzso cell line zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression was zzso and their levels zzso correlated with the levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso upon zzso zzso A zzso reporter zzso revealed that zzso and zzso directly targeted the zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso regulated the expression of zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso or zzso by zzso of their mimics remarkably reduced the viability of zzso cells upon zzso cell zzso By contrast, the suppression of the activity of zzso or zzso by their respective zzso zzso improved the resistance of zzso cells to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso the zzso of zzso cells against zzso cells partly through zzso of zzso and zzso and hence zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso
