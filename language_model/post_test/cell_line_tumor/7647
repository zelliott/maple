zzso expression of zzso rendered zzso breast cancer cells resistant to zzso via zzso zzso zzso of zzso It is unclear whether an zzso therapy may abrogate zzso zzso resistance in breast zzso Here, we study the zzso activity of an zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso against zzso breast zzso 

Cell growth zzso were used to determine cell zzso zzso undergoing zzso were zzso by a specific zzso zzso Western zzso analyses were performed to assess the protein expression and zzso zzso zzso containing zzso was used to specifically zzso zzso zzso zzso were established by zzso of zzso cells into nude zzso The zzso mice were treated with zzso and/or zzso to determine whether the zzso zzso enhances zzso zzso zzso zzso was carried out to study the zzso effects on tumor cell proliferation and induction of zzso in zzso 

zzso significantly facilitated zzso zzso effects on zzso cells zzso with a control zzso or zzso zzso It specifically zzso zzso associated with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso enhances zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso cells dramatically enhanced zzso zzso suggesting that increased zzso caused a zzso to zzso Furthermore, the studies using a tumor zzso zzso from zzso cells revealed that either zzso (10 zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso had no effect on tumor growth, their combinations significantly inhibited tumor growth in zzso zzso analysis showed that the combinations of zzso and zzso significantly reduced the cells with positive zzso for zzso and zzso and increased the cells with zzso zzso 

The combinations of zzso and zzso not only inhibit tumor cell zzso but also promote zzso breast cancer cells to undergo zzso via zzso of zzso in zzso and in zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso with zzso enhances zzso zzso activity against zzso breast zzso Our data supports further exploration of the zzso regimens consisting of zzso and zzso in breast cancer patients with zzso tumors, particularly those resistant to zzso
