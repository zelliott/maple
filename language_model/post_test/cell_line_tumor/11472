zzso zzso is a term that refers to the design, fabrication and use of zzso that are mainly composed of zzso via bottom-up zzso The packaging zzso zzso of the zzso zzso DNA packaging motor has been developed into a zzso zzso This protocol describes the zzso assembly and zzso of zzso zzso on the basis of three zzso derived from zzso structural features: interlocking zzso for hand-in-hand zzso zzso sequences for zzso interactions and an zzso three-way junction for branch zzso zzso zzso zzso chemical zzso zzso and other zzso can also be fused to the zzso before the assembly of the zzso so as to ensure the production of homogeneous zzso and the retention of appropriate folding and function of the incorporated zzso The resulting zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso and chemically stable, and they remain intact at zzso zzso zzso effects are progressively enhanced with increasing numbers of zzso in each zzso zzso zzso injection of the zzso zzso into zzso mice has revealed strong binding to tumors without zzso in vital zzso or zzso The zzso zzso scaffold zzso a new way for zzso application of zzso zzso for disease detection and zzso The time required for completing one round of this protocol is zzso weeks when including in zzso functional zzso or 2-3 months when including in zzso zzso
