Type IV zzso are a major zzso factor of the zzso human pathogen zzso zzso (the zzso zzso zzso facilitate bacterial adherence to zzso cells, but their participation in later steps of zzso infection, particularly zzso replication and exit, is poorly zzso Using polarized zzso cells as a model for mature zzso zzso zzso dynamics in zzso zzso zzso were examined over zzso zzso infection was characterized by a zzso delay in the growth of zzso bacteria and by zzso exit of zzso the first time these phenomena have been zzso During infection, zzso progeny arose zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and exited from zzso cell zzso equally well, demonstrating that zzso did not influence zzso survival during zzso zzso The frequency with which zzso zzso arose from a defined zzso zzso during zzso cell infection was found to be sufficiently high to account for the extensive zzso variation reported during human zzso However, the repertoire of zzso appearing in association with zzso cells was similar to what was seen in the absence of cells, demonstrating that polarized zzso cells can support zzso replication without selecting for a subset of zzso zzso or zzso zzso
