In this study, we investigate the zzso activity of zzso in zzso human zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso and zzso activity in human zzso vein zzso cells zzso We show that zzso zzso the cell viability and zzso zzso zzso phase arrest in zzso cells with a dose dependent zzso zzso cells, not zzso dealing with zzso exhibited typical characteristics of zzso which were accompanied by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso treatment resulted in a decrease of zzso and increase of zzso of zzso and inhibited zzso levels of zzso zzso 9) in zzso zzso zzso medium of zzso zzso or growth zzso tube formation of zzso was markedly inhibited by zzso treatment, which was associated with the zzso zzso zzso from zzso cells by zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso cell growth and zzso by targeting zzso zzso and suppressing zzso zzso
