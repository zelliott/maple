Reports on hormone zzso expression of pancreatic cancer zzso cells and treatment responses to zzso therapy are zzso We examined zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells and investigated its function in zzso cell zzso 

zzso levels of zzso and zzso in 8 human zzso lines were detected by Western zzso zzso Cell proliferation was measured by zzso B zzso zzso zzso included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso levels were detected in all eight, and zzso in seven cell zzso zzso ratio ranged from zzso to 111 zzso zzso zzso in seven zzso Median zzso growth stimulation (in zzso observed at 20 to 200 zzso was 19 zzso 39 zzso 20 zzso 22 zzso and -9 zzso median zzso zzso (at 40 to 60 zzso was 59 zzso 36 zzso 25 zzso 43 zzso and 50 zzso The extent of zzso and Gen zzso effects correlated with the zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso levels zzso Only zzso zzso correlated with the zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso and with zzso expression zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (at zzso was significantly reduced by zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso proliferation in zzso is highly zzso sensitive, and in contrast to other reports, zzso are frequently zzso In zzso cell lines, zzso expression outweighs zzso zzso The impact of the zzso ratio on zzso growth stimulation and reduced zzso at zzso zzso may have clinical implications on zzso zzso
