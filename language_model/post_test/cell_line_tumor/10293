We performed a zzso zzso screen and identified 70 zzso altering cell migration in zzso lung cancer zzso In particular, zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso increased, whereas zzso and zzso zzso inhibited cell zzso In a secondary zzso three-dimensional invasion screen, 38 of our hits zzso including zzso and zzso In two further lung cancer cell lines, zzso but not zzso zzso showed identical zzso of cell zzso We therefore selected zzso for further zzso zzso analysis followed by zzso validation revealed that the zzso regulators zzso and zzso interact with zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso on zzso a site regulating its binding to zzso In addition, zzso of zzso enhanced the zzso potential of these cells in zzso using a zzso zzso Finally, we investigated the relevance of this finding in human lung cancer zzso In zzso matched zzso zzso was reduced in zzso versus primary lung cancer zzso Moreover, patients with zzso lung zzso showed increased number of zzso Our results suggest that the findings of our zzso in zzso screen can reliably identify relevant clinical targets and as a proof of principle, zzso may provide a zzso for zzso in lung cancer zzso
