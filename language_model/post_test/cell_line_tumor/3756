zzso serves as an zzso zzso for zzso fluid and its zzso zzso is zzso in zzso cells and, recently, we have revealed a functional role for zzso in fueling cancer cell growth through the zzso of zzso zzso which is zzso into a usable source of zzso zzso zzso Assessing zzso has been challenging in the past because of the lack of reliable zzso capable of zzso measuring this zzso zzso Here we describe a protocol for visualizing and zzso the extent of zzso in cells both in culture and growing in zzso as tumor zzso By using this approach, the zzso zzso of a particular cell line or subcutaneous tumor can be zzso within 1-2 zzso The protocol can be carried out with multiple samples in parallel and can be easily adapted for a variety of cell types and zzso or zzso mouse zzso
