zzso zzso domain zzso zzso proteins of the zzso zzso zzso play a key role as initiators of zzso zzso To date, at least 10 zzso zzso proteins have been identified, and it is now being realized that they have different roles and mechanisms of regulation in the zzso of zzso signals to zzso zzso is one of the zzso zzso proteins implicated in a variety of zzso and pathological zzso yet the molecular mechanism involved in zzso zzso remains poorly zzso In an attempt to identify cellular proteins participating in zzso zzso we have conducted zzso zzso screening for zzso proteins and isolated zzso a zzso protein that has been shown to form a channel consisting of its zzso In zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso analyses verified specific interaction and zzso of zzso and zzso both of which depended on the presence of the highly zzso zzso region of zzso zzso zzso zzso was suppressed by the expression of zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso signal sequence zzso and the zzso zzso region zzso zzso which are expected to inhibit binding of zzso competitively to the zzso zzso protein and to disrupt the channel function of zzso zzso Furthermore, small interfering zzso zzso of zzso zzso protection against zzso zzso Altogether, these results suggest that zzso may be a key zzso that links zzso to zzso and is critically involved in the regulation of zzso zzso
