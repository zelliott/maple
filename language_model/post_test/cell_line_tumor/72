To investigate the effect of zzso zzso derived factor zzso on the growth of lung cancer cells and the zzso zzso 

The full length of human zzso gene was amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso Human lung cancer cells of the line zzso were cultured and zzso with zzso An zzso expression zzso constructed by zzso DNA technology, so as to construct the zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso were used to confirm the zzso and protein expression of zzso in these zzso Another zzso lung cancer cells were zzso with blank plasmids zzso zzso The zzso cells not zzso were called zzso zzso The 3 kinds of zzso cells were zzso in the zzso membrane zzso of chick zzso hatched for 7 days zzso The size and weigh of the tumor were zzso The vessels density was zzso 

The tumor volume of the zzso group was zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly smaller than that of the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the mass of the zzso group was zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly smaller than that of the control group too zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The amount of first class zzso of the zzso group was (15 zzso zzso significantly fewer than that of the control group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The amount of second class zzso of the zzso group was (75 zzso zzso also significantly fewer than that of the control group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso the growth of lung cancer cells and zzso zzso protein may be used as a potential biological drug to treat lung zzso
