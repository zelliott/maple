The fetal and zzso zzso is influenced by zzso conditions experienced zzso Among prenatal development zzso factors are of particular importance as they are supposed to zzso for zzso zzso later in life and to pioneer functional impairment in zzso zzso zzso zzso now the mechanisms of zzso programming are not well zzso We have investigated various zzso of zzso during differentiation of zzso zzso embryonic zzso cells zzso into zzso zzso zzso cells were exposed to zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso 40 zzso or zzso zzso zzso for 48 h during zzso body zzso formation, followed by zzso and differentiation into zzso in zzso with standard zzso supplementation zzso zzso for zzso zzso The amount of cardiac zzso the frequency of spontaneous beatings as well as the expression of zzso and cardiac marker genes and their promoter zzso were zzso We observed a zzso programming effect of zzso during cardiac zzso Whereas the number of beating clusters and the expression of the cardiac marker alpha zzso heavy chain zzso were comparable in all groups, the zzso of beating clusters were significantly higher in the high zzso group compared to low zzso However, neither the insulin zzso zzso or insulin like growth factor 1 zzso zzso nor the zzso gene zzso zzso 4 zzso were influenced in zzso expression or in promoter zzso Our data indicate that a short time zzso stress during embryonic cell determination leads to lasting effects in terminally differentiated cell zzso
