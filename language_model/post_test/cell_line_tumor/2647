It is well established that cancer cells can fuse with zzso cells to form hybrid cells spontaneously, which zzso cancer cells zzso the zzso barrier to form zzso However, up to now, little is known about the zzso characteristics of hybrid zzso zzso we investigate the zzso zzso behaviors and proteins expression of the hybrid cell line zzso with its parent cell line zzso 

Cell counting and flow zzso zzso were carried out to assess cell zzso The number of cells attached to the zzso zzso zzso was measured by zzso zzso for the zzso ability of zzso zzso chambers were established for detecting the ability of cell migration and zzso zzso zzso test was carried out to observe zzso of the cell zzso In addition, two-dimensional zzso zzso and mass zzso were zzso to identify zzso expressed proteins between in zzso cells and in zzso zzso 

The doubling time of zzso cell and zzso cell proliferation was zzso h and zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso Comparing the phase distribution of cell cycle of zzso cells with that of zzso cells, the percentage of cells in zzso phase, in S phase and in zzso phase was zzso zzso zzso VS zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso VS zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso VS zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso For the ability of cell zzso of zzso cells and zzso cells, the value of zzso in zzso cells was significantly higher than that in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso VS zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso We also found that the migration ability of zzso cells was stronger than that of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso VS zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and that the invasion ability of zzso cells was significantly weak than that of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso VS zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In the zzso tumor model, expansive masses of classic tumor were found in the zzso cells group, while subcutaneous inflammatory focuses were found in the zzso cells zzso Besides, zzso proteins were identified zzso expressed between in zzso cells and in zzso cells by zzso zzso 

As for the biological behaviors, the ability of cell proliferation in zzso cells was similar to that in zzso cells, but the ability in zzso and migration of zzso cells was zzso In addition, zzso cells had weaker ability in invasion and could not form tumor zzso Furthermore, there were many differently expressed proteins between hybrid cell line zzso cells and zzso cells, which might partly account for some of the differences between their biological behaviors at the molecular zzso These results may help to understand the processes of tumor zzso invasion and zzso and to search for screening method for more targets for tumor therapy in zzso
