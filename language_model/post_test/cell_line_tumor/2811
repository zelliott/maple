zzso zzso receptors are expressed in a broad range of human cell types and in a majority of human breast and prostate zzso zzso normal and zzso human cells are typically cultured in zzso in media containing bovine zzso zzso from fetal bovine serum or as zzso in zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso The biological efficacy of zzso toward zzso receptors zzso is controversial, and zzso are insensitive to zzso but the mechanism is not zzso To clarify limitations of current in zzso and in zzso experimental model systems for studies of zzso cells, we tested human and relevant zzso zzso in multiple zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso less potent zzso zzso than zzso although zzso responses at high zzso zzso zzso equaled that of zzso zzso and rat zzso had greater than zzso lower zzso toward zzso than zzso and had 50% reduced zzso In fact, zzso and rat zzso were less effective zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso was an effective competitive inhibitor of zzso binding to zzso with an zzso constant of zzso zzso and showed partial zzso activity, suggesting reduced zzso zzso zzso low zzso of zzso and zzso toward zzso suggest that existing laboratory cancer cell lines grown in zzso bovine zzso media or in mice are selected for growth under zzso zzso The biology and drug responsiveness of existing human cell lines may therefore not be representative of clinical zzso that are sensitive to circulating zzso
