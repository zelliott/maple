To discover the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso gene 2 zzso a newly found zzso tumor zzso the relationships between zzso and zzso were investigated in tumor cells and zzso Positive correlations between the expression of zzso and zzso were shown in several colon cancer cell lines as well as in colon cancer zzso According to the zzso zzso using a reporter zzso containing zzso promoter region zzso zzso introduction into colon cancer cell lines induced zzso of zzso promoter activity and its zzso On the contrary, zzso of zzso expression by zzso treatment caused the decrease of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was shown to be a zzso of zzso zzso zzso The enhancement of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity by zzso zzso caused zzso degradation of Snail zzso factor followed by zzso zzso of zzso We also found that zzso could mediate cell zzso zzso zzso The increase of zzso expression with cell density preceded zzso zzso and the regulation of Snail activity by zzso was also related to this zzso
