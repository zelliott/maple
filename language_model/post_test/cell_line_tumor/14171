zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein that was first identified in zzso secretions, but is zzso by most zzso zzso The protein has a signal sequence that dictates zzso it also has a nuclear zzso sequence that zzso entry into the cell zzso The mechanism of the latter action is currently unknown, but is thought to occur via a zzso zzso zzso content of zzso tissue and zzso varies with zzso state; it is zzso in zzso tissue at high levels during both pregnancy and zzso and during zzso zzso Using fluorescent zzso zzso we show that bovine primary zzso cells and zzso breast cancer cells do not zzso the zzso added zzso to the nucleus after culture in serum free media zzso However, the supplementation of zzso with zzso zzso zzso acid zzso caused breast cancer cells to gain the capacity to take up labeled zzso into the cell zzso zzso bovine zzso cells zzso exhibited similar capacity in zzso This suggests that in addition to zzso one or more components modulated by zzso are necessary for nuclear zzso to zzso zzso experiments with zzso treated zzso cells containing zzso acid response element reporter zzso showed that the zzso application of zzso alters reporter gene zzso zzso increased a zzso zzso response element in a zzso manner only when zzso was zzso zzso markers for the cell cycle zzso and zzso events zzso and zzso showed that zzso alters the zzso zzso blocking zzso and maintaining cell cycle activity in both zzso and zzso cells in the presence of zzso zzso We propose that nuclear zzso interacts with zzso acid signaling pathways in cells and zzso the signals so that cells remain in the cell cycle and/or do not enter the zzso zzso
