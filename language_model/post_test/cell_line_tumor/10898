The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso used commonly for vascular disorders in humans, on the zzso in zzso tumors of zzso mice and on the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso in the zzso tumors, which were measured 30 zzso after zzso zzso injection of zzso (5 zzso zzso (5 zzso or zzso (10 zzso using zzso was compared to that in zzso control zzso All the three drugs, zzso zzso and zzso yielded significant increase of the zzso in the zzso tumors from zzso to zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso distribution in the zzso zzso tumors did not show hypoxic fraction of less than 10 zzso The zzso of the drugs were investigated by tumor growth delay zzso In the zzso groups, the zzso tumors were zzso with a single dose of 15 zzso 30 zzso after injection of the drugs at the same doses as those used in the experiments for zzso zzso zzso Compared with the zzso alone group, significant tumor growth delays were observed in all the zzso zzso The time required to reach a zzso increase in the initial tumor volume were 4 days in the zzso control group, 22 days in the zzso zzso alone group, 28 days in the zzso + zzso group, 29 days in the zzso + zzso group, and 32 days in zzso + zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso are potentially promising drugs for increasing the zzso zzso although the mechanism for zzso observed in the present study is unknown due to small hypoxic fraction in the zzso zzso Further studies on other mechanisms for zzso of zzso zzso or zzso besides of increasing the zzso in the zzso are zzso
