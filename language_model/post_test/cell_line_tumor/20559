zzso regulator of zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso play a role in zzso signals for migration and invasion of highly zzso breast cancer cell zzso This has important zzso as elevated zzso protein levels were observed in a small cohort of breast cancer patients, which identified a potential role for zzso proteins in breast cancer zzso Numerous in zzso studies identified a role for zzso proteins in cell zzso but little is known about how zzso proteins contribute to breast cancer progression in zzso 

The clinical significance of zzso proteins in human breast cancer was assessed by analyzing published breast cancer zzso using a gene expression signature that was generated following zzso zzso and by examining zzso protein expression in tissue zzso of breast tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso proteins was accomplished using a short hairpin zzso zzso approach in two zzso breast cancer cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso where the former have a high affinity to form bone zzso Both in zzso zzso zzso migration, invasion, soft zzso zzso and in zzso experiments zzso zzso and zzso fat pad zzso were performed to assess the functional significance of zzso proteins in breast zzso 

A gene signature derived following zzso zzso correlated significantly with zzso breast zzso and with high grade and poor outcome in zzso Moreover, elevated zzso zzso on tissue zzso revealed a significant association with highly zzso tumors within the zzso zzso zzso zzso of all three zzso proteins in zzso zzso breast cancer cells established a continued requirement for zzso in cell migration and invasion in zzso and zzso growth in zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso suppressed zzso independent growth and in zzso zzso tumor zzso This was associated with diminished cell proliferation and was rescued by expression of zzso targeted zzso zzso in tumor progression correlated with altered zzso zzso including decreased cell zzso diminished zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

These data highlight the zzso importance of zzso proteins in regulating growth of aggressive zzso breast cancer cells and identify zzso signaling networks as promising therapeutic zzso
