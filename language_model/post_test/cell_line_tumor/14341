Identification of zzso derived factors in tumor progression has the potential to provide novel molecular targets for modulating tumor cell growth and zzso Multiple zzso zzso zzso are expressed by both zzso and zzso cells within head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso but the relative importance of these zzso and the cell source is the subject of zzso 

The invasive potential of zzso tumor cells were assessed in zzso atop type I collagen gels in zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso A floor of mouth mouse model of zzso was used to assess in zzso growth after zzso of zzso tumor cells with zzso zzso zzso 

Here we report changes in tumor zzso when zzso zzso cells are zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso spontaneously invaded into type I collagen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor cell invasion in zzso This invasive zzso was unaffected by combination with zzso zzso zzso reduced with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso tumor cells with zzso in an zzso oral cavity zzso mouse model demonstrated a reduction of tumor volume using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso with in zzso studies, zzso zzso zzso when zzso with zzso cells resulted in a zzso reduction in tumor volume compared to zzso cells injected with zzso zzso 

These data suggest a role for zzso zzso and zzso in zzso tumor invasion in zzso and tumor growth in zzso
