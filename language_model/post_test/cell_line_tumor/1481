zzso zzso zzso has been found to play an important role as a novel zzso involved in many biological zzso The regulatory role of zzso zzso zzso on cancer cell survival is complex and zzso According to the data that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production in zzso pathway, was zzso in zzso zzso transformed mouse embryonic zzso cells, the mechanisms that elevated zzso expression by zzso signaling zzso and its biological functions in cell survival were zzso In the present study, zzso the results showed that zzso positively correlated with zzso expression levels in human zzso zzso cell zzso zzso expression was decreased by the zzso inhibitor or zzso zzso while zzso with the zzso of zzso Based on zzso reporter zzso the zzso gene zzso represented the zzso core promoter, and the zzso zzso regulated zzso expression on zzso zzso zzso was the critical zzso factor in regulation of zzso expression via the zzso of zzso factor binding sites on the zzso Furthermore, we proved that zzso could directly bind to zzso promoter by zzso zzso In addition, we explored that the zzso zzso production was connected with the regulated zzso zzso and zzso promoted human zzso zzso cell proliferation via cell cycle progression zzso In zzso we have, for the first time, demonstrated that zzso zzso regulates the zzso expression via zzso which is particularly important to understand the effect of zzso and zzso on the zzso
