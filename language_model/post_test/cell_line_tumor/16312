Parkinson's and zzso diseases are associated with zzso zzso forms of the zzso zzso We have investigated the effects of calcium on zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso We treated zzso zzso with calcium in zzso and used zzso imaging, zzso correlation and scanning electron zzso to investigate protein zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso at low concentration (10 zzso with calcium resulted in surface zzso zzso zzso detected by zzso zzso zzso at a zzso calcium concentration of 80 zzso whilst zzso without calcium showed few protein zzso zzso electron zzso revealed that zzso surface plaques zzso zzso form in the presence of calcium and comprise zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso at high concentration (75 zzso zzso resulted in soluble zzso zzso detected by zzso correlation zzso in a calcium dependent process, zzso at a half maximum calcium concentration of 180 zzso In cell culture experiments, we used zzso or calcium zzso zzso to induce transient increases of zzso free calcium in human zzso cells expressing an zzso construct and observed calcium flux and zzso zzso by zzso zzso The cell culture data shows that a transient increase in zzso free calcium significantly increased the proportion of cells bearing zzso zzso zzso 6 and zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data indicates that calcium zzso zzso zzso on surfaces, in free solution and in cultured cells and suggests that surface zzso may play an important role in the zzso zzso zzso
