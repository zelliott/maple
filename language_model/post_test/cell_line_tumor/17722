zzso immune privilege is considered essential in the protection against zzso immune responses, as illustrated by the ability of the zzso environment to permit the growth of tumors that are rejected when implanted at other zzso Although several studies indicate that soluble zzso can drain directly into the zzso when injected into the anterior chamber, the primary site of zzso tumor zzso presentation to zzso zzso has not been zzso To gain a better understanding of the mechanism involved in zzso immune privilege, we examined to which zzso zzso anterior chamber tumor zzso primarily zzso Our data show that zzso tumor zzso drains exclusively to the zzso zzso zzso resulting in zzso of zzso zzso whereas no zzso drainage was found in zzso However, these zzso zzso do not distribute zzso and, as a consequence, zzso tumor growth is zzso A similar lack of zzso efficacy has been observed in mice bearing zzso tumors, which is converted to a systemic zzso zzso response by administration of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, systemic zzso treatment of eye zzso mice did not result in zzso zzso zzso or tumor zzso Together, these results show that zzso tumor zzso drains to regional zzso zzso for zzso of zzso zzso However, the induced zzso immunity is insufficient for tumor zzso even combined with otherwise highly effective immune intervention zzso
