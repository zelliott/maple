Here we investigated roles of the zzso bone zzso protein zzso system in modulating zzso production regulated by a zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso The zzso cells were found to express zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors (except the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso production in accordance with zzso zzso zzso but not zzso suppressed zzso zzso synthesis by zzso zzso Individual treatment with zzso and zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso A low concentration zzso zzso of zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso exhibited additive effects on reducing zzso and zzso production induced by zzso However, a high concentration (10 zzso of zzso in combination with zzso failed to suppress zzso and zzso zzso zzso specifically enhanced zzso zzso and zzso production induced by zzso in zzso zzso zzso but not zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso Of note, in the presence of a high concentration of zzso the zzso effects suppressing zzso signaling were significantly zzso In the presence of zzso a high concentration of zzso also attenuated the zzso effects suppressing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a high concentration of zzso interferes with zzso effects by reducing zzso production and suppressing zzso signaling in zzso zzso These findings may explain the mechanism of resistance of zzso reduction to a combination therapy with zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso
