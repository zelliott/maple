zzso zzso growth factor zzso is a positive regulator of zzso and its expression is zzso in many zzso In the present study, we found that a zzso zzso has a binding site in zzso region of the zzso zzso In eight lung cancer cell lines, expression of zzso was zzso zzso gene zzso showed that the zzso of zzso expression zzso with zzso could reduce the activity of zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso could decrease the expression of zzso Three human lung zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso were investigated as cancer models in zzso and zzso infected by zzso zzso was studied in tumor zzso zzso zzso of zzso can zzso the expression of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cell lines and can inhibit the growth of these zzso In addition, flow zzso analysis revealed that zzso infection can induce cell cycle zzso arrest in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, in nude mice, the average weight of zzso tumor zzso in experimental group was reduced from zzso to zzso with the zzso rate being zzso All these results revealed that zzso may have a tumor zzso function in lung cancer cells and could be a promising treatment in zzso zzso
