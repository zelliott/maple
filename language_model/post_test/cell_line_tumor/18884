zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso and its zzso are important regulators of zzso zzso zzso and zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso human zzso express the zzso factor zzso and that zzso zzso blunt zzso zzso To further understand the nature of zzso in zzso we determined the zzso zzso zzso and investigated the fate of zzso following zzso zzso Our studies demonstrated that human zzso contain only the zzso zzso and after zzso with zzso zzso zzso or collagen zzso is released from internal zzso zzso release was blocked by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso with the zzso X zzso zzso and retained its ability to bind zzso Interestingly, the released zzso and zzso were zzso associated and the released zzso complex retained zzso zzso Additionally, a zzso cell line, zzso is capable of zzso zzso Further investigation following treatment of these cells with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed a possible zzso mechanism to zzso zzso zzso These new findings are the first to demonstrate zzso factor release from zzso revealing the complex spectrum of proteins expressed and expelled from zzso and suggests that zzso zzso has an undiscovered role in human zzso
