zzso of zzso and/or zzso zzso proteins as zzso zzso is a key hallmark in more than 20 zzso zzso In that respect, blocking or reversing zzso zzso via the use of small compounds is considered as two useful approaches in zzso the development of these zzso In this research, we have studied the ability of different zzso derivatives to inhibit zzso zzso as well as to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso as an in zzso model system, with the aim of investigating their zzso zzso By zzso several techniques such as zzso T and zzso acid fluorescence, zzso red zzso zzso circular zzso and transmission electron zzso we demonstrated that all compounds possessed zzso activities and were capable of zzso the zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso of the treated zzso cells with the zzso zzso formed in the presence of compounds at a zzso zzso ratio of zzso indicated a significant increase in the viability of cells, compared to the zzso formed in the absence of each of the zzso Our zzso electron zzso and cellular studies indicated that zzso with a zzso group at the zzso position zzso zzso had higher activity to either inhibit or disrupt the zzso structures relative to other zzso On the basis of these results, it can be concluded that in addition to aromatic rings of each of the zzso the type and position of the side zzso contribute to lower zzso zzso zzso
