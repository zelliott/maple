The zzso zzso of the zzso rat zzso cell line is completely devoid of zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso and is a useful model to examine zzso zzso Previous studies showed that zzso cells, when zzso with mouse zzso exhibit induction of a zzso reporter even in the absence of zzso zzso We zzso zzso cells with full-length human zzso and found that presence of the zzso alone was sufficient to induce substantial zzso and zzso zzso without any zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso expression in a zzso zzso When we zzso zzso cells with a zzso human zzso that is defective in zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso was diminished but not zzso zzso by the zzso zzso along with the diminished response to the zzso zzso indicates that zzso cells contain some agent that acts as an zzso zzso for the zzso
