We have recently reported the zzso performance of an zzso zzso one zzso parallel plate zzso flow chamber and applied to capture zzso breast cancer cells zzso et zzso zzso zzso 24, zzso zzso zzso we present a new multiplex zzso embodying four parallel plate zzso flow chambers that fit onto a standard, zzso zzso glass zzso The four surfaces are coated with long zzso chain zzso of zzso zzso zzso and then grafted with a zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso specific of target cells to zzso We first demonstrate a significantly zzso zzso improved capacity of each of the four flow chambers of the multiplex zzso to capture zzso cells compared to the previous single chamber zzso Second, in addition to an increase of cell zzso the multiplex device offers a versatile tool easily grafted with various zzso zzso onto the four zzso Third, we obtained high cell capture rate and efficiency of various numbers of zzso cells spiked in buffer containing an equal number of background zzso And fourth, we demonstrate isolation efficiency of circulating tumor cells zzso from peripheral blood drawn from a small cohort of patients with localized or zzso breast zzso This new multiplex zzso could be tested for its potential to capture different zzso of zzso
