The zzso zzso protein 1 gene zzso encodes a zzso signaling zzso and frequently is zzso by promoter zzso in many zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso is not zzso zzso the authors investigated whether zzso of the zzso promoter is common in zzso and whether it may influence zzso zzso 

Four zzso cell lines, 54 zzso 42 zzso zzso 21 zzso with chronic zzso and 15 normal control zzso were analyzed for 1) zzso promoter zzso by using zzso zzso chain reaction analysis and zzso sequencing, 2) zzso zzso zzso expression by using quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction analysis, and 3) loss of zzso zzso by using zzso markers zzso the zzso zzso zzso cells were treated with the zzso agent zzso to determine whether it could restore zzso zzso 

zzso promoter zzso was observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cell lines, primary zzso zzso zzso zzso with chronic zzso and normal control zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoter region in zzso increased significantly compared with control zzso All samples with zzso zzso showed zzso of zzso zzso zzso treatment with zzso in zzso cells restored zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of markers zzso and zzso was found in zzso and zzso of the zzso samples, zzso 

The current results suggested that promoter zzso of zzso is a common event in zzso and plays an important role in the regulation of zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso of zzso zzso also may play a zzso
