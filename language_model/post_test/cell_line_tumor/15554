zzso zzso by zzso tip and zzso stalk zzso cells zzso is controlled by genetic signals (such as zzso but it is unknown whether metabolism also regulates this zzso Here, we show that zzso relied on zzso rather than on zzso zzso for zzso production and that loss of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso impaired vessel zzso zzso zzso not only regulated zzso proliferation but also controlled the formation of zzso and directional migration, in part by zzso with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso further revealed that zzso zzso overruled the zzso activity of zzso whereas zzso zzso impaired tip cell formation upon zzso zzso zzso that zzso regulates vessel zzso
