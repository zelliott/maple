The effects of zzso on the membrane potential and currents of human zzso zzso cells were zzso In zzso whole cell zzso short (3 zzso applications of zzso zzso zzso zzso the membrane by zzso a zzso zzso The response involved the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso release from zzso zzso zzso The zzso current was insensitive to zzso (3 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but was markedly inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso a pharmacological profile zzso with the intermediate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recordings confirmed that zzso activated a zzso channel with properties zzso with the zzso channel zzso independence, 22 zzso zzso zzso and slight inward zzso in symmetrical 140 zzso zzso More prolonged zzso applications zzso zzso often evoked a sustained zzso channel activity, which depended on a zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the sustained zzso channel activity enhanced the zzso zzso zzso most likely by a zzso increase in the driving force for zzso zzso In virtually all cells examined we also observed the expression of the large zzso zzso zzso zzso channel, with a zzso zzso of zzso 230 zzso in symmetrical 140 zzso zzso and a zzso zzso constant zzso of zzso 3 zzso at zzso zzso zzso in no instance was the zzso channel activated by zzso under zzso zzso The most zzso explanation based on the different zzso for the two zzso channels is zzso
