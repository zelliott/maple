zzso zzso has been associated with colon zzso but the mechanism underlying zzso zzso is largely zzso zzso zzso zzso can inhibit the zzso activity of certain zzso zzso family members in zzso by zzso the zzso zzso and by a zzso zzso zzso was previously reported to be expressed primarily in brain and zzso zzso We report zzso that zzso is also expressed in normal colon cell zzso Furthermore, zzso protein levels are significantly decreased in various colon cancer cell lines and the decrease zzso with the increased specific activity of zzso in these cell lines, while the level of the other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is not significantly zzso zzso is also expressed in normal colon zzso but its expression level is decreased in colon cancer zzso collected from the same zzso zzso zzso shows that zzso zzso with zzso in normal colon zzso zzso zzso of zzso in colon cancer cells results in zzso of zzso without zzso zzso at its zzso In addition, zzso suppresses zzso cell growth and cell invasion of colon cancer zzso These results reveal a potentially important role for zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in colon cancer zzso
