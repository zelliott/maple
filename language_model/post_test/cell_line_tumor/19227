Recent studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso family 1 B10 zzso a novel protein zzso in human zzso zzso and zzso cell lung zzso may facilitate cancer cell growth by detoxifying zzso zzso zzso This study presents a novel function of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells zzso regulating fatty acid zzso In zzso cells, zzso 300 gel zzso and zzso zzso exchange zzso demonstrated that zzso exists in two distinct forms, zzso zzso 40 zzso bound to zzso column and protein complexes zzso 300 zzso remaining in zzso zzso with zzso zzso and protein mass zzso analysis identified that zzso associates with zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of de zzso fatty acid zzso This association between zzso and zzso proteins was further confirmed by zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso fluorescent studies showed that zzso and zzso proteins zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso More interestingly, small interfering zzso zzso knock down increased zzso degradation through zzso zzso and resulted in zzso decrease of fatty acid synthesis in zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso is a novel regulator of the zzso of fatty acid, an essential component of the cell zzso in breast cancer zzso
