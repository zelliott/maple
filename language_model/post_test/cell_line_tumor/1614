The selective delivery of zzso agents to tumors reduces toxicity and enhances the efficacy of zzso zzso In this study, we show that the zzso zzso which recognizes zzso and zzso zzso zzso when zzso to zzso zzso can effectively inhibit the growth of zzso zzso in combination with zzso We obtained zzso effects with zzso administered before the zzso zzso of zzso increased the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso enhancing tumor zzso and zzso zzso also zzso the recruitment of zzso natural killer zzso cells to the zzso suggesting a host response as part of the observed therapeutic zzso In support of this likelihood, zzso cell depletion impaired the zzso effect of zzso plus zzso zzso this combination reduced both the tumor burden and the number of pulmonary zzso zzso The combination did not cause cumulative zzso Together, our findings offer a zzso proof that by acting on the tumor zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity zzso by a targeted delivery of zzso thereby supporting the use of zzso in the treatment of zzso zzso
