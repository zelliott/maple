zzso cell death zzso as well as programmed cell death zzso serve to control the expansion of activated T cells to limit zzso side effects of continued zzso responses by T cells and to maintain zzso zzso of T cells in tumor zzso can be counterproductive particularly if the activated T cells undergo zzso death after the very first secondary encounter of the specific zzso We examined the extent to which tumor zzso zzso that are activated and expanded in an in zzso zzso zzso primary stimulation protocol undergo zzso following their first secondary encounter of the zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso as a zzso vaccine zzso we also examined whether these zzso could be rescued from zzso Our results demonstrate that a substantial fraction of zzso zzso primary zzso undergo zzso upon the very first secondary encounter of the zzso zzso The zzso in these zzso is neither zzso dependent nor is it triggered by the zzso death signaling pathways zzso zzso zzso These zzso interestingly, could be rescued from zzso by the zzso zzso zzso We also found that zzso interferes with their zzso response but does not block their zzso zzso The rescued zzso however, regain their capacity to zzso zzso if continued in culture without the zzso These observations have implications in tumor zzso and in further studies for regulation of zzso in zzso
