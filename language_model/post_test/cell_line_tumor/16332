A study was carried out to identify a suitable radioactive zzso analog and to use it to investigate tumor zzso resistance in zzso zzso was prepared by aromatic zzso of zzso zzso of the labeled zzso analog in nude mice bearing tumor with the zzso sensitive cancer cell lines zzso and zzso and zzso resistant cell lines zzso and zzso was zzso There was no difference in drug level between the sensitive and resistant zzso tumors at zzso zzso However, at zzso there was a significant increase in drug level for the zzso tumor as compared with the zzso zzso presumably due to increased drug zzso At zzso drug zzso was significantly higher in both sensitive tumor cell lines as compared to their drug resistant zzso zzso of mice with zzso transport zzso zzso or zzso zzso did not increase the level of labeled zzso analog in the drug resistant zzso zzso On the other hand, at zzso zzso apparently increased analog level in the drug sensitive zzso zzso aiding drug imaging zzso
