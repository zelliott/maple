Gene expression profiling indicates that the Sonic zzso zzso zzso is active in approximately zzso of human zzso suggesting that it could provide a useful therapeutic zzso Previously, we showed that spontaneous zzso in zzso mice could be eradicated by treatment with a zzso inhibitor zzso of zzso zzso Here, we compared the responses of mouse zzso cells zzso in flank zzso either directly or after culture in zzso to zzso We found that zzso zzso activity was suppressed in zzso cells cultured in zzso and it was not restored when these cells were transplanted into the flank of nude zzso The growth of these transplanted tumor cells was not inhibited by treatment of mice with doses of zzso that completely suppressed zzso zzso Interestingly, tumor cells transplanted directly into the flank maintained zzso activity and were sensitive to treatment with zzso These findings indicate that propagation of tumor cells in culture zzso zzso activity in a way that cannot be reversed by transplantation in zzso and they raise concerns about the use of cultured tumor cells to test the efficacy of zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso
