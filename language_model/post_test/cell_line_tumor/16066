zzso is zzso in many zzso with high expression often associated with poor zzso In the present study, we examined the expression of zzso in zzso and its role in zzso zzso Moreover, we evaluated the role of a newly identified zzso activated zzso zzso axis in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso expression in zzso cell lines was determined by real time zzso zzso zzso expression in 96 normal and zzso zzso tissue specimens was analyzed using a zzso real time zzso zzso zzso concentration in zzso medium was measured by zzso zzso zzso protein expression was detected by Western zzso Cell invasion was evaluated by in zzso zzso invasion zzso 

In zzso tumor zzso more zzso expression was observed than in normal zzso zzso ( zzso and its expression correlated with tumor grade zzso zzso zzso zzso Human zzso zzso as well as serum free zzso medium containing high levels of zzso from zzso and zzso cells significantly promoted zzso cell invasion ( zzso implicating a direct role of zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso induced zzso invasion was significantly blocked by zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso were both significantly induced by zzso (20 zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso both significantly reduced zzso zzso effect in zzso cells ( zzso 

Our results suggest that the zzso axis is involved in zzso invasion and at least partially mediates zzso zzso zzso zzso blocking zzso or zzso may represent a new therapeutic option for zzso zzso
