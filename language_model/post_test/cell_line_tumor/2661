zzso rats develop multiple zzso zzso following initiation with zzso whereas Copenhagen rats are resistant to the development of zzso zzso We have previously isolated cell lines from tumors induced in resistant Copenhagen zzso zzso zzso rats by infusion of a zzso harboring zzso directly into the main zzso zzso Some of the cell lines were able to grow in soft zzso but a significant number did not display zzso zzso Here, we compared by zzso analysis genes that are zzso expressed in these cell zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was highly correlated with the inability of cells to grow in soft zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells inhibited their growth in zzso culture, in soft zzso and in nude mice in zzso and inhibited their ability to migrate and invade in in zzso zzso Furthermore, growth suppression by zzso was associated with the zzso zzso of zzso via the zzso of zzso We zzso for the first time, that zzso zzso is a downstream target of zzso However, zzso does not play a direct role in regulating the zzso capacity of rat zzso tumor zzso Our results show that zzso suppresses the growth of rat zzso zzso cells and may play a role in the resistance of Copenhagen rats to zzso zzso
