To investigate whether there were particular zzso gene zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso development in zzso 

The zzso genes were examined in 51 zzso tumor tissue samples from patients with zzso and 25 serum samples from zzso carriers from southern China by zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis, zzso analysis and DNA zzso The zzso genes with deletion variations zzso zzso from tumor zzso were cloned and zzso into zzso zzso Then, the biological characteristics of the zzso cells were analyzed in nude mice by zzso zzso soft zzso colony formation zzso flow zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso and point zzso were found in the zzso genes of zzso tumor zzso and there were some differences between the zzso gene zzso in zzso B and those in zzso zzso More zzso were found in zzso C than those in zzso B zzso P zzso zzso but the deletion variations zzso zzso were detected in zzso B zzso from zzso liver zzso The zzso genes with deletion variations zzso zzso were zzso with zzso and zzso into zzso cell lines zzso which established four permanent zzso zzso cell lines, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso grew faster and had more potential colony formative activity than those of zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso cells zzso in nude mice produced tumors more rapidly than those of zzso and zzso The volumes of the tumors in nude mice were also obviously larger in zzso and zzso groups than those in zzso and zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso gene zzso occur frequently in zzso zzso and the deletion at zzso of the zzso gene might play a role in zzso of zzso in southern zzso
