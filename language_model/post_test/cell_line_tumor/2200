zzso has a central role in the regulation of zzso Barrett's esophagus zzso is associated with a significantly increased risk for the development of zzso zzso zzso In the current study, we evaluated the role of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso obtained from patients with BE and zzso zzso from a rat model of BE and zzso and zzso cell lines were evaluated for the expression of zzso by zzso zzso or zzso Since zzso of zzso acids is important in zzso we also evaluated the effect of exposure to zzso acid zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression was high in zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas its expression was low in zzso BE and zzso The same pattern of expression was observed in rat zzso and in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso from normal zzso zzso show high levels of zzso but lower levels of zzso were found in BE and zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso Acute exposure to zzso led to increased zzso expression and increased zzso as evaluated by electron zzso and counting percentage of zzso BE cells with zzso zzso In contrast, chronic exposure to zzso did not result in the zzso of zzso levels or zzso In zzso these data suggest that zzso is initially activated in response to zzso zzso but chronic exposure to zzso acids leads to decreased zzso expression and zzso zzso
