zzso zzso in response to zzso stress can affect both the stability and activity of target zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso is a key zzso in zzso DNA precursor zzso Using an zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected after the addition of zzso zzso zzso but not zzso This was reversed by the addition of zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso is zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and subsequent analysis of zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso and zzso were specifically zzso by zzso These zzso zzso do not appear to be part of the active site, as demonstrated by kinetic studies of the zzso zzso Treatment of isolated rat zzso with hydrogen zzso resulted in zzso of added zzso zzso Treatment of intact cells with hydrogen zzso led to reduction of zzso zzso activity and protein levels, as well as zzso of zzso Furthermore, the addition of zzso zzso zzso to zzso isolated from hydrogen zzso cells led to degradation of the zzso zzso which was not observed with unmodified zzso zzso on zzso was responsible for the observed selective degradation of zzso in zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso zzso zzso and degradation of zzso have significant impact on zzso DNA precursor zzso
