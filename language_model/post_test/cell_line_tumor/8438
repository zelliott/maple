zzso 1 zzso protects the gastric zzso zzso and promotes healing by zzso zzso and proliferation after zzso zzso is zzso in zzso zzso gastric zzso cells and loss of zzso expression is tightly associated with gastric zzso However, the underlying mechanisms as a tumor zzso are largely zzso zzso the zzso region and zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were shown to suppress gastric cancer cell growth and zzso zzso zzso As well, the zzso region and zzso domain of zzso had a synergistic zzso effect with zzso on tumor cell growth, zzso that the zzso zzso region and zzso domain of zzso are sufficient for tumor suppression, thereby suggesting a therapeutic intervention for gastric zzso Also, its domain inducing zzso zzso directly targeted the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in gastric cancer zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso region and zzso domain of zzso are sufficient for its tumor zzso zzso
