Cancer therapy has moved beyond conventional zzso to more zzso targeted zzso Studies demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso is a promising target for zzso zzso zzso structurally diverse, zzso acid zzso zzso zzso have been reported and have been shown to induce growth arrest, zzso zzso and/or zzso cell death by zzso multiple signaling pathways in cancer zzso zzso zzso acid zzso has emerged as an effective zzso therapeutic agent and was recently approved by the zzso for the treatment of advanced zzso zzso zzso In our previous study, we reported the development of the novel, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In this study, the effects of zzso and zzso on signaling pathways and zzso were compared with the known zzso zzso zzso in lung cancer cell zzso After 24 h of treatment, zzso and zzso inhibited lung cancer cell growth to a greater extent than zzso in a zzso manner with zzso values at low zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso and zzso signaling pathways while simultaneously increasing in zzso in zzso cells in a time dependent zzso This preliminary study demonstrates the effectiveness of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso as zzso zzso and provides insight into the improvement and/or development of these zzso as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of lung zzso
