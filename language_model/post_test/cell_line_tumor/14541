The aim was to determine the potential of the zzso zzso target of zzso zzso zzso to act in combination with zzso zzso compounds in zzso and in zzso A zzso combination in zzso showed no evidence of zzso but enhanced the zzso effects zzso to zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was evaluated for zzso activity in zzso alone or in combination with zzso zzso doses using zzso nude mice bearing subcutaneous human zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso colon tumor zzso zzso zzso was very well tolerated and caused zzso of tumor growth, rather than regression, and this was associated with a zzso decline in tumor zzso levels, a key downstream protein of zzso target of zzso At the doses used, the zzso inhibited tumor growth and caused tolerable zzso zzso zzso combinations of zzso zzso zzso or zzso with zzso produced cooperative zzso effects, in some cases producing zzso without clinically significant increases in zzso In contrast, combinations with zzso and zzso were less well zzso Alternative administration schedules were tested for zzso zzso or zzso combined with zzso these did not dramatically affect zzso or zzso activity or zzso but were zzso for zzso zzso showed promising maintenance activity after treatment with zzso or zzso zzso Overall, the results confirm that zzso is an effective, zzso zzso of experimental human tumor growth, and although it did not show strong zzso of zzso zzso activity in zzso was increased without marked increases in zzso supporting clinical use of zzso as a partner for conventional zzso
