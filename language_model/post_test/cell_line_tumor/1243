DNA zzso profiling performed on clinical tissue specimens can potentially provide significant information regarding human cancer zzso zzso cores, the typical source of human tumor zzso however, generally provide very small amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso amplification is a common method used to increase the amount of material available for zzso zzso Using human zzso zzso we sought to address the following three questions: 1) is amplified zzso representative of the original zzso zzso 2) what is the minimum amount of total zzso required to perform a representative zzso 3) are the direct and indirect methods of labeling the zzso probe zzso 

Total zzso was extracted from human zzso tissue and amplified using a linear amplification zzso zzso was labeled and zzso and the resulting images yielded data that was extracted into two categories using the zzso system: zzso zzso and zzso zzso plots were generated for each slide and zzso zzso of correlation were zzso 

zzso show that the amplification of 5 zzso of total zzso yields a zzso zzso zzso of zzso (N zzso zzso zzso between the amplified and total zzso zzso We subsequently determined that amplification of zzso zzso of total zzso generated a similar zzso zzso zzso as compared to the corresponding original zzso zzso Similarly, zzso percent of total zzso zzso were detected with 5 zzso of amplified starting zzso and zzso of zzso were detected with zzso zzso of starting zzso However, amplification of zzso zzso of starting zzso resulted in a loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso between amplified and original samples, zzso zzso zzso In these studies the direct or indirect methods of probe labeling yielded similar zzso Finally, we examined whether zzso obtained from needle core zzso of human tumor zzso amplified and indirectly labeled, would generate representative array profiles compared to larger zzso biopsy zzso In this analysis correlation zzso were obtained ranging from zzso between zzso biopsy zzso and excised tumors, and zzso between zzso biopsy zzso and excised zzso 

These data suggest that needle core zzso can be used as reliable tissue samples for tumor zzso analysis after linear amplification and either indirect or direct labeling of the starting zzso
