Tracking and tracing of transplanted cells in mice is required in many fields of zzso Examples are transplantation of stem cells into zzso of mice to study their differentiation capacity and injection of tumor cells to examine zzso zzso In the present study we tested the zzso dye zzso and red fluorescent zzso zzso for their zzso in tagging and tracing of human cells in zzso zzso of different cell types, including zzso human breast cancer cells, human zzso blood derived cells, human zzso cells and human zzso precursor cells, is technically easy and did not compromise further cell zzso After transplantation of zzso or zzso marked cells, red fluorescent structures could be detected already in zzso zzso slices of the studied zzso namely liver, zzso zzso zzso zzso and bone zzso Next, we examined whether the red fluorescent structures represent the transplanted human zzso For this purpose, we established an in zzso zzso zzso technique that allows clear-cut differentiation between human and zzso zzso based on simultaneous zzso with human zzso and mouse major satellite zzso zzso We observed a high degree of coincidence between zzso cells and zzso positive zzso However, also some zzso positive cells contained zzso suggesting zzso of the transplanted zzso zzso The degree of such zzso mouse cells depended on the cell type and route of zzso From a technical point of view it was important that zzso structures in zzso slices remained fluorescent also after zzso In contrast, zzso positive structures faded during further zzso zzso In conclusion, marking of cells with zzso or zzso prior to transplantation zzso recovery of human cells, since a high fraction of positive structures in the zzso tissue originate from the transplanted zzso However, zzso or zzso positive zzso of individual cells in transplanted zzso is not sufficient to prove their human zzso Additional procedures, such as zzso with zzso are essential, when characterizing individual zzso
