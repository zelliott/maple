zzso zzso is commonly used to identify and test zzso zzso oxygen zzso zzso and to inhibit zzso In the present study, we identified zzso of zzso zzso as a novel activity of zzso Both zzso and zzso another known scavenger of zzso similarly inhibited zzso levels and zzso associated with zzso However, only zzso and not zzso or another zzso scavenger zzso was able to prevent effects linked to zzso zzso such as protein stabilization, zzso and zzso of zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso has a dual activity as an inhibitor of zzso and zzso zzso Recently, zzso was used as a zzso inhibitor to functionally characterize a novel zzso compound, zzso leading to its description as a zzso zzso In contrast, our own experiments showed that this compound depicts features of zzso zzso including suppression of zzso zzso box protein zzso stabilization of cellular zzso induction of zzso zzso and enhanced zzso of zzso zzso In addition, zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso with the activity of zzso further supporting that zzso is a zzso zzso Most importantly, we showed that zzso but not other zzso zzso directly binds to zzso zzso To our knowledge, zzso is the first known compound that directly interacts with and zzso the activity of zzso zzso Taken together, the findings of the present study suggest that, as a result of the dual nature of zzso data interpretation might not be straightforward when zzso is zzso as an zzso to demonstrate zzso involvement in drug-induced zzso
