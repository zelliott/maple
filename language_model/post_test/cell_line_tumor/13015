zzso in the process of zzso are classically linked to zzso transformation through the deficient zzso of signaling zzso The present study describes a zzso mechanism that does not require zzso by which zzso proteins affect cell migration and basement membrane zzso Specifically, we found that the zzso zzso zzso binds and regulates the biological properties of the signaling zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso with the N zzso of zzso via its characteristic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A combination of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells demonstrated that impairment of the zzso interaction led to cell migration and basement membrane invasion zzso We found the zzso domain was necessary and sufficient to sustain normal cell migration and zzso Because all the zzso zzso motifs reside in the zzso part of the zzso these results suggest that this novel regulatory circuit does not require zzso In addition, cells depleted of zzso complex displayed deficient zzso of zzso and zzso suggesting a signaling function for this novel zzso Further, zzso of either zzso or zzso enhanced migration and invasion of zzso zzso zzso our results indicate that zzso regulates zzso function in zzso and zzso pathways to ultimately affect cell migration and zzso We propose that the observed zzso of both zzso and zzso in certain zzso contributes to their invasive zzso
