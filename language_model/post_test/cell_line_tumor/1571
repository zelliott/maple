zzso administration of zzso zzso was found to exert opposite effects on plasma levels of vascular zzso growth factor zzso in two animal zzso One study in nude mice injected via tail vein with zzso zzso cells showed that BC decreases the plasma zzso level, whereas the other study in nude mice injected zzso with prostate tumor zzso cells showed that BC increases the plasma zzso zzso zzso we investigated whether BC zzso zzso possesses diverse effects on zzso zzso in zzso zzso and melanoma zzso zzso We found that incubation of zzso cells with BC zzso zzso for 6 h significantly decreased zzso zzso whereas BC zzso zzso significantly increased the zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, these effects disappeared at 12 h of zzso Similar effects occurred in zzso zzso and protein expression after treatment of zzso and zzso cells with BC for 6 zzso In contrast, BC zzso zzso did not affect zzso and protein expression and zzso of zzso in zzso zzso We also found that the proliferation of zzso and zzso cells was significantly inhibited by 20 zzso BC at 6 and 12 h of zzso whereas the proliferation of zzso cells was significantly inhibited by 20 zzso BC at 12 h of zzso In zzso the present study demonstrated the zzso effect of BC on zzso zzso in different cancer cell zzso
