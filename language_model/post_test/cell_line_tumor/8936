zzso family interacting protein 1 zzso is an zzso protein for the zzso family of zzso zzso that target proteins for zzso Recent studies confirmed the role of zzso as a regulator of iron metabolism and pointed out that zzso was involved in iron zzso by regulating the degradation of iron importer zzso metal zzso 1 zzso However, little is known about how zzso is zzso The aim of this article was to investigate the regulation of zzso levels and the possible zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of various zzso including iron status and zzso zzso on zzso expression in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso showed that zzso expression in these cells was enhanced by zzso iron overload, but not zzso iron overload, and decreased after iron deprivation by zzso In addition, zzso could significantly increase the expression of zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that the regulation of zzso expression by these various stimuli was achieving by zzso of nuclear zzso zzso We speculate that iron status and zzso may contribute to the changes of zzso expression by zzso of nuclear zzso zzso
