zzso zzso zzso which are resistant to zzso by zzso detergents, have been demonstrated to be involved in many key cell functions such as signal zzso zzso and cholesterol zzso zzso modification of proteins by fatty zzso has been proposed to be an important zzso mechanism for zzso zzso However, little is known concerning the effects of zzso zzso saturated fatty zzso on protein composition of zzso in human cancer zzso In the present study, we found that, in zzso human breast cancer cells, the major protein increased in zzso in response to the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso II accumulated in zzso specifically in response to zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso fatty zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso This process was zzso and dependent on cholesterol and zzso zzso Although calcium was necessary for this zzso it was not sufficient to induce the zzso II zzso to zzso We also demonstrate that zzso induced the zzso of zzso but not that of zzso zzso Association of zzso II with zzso although not necessarily zzso specifically occurs in zzso in response to zzso Finally, zzso a zzso analogue that effectively blocks protein zzso does not induce zzso II zzso to zzso We conclude that zzso added zzso strongly zzso the zzso of zzso II to zzso in zzso human breast cancer cells at least partially by association with zzso zzso
