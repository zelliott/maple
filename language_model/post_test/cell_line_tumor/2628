In this paper, we investigated the feasibility and effect of a novel combination therapy of magnetic zzso zzso zzso with zzso drugs for solid zzso using zzso zzso magnetic zzso zzso in an animal liver cancer zzso zzso zzso containing 18 zzso zzso with zzso zzso were zzso and zzso Then, the particular behavior of zzso release under external alternating current magnetic filed zzso was tested in zzso Moreover, to obtain accurate zzso the dose of zzso and temperature rise were zzso by zzso treatment plan zzso and a fiber zzso temperature sensor zzso was used to monitor the temperature rise during treatments on zzso liver zzso zzso Furthermore, the therapeutic effect was studied by zzso examinations and animal zzso The results showed that zzso can induce zzso fast release during the treatment and the high zzso content of zzso guaranteed the temperature rise for zzso in zzso The rabbits bearing zzso tumors in the magnetic zzso using zzso group gained the most tumor necrosis and survival zzso It was indicated that zzso magnetic zzso could be a feasible and effective remedy which could be targeted at liver tumors by dual effects of zzso and zzso
