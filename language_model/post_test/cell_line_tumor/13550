Acute zzso leukemia zzso is a zzso zzso characterized by a rapid increase in the number of immature zzso cells in bone zzso Despite recent advances in the treatment, zzso remains an incurable zzso zzso a major component extracted from zzso zzso zzso has been demonstrated to exert zzso effects on various cancer cell zzso However, the effects of zzso on zzso remain largely zzso Here we investigated its zzso effects and underlying mechanisms on human zzso cells in zzso and in zzso The results showed that zzso inhibited cell viability and induced cell zzso in zzso cell lines as well as primary zzso cells from patients with zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced zzso by collapsing the zzso membrane potential, inducing zzso c release from zzso reducing the ratio of zzso increasing zzso of zzso and decreasing the levels of zzso and zzso The zzso effects of zzso on zzso cells were partially blocked by a zzso inhibitor zzso and a zzso zzso IGF-1, zzso zzso zzso inhibited in zzso tumor growth following subcutaneous zzso of zzso cells in zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso can inhibit cell proliferation and induce zzso of zzso cells and may be a novel effective candidate as zzso agent against zzso
