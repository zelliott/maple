zzso is a rare zzso zzso of bone, the molecular marker of which is the expression of the zzso factor, zzso Having recently demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso growth arrest in a zzso cell line, we now seek to identify its downstream target zzso Here we use an integrated functional zzso approach involving zzso zzso zzso gene expression zzso zzso experiments, and zzso analysis to achieve this zzso We confirm that the zzso binding motif of human zzso is identical to that found in zzso zzso and zzso development, and that zzso acts primarily as an zzso of zzso Using human zzso samples for validation purposes, we show that zzso binds 99 direct targets and indirectly influences the expression of 64 other zzso thereby acting as a master regulator of an elaborate zzso zzso network encompassing diverse zzso pathways including components of the cell cycle, and zzso zzso zzso Given the wide repertoire of its active binding and the relative specific zzso of zzso to the zzso cells, we propose that an zzso zzso gene therapy approach is a plausible therapeutic avenue worthy of zzso
