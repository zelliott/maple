To study the effect of zzso alone or in combination with zzso zzso on an zzso zzso drug-resistant leukemia cell line zzso a zzso cell line zzso a zzso cell line zzso and primary cells from acute zzso leukemia zzso 

The cell lines were exposed to zzso zzso and zzso plus zzso and cell zzso cell cycle, zzso rate, and expression of zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso inhibited growth and increased the zzso rate in the cell zzso In zzso and zzso the calcium channel blocker zzso reduced the 50% zzso concentration and zzso rate of zzso a zzso protein zzso but not of zzso zzso plus zzso had synergistic effect on zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso was substantially more increased by the combination of two drugs than by zzso zzso zzso arrested the cell cycles of three cell lines at the zzso stage, decreased zzso zzso zzso but did not affect zzso zzso zzso The zzso role of zzso was also confirmed in primary leukemia zzso 

zzso is a promising potential therapy for acute zzso especially zzso drug-resistant zzso
