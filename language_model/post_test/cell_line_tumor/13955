This laboratory has reported previously that zzso zzso and zzso zzso robustly elevate zzso calcium zzso in resting human and zzso T cells, whereas zzso zzso a zzso zzso for zzso and zzso does zzso In light of our previous studies, the objective of the present investigation was to examine the ability of various zzso compounds to elevate zzso in the zzso zzso human peripheral blood acute zzso leukemia T cell line and the dependence of structural similarity to zzso zzso The present studies demonstrate that zzso and zzso zzso both zzso and in that respect structurally similar to zzso elevate zzso The zzso zzso zzso by both zzso and zzso was attenuated upon removal of zzso calcium and upon zzso with zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso attenuated the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Further investigation of the dependence of zzso zzso and zzso on zzso receptors using zzso from zzso and zzso mice showed that the zzso zzso zzso by all three zzso cannabinoids was independent of zzso and zzso Moreover, both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso attenuated that rise in zzso zzso by the zzso cannabinoids in the zzso and zzso mouse zzso Taken together, the present results demonstrate that classic zzso cannabinoids with structural similarity to zzso elicit a robust influx of calcium in T cells zzso through zzso zzso channels in a manner sensitive to the zzso zzso antagonists, but independent of the zzso and zzso zzso
