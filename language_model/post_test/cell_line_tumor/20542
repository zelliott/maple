zzso breast cancer zzso high rate of zzso is thought to be due to the presence of zzso cells zzso zzso defined as being zzso zzso are resilient to chemotherapy and zzso However, no currently accepted molecular target exists against zzso and, moreover, zzso zzso we sought the identification of zzso targets that inhibit zzso growth and eliminate zzso 

A zzso human zzso small interfering zzso zzso library zzso zzso was screened against the zzso cell line zzso for growth zzso zzso zzso were then tested on four different breast cancer cell lines to confirm the spectrum of zzso Their effect on the zzso zzso and sorted zzso cells of zzso also was zzso Further studies were focused on zzso zzso 1 zzso including its expression in breast cancer cell lines, effect on the zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso formation, and zzso as well as the activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Of the 85 zzso identified in the screen, 28 of them were further silenced by zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso cells and showed a broad spectrum of growth zzso zzso 12 of 28 zzso also reduced the zzso zzso compared with control in zzso Further tests of these 12 zzso directly on a sorted zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells confirmed their zzso zzso zzso had the greatest growth zzso on breast cancer cells and zzso by about zzso to zzso after 72 zzso zzso was universally expressed in breast cancer cell lines, representing all of the breast cancer zzso and was positively correlated to zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso zzso showed similar effects on growth, zzso formation, and zzso as did zzso zzso Finally, whereas zzso zzso and zzso enriched the zzso population compared with control in zzso subsequent treatment with zzso zzso killed the emergent population, suggesting that it could potentially be used to prevent zzso 

zzso zzso with zzso or zzso zzso blocked growth of zzso including the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of zzso as well as other zzso of breast zzso
