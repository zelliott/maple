To identify the extent and the smallest region of loss for zzso zzso and zzso zzso deletions of human zzso zzso occur frequently in zzso cell lines and are common in zzso cell zzso of the head and neck zzso This complex region encodes the tumor zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso 

A targeted probe panel designed to finely map the region of zzso loss comprised 3 zzso for zzso 7 for zzso zzso and 3 for zzso and was interrogated using the multiplex zzso probe amplification zzso zzso The zzso zzso copy number zzso for zzso were validated using real-time zzso chain zzso 

Six zzso primary zzso and zzso or zzso zzso cell lines were zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

Cell line zzso retained all zzso zzso tested in the zzso Cell lines zzso indicated zzso deletion of zzso zzso starting at zzso zzso zzso to include zzso 2 and zzso zzso loss was indicated for zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso Cell line zzso indicated retention of all zzso zzso except for zzso zzso zzso Selective loss of the 3' end of zzso was observed in zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso were validated at the DNA level for zzso 

We identified zzso zzso zzso as the smallest region of loss in the zzso zzso zzso The frequency and precise loss of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the prognosis of zzso zzso may provide impetus for use of these targets as therapeutic zzso in head and neck zzso
