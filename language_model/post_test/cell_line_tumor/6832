The zzso gene has been previously identified by in zzso analysis of four million zzso as a candidate gene zzso expressed in breast zzso zzso is located on zzso zzso and it encodes the zzso of the zzso acid zzso zzso a zzso protein expressed in the brain and several zzso zzso Using zzso dot zzso zzso zzso profiling zzso quantitative zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso we have zzso zzso expression in breast cancer and normal breast zzso as well as in zzso and zzso breast cell zzso Analysis of the cancer profiling array revealed a more than zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso of primary breast zzso zzso zzso 50) compared to corresponding normal zzso zzso zzso in a panel of 23 normal human zzso showed that the zzso expression level was most abundant in the normal breast zzso compared to other human zzso zzso zzso in breast cancer was confirmed by quantitative zzso in zzso breast zzso and normal breast tissue specimens zzso zzso zzso in archival zzso zzso tissue specimens zzso zzso zzso as well as in breast cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, a significant zzso of zzso was noted in large zzso zzso zzso zzso primary breast zzso zzso zzso showed strong zzso expression in normal zzso and benign zzso breast cells, but no signal could be detected in invasive zzso zzso Altogether, these data suggest that zzso is progressively zzso with zzso and that it may be useful as a zzso marker in breast zzso
