Although the zzso zzso gap junction is abolished in zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso tends to increase in correspondence with the grade of zzso zzso a zzso expression system in human zzso zzso zzso cells where zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso withdrawal, we previously demonstrated that zzso of zzso zzso made zzso cells zzso in zzso In our study, zzso that the zzso zzso zzso may involve expansion of the cancer stem cell zzso population, we examined whether zzso zzso controlled the size of the side population zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell sorting revealed that SP was expanded in a zzso medium compared with a zzso zzso Although zzso zzso did not block maturation from SP to zzso zzso SP zzso a larger SP fraction in the zzso medium than in the zzso zzso Furthermore, although SP from zzso zzso mock cells formed a similar number of zzso spheres of a similar size whether with or without zzso SP from zzso zzso zzso cells developed a greater number of larger zzso spheres in the zzso medium than in the zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso of zzso zzso should enhance zzso of zzso to expand the zzso population in zzso
