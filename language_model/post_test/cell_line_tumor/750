The zzso zzso zzso is a critical factor for zzso cell invasion and zzso zzso is known to occur in cancer zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso zzso the zzso of zzso expression in the human colon cancer cell lines zzso and zzso zzso cancer cells were exposed to zzso (2 zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso The subsequent expression of zzso on the cell surface was examined by zzso and zzso zzso zzso the total amount of zzso protein was examined by Western zzso and the zzso zzso level was examined by a real-time zzso chain reaction zzso The expression of zzso on the cell surface and the total amount of zzso protein were zzso reduced after zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso level was not decreased during zzso zzso with zzso D or zzso that interfere with the zzso of zzso significantly attenuated the zzso of zzso which implicated a role for the de zzso protein zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso a transient reduction of zzso expression in human colon cancer cells through zzso dependent zzso zzso
