Current methods to study zzso zzso are not well suited for high zzso drug screening since they require large cell numbers and multiple experimental steps that include zzso for isolation of zzso or zzso Here we show that site specific zzso analysis can be achieved in one step by simply performing direct zzso zzso zzso on zzso The basic underlying observation was that standard zzso zzso buffers prevent global cellular zzso zzso during zzso cycling while more loosely organized zzso can be zzso Despite repeated heating to zzso zzso 41 of 61 tested zzso sequences of silenced genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were not zzso while 47 could be amplified from expressing zzso Two gene regions zzso zzso even required zzso of cells in zzso media to allow this zzso otherwise none of 19 zzso sequences yielded zzso zzso zzso with baseline expression or zzso zzso gave similar zzso zzso zzso during differentiation of zzso positive zzso blood cells closed respective zzso while treatment of myeloma cells with an zzso zzso inhibitor opened a site to zzso that was occupied by zzso zzso II and zzso as determined by zzso zzso into real-time zzso can not be achieved with commercial real-time zzso buffers which zzso open zzso but even with simple zzso zzso addition to standard zzso zzso we were able to identify hits in small molecules screens that suppressed zzso expression or zzso zzso in myeloma cells using zzso or visual inspection of zzso plates under zzso zzso While need in drug development inspired this work, application to zzso analysis appears feasible using zzso for selective amplification of open cellular zzso followed by library construction from zzso since such zzso yielded similar results as gene specific zzso
