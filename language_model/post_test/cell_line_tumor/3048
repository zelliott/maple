In this study, we evaluated whether the forced expression of zzso zzso would zzso the zzso to zzso transition zzso When the full length zzso zzso was expressed in poorly invasive zzso cell zzso zzso cells, the resulting zzso cells acquired a zzso zzso increased expression of the zzso marker zzso and reduced expression of the zzso markers zzso and zzso zzso cells, which express a truncated form of zzso zzso lacking the zzso 11 zzso acids zzso retained their zzso zzso and did not alter zzso or zzso zzso This suggests that the full-length zzso zzso can induce zzso in oral SCC zzso We previously showed that expression of zzso increases both zzso zzso and zzso expression and we now show that both molecules are zzso zzso These results also demonstrate that the terminal 11 AA of zzso contain information important for establishing an zzso to zzso zzso
