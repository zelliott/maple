Wine may cause stomach irritation due to its zzso effect on gastric acid zzso although the mechanisms by which wine or components zzso activate pathways of gastric acid zzso are poorly zzso zzso pH was measured with a zzso zzso probe, demonstrating that administration of 125 zzso of white or red wine to healthy volunteers zzso gastric acid zzso more zzso than the administration of equivalent amounts of zzso Between both zzso red wine showed a clear trend for being more active in stimulating gastric acid zzso than white wine zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso concentration in human gastric tumor cells zzso a well-established indicator of zzso zzso and, in turn, stomach acid formation in zzso confirmed the stronger effect of red wine as compared to white zzso zzso experiments on cells exposed to red wine also revealed a more pronounced effect than white wine on the fold change expression of genes associated with gastric acid zzso Of the zzso abundant organic acids in wine, zzso acid and zzso acid most actively zzso zzso zzso in zzso However, addition of ethanol to individual organic acids attenuated the zzso effect of zzso acid, but not that of the other organic zzso It was concluded that zzso acid for white wine and zzso acid for red wine are key organic acids that contribute to gastric acid zzso
