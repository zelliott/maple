It has been reported that the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso A zzso zzso an increase in zzso gene zzso zzso This result would compromise the use of zzso in combination with other zzso agents that are zzso of zzso zzso It has also been reported the use of alternative promoters by the zzso gene and the existence of a zzso control of zzso zzso Finally, the zzso gene is located in a genetic locus with the zzso gene zzso in the complementary DNA zzso raising the possibility that zzso expression could interfere with zzso alternative promoter zzso 

A combination of zzso real time zzso Western zzso and drug zzso zzso by flow zzso has been used in this zzso 

The zzso increase in zzso zzso levels is not followed by a subsequent increase in zzso protein levels or activity in several pancreatic and colon zzso cell lines, suggesting a zzso control of zzso in these cell zzso In addition, the zzso zzso produced in these cell lines is shorter in its zzso end that the zzso zzso produced in cell lines expressing zzso zzso The different size of the zzso zzso is due to the use of alternative zzso We also demonstrate that these promoters are zzso regulated by zzso The zzso blockade of zzso zzso in the pancreatic zzso cell lines could be related to zzso in the zzso end of the zzso zzso in the zzso protein expressing cell zzso In addition, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso gene zzso expression although zzso by zzso is independent of the zzso alternative promoter zzso 

The results show that the increase in zzso zzso expression after zzso treatment is clinically irrelevant since this zzso does not render an active zzso zzso at least in colon and pancreatic cancer cell zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso in fact, regulates zzso both zzso zzso zzso the upstream promoter that is responsible for active zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso such as zzso may in fact zzso the effects of zzso drugs that are zzso of zzso Finally, we also demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso independently of the zzso promoter in zzso
