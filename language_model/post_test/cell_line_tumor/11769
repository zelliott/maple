Alternative zzso contributes to cell zzso zzso Here, we show that changes in zzso zzso marks affect zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso 18 zzso alternative zzso during zzso zzso An increase in the repressive marks zzso and zzso along the gene body correlated with zzso of zzso II zzso in the zzso region, but without significantly affecting total zzso zzso Treatment with the general DNA zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso pointing to a role for repressive marks in sustaining zzso zzso patterns typical of mature zzso We demonstrate that zzso deployment of repressive zzso zzso induced by zzso small interfering zzso targeting zzso zzso 18, promotes zzso inclusion in zzso zzso cells, confirming the zzso changes observed upon differentiation to be sufficient to induce alternative zzso Combined with previous evidence that zzso zzso causes zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso our results show how two alternative zzso marks regulate zzso alternative zzso and zzso levels in different cellular zzso
