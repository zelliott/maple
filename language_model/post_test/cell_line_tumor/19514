zzso is the main phenomenon of type II programmed cell death which is also named as zzso cell death, and zzso has a close relationship with zzso cell zzso The relationship of zzso and cell cycle has been explored deeply, but little is known about the relationship of zzso cell death and cell zzso This study was to observe the correlation of zzso induced by different methods to cell zzso 

zzso growing zzso and zzso cells, and peripheral blood zzso zzso from healthy donors, with or without 48 h stimulation of zzso zzso were treated with zzso solution (to produce zzso or zzso zzso laser microscope and transmission electron microscope zzso were used to detect zzso flow zzso zzso was zzso used to detect the cell cycle of zzso cells with zzso of zzso protein 1 light chain 3 zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso cells induced by zzso or zzso was observed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and increased along with the zzso time; no zzso was observed in zzso zzso The positive rate of zzso indicating the occurrence of zzso was lower than zzso when induced by zzso in zzso solution for 48 zzso or zzso when induced by zzso for 48 zzso After zzso were zzso into cell cycle by zzso zzso was markedly detected 2 h after the indicated zzso 

zzso zzso analysis by zzso is a convenient and reliable method for simultaneously analyzing zzso and cell zzso zzso could be induced when cells are in cell cycle, while the cells in zzso phase are insensitive to the zzso
