The zzso protein is a zzso zzso factor that plays a crucial role in tumor suppression by inducing zzso or cell cycle arrest in response to cellular zzso To identify novel proteins involved in the regulation of zzso zzso activity we have performed a large scale zzso zzso zzso We have identified four genes previously unknown to be involved in modulating zzso activity zzso zzso zzso and zzso The interference of each of these four genes resulted in the zzso of zzso zzso activity and, conversely, their zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso target promoters and zzso zzso These observations suggest a role for these genes as zzso zzso and imply that they may have zzso zzso
