zzso zzso is one of the most common zzso solid tumors in children and is known for its clinical and biological zzso The aim of this study is to reveal the functional role of zzso family zzso in the biological behavior of zzso by zzso their zzso activities with a specific zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were treated with zzso of zzso zzso changes, cell growth, and cell death were zzso as well as zzso zzso acid zzso zzso differentiation and zzso growth factor zzso zzso 

At zzso after zzso treatment, zzso cell lines showed drastic cell zzso zzso also inhibited cell growth of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso was detected in these zzso zzso zzso differentiation of zzso was not affected by zzso zzso reduced the zzso effect of zzso zzso rapid zzso of zzso which was not blocked by zzso treatment, suggesting that the cellular events triggered by zzso were independent to zzso zzso signaling zzso 

Our data suggests that zzso family zzso promote cell zzso and reduces cell zzso of zzso zzso family zzso zzso may be good candidates for a novel molecular target zzso
