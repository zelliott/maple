To establish zzso knocking down zzso cell model and detect the effects of zzso expression on breast cancer zzso 

zzso cells carrying zzso construct were established by zzso infection and zzso zzso Western zzso and real-time zzso were used to check the expression levels of zzso In zzso imaging system was used to monitor the effects of zzso knocked down on cell growth and tumor zzso after the in zzso zzso of zzso knocking down zzso cells in zzso zzso 

The cell expression decreased at the protein and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in different zzso zzso cells was respectively zzso zzso and zzso versus the control zzso zzso zzso cells were chosen for in zzso zzso into zzso mice because zzso intensity was consistent with cell zzso The zzso flux of lung zzso tumor induced by zzso knocking down zzso cell was zzso zzso zzso while that of lung zzso induced by control cells was zzso zzso zzso The differences between two groups were zzso In pathology, zzso was detected positive in lung zzso tumors induced by control zzso However, zzso was negative in the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso infection may be effectively used to establish zzso knocking down zzso cell zzso Because of its involvement in the in zzso pulmonary zzso of breast zzso zzso should be a novel target for tumor zzso
