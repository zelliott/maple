The zzso zzso zzso zzso is activated in most advanced prostate zzso yet so far treatments with zzso zzso have been at best zzso in zzso cancer models and do not show significant zzso efficacy in clinical zzso zzso from tissue culture experiments in prostate cancer cells suggest that zzso zzso should be combined with other zzso zzso however, the general toxicity of such combinations prevents translating these experimental data into zzso and clinical zzso We investigated the emerging concept of zzso synthetic zzso in prostate cancer cells by using the zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso zzso a protein zzso between the zzso variable zzso of the zzso zzso zzso against the zzso membrane zzso zzso and the truncated form of the zzso zzso zzso A zzso The combination of zzso and zzso increased zzso within 6 hours and cell death zzso at zzso zzso in the zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso but not in control cells that do not express zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that induction of zzso requires zzso death promoter zzso zzso and decreased expression of zzso leukemia cell differentiation protein 1 zzso A single injection of zzso and zzso into zzso prostate cancer zzso cells led to consistent and stable reduction of zzso within 6 zzso These results suggest that the combination of a zzso inhibitor and a zzso protein synthesis inhibitor toxin represents a promising novel strategy for advanced prostate cancer therapy that should be further zzso
