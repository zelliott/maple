zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso is associated with resistance to chemotherapy and zzso advanced tumor stage, invasion, zzso and poor prognosis in zzso zzso zzso therefore, has been an attractive molecular target for zzso However, the results of clinical studies using zzso of its zzso activity have not been promising because the response rates were at most zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is a membrane protein that mediates the transport of zzso across cellular zzso zzso physically associates with and zzso zzso to promote zzso zzso into cancer cells through a zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the zzso of zzso and zzso and its relationships with zzso features in oral zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected in all zzso cell lines, and the expression levels of zzso were significantly correlated with those of zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso of zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso study using the surgical specimens in 52 patients with tongue SCC also showed a significant correlation between zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso expression was zzso related to tumor differentiation among the 5 zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso might be required in the zzso of zzso but further study is needed to clarify the implication of these proteins in the manifestation of zzso and clinical zzso
