zzso zzso potential in zzso cells is an important characteristic of zzso It is of great current interest to develop a zzso that is sensitive to zzso potential changes at the early stage of tumor zzso In this report, we present the synthesis and evaluation of zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a new zzso for imaging tumors in zzso nude mice bearing zzso human zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso We also explored its zzso mechanism using zzso as the fluorescent probe in both the zzso human zzso cell line and the cultured primary zzso zzso zzso It was found that zzso had the highest tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at zzso 1, 2, 4, and 24 h zzso zzso among many zzso organic zzso evaluated in the same animal zzso The cellular zzso study indicated that zzso was able to zzso in zzso of zzso zzso cells due to the enhanced negative zzso zzso This statement is completely supported by the results from decoupling experiment with zzso zzso zzso data showed that the zzso zzso tumors were clearly zzso as early as 30 zzso zzso with zzso zzso remained stable during zzso zzso but underwent extensive degradation during zzso zzso On the basis of the results from this study, it was concluded that zzso represents a new class of promising PET zzso for zzso imaging of the zzso zzso
