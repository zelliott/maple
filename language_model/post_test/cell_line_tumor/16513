zzso acid zzso is a widely distributed marine toxin produced by several zzso species and responsible for zzso shellfish poisoning in zzso At the molecular level zzso is a specific inhibitor of several types of zzso protein zzso Due to this zzso zzso zzso was reported to induce numerous zzso in relevant cellular zzso zzso including several zzso pathways such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and protein zzso In order to further understand the underlying mechanisms involved in zzso effects on cellular zzso the expression levels of six genes related to different zzso and anabolic zzso processes were analyzed by real-time zzso chain zzso Specifically, the expression patterns of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were determined in zzso human zzso cells exposed to zzso for 3, 24, or 48 zzso All these genes showed zzso in their expression levels after at least one of the zzso treatments zzso These zzso provide a basis to understand the mechanisms underlying the previously described zzso effects on different zzso zzso mainly regarding zzso and zzso zzso However, other zzso affected genes can not be ruled out, and further studies are required to more zzso characterize in the mechanisms of zzso interaction on cell zzso
