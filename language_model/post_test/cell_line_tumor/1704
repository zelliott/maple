zzso properties affect zzso physiology and direct zzso cell zzso Here we present data showing that zzso expressed by zzso cells is involved in the control of zzso fluid pressure zzso zzso volume zzso and collagen scaffold architecture in experimental zzso zzso zzso was elevated and zzso lowered in zzso zzso colon and zzso zzso zzso grown in zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso growth rate or on vascular zzso and zzso zzso by electron zzso of zzso from zzso zzso mice revealed a zzso and denser collagen network compared to zzso in zzso zzso zzso fibers were built from zzso and thicker collagen zzso in zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso did not correlate with increased zzso zzso in zzso zzso mice bearing zzso tumors, indicating that the zzso zzso was not zzso by increased zzso In conclusion, we report that zzso zzso in tumor zzso led to an elevated zzso and lowered zzso that correlated with a more zzso zzso underlining the role of the collagen network for zzso zzso
