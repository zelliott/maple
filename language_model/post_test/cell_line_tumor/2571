Chronically elevated fatty acids contribute to insulin resistance through poorly defined zzso zzso zzso zzso stress and the subsequent unfolded protein response zzso have been implicated in zzso insulin zzso However, the zzso is also a fundamental mechanism required for cell adaptation and zzso We aimed to distinguish the zzso and deleterious effects of zzso zzso stress on zzso insulin zzso Exposure of human zzso zzso cells or mouse primary zzso to the saturated fatty acid zzso enhanced zzso stress in a zzso zzso zzso exposure of zzso cells to prolonged mild zzso stress zzso induced by low levels of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This chronic mild zzso stress subsequently attenuated the acute stress response to high-level zzso zzso In contrast, exposure of zzso cells or zzso to severe zzso stress induced by high levels of zzso was associated with reduced zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as increased expression of zzso zzso of zzso stress using chemical zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso partially protected against the zzso changes in insulin zzso These findings in liver cells suggest that mild zzso stress associated with chronic low-level zzso exposure zzso an zzso zzso that enhances insulin signaling and protects against the effects of high-level zzso However, in the absence of chronic adaptation, severe zzso stress induced by high-level zzso exposure zzso deleterious zzso signaling that contributes to insulin resistance and zzso zzso
