zzso play a major role in zzso communication, targeting cells to transfer zzso molecules including zzso zzso and zzso zzso by an zzso zzso zzso are small zzso zzso molecules on average 22 zzso in length that regulate numerous biological processes including cancer zzso and mediate gene zzso by targeting zzso to induce zzso degradation and/or interfering with zzso Recent reports imply that zzso can be zzso detected in circulating plasma and serum since zzso are packaged by zzso to be protected from zzso zzso Thus, profiling zzso zzso are in need to clarify zzso signaling and discover a novel disease marker as zzso 

zzso were isolated from cultured cancer cell lines and their quality was validated by analyses of transmission electron zzso and western zzso One of the cell lines tested, a zzso gastric cancer cell line, zzso showed the highest zzso yield in the released zzso and distinctive shape in zzso In addition, zzso were isolated from cells and culture media, and profiles of these three zzso zzso were obtained using zzso zzso By comparing signal zzso of zzso data and the following validation using zzso analysis, we found that zzso zzso family was abundant in both the zzso and zzso zzso from zzso cells, while low zzso zzso the parental cell line of zzso as well as other cancer cell lines showed no such zzso 

The enrichment of zzso zzso family in the zzso zzso particularly, in the zzso from zzso cells may reflect their zzso characteristics including zzso and zzso Since zzso zzso generally play a zzso role as targeting zzso such as zzso and zzso our results suggest that zzso cells release zzso zzso via zzso into the zzso environment to maintain their zzso
