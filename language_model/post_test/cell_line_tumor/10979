zzso experiments routinely require the zzso of cellular zzso Several zzso zzso have been proposed, which have inherent advantages and zzso The performance of one of them, the crystal violet dissolution zzso was examined under a broad range of zzso zzso prostate zzso cells were exposed to zzso radiation in the presence or absence of heat shock protein zzso zzso Colony formation as assessed by traditional manual counting was compared with the results from the crystal violet dissolution zzso The overall zzso correlation of the data was determined zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The zzso of the data zzso from two different observers were zzso and found to agree zzso zzso radiation has a zzso effect that if plotted as zzso versus radiation energy dose yields a zzso distribution of data zzso The crystal violet dissolution zzso is a convenient tool for the rapid and zzso determination of cellular survival and under appropriate conditions exerts a reasonable correlation to colony zzso
