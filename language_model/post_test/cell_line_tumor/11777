zzso zzso is a worldwide cause of meningitis and zzso leading at least to 50,000 deaths every zzso Nevertheless, zzso zzso is also a zzso zzso that zzso zzso the zzso cells of the zzso of 10 to zzso of healthy zzso Occasionally, zzso zzso crosses the zzso barrier and enters the zzso During zzso zzso zzso may adhere to zzso cells of brain vessels and invade zzso To identify the genes required for zzso host zzso we screened a zzso zzso zzso library using an innovative in zzso colonization model in order to identify zzso displaying decreased capacity to colonize human zzso zzso zzso zzso defined zzso zzso of invasive zzso C strain zzso were zzso zzso zzso were tested individually for zzso of bacterial biomass with zzso microscope and zzso zzso Five zzso were demonstrated to exhibit significantly decreased colonization zzso The identified zzso including zzso and zzso appeared to be involved in adaptation to hypoxic conditions and stress zzso Interestingly, the genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso a putative zzso prior to this study, had not been shown to be involved in zzso zzso we provide here insights into the zzso functions necessary for the zzso to adapt to growth on host zzso
