To establish zzso transgenic mice model and study the effect of zzso zzso on tumor growth and zzso in zzso 

The zzso expression element of zzso which contained mouse zzso promoter, structural gene of zzso and zzso signal zzso was zzso into zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso The manipulated zzso were then transplanted into the zzso of 94 zzso recipient zzso All the newborn mice were screened by zzso to detect zzso DNA in tail zzso then zzso zzso and protein expression were detected by zzso and western zzso respectively in the positive zzso zzso cell zzso was zzso zzso into the right armpit of wild type mice and zzso zzso transgenic zzso zzso size was measured every zzso Mice were sacrificed on day 12 and then the tumors were exercised and zzso zzso and zzso were fixed in zzso and zzso The sections were stained with zzso and examined under zzso The expression of zzso protein was detected with zzso zzso 

Among the 43 zzso 3 were positive for tail tissue zzso gene examination, zzso was successfully expressed in the liver of the randomly selected transgenic zzso zzso tumor grew faster in all the transgenic mice than in wild type zzso The average size and weight of tumors between the transgenic mice and wild type mice were significantly different zzso zzso zzso Most tumors in the transgenic mice invaded the surrounding zzso and showed liver zzso zzso protein was expressed in zzso In contrast, nearly all the tumors in wild type mice were zzso and zzso was not expressed in zzso 

Our results showed that the zzso gene could be expressed in the liver of the transgenic zzso zzso promotes growth, invasion, and zzso of transplanted zzso tumors in zzso
