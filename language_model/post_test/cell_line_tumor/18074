zzso zzso zzso is an invasive and aggressive primary brain tumor which is associated with a dismal zzso We have earlier developed a zzso zzso zzso zzso model, in which treatment with zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso resulted in survival of approximately zzso of the zzso In this model, treatment with zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso in combination with zzso improves the survival rate to approximately zzso and zzso systemic zzso zzso We hypothesized that the growth of a large zzso tumor mass would cause behavioral abnormalities that can be reversed by the combined gene zzso We assessed the behavior and zzso of zzso animals treated with the combined gene therapy, 3 days after treatment, in long-term survivors, and in a zzso model of zzso We demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso behavioral deficits that are resolved after treatment with zzso zzso zzso analysis of long-term survivors revealed an overall recovery of normal brain zzso The lack of long-term behavioral deficits and limited zzso abnormalities demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the combined zzso gene therapy for zzso These findings can serve to zzso further developments of this therapeutic zzso leading toward zzso of a Phase I clinical zzso
