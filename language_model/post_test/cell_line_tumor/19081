zzso are characterized by zzso zzso suggesting that a tumor zzso gene zzso resides in this zzso We have mapped the smallest region of deletion zzso to a 2 zzso region of zzso using zzso and single zzso zzso We have identified 23 genes in this region, and we have zzso these genes for zzso and zzso expression patterns to identify candidate zzso We zzso the coding zzso of these genes in 30 zzso cell zzso Although rare zzso were found in 10 of the 23 zzso none showed a pattern of genetic change consistent with zzso zzso We examined the expression of these 23 genes in 20 zzso cell lines, and most showed readily zzso zzso and no correlation with zzso zzso However, 7 genes showed zzso low expression in the lines, and 2 genes zzso zzso had virtually absent zzso consistent with the expected pattern for a zzso Our zzso and expression analysis in zzso cell lines, combined with expression analysis in normal zzso putative function and prior implication in zzso zzso suggests that the most promising zzso deleted from the zzso zzso is zzso but zzso zzso and zzso are also viable zzso
