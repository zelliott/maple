Resistance to two cultured lines of zzso zzso zzso was studied in F1 hybrids constructed between the zzso mouse strain zzso and several zzso zzso Three of four such hybrid strains were significantly more resistant to the zzso zzso zzso line zzso than the zzso zzso parent zzso All hybrid strains tested showed significantly higher resistance to the zzso zzso zzso line zzso than the zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso lines does not require a hybrid zzso zzso Several kinds of evidence indicate that this hybrid resistance has an zzso zzso
