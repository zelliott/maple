The aim of this work was to improve the zzso and zzso effects of zzso using a zzso zzso zzso therapy zzso zzso zzso rat zzso and human zzso zzso cell lines were zzso with an zzso zzso zzso the human zzso zzso gene zzso zzso tumors were established in zzso mice and zzso rats using either zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso growing cells and established tumors were treated with zzso and zzso either alone or in zzso zzso zzso zzso substantially increased both the toxic and zzso effects of zzso in each cell line, but the enhancement rate zzso it was mild in the zzso cells and much stronger in the zzso and zzso zzso In zzso experiments showed a mild zzso effect of zzso zzso both in the zzso and zzso zzso The combination of zzso zzso zzso treatment and zzso improved the survival rate of zzso bearing rats zzso In conclusion, zzso of the zzso gene can improve the zzso and zzso effect of zzso both in zzso and in zzso in a zzso zzso
