To investigate zzso cell cycle changes of human breast cancer stem cells enriched by suspension zzso 

The zzso of human breast cancer stem cell line zzso cultured in zzso media was confirmed in zzso mice, and the zzso of the cells was tested by clone formation zzso following radiation zzso zzso zzso was performed to evaluate zzso cell cycle changes, and the protein expression of zzso zzso was measured by Western zzso 

After the exposure to 2 zzso radiation, the survived fraction of the cells in suspension culture and those in adherent culture was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, and the cells in suspension culture showed an obviously greater capacity of zzso in zzso zzso The radiation exposure resulted in an obvious increase in the proportion of zzso phase cells from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and significantly increased the expression of zzso zzso 

zzso induced zzso phase arrest may contribute to the resistance of the breast cancer stem cells to zzso
