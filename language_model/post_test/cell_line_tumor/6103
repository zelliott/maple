The formation of protein complexes or clusters in the plasma membrane is essential for many biological zzso such as zzso We develop a zzso based on zzso zzso for following cluster formation in zzso zzso and tracing of single zzso proteins have become standard zzso zzso The determination of the number of proteins in a zzso however, remains zzso The reasons are zzso the poor zzso stability and complex zzso of fluorescent proteins and zzso noise and zzso background in live cell zzso We show that, despite those obstacles, the accurate fraction of signals in which a certain (or zzso number of labeled proteins zzso can be determined in an accurate an robust way in zzso We define experimental conditions under which fluorescent proteins exhibit predictable zzso of intensity and zzso the influence of zzso Finally, we confirm our theoretical predictions by zzso of the zzso of individual enhanced yellow fluorescent protein zzso molecules in living zzso zzso of the average number of zzso zzso in zzso spots finally confirm that the membrane anchor of human Harvey rat zzso zzso zzso distributes in the plasma membrane of living Chinese zzso zzso zzso
