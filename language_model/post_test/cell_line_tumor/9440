To construct a database of human lung zzso zzso cell line zzso and to facilitate discovery of novel zzso markers of lung zzso 

zzso technique was used to analyze human lung zzso zzso cell line zzso The proteins of the zzso cells were separated by two-dimensional gel zzso and identified by mass zzso 

The results showed that a good zzso of the zzso gel pattern was zzso The position zzso of matched spots among three zzso gels was zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso focusing direction, and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso One hundred and zzso zzso including zzso signal zzso zzso structure zzso transport zzso zzso were zzso of which, 29 identified proteins in zzso cells were reported for the first time to be involved in lung cancer zzso 

The information obtained from this study could provide some valuable clues for further study on the zzso mechanism of different types of lung cancer, and may help us to discover some potential zzso zzso of lung zzso
