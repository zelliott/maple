This study demonstrated the fabrication of zzso zzso using a modular zzso system for zzso controlled drug release and cell zzso A novel two-dimensional zzso technique with zzso and junctions was used to zzso control the continuous zzso flow of zzso zzso The diameter of the manufactured zzso which ranged from 211 zzso to 364 zzso could be well controlled by changing the flow rate of the continuous zzso While the model drug, zzso was zzso into zzso the drug release profile exhibited the characteristic of a proper and steady zzso Furthermore, the zzso release zzso from the magnetic iron zzso zzso could be controlled zzso allowing for a rapid drug release by applying a magnetic zzso In addition, the successful culture of zzso zzso cells in the zzso demonstrated a good structural integrity and environment to grow cells that could be applied in drug screening for targeting cancer zzso The proposed zzso system has the advantages of ease of zzso zzso and a fast and low-cost process that is capable of generating functional zzso with the potential for biomedical applications, such as drug controlled release and cell zzso
