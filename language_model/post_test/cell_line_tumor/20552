The zzso locus is amplified in a zzso of zzso zzso zzso grade III breast zzso This zzso comprises nine zzso including zzso E1 zzso which has been proposed as its zzso The aim of this study was to identify the genes within the zzso zzso whose expression is required for the survival of cancer cells zzso their zzso 

We investigated the presence of zzso amplification in a series of 313 frozen primary breast zzso and 56 breast cancer cell lines using zzso comparative zzso zzso zzso The nine genes mapping to the smallest region of amplification on zzso were silenced using zzso interference in zzso matched breast cancer cell lines with zzso and zzso and without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso amplification of this zzso Genes whose zzso was selectively lethal in amplified cells were taken forward for further zzso The effects of zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso and chemical zzso were tested in cancer cells with and without zzso zzso 

zzso amplification was identified in zzso of zzso grade III breast zzso Of the nine genes mapping to this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly zzso when amplified in primary breast zzso and/or breast cancer cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso selectively reduced cell viability in cancer cells zzso their zzso Cancer cells with zzso amplification were shown to be dependent on zzso expression and zzso activity for their zzso 

The zzso zzso may zzso more than a single zzso given that expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso is required for the survival of cancer cells displaying their zzso The observation that cancer cells zzso zzso gene amplification are sensitive to zzso zzso provides a rationale for the testing of these chemical zzso in a zzso of patients with zzso grade III breast zzso
