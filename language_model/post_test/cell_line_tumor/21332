Recent studies have revealed that zzso zzso are very common in zzso melanoma and are required for tumor growth and zzso The majority of zzso zzso zzso involve a single point zzso zzso which results in greatly elevated zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso of zzso zzso Here we show that zzso increases resistance to zzso induced by zzso drugs and promotes zzso zzso of the zzso proteins zzso and Bad that are involved in setting thresholds for zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in degradation of this zzso zzso whereas zzso of Bad has previously been shown to result in its zzso by zzso zzso zzso with this, zzso of zzso activity in a panel of melanoma cell lines resulted in stabilization of zzso and zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso induced through zzso of Bad or zzso was efficiently blocked by zzso of zzso zzso However, small interfering zzso zzso of zzso and Bad expression zzso only modest protection against zzso drugs, whereas zzso zzso strongly protected against the same zzso These observations suggest that zzso zzso of Bad and zzso only partly contributes to the zzso activities of this zzso and that other points within the cell death machinery are also targeted by zzso zzso zzso
