zzso protein zzso is a biological zzso zzso system developed from the zzso cell wall display mechanism found in zzso zzso This zzso system zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso a zzso containing the zzso zzso recognition zzso and zzso an zzso zzso zzso We describe cloning of the zzso zzso zzso which binds to the zzso domain of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso from the parental zzso zzso and incorporation of a zzso tag zzso zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate successful incorporation of zzso from zzso onto zzso zzso is an important cancer target and is zzso in human tumor zzso and cancer lines, such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically bound zzso expressed on zzso cells, but not negative control zzso Similarly, when zzso was labeled with zzso we observed zzso zzso The ability to introduce functionality into zzso zzso in a controlled, zzso manner has applications in zzso zzso and potentially clinical zzso For example, we demonstrate addition of all three reaction components in zzso within a zzso flow cell, resulting in oriented zzso capture and presentation of zzso and determination of precise affinities for the zzso zzso
