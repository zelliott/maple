An increasing body of evidence suggests that zzso contain a small subset of their own zzso cells called cancer stem cells zzso which play critical roles in the zzso maintenance and zzso of zzso However, the role of zzso in cancer zzso especially in zzso to bone, has not been extensively zzso Side population zzso has been shown to enrich zzso in several types of cancer, including breast zzso In the present study, we characterized the SP cells isolated from the human breast cancer cell line zzso in comparison to zzso zzso zzso cell zzso analysis demonstrated the existence of SP in zzso cells, which was markedly reduced in the presence of zzso C, a specific inhibitor of zzso cassette zzso G member 2 zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso expression was significantly higher in SP cells than in zzso zzso SP cells formed increased numbers of zzso in suspension zzso Furthermore, the tumor growth in the zzso zzso fat pad in nude mice was significantly accelerated in SP zzso On the other hand, the development of bone zzso determined by zzso injection into nude mice showed no difference between SP and zzso zzso SP abundance in the tumor cells isolated from the bone zzso was not increased either compared with that from the zzso zzso These results suggest that the SP in zzso cells possesses some of the zzso properties but does not have higher zzso potential to zzso
