With an approach to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy agents against breast cancer treatment, here, we investigated the zzso effects of grape seed extract zzso and zzso zzso either alone or in zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso human breast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of cells resulted in zzso growth zzso and zzso cell death, in a zzso and a zzso zzso In other studies, zzso zzso zzso treatment showed zzso growth zzso and zzso cell zzso Based on these results, several combinations of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso were next assessed for their zzso additive and/or zzso efficacy towards cell growth zzso and zzso In both zzso and zzso cells, a combination of 100 zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso treatment for 48 h showed a strong synergistic effect zzso index zzso zzso zzso in cell growth zzso but mostly an additive effect zzso approximately 1) in cell zzso In zzso progression studies, zzso plus zzso combination resulted in a moderate increase in zzso arrest in zzso cells compared to each agent zzso zzso plus zzso combination showed a very strong and significant zzso arrest in zzso cells when compared with zzso alone, however, it was less than that observed with zzso zzso In quantitative zzso studies, zzso and zzso alone and in combination showed comparable zzso death of zzso cells, however, a combination of the two was zzso to zzso induced zzso in zzso zzso This was further confirmed in another zzso zzso zzso cell line, in which zzso and zzso combination strongly inhibited cell growth but did not show any increase in zzso cell death caused by zzso Together, these results suggest a strong possibility of synergistic efficacy of zzso and zzso combination for breast cancer treatment, independent of zzso zzso status of the cancer zzso
