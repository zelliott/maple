zzso gene products play a crucial role in the development of highly zzso zzso and aggressive cancer progression in a variety of zzso however, their role in zzso zzso remains zzso First, we analyzed the impact of zzso and zzso zzso on cell growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed marked growth zzso after zzso or zzso zzso In addition, simultaneous zzso of these 2 genes further zzso cell growth zzso zzso Next, we conducted zzso assessment of 86 zzso zzso surgical zzso evaluating the correlation between zzso and zzso protein expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression was detected in 57 zzso and 52 tumor zzso zzso zzso Among these, 48 tumor zzso zzso showed zzso of zzso and zzso in almost all tumor zzso The cumulative recurrence rate, but not survival rate, was significantly higher in patients positive for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso than in their negative counterparts, as determined by zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso and zzso may cooperate in initiation and progression of zzso zzso
