zzso zzso a precursor of zzso not only zzso the level of zzso in both zzso and zzso cultures, but also affects the cellular level of zzso zzso zzso cells were investigated using the stable zzso human cell zzso In the zzso cells, zzso depending on the concentration in the culture medium and culture zzso either elevated or diminished the level of zzso zzso and this was respectively accompanied by decreased or increased cellular zzso In zzso zzso in turn, zzso was capable of lowering the level of zzso sulfur and in this way decreased cellular zzso It seems that normal zzso and transformed zzso cells differed in their reaction to zzso in the culture zzso The effect of zzso on zzso cells was advantageous in that it inhibited their proliferation through the zzso of the level of zzso zzso
