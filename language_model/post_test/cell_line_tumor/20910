zzso antibiotics penetrate cells, but the mechanism by which this occurs is zzso The objective of this study was to characterize the mechanisms of zzso zzso by zzso zzso and oral zzso zzso human zzso zzso and zzso cells were incubated with zzso We zzso zzso transport by measuring zzso zzso over zzso zzso and zzso cells rapidly accumulated zzso attaining zzso zzso zzso within 15 zzso zzso in medium containing 2 zzso zzso yielded zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso transport exhibited zzso zzso and was inhibited below 37 degrees zzso The zzso zzso for zzso and zzso cells were zzso and 227 zzso respectively, while the maximum transport zzso were 264 and zzso zzso cells, zzso Thus, both types of cells take up zzso via a zzso active transport zzso By increasing zzso zzso levels, this system may enhance the effectiveness of zzso against invasive zzso zzso
