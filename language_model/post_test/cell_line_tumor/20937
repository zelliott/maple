zzso is a zzso zzso catalyzing protein zzso zzso We investigated the contribution of this zzso to the zzso of the injured plasma membrane in animal cells, using a lung zzso cell line, zzso After mechanical injury by zzso the level of membrane zzso was estimated by differential incorporation of zzso labeled with two distinct fluorescent zzso The recovery level was decreased in the presence of excess primary zzso as a competitive inhibitor of zzso We established a cell line that zzso expresses zzso (short hairpin zzso to specifically inhibit the expression of zzso 2 zzso zzso of zzso and confirmed the suppressed zzso level in the zzso Furthermore, additional expression of zzso 2 rescued the ability for membrane zzso These results show that, after mechanical damage, this zzso appeared to contribute to membrane zzso
