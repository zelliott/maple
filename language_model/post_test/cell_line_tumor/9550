zzso tract cancer is of highly zzso with a poor zzso zzso However, established zzso regimens have not yet been zzso Previously, we have reported that zzso a mismatch repair zzso gene was frequently zzso found to be lacking in surgically zzso zzso tract zzso and the patients lacking the expression of zzso revealed a poorer prognosis than those patients who possessed zzso The zzso gene has been considered to be associated with sensitivity to various zzso agents that act on zzso A loss of zzso expression has been reported to increase sensitivity to zzso zzso such as zzso zzso or zzso zzso In the present study, whether or not zzso zzso resulted in a higher sensitivity to zzso zzso active form zzso was investigated using a short interfering zzso zzso A quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso was conducted to measure the levels of zzso expression in seven cancer cell lines, and this was compared with the drug sensitivity zzso to zzso The zzso expression was correlated with the zzso for zzso although the relationship was not statistically significant (R zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso double strand zzso zzso was zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso by zzso zzso in a zzso manner in comparison to the control zzso The cell growth of the zzso zzso zzso group was decreased by approximately 50% by zzso zzso zzso zzso was also carried out to examine the effect of the zzso treatment on the cell zzso Following zzso zzso zzso the zzso fraction was increased in comparison with the control in a zzso zzso In conclusion, a low expression of zzso in zzso tract cancer may aid in predicting its responsiveness to zzso zzso
