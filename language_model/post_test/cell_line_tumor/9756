zzso regulation of zzso a zzso family member, remains zzso Here we report that zzso expression is significantly regulated by cell zzso In particular, we found that zzso and zzso are zzso zzso While zzso protein levels were zzso correlated with cell zzso zzso protein levels behaved zzso We further showed that zzso changes of zzso follow the same patterns as zzso and zzso zzso levels, suggesting zzso zzso Our data also suggest that high levels of zzso at lower zzso may be due to increased protein zzso However, zzso appeared not to be involved in zzso of zzso at high zzso Moreover, we also found that zzso location of zzso zzso changes with the culture density zzso While high level of zzso at low density was mainly presented in the nucleus, low levels of this protein at high zzso were mainly in the zzso Taken together, these findings reveal a novel mechanism that zzso regulates zzso zzso and underscores the role of zzso interaction in zzso regulation, which may advance our understanding of zzso expression and function in human zzso
