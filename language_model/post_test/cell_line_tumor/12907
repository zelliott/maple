The zzso factor zzso has been well characterized as an zzso in several human tumor types, and its expression in the zzso zzso cell population is essential for proper zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso and breast zzso is poorly zzso despite its high expression in the majority of breast cancer cases zzso 

We find that zzso high expression in human breast tumors zzso with the zzso zzso and a good zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso breast tumor cell line increased zzso both in zzso and in zzso suggesting a possible tumor zzso role in zzso breast zzso We created a zzso zzso expression signature, comprised of both direct and indirect zzso target zzso and found it to be highly correlated with a published mature zzso zzso cell signature and least correlated with a zzso zzso lineage gene zzso 

These data describe, for the first time, a possible tumor zzso role for the zzso zzso in breast cancer that has implications for the understanding of zzso zzso and for guiding zzso
