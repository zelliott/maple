zzso burden is strongly implicated in the zzso of age-related diseases, including prostate cancer tumor zzso As omega-3 fatty acids possess known zzso properties, we investigated the effects of zzso acid zzso one component of fish oil, in modulating the effects of zzso DNA damage in zzso and zzso human prostate zzso cells and in a normal human prostate cell line, zzso 

Cell survival was determined by an zzso of colony formation zzso DNA zzso breaks, zzso zzso zzso and relative zzso expression levels were determined by zzso and zzso expression levels confirmed by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity was investigated by dual zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso cells zzso with zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso exhibit decreased survival compared to zzso zzso zzso indicating DNA zzso breaks, were associated with zzso of zzso into the nucleus, whereas exposure to zzso prior to zzso zzso treatment prevented zzso zzso Further, zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and diminished expression of the downstream target, zzso 

zzso is heavily implicated in promoting zzso signaling and may be critical for resistance to the chronic zzso stress observed in the zzso of prostate zzso Our studies indicate that exposure of cells to zzso achievable levels of zzso prior to treatment with zzso zzso results in decreased cancer cell survival which is associated with nuclear exclusion of zzso We therefore propose that zzso selectively zzso prostate cancer cells to growth arrest through zzso of the zzso survival zzso
