zzso virus, zzso is a human zzso zzso whose replication in zzso cells causes the fatal zzso disease progressive zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso possesses zzso activity and expression of its transforming zzso large zzso zzso in several experimental animals zzso tumors of neural zzso Further, the presence of zzso DNA and zzso have been repeatedly observed in several human zzso zzso including primitive zzso tumors and zzso Earlier studies have demonstrated that zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso family of zzso which is implicated in zzso and zzso is zzso upon zzso infection of zzso cells and that zzso zzso is responsible for suppressing the activity of the zzso zzso Here, we investigated the possible impact of zzso on zzso expression in zzso human primary zzso cells as well as in cells derived from zzso zzso in transgenic zzso zzso from these studies revealed that zzso of zzso drastically decreases the level of zzso expression by inducing the zzso degradation of the viral zzso Interestingly, this event leads to the zzso of zzso infection of zzso cells, suggesting that the reduced levels of zzso seen upon the zzso of zzso has a biological impact on the viral zzso zzso zzso from zzso interaction studies showed that zzso and zzso physically interact with each other through the zzso of zzso and the zzso rich zzso of zzso and this interaction is important for the zzso degradation of zzso Our observations open a new avenue of research for better understanding of zzso interaction by investigating the interplay between zzso and zzso and their impact on the development of zzso zzso
