zzso zzso are zzso regulatory zzso zzso molecules that regulate the expressions of a wide variety of zzso including some involved in cancer zzso In this study, we investigated the possible role of zzso in zzso cancer zzso 

zzso levels of human mature zzso were examined using real-time zzso expression zzso on paired zzso zzso and adjacent zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was further evaluated in colon cancer cell lines and in paired zzso and adjacent zzso zzso zzso by zzso Potential targets of zzso were zzso The functional effect of zzso and its targets was investigated in human colon cancer cell lines to confirm zzso zzso 

Both real-time zzso expression zzso and zzso showed that zzso was frequently zzso in zzso (35 of 40) of zzso zzso zzso compared with their adjacent zzso zzso zzso Using in zzso predictions, DNA zzso 3A zzso was defined as a potential target of zzso Restoration of the zzso expression in colon cell lines decreased zzso cell growth and zzso colony formation, and zzso the zzso expression in both zzso and protein zzso zzso was shown to be a direct target of zzso by zzso reporter zzso Furthermore, the zzso expression was observed to be zzso correlated with zzso zzso and protein expression in zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso regulates zzso in zzso These findings zzso a zzso role of zzso in the zzso aberration of zzso providing a potential development of zzso targeted approaches for zzso zzso
