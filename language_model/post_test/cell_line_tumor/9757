An elevated level of copper zzso which is necessary for the growth and zzso of tumor cells, has been found in many types of cancer, including breast, zzso lung and zzso Although its molecular basis is zzso this zzso zzso zzso has been proposed to be a novel target for developing selective zzso zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso is able to form a zzso complex that zzso the zzso and zzso zzso in cultured cancer zzso Toward the goal of discovering novel zzso zzso as potential zzso and zzso drugs, in the current study we zzso several zzso zzso and their copper complexes and evaluated their biological activities in human breast cancer zzso We report that when zzso are made on the zzso group of zzso their copper zzso have profound effects on the zzso and zzso abilities in breast cancer zzso zzso In addition, the zzso and zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso are determined by both the polarity and position of the zzso Finally, a synthetic complex of zzso zzso was able to inhibit the zzso activity, induce cell death and suppress the growth selectively in breast cancer zzso cells, but not in normal immortalized human breast zzso zzso Our results support the concept that human cancer cells and zzso which contain an elevated copper level and are highly dependent on zzso activity for their survival, should be sensitive to treatment with zzso drugs such as the novel zzso zzso described zzso
