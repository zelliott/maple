zzso 9, which is often partially or fully reduced to zzso in zzso cancer cells, harbors several tumor zzso zzso including deleted in zzso cancer zzso region 1 zzso at zzso To study zzso function, stable cell lines, zzso for zzso expression by zzso were made, but the zzso protein was not expressed at zzso zzso To understand the fate of zzso cells, human zzso tumor cells were zzso zzso with an expression zzso containing zzso fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso Initially, zzso cells demonstrated diffuse zzso green zzso with nuclear exclusion zzso After time, the intensity level of green zzso increased and a zzso distribution of protein became visible in the zzso At this point, cells rounded up and detached from the tissue culture zzso zzso zzso with a control zzso containing only zzso and partial zzso fusion zzso did not demonstrate this zzso zzso cell death in cultured tumor cells was independent of zzso zzso and did not result in zzso DNA strand breaks by zzso zzso that are hallmarks of the classical zzso zzso
