Human zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso to its primary zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso as the first step of zzso However, zzso expression decreases as tumors progress, thereby diminishing the utility of zzso zzso for cancer zzso In contrast, many aggressive tumor cells highly express zzso a cellular zzso for zzso We hypothesized that a mosaic zzso zzso containing two kinds of fiber zzso would provide extensive zzso in a zzso population of tumor cells with varying expression levels of zzso zzso We therefore generated a zzso zzso zzso displaying both a zzso zzso fiber and the zzso fiber zzso We verified the structural integrity of zzso viral particles and confirmed that the zzso zzso zzso has expanded zzso We conclude that the use of zzso zzso zzso is a promising approach for zzso a zzso cell population with different expression levels of zzso zzso
