zzso originally identified as a zzso product, is an important negative regulator of transforming growth factor zzso family signaling through interaction with zzso zzso and zzso High expression of zzso has been found in some zzso including gastric zzso We previously showed that disruption of zzso signaling by zzso zzso type II zzso in a zzso gastric zzso model accelerated tumor growth through induction of tumor zzso by decreased expression of the zzso factor zzso zzso Here, we examined the function of zzso in human zzso gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso signaling in zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso resulted in extensive acceleration of the growth of subcutaneous zzso in zzso zzso female mice (6 weeks of zzso Similar to tumors expressing zzso zzso type II zzso zzso studies revealed less zzso and increased zzso in zzso tumors expressing zzso compared to control zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso was attenuated by zzso in zzso and expression of zzso zzso was decreased in tumors expressing zzso in zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso promotes the growth of zzso gastric zzso through induction of zzso
