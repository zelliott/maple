The present study investigated possible mechanisms on the zzso induction of human zzso cells by zzso a zzso zzso found in marine zzso zzso treatment of cells resulted in zzso of growth and induction of zzso as measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso and flow zzso zzso The increase in zzso was associated with the zzso zzso of zzso Bid zzso zzso of zzso zzso into the zzso release of zzso c from zzso to zzso and loss of zzso membrane potential zzso in zzso zzso However, zzso induced by zzso was attenuated by zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso was dependent on the zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment effectively activated the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and significantly reduced zzso zzso through zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso of zzso zzso may play a key role in zzso zzso In addition, the authors found zzso significantly attenuated in zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso with zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso markedly increased zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Our findings imply that we may attribute some of the biological functions of zzso zzso and zzso to their ability to inhibit zzso zzso
