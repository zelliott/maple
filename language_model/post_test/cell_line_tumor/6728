zzso immune privilege preserves the visual axis by preventing the induction of zzso zzso zzso Although privilege is essential for maintaining visual integrity, zzso tumors exploit the privileged environment and grow progressively within the anterior chamber of the zzso Recently, a large number of laboratories have constructed genetically engineered tumor cell vaccines that express high levels of zzso zzso These vaccines are designed to bypass the normal pathways of zzso zzso and directly activate zzso zzso T zzso In the following series of experiments, we determined whether a tumor cell vaccine that uses zzso signals zzso and zzso is capable of eliminating tumors within the zzso anterior zzso As expected, zzso mice rejected subcutaneous flank tumors (a zzso zzso However, the vaccine failed to protect mice from even a small number of tumor cells transplanted into the zzso anterior zzso Surprisingly, zzso mice that were simultaneously challenged with subcutaneous and anterior chamber tumors were unable to eliminate tumors at either zzso The failure of systemic protective immunity coincided with the loss of zzso delayed hypersensitivity and zzso T zzso We conclude that tumor cell vaccines that induce complete protection against tumors in zzso sites fail to protect against the same tumor within an zzso zzso zzso Moreover, a tumor that escapes elimination within the eye can terminate systemic protective immunity that is induced by the tumor cell zzso
