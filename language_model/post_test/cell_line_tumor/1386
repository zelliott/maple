zzso is a treatment choice for local control of breast zzso However, intrinsic zzso of cancer cells limits therapeutic zzso We have recently validated that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an attractive zzso zzso Here we tested our hypothesis that zzso a newly discovered zzso small zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso could act as a novel zzso agent in breast cancer zzso Indeed, we found that zzso effectively inhibited zzso zzso and zzso breast cancer cells to radiation with a sensitivity enhancement ratio zzso of zzso for zzso cells and zzso for zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso significantly enhanced zzso zzso arrest in zzso cells, but not in zzso cells at early time point, and enhanced zzso zzso in both lines at later time zzso However, zzso of zzso by zzso failed to abrogate zzso zzso suggesting that zzso was not zzso zzso We further showed that zzso failed to enhance zzso DNA damage response, but did cause minor delay in DNA damage zzso Among a number of tested zzso zzso zzso known to regulate growth arrest, zzso and DNA damage response, zzso was the only one showing an enhanced zzso in zzso combination group, as compared to the single treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso arrest and zzso indicating a zzso role played by zzso Our study suggested that zzso could be further developed as a novel class of zzso for the treatment of breast zzso
