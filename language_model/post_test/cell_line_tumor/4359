The majority of patients with acute zzso leukemia zzso still die of their zzso In order to improve survival rates in zzso patients, new strategies are necessary to discover zzso for the detection and targeted therapy of zzso One of the advantages of the zzso technology is the unique zzso selection process, which allows us to efficiently select for zzso zzso without knowing which target molecules are present on the cell zzso 

The zzso zzso cell line was used as the target cell population for selecting single stranded DNA zzso After determining the affinity of selected zzso to zzso the zzso were used to zzso human bone zzso zzso and zzso cells in clinical zzso Then a zzso zzso was used to enrich and identify its target surface zzso 

Three new zzso were characterized from the selected zzso pools zzso zzso and zzso All of them can selectively recognize zzso cells with zzso in the low zzso range zzso to zzso zzso The target of the zzso zzso zzso probe was identified as zzso a surface membrane protein in low abundance whose expression can serve as a zzso of zzso maturation and be used to zzso zzso More importantly, zzso expression can be used to detect low zzso of zzso cells in human bone zzso zzso and functions as a potential target for zzso zzso 

We have demonstrated a pipeline approach for developing single stranded DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso cells in clinical zzso and then identifying the zzso target zzso The developed zzso zzso and identified zzso protein may potentially be used for zzso cell detection and therapy in our future clinical zzso
