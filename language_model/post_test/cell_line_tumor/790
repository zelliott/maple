zzso a zzso zzso zzso is expressed in many regions of the adult zzso We examined the cell zzso expression of zzso in zzso and zzso cells in primary cultures of fetal zzso cells and sections of the adult mouse brain using zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso markers zzso and zzso to differentiate between zzso and zzso zzso zzso is exclusively expressed in zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in two zzso cell lines zzso zzso and the zzso cell line zzso but not in zzso cell lines zzso zzso or other, zzso cells zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso sequence from man and mouse identifies sequence motifs with similarity to the zzso zzso element, possibly explaining a zzso expression of zzso
