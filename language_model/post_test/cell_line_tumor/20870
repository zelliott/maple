As a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates the expression of multiple zzso zzso and zzso in zzso The zzso activated nature of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso has hindered its use as a predictor of zzso zzso zzso Here, we have identified zzso zzso a typical peripheral zzso zzso zzso zzso as a selective and potent inhibitor of human zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso activity of zzso more than zzso at the concentration of 10 zzso and the zzso activity was efficiently zzso by the direct zzso zzso zzso zzso but not by the indirect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso pull-down zzso showed that zzso zzso the interactions of zzso with the zzso steroid zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein 1 to inhibit zzso zzso The zzso by zzso specifically occurred to the zzso zzso strongly activated human zzso X zzso zzso whereas it did not alter the activity of the mouse zzso and mouse zzso In addition, zzso played no role in the zzso zzso of zzso because the zzso fully occurred in the zzso cells in which the zzso was knocked down by small interfering zzso In the zzso mouse liver, zzso zzso enhanced yellow fluorescent zzso into the zzso These results are consistent with the conclusion that zzso is a novel zzso zzso that zzso the zzso interactions to inhibit the zzso activity inside the zzso Thus, zzso can be used as a chemical tool for studying the molecular basis of zzso zzso
