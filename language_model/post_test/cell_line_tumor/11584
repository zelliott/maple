zzso of the zzso family provide a survival mechanism in many human zzso including chronic zzso leukemia zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso zzso is active in clinical trials for zzso zzso yet resistance is expected on the basis of zzso zzso We recently showed that zzso can dramatically sensitize several leukemia cell lines to zzso (the experimental zzso of zzso The goal of these experiments was to determine the impact of zzso on zzso sensitivity in zzso cells isolated from peripheral blood and to define the underlying zzso Freshly isolated zzso cells from 35 patients, as well as normal zzso and zzso were incubated with various zzso agents plus zzso to assess sensitivity to the single agents and the zzso zzso and zzso displayed a range of sensitivity as single agents, and zzso markedly zzso all zzso samples to zzso within six zzso zzso zzso induced the zzso protein zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso manner and this was required for the observed zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso by binding to a different site, had the same effect, confirming that interaction of these agents with zzso is the initial zzso Similarly, zzso and zzso induced zzso and enhanced zzso sensitivity to zzso Furthermore, zzso plus zzso overcame zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso was induced with clinically achievable zzso with no additional toxicity to normal zzso or zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso may improve the clinical efficacy of zzso in patients with zzso
