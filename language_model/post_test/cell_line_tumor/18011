To construct an expression zzso of zzso targeting human zzso gene and observe its zzso effect in zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso sequences targeting zzso gene were designed and zzso with two complementary zzso zzso The zzso strands were zzso and zzso into zzso zzso which was identified by sequencing following transformation and zzso The zzso expression zzso zzso was zzso into human zzso zzso zzso cells via zzso zzso and Western zzso were used to detect expression levels of zzso zzso and protein in the zzso zzso cells, zzso 

The zzso zzso fragments of the zzso targeting zzso gene were cloned into zzso zzso which was validated by sequence zzso zzso and Western zzso indicated that zzso zzso and protein expressions were significantly decreased in the zzso cells, especially in those zzso with the zzso targeting the sequence of zzso zzso which induced almost complete zzso of zzso protein zzso 

The zzso expression zzso zzso for zzso zzso gene expression in the zzso zzso cells has been successfully constructed, which may facilitate further study for decreasing the invasive and zzso zzso of zzso tumors by zzso gene zzso
