Cell specific gene zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso synthetic small interfering zzso zzso and zzso expressing zzso zzso were comparatively zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to form zzso zzso complexes with the above three zzso acids coding for zzso of green fluorescent protein zzso zzso The three zzso acid complexes formulated with either zzso or zzso had comparable sizes and surface zzso potential zzso Among the three zzso zzso zzso zzso when zzso with zzso exhibited the most zzso and fastest gene zzso effect for zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, because the zzso could be directly delivered, via zzso zzso zzso into the zzso compartment where the degradation processing of target zzso zzso occurred in a zzso zzso
