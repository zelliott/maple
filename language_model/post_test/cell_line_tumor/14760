A balance between zinc zzso by zzso zzso and zzso of zinc from the zzso into zzso zzso and out of the cell by zzso zzso zzso is crucial for zinc zzso It is not clear whether normal and zzso pancreatic cells respond differently to increased zzso zinc zzso Use of flow zzso methods revealed that treatment with as little as zzso zzso zinc induced significant zzso in two human zzso zzso cell zzso In contrast, normal human pancreatic zzso cells tolerated as high as zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines of mouse and rat origin also succumbed to high zzso of zzso Exposure to elevated zinc zzso enhanced the numbers of zzso but not primary zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso fluorescent zzso zzso indicating increased zinc influx in transformed zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso generation, decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso characterized zzso zzso cell zzso Only the zzso zzso but not zzso of zzso implicated in zzso or necrosis prevented zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso revealed that zinc treatment increased the zzso of proteins in cancer zzso zzso zinc treatment zzso the expression of zzso gene in a rat zzso cell line and in two human zzso zzso cell zzso These results indicate that the exposure of pancreatic cancer cells to elevated zzso zinc zzso can lead to zzso cell death characterized by increased protein zzso and zzso of the zinc zzso zzso gene zzso
