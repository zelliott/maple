Multiple myeloma zzso is characterized by almost exclusive zzso of zzso cells for the bone zzso zzso zzso The survival and proliferation of zzso plasma cells have been shown to rely on interactions with zzso zzso cells, in particular zzso zzso cells zzso in the zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso is composed of a diverse array of cell zzso This study examined the role of zzso an abundant component of zzso zzso as a potential niche component that supports zzso plasma zzso We investigated the proliferation of zzso zzso cell lines when cultured alone or together with zzso zzso or a combination of zzso and zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we observed increased proliferation of zzso cell lines in the presence of either zzso or zzso compared to cell zzso zzso Furthermore, the combined zzso of zzso plus zzso induced the greatest degree of proliferation of myeloma zzso In addition to increased zzso zzso and zzso decreased the rate of zzso of myeloma zzso Our in zzso studies provide evidence that highlights the role of zzso as a key component of the zzso zzso zzso the growth of zzso plasma cells in zzso
