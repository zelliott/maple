Human zzso reverse zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso is strongly associated with zzso activity implicated in cellular zzso and zzso In zzso detection of zzso will aid in determining the zzso of zzso positive zzso The aim of this study was to detect zzso protein expression in zzso oral zzso using zzso embedded tissue samples, and to study the relationship of zzso expression with different zzso stages in oral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) and zzso zzso zzso 10) oral zzso representing different zzso stages in oral zzso were included in the zzso zzso protein detection was done by zzso zzso zzso Nuclear zzso zzso were noted and the zzso index was zzso zzso and zzso oral zzso showed an increased percentage of zzso positive cells zzso zzso zzso 50% positive zzso zzso with intense zzso in the zzso zzso and superficial layers of the zzso unlike normal oral zzso which showed intense zzso only in the zzso and zzso cell zzso which are the normal zzso zzso zzso zzso protein expression was elevated with the corresponding advancement of the zzso stages of oral zzso from normal to zzso to zzso to zzso There seems to be an zzso of zzso protein expression during the progression of oral cancer, therefore, this may indicate the feasibility of zzso detection of zzso protein in oral zzso as a potential diagnostic or zzso zzso
