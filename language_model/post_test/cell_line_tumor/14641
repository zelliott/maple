zzso of zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso by protein zzso A zzso or zzso zzso 1 zzso has zzso been associated with tamoxifen zzso Here, we investigated the clinical application of this knowledge to predict tamoxifen resistance in zzso breast cancer zzso Using zzso a score including zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was developed on a training set consisting of 103 patients treated with tamoxifen for zzso disease, and validated on 231 patients zzso between zzso tamoxifen or no zzso In the training set, zzso levels were associated with tumor progression after tamoxifen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as was zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the validation set, a significant tamoxifen benefit was found among the zzso patients negative for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while others zzso were likely to have no benefit from tamoxifen zzso zzso zzso zzso The test for interaction showed a significant difference in recurrence-free survival between groups defined by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso appeared to influence tamoxifen zzso Both zzso and zzso levels were associated with sensitivity to tamoxifen in breast tumors and the combination of these variables should be considered in predicting tamoxifen zzso
