We evaluated the effect of fetal calf serum zzso zzso zzso acid, calcium zzso zzso acid, and insulin on the growth of zzso zzso in human colon tumor zzso zzso After being incubated for 48 zzso the proliferation of zzso was determined by real-time zzso chain reaction zzso zzso and the development of zzso zzso was observed by transmission electron zzso zzso Ten percent zzso was the best concentration for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, and insulin had a significant effect on the growth of zzso zzso when added into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had no significant effect and zzso acid had the inhibited zzso We also observed the stages of zzso zzso zzso type I zzso type II zzso and zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells by zzso Our results indicated that the best medium for zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso medium containing 50 zzso zzso 50 zzso zzso acid, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could provide a quick and precise technique to determine the proliferation of zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells will facilitate the study of interactions between zzso and host cells as well as provide a reliable system for evaluating zzso compound zzso
