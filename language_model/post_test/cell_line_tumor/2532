Recent profile studies of zzso zzso expression have documented a deregulation of zzso zzso in human zzso zzso However, its expression pattern and underlying mechanisms in the development and progression of zzso zzso has not been zzso zzso Here, we performed real-time zzso to examine the expression levels of zzso in colon cancer cell lines and tumor zzso And then, we investigated its biological functions in colon cancer cells by a gain of functional zzso Further more, by the zzso approaches of zzso and experimental zzso we confirmed target associations of zzso in zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso was frequently zzso in cancer cell lines and colon cancer zzso And we demonstrated that zzso restoration inhibited colon cancer cell proliferation and zzso a functionally zzso zzso was a direct target gene of zzso Finally, the data of real-time zzso showed the zzso relationship between zzso and zzso downstream genes in colon cancer zzso These findings indicate that zzso suppresses the growth of colon cancer cells by directly targeting zzso suggesting its application in prognosis prediction and cancer zzso
