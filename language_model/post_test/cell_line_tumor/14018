To transform zzso zzso immortalized human oral zzso cell zzso line cells by zzso zzso in zzso and to establish a zzso model of oral zzso cell zzso 

zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso for 6 zzso The cells were cloned at 18th passage, and then the culture medium was changed into zzso containing zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso were cultured in zzso for half and one year and the cell line was named zzso The zzso changes of the cells were observed with differential interference contrast microscope and HE zzso The soft zzso colony forming ability and zzso of the cells in nude mice were identified to confirm the zzso characteristics of zzso zzso 

zzso After zzso cells were treated with zzso for 6 months, zzso cells could grow well in zzso medium containing zzso zzso and physical concentration of zzso zzso When zzso cells were treated with chemical zzso the zzso of the cells was zzso zzso showed the character of polygon zzso cells with much zzso zzso zzso The zzso passage of zzso cells had soft zzso colony formation zzso zzso The 55th passage of zzso cells could develop zzso zzso The 69th passage of zzso cells could develop typical zzso zzso cell zzso The 74th and the 96th zzso cells developed zzso grade zzso cell zzso clinical zzso in nude zzso 

zzso may induce zzso cells to be oral zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso It will provide a multiple factors, zzso zzso model of zzso for the further zzso
