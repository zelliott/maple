zzso are ubiquitous integral zzso molecules associated on the cell surface with such zzso molecules as zzso Their expression has been shown to vary in tumors, but has seldom been described on lung zzso zzso cells, and the conditions required for a proper association of zzso and zzso have not yet been fully zzso 

We investigated the expression of 10 zzso and six zzso zzso on the zzso lung zzso cell line zzso zzso were examined both in quantitative flow zzso and as zzso under normal or zzso conditions, in order to determine the zzso dependency of their zzso 

Five zzso and four zzso zzso are expressed on the membrane of zzso zzso Both quantitative and qualitative surface and zzso modifications of this pattern were induced in zzso conditions, suggesting the importance of zzso zzso for the expression of these zzso 

These data indicate that a specific pattern of zzso and zzso relying strongly on the availability of zzso zzso in the zzso is expressed by zzso zzso zzso
