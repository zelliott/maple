To construct a zzso zzso zzso plasmids for zzso interference zzso of zzso gene and select the optimal target sequence of zzso gene for zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were designed and zzso according to the sequence of zzso zzso and zzso into zzso zzso zzso followed by transformation into competent zzso zzso After zzso and sequence analysis for zzso of the positive zzso the zzso zzso zzso was extracted and zzso into zzso zzso cells to obtain the viral zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso cells were infected with zzso zzso and at the infection rate over zzso the cells were harvested to extract the zzso Real zzso was performed to determine the expression level of zzso zzso in the infected zzso 

The zzso zzso was successfully constructed as confirmed by sequence zzso High zzso of the virus was zzso and after infection of zzso cells, zzso targeting the zzso and zzso sequences in zzso gene resulted in suppression of zzso zzso expression by zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso of zzso gene has been successfully constructed, which provides the basis for further study of the role of zzso gene in tumor zzso
