The tumor zzso gene zzso located on zzso has dual zzso activity in the zzso signaling zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso which is involved in zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso is frequently zzso in a variety of tumors including prostate zzso In this study, we generated a new type of gene transfer drug, zzso which is a zzso of zzso gelatin zzso incorporating zzso zzso zzso Using our previously reported zzso zzso human prostate cancer cells zzso zzso we examined the efficacy of zzso to force the expression of zzso in zzso to inhibit tumor growth after zzso injection alone or with zzso zzso therapy with zzso and zzso improved both the in zzso and in zzso efficacy of growth zzso compared with zzso or zzso zzso These data show that zzso gene therapy, enabling zzso can potentially treat prostate zzso that have zzso gene zzso associated with zzso
