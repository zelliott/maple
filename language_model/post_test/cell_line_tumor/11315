The zzso zzso factor zzso factor 2 zzso zzso by zzso has been implicated as zzso of zzso cancer cell line resistance to zzso zzso However, the activity status of the zzso zzso in human zzso cancer remains zzso 

The aims of this study were assessment of the activity status of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and investigation of its zzso in zzso zzso responses and viability of cancer zzso 

We conducted retrospective zzso analyses of zzso zzso adjacent normal zzso and benign zzso zzso of viability and gene expression in the zzso cell lines zzso and zzso after zzso manipulation of zzso and DNA sequencing at an academic medical zzso 

The study included 42 zzso and 42 benign zzso (24 zzso and 18 zzso zzso 

We assessed the abundance of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell line viability and zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso and the sequence of zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso and its target zzso were zzso in normal zzso their levels were significantly higher in zzso than in benign zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso was zzso abundant in zzso and its levels did not correlate with zzso zzso zzso zzso arguing against decreased levels as the mechanism for zzso zzso The oxidized zzso zzso was more abundant in zzso than normal tissue zzso zzso zzso indicating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso responses in both the zzso cell lines zzso and zzso and in the zzso cell line zzso but it zzso a viability advantage specifically in the zzso cell zzso 

The high activity of zzso in zzso warrants further exploration of this zzso potential zzso zzso and/or therapeutic utility in zzso
