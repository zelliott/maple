We previously reported that zzso zzso causes zzso of zzso proteins in the zzso subsequently leading to massive cell death in zzso zzso To further investigate how zzso zzso is associated with zzso cell death, we established zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso with zzso expressed zzso proteins in the zzso especially at the zzso zzso which supports our previous results about a functional connection between zzso and zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso production from zzso proteins was significantly increased when zzso was zzso Moreover, zzso expression of zzso activated zzso signal pathways via zzso of zzso zzso zzso In addition, suppression of zzso zzso zzso under a certain condition was removed by zzso expression of zzso indicating a functional role of zzso in the maintenance of zzso zzso Indeed, zzso cell death was highly elevated by zzso zzso zzso and it was further accelerated by DNA damage via zzso zzso These all results suggest that zzso zzso could play an important role in zzso cell death by modulating zzso upon DNA zzso
