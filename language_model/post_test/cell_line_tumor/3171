zzso of the fatty acid zzso zzso gene has been implicated in prostate zzso We sought to directly assess the zzso potential of zzso 

We used immortalized human prostate zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and human prostate zzso zzso cells that zzso zzso zzso for cell proliferation zzso soft zzso zzso and tests of tumor formation in zzso zzso zzso mice expressing zzso in the prostate were generated to assess the effects of zzso on prostate zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso and by zzso cell sorting in zzso cells treated with zzso of the intrinsic and zzso pathways of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso or with a small interfering zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso expression was compared with the zzso index assessed by the terminal zzso zzso zzso method in zzso human prostate cancer samples by using the least squares means zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells increased cell proliferation and soft zzso zzso zzso that expressed both zzso and zzso zzso zzso formed invasive zzso in zzso mice (12 of 14 mice injected formed tumors vs 0 of 14 mice injected with zzso expressing empty zzso zzso zzso zzso Fisher exact zzso however, zzso that expressed only zzso did zzso zzso expression of zzso in mice resulted in prostate zzso zzso the zzso of which increased from zzso in 8- to zzso mice to zzso in mice aged 7 months or more zzso zzso zzso Fisher exact zzso but not in invasive zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso of zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso protected zzso from zzso induced by zzso but did not protect zzso from zzso zzso zzso In human prostate cancer zzso zzso expression was zzso associated with the zzso rate zzso percentage of zzso cells, lowest vs highest zzso of zzso expression: zzso vs zzso difference zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These observations suggest that zzso can act as a prostate cancer zzso in the presence of zzso and that zzso exerts its zzso effect by zzso the intrinsic zzso of zzso
