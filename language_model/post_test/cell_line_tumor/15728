zzso of zzso proteins is caused by the impairment of protein quality control systems, such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In this study, the formation of inclusion bodies was examined after the blockade of zzso and/or zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a single and large inclusion body localized in zzso zzso Interestingly, however, zzso zzso generated dispersed small inclusion bodies in the zzso zzso sclerosis complex 2 was selectively accumulated in the inclusion bodies of zzso cells, but not those of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and translation entirely inhibited the formation of inclusion body induced by zzso zzso but partially by zzso zzso Moreover, the simultaneous zzso of two protein zzso pathways independently developed two distinct inclusion bodies within a single zzso These findings clearly demonstrated that dysfunction of each zzso zzso induced formation and zzso of unique inclusion bodies on the basis of zzso zzso and formation process in zzso zzso
