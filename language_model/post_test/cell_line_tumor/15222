Recently, attempts have been made to use zzso as novel candidates for live vaccine zzso against solid zzso In this study, we examined the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso infection on solid tumor growth and zzso After oral infection with zzso zzso larvae, zzso cells were injected zzso and zzso into zzso mice to evaluate tumor growth and zzso potential, zzso zzso growth and lung zzso in zzso zzso infected mice were significantly reduced compared with control zzso To zzso the mechanism of tumor reduction by zzso infection, we conducted zzso zzso using mouse zzso zzso and zzso were increased in the infection group and decreased in the zzso zzso However, the expression level was not changed in the zzso group compared to the infection or zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso were increased in the infection group, there was no significant change in expression in the zzso group or the zzso zzso Additionally, zzso and zzso were increased in the zzso group compared to the zzso group, but there was no difference in expression between the zzso group and the zzso zzso zzso was significantly increased in the zzso group zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso infection reduced tumor growth and zzso through a complex transition in zzso regulation profiles including zzso zzso and zzso
