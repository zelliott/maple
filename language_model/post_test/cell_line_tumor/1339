Sex determining region Y zzso high mobility zzso 9 zzso is an important zzso factor required for development, which regulates the expression of target genes in the associated zzso The aim of this study was to describe the expression of zzso in human zzso cell lung cancer zzso and to investigate the association between zzso expression and progression of zzso 

zzso protein and zzso expression in normal human zzso lung cancer cell lines, and eight pairs of matched lung cancer zzso and their adjacent normal lung zzso were detected by Western zzso and real-time reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso was used to determine zzso protein expression in 142 cases of zzso characterized zzso zzso analyses were applied to test for zzso and diagnostic zzso 

zzso in lung cancer cell lines was zzso at both zzso and protein levels, and zzso zzso and protein were also elevated in zzso zzso compared with levels in corresponding adjacent zzso lung zzso zzso analysis demonstrated a high expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso archival lung cancer zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso of zzso was significantly correlated with the zzso stage of zzso zzso and that patients with a high zzso level exhibited a shorter survival time ( zzso zzso analysis illustrated that zzso zzso might be an independent zzso indicator for the survival of patients with zzso 

This work shows that zzso may serve as a novel and zzso marker for zzso and play a role during the development and progression of the zzso
