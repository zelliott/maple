zzso zzso by infusion of designer T cells zzso engineered with zzso zzso receptors zzso for zzso activity represents a potentially highly specific zzso for the treatment of zzso In this study, 2nd generation zzso zzso specific membrane zzso zzso zzso were developed for improving the efficacy of previously developed 1st zzso zzso for prostate cancer zzso The 1st zzso zzso are modified with zzso zzso cell zzso zzso while the 2nd zzso zzso are engineered with an zzso cell zzso zzso which incorporates a zzso zzso signal for optimal T cell zzso 

A 2nd zzso zzso zzso zzso was constructed by inserting the zzso signal domain into the 1st zzso zzso 1st and 2nd zzso zzso zzso were created by zzso human T cells with zzso zzso and their zzso efficacy was compared for specific zzso on zzso tumor zzso zzso against zzso tumor cells in zzso and suppression of tumor growth in an animal zzso 

The 2nd zzso zzso can be zzso activated to zzso larger amounts of zzso such as zzso and zzso than 1st zzso and to zzso more vigorously on zzso tumor zzso More importantly, the 2nd zzso zzso preserve the zzso zzso in zzso and suppress tumor growth in animal models with significant higher zzso 

Our results demonstrate that 2nd zzso zzso designer T cells exhibit superior zzso functions versus 1st zzso providing a rationale for advancing this improved agent toward clinical application in prostate cancer zzso
