For zzso integrity to be zzso the cell cycle and DNA damage responses must be zzso zzso a zzso zzso factor, is targeted for zzso by the zzso zzso zzso following DNA zzso Using a laser zzso microscope to generate zzso restricted DNA damage within the living cell nucleus, we show that zzso is recruited onto damaged sites in zzso phase cells, within seconds of DNA damage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso also accumulate rapidly to damaged zzso zzso recruitment is zzso whereas zzso and zzso recruitment are independent of zzso Fitting of zzso recovery after zzso profiles to an zzso zzso model shows that zzso and zzso exhibit highly dynamic binding at the site of damage, whereas zzso appears zzso zzso exhibits both a rapidly exchanging and an apparently immobile zzso Our data suggest that zzso provides an immobile binding interface for dynamic zzso interactions at the site of damage, which leads to rapid zzso recruitment to damaged DNA, preceding zzso zzso
