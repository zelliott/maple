zzso has been identified recently as a new type of protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso are zzso at specific zzso zzso that have been known previously to be zzso However, other proteins subject to this modification remain to be identified, and the zzso zzso involved need to be zzso In this work, we report the discovery of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso was detected in the leukemia cell line zzso by mass zzso and Western analysis using a specific zzso In this cell line, the zzso form of zzso accounted for zzso a level at least zzso higher than in other leukemia cell lines zzso and zzso or zzso cell lines zzso and zzso The zzso level in zzso cells decreased remarkably during zzso zzso indicating that this modification is zzso zzso Moreover, in zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso can catalyze zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso can remove this modification in the presence of zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso might be generated by the same set of zzso as for zzso zzso and that selection of donor molecules zzso versus zzso may determine the difference of zzso Because like zzso zzso is an important intermediate in zzso and energy production, zzso zzso zzso zzso may provide a novel zzso regulatory mark for cell zzso
