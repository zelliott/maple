zzso structure and properties of two new zzso complexes of zzso are zzso The new complexes form during the reaction of zzso zzso with zzso zzso dissolved in an zzso zzso The formed products depend on the alcohol used and were found to be: zzso zzso from a zzso solution and zzso zzso from an zzso solution, in which the original zzso zzso had been converted by zzso zzso to an entirely new zzso This paper presents the X-ray structure and detailed zzso analysis of both new compounds, as well as the study of their zzso zzso The coordination of zzso is zzso with zzso zzso having trans zzso and common zzso zzso Both 1 and 2 are highly zzso towards the zzso resistant zzso and zzso cell lines, and both complexes are as active as zzso in the sensitive cell zzso They display the ability to overcome zzso resistance in the drug resistant zzso zzso and zzso The present evidence suggests that the mechanism of biological activity may be different for these zzso compounds compared to zzso
