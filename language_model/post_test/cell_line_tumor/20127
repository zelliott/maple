zzso a zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso and zzso and is approved, in combination with zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso breast zzso In order to establish a possible gene expression response to zzso a panel of breast cancer cell lines with varying sensitivity to zzso were zzso using a combination of zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso analysis zzso a data integration technique, was used to identify zzso factors associated with the zzso response on a previously published zzso of 96 zzso zzso was extracted from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso breast cancer cell lines displaying a range of zzso sensitivities and zzso expression treated with zzso of zzso for 12 hours and zzso using zzso zzso A fold zzso zzso 2 was considered zzso 

A list of zzso zzso genes and 8 zzso factors zzso whose potential regulatory impact was zzso in zzso were identified as associated with zzso zzso From this group, a panel of 27 genes (including the 8 zzso were selected for zzso zzso 5 genes were determined to be significantly zzso expressed following the zzso treatment of zzso zzso across all six cell zzso Furthermore, the expression of 4 of these genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso was directly correlated with the degree of sensitivity of the cell line to zzso and their expression was observed to zzso from zzso to zzso when the cell lines were arranged in a zzso to insensitive zzso These included the novel zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso Additionally, zzso D1 zzso a common regulator of the other four zzso was also demonstrated to observe a zzso response to zzso zzso 

A panel of 5 genes were determined to be zzso expressed in response to zzso at the 12 hour time point zzso The expression of these 5 genes correlated directly with zzso zzso We propose that the gene expression profile may represent both an early measure of the likelihood of sensitivity and the level of response to zzso and may therefore have application in early response zzso
