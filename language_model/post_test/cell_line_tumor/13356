A new type of fluorescent zzso for zzso zzso and zzso containing 6- or zzso zzso as zzso and zzso zzso as zzso recognition unit were zzso As zzso these zzso probe molecules can release the corresponding fluorescent zzso zzso and zzso through aromatic zzso substitution zzso by zzso zzso from zzso The sensing reaction is highly sensitive zzso limit of zzso for zzso and highly selective to zzso over zzso zzso and other zzso under neutral conditions zzso The zzso respond rapidly to zzso with zzso rate zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso Furthermore, the selective detection of zzso in living cells by zzso was demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso In addition, these zzso zzso show excellent chemical and zzso zzso In conclusion, this type of zzso may find use in the detection of zzso in environmental samples and zzso
