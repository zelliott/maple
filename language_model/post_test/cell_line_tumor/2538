A zzso map zzso is a virtual screening method used for correlation of molecular structure and potential biological activity on a certain target and offers a way to represent zzso data of large databases in a two-dimensional zzso Large databases, for example the zzso database, provide information about biological activity and chemical structure of small molecules and are widely used in drug development for identification of new lead zzso The zzso X zzso zzso is a zzso activated zzso factor involved in key regulation mechanisms within zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso became an established target in drug development for diseases associated with zzso zzso or zzso disorders during the last decade, none of the developed compounds have reached later zzso of clinical development so zzso We used a zzso trained with known zzso zzso to screen the zzso database for potential zzso for zzso In this article, we report the successful identification of six approved drugs out of the zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by using a zzso for screening of the zzso zzso We show zzso zzso by selected compounds in a full length zzso zzso zzso and zzso of a zzso target gene by zzso
