zzso zzso virus zzso therapy has shown promise in zzso models and in clinical zzso However, complete responses have rarely been zzso This lack of efficacy is most likely due to zzso virus spread through the tumor resulting in limited tumor cell zzso We reasoned that zzso T cells to the tumor has the potential to improve the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso therefore, constructed a zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso consisting of two zzso chain variable fragments specific for zzso and the tumor cell surface zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso ability to replicate and induce zzso was similar to that of unmodified zzso However, only tumor cells infected with zzso induced zzso zzso as judged by the zzso of zzso and zzso In zzso zzso zzso not only killed infected tumor cells, but in the presence of T cells, it also induced bystander killing of zzso tumor zzso In zzso zzso plus T cells had potent zzso activity in comparison with control zzso plus T cells in a lung cancer zzso zzso Thus, arming zzso zzso with zzso zzso may represent a promising approach to improve zzso virus zzso
