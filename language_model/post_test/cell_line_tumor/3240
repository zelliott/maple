zzso acid zzso were designed and zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso based on the structure and zzso zzso activity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso containing an zzso zzso in the side chain that makes it an irreversible inhibitor of zzso We replaced the zzso zzso of zzso with zzso acid to design potent and zzso zzso of zzso In addition, a number of zzso acids zzso are introduced instead of the simple zzso acid zzso for a variety of the series of zzso zzso The compounds zzso were tested for zzso zzso activity and the results showed that many of them are potent zzso of zzso The replacement of zzso zzso of zzso with an aromatic zzso acid enhances the in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso We have carried out circular zzso and molecular modeling studies on zzso acid analogue and compared it with the solution structure of zzso
