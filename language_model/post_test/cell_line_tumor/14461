zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso to prepare stable and zzso zzso zzso for in zzso zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso by a solid zzso method and zzso to have high zzso intensity for in zzso imaging zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso were characterized by various zzso techniques such as zzso zzso dynamic light scattering zzso zzso zzso and transmission electron zzso zzso Finally, we evaluated toxicity and body distribution of zzso loaded in zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso From the results, the zzso loaded in zzso zzso were zzso and showed a diameter range of zzso zzso in zzso The zzso zzso increased their stability against zzso and zzso which have the high potential for applications in biomedical zzso We have also attained zzso in zzso imaging with light zzso representing an intriguing avenue for obtaining biological information by the use of zzso zzso
