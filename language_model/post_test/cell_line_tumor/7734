In a wide range of human zzso increased levels of heat shock protein 27 zzso are closely associated with zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso and thus poor zzso In this study, we evaluate the zzso effects of zzso gene zzso using zzso a second-generation zzso zzso zzso on the zzso head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso the zzso of zzso significantly enhanced zzso zzso and zzso death, and promoted zzso zzso In zzso combining zzso with local tumor zzso (5 zzso 2 zzso led to a significant zzso of zzso tumors related to a high rate of zzso and decreased levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso the total radiation dose (15 zzso 2 zzso significantly amplified the zzso effect of zzso Treatment of tumors with zzso plus radiation resulted in a decrease in zzso associated with a reduced zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, the combined treatment enhanced the survival of zzso mice and showed no signs of acute and delayed zzso Our findings demonstrate for the first time that zzso zzso enhances the zzso effects of zzso in zzso and provide zzso proof of principle for clinical trials using zzso zzso technology in the treatment of patients with zzso zzso zzso
