Natural killer zzso cells are characterized by an efficient zzso activity, and this activity has been exploited as the basis of cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso required for induction of the durable zzso immune response and is an important zzso of zzso zzso In this study, to augment the efficiency of zzso cell zzso to tumor cells, human zzso zzso natural killer cell line zzso zzso cells, which could zzso zzso zzso were zzso We investigated the natural zzso of zzso cells against human zzso cells zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso cells displayed a significantly stronger zzso activity against both human zzso cell lines and primary human zzso cancer cells compared with parental zzso zzso The increased zzso activity of zzso cells was associated with the zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso B and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso by zzso cells, such as tumor necrosis zzso and zzso induced increased expression of zzso on the target zzso cells, and resulted in increased zzso of the zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso cells could significantly inhibit zzso tumor growth in a zzso model and prolonged the survival of zzso nude zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso cells could be suitable for the future development of zzso zzso strategies for zzso zzso
