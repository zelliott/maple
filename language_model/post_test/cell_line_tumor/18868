zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso family contribute to the regulation of zzso zzso zzso Recently, we found that zzso zzso 2 zzso was significantly expressed in human zzso zzso zzso and in zzso human zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we further explored the pharmacological function of zzso in four human zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso following the treatment of zzso acid zzso an zzso specific zzso After administrations with zzso zzso of zzso cell proliferation was greatly inhibited in a zzso manner from zzso to zzso in higher zzso zzso cells, but not in other cell zzso The results of zzso zzso zzso DNA fragmentation and flow zzso analysis further revealed that cell zzso induced by zzso was also observed in zzso zzso zzso these findings suggested that zzso may be involved, in part, in the proliferation and survival of zzso cells and could be a new potential therapeutic target against specific human zzso
