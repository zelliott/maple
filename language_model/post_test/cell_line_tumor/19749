zzso zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso coli are zzso zzso zzso bacterial pathogens that zzso their zzso zzso zzso causing severe zzso zzso These bacteria zzso a type III zzso apparatus to deliver zzso molecules into host cells, zzso cellular zzso zzso associated protein zzso is a zzso zzso protein that targets host cell zzso and contributes to zzso zzso barrier dysfunction in zzso Unfortunately, the relevance of these actions to the zzso of zzso disease is zzso Using zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso with host cell zzso and that in zzso infection led to a disruption of zzso zzso in infected zzso as assessed by electron zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso also revealed a significant loss of zzso respiratory function in the infected zzso zzso however, both zzso were attenuated in mice infected with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also implicated in the disruption of zzso barrier function both in zzso and in zzso These studies thus advance our understanding of how zzso pathogens zzso host cell functions and cause disease, demonstrating that zzso contributes to the functional disruption of the zzso zzso during enteric infection by zzso zzso
