zzso zzso zzso zzso is used in Chinese medicine and has been zzso as highly toxic in the Chinese zzso In Europe, zzso patches have been used since ages to treat various zzso zzso We investigated the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in 41 tumor cell lines zzso zzso and compared the results with those of 60 cell lines of the National Cancer Institute, zzso We found profound activity at low zzso zzso zzso zzso values between zzso and zzso zzso zzso bound to protein zzso 2A zzso with higher affinity zzso zzso than to zzso zzso zzso in molecular zzso zzso Using a zzso array for 84 zzso zzso zzso treatment zzso gene expression of zzso and nerve growth factor zzso but zzso zzso expression of zzso like protein 10, zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso By using zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso expressions, 21 genes were found to significantly correlate with response of 60 tumor cell lines to zzso As shown by zzso cluster analysis and zzso test, the distribution of cell lines in the zzso according to their gene expression profiles predicted sensitivity or resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso The compassionate use of zzso patches in two patients suffering from zzso and zzso zzso respectively, considerably improved the diseases without signs of zzso In conclusion, these results indicate that zzso may be a useful candidate to develop novel strategies for cancer zzso
