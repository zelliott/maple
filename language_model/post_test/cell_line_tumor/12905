Cancer stem cells zzso are a small subset of cancer cells capable of zzso and tumor zzso zzso cancer stem cells, the root of tumor origin and zzso has emerged as one promising approach to improve lung cancer zzso Cancer stem cells are reported to reside in the side population zzso of cultured lung cancer zzso We report here the coexistence of a distinct population of zzso zzso cells that have equivalent zzso capacity compared to SP cells in a lung tumor sphere zzso Compared with the corresponding cells in zzso cultures, lung tumor zzso formed from human zzso cell lung zzso cell lines zzso or zzso showed marked zzso differences and increased expression of the stem cell markers zzso and zzso Lung tumor spheres also exhibited increased zzso potential as only 10,000 lung tumor sphere cells were required to produce zzso tumors in nude mice, whereas the same number of zzso cells failed to induce zzso We also demonstrate that lung tumor spheres showed decreased zzso zzso activity compared to zzso By using the zzso zzso sequence that directs degradation of zzso zzso reporter zzso in zzso cell lines, only less than zzso zzso cultures were zzso positive indicating low zzso zzso whereas lung tumor sphere showed increased numbers of zzso cells, suggesting the enrichment of zzso in sphere zzso
