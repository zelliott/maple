The purpose of this study was to zzso the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso as a tumor zzso in prostate cancer zzso In the present study, zzso zzso analysis suggested that the expression of zzso was significantly decreased in advanced zzso compared with early zzso zzso zzso analysis also indicated that zzso expression was significantly decreased in zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso Moreover, the expression of zzso has been demonstrated to be associated with the zzso stage and zzso zzso zzso zzso level of zzso zzso analyses showed that both the zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso in zzso cell lines could inhibit cell growth, colony formation, migration, invasion and the cell cycle as well as induce cell zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso reduced zzso in zzso Through a zzso activity zzso and Western zzso zzso was identified as a target of zzso in zzso The zzso of zzso suppressed zzso and its downstream signaling zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso and attenuated cell zzso invasion and tumor zzso
