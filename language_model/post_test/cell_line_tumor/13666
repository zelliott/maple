Inspired by the composition of the native zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were assembled from zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso To investigate whether zzso zzso zzso an effect on the cell biological functions of zzso the secondary structure was analyzed by in zzso zzso and circular zzso zzso zzso composed of zzso and zzso reveal a predominantly random coiled zzso and impede zzso zzso On the contrary, zzso chains in zzso of zzso and zzso acid zzso primarily adopt an zzso zzso sheet structure and reveal an increased area of spread, which consequently supports the proliferation of zzso When zzso is replaced by PGA in mixed zzso we observe a structural zzso from random coils to zzso sheets with a zzso improved cell zzso We conclude that zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso affects zzso response by altering the zzso of the zzso
