zzso target of zzso zzso signaling is a central regulator of protein translation, cell growth, and zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso are common in cancer, making zzso a promising therapeutic zzso In clinical trials, zzso zzso have shown modest response rates for most cancer types, including breast zzso zzso there is an urgent need to better understand the mechanism of action of zzso to improve patient selection and to monitor zzso zzso To identify novel zzso markers of zzso activity, we carried out zzso profiling of total and zzso zzso in three breast cancer cell lines representing different zzso In all three cell lines, we found that zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso for zzso zzso 1 zzso the zzso zzso in zzso fatty acid zzso zzso of zzso increased zzso protein zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso decreased zzso protein zzso zzso decreased total zzso zzso expression without inducing a significant decline in its relative zzso recruitment zzso zzso zzso did not alter zzso zzso zzso Instead, zzso inhibited zzso promoter activity and decreased expression of mature zzso factor zzso regulatory element binding protein 1 zzso zzso initiation factor zzso zzso small interfering zzso zzso decreased both zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may be regulated through the zzso protein 1 zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso inhibited breast cancer cell growth, whereas zzso increased zzso Taken together these findings show that zzso decreases zzso zzso establishing an important link between cell signaling and cancer cell fatty acid synthesis and zzso
