By exposing cells of the zzso zzso cell line to zzso IX zzso in culture, we found that the 18 zzso zzso zzso protein zzso prevents zzso zzso of zzso In particular, zzso zzso by stable zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso cells leads to zzso zzso zzso In combination with light exposure, the zzso zzso led to cell death of the zzso zzso zzso In the sham control cells zzso zzso of scrambled zzso zzso zzso expression remained high and no zzso zzso was zzso The prevention of zzso zzso by zzso was not due to conversion of zzso to zzso in the sham control zzso Similar to zzso zzso the zzso oxygen species zzso scavenger zzso zzso also enhanced zzso zzso This suggests that that zzso generation as modulated by zzso zzso may present a mechanism to prevent zzso of zzso
