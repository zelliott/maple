Human zzso zzso zzso molecules are zzso zzso class I zzso with an important role in pregnancy immune regulation and inflammation zzso zzso zzso proteins can be generated through two zzso alternative zzso and zzso release, which is known to be zzso zzso Among this class of zzso zzso zzso zzso might be involved in the zzso membrane zzso Of particular interest are zzso and zzso which regulate the inflammatory process by zzso and zzso zzso We evaluated the effect of zzso and zzso on zzso membrane zzso In particular, we analyzed the in zzso effect of these two zzso on the zzso of zzso via zzso zzso in zzso cell line, in zzso cell line, and in peripheral blood zzso zzso The results obtained by both cell lines showed the role of zzso in zzso zzso On the contrary, zzso was not involved in this zzso In addition, we identified three possible highly specific zzso sites for zzso whereas none were detected for zzso This study suggests an effective link between zzso and zzso zzso increasing our knowledge on the regulatory machinery beyond zzso regulation in zzso and pathological zzso
