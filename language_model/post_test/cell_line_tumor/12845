zzso zzso zzso consist of carbon atoms arranged in sheets of zzso rolled up into zzso zzso This class of zzso has attracted attention because of their extraordinary properties, such as high electrical and zzso zzso In addition, development in zzso zzso chemistry has led to an enhanced zzso in zzso zzso media which indeed zzso the spectrum for their potential biological applications including gene zzso The aim of this study is to determine the capability of different zzso zzso zzso carbon zzso zzso zzso to efficiently complex and transfer zzso DNA zzso in zzso without promoting zzso zzso zzso is chemically zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or a mixture of the two zzso In order to explore the potential of these zzso as gene delivery systems, we first study their capacity to complex zzso DNA zzso using zzso gel zzso zzso migration studies confirm zzso binding to zzso with different zzso highest for zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression is assessed in human lung zzso zzso cells, and the zzso is determined by modified zzso zzso after 24 h incubation zzso Additionally, zzso and/or zzso reveal an improvement in gene expression when compared to the naked zzso or to the equivalent amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was delivered by the zzso zzso via a different zzso compared to those used by zzso In conclusion, zzso may be considered in the future as a versatile tool for efficient gene transfer in cancer cells in zzso provided their zzso profile is zzso
