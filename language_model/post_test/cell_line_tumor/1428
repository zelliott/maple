During the last 11 years, 5 molecular zzso of breast zzso zzso A, zzso B, zzso zzso and normal zzso have been characterized and zzso zzso As zzso research zzso further zzso of breast zzso into new zzso zzso are expected to zzso For example, a new and rare breast cancer zzso known as zzso has been recently found in human zzso and in breast cancer cell zzso There is no doubt that global gene expression analyses using zzso zzso have drastically improved our understanding of breast cancer as a zzso zzso The main question is, however, whether new molecular techniques such as gene expression profiling (or zzso should be regarded as the gold standard for identifying breast cancer zzso A critical review of the literature clearly shows major problems with current molecular techniques and zzso including poor zzso lack of zzso and lack of quality zzso zzso the current molecular approaches cannot be incorporated into routine clinical practice and treatment decision making as they are immature or even can be zzso This review particularly focuses on the zzso breast cancer zzso that represents one of the most popular breast cancer zzso It critically shows major problems and zzso with and about this zzso and challenges the common claim that it represents a zzso zzso It concludes that the term zzso is misleading and states that there is no evidence that expression of zzso zzso in a given breast cancer, regardless of other established zzso factors, does have any impact on clinical zzso
