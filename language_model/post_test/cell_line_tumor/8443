zzso zzso in the cellular zzso status play a critical role in the development of zzso zzso in cancer zzso Human zzso zzso zzso an zzso involved in the conversion of zzso into zzso in zzso zzso was recently identified as an important zzso against zzso stress and zzso However, the role of zzso on zzso drug resistance has not been previously zzso Using human zzso cell lines, we evaluated the potential role of zzso in zzso drug zzso We found that zzso caused a significant increase in zzso expression in zzso cells that was accompanied by zzso We also observed that zzso targeting of zzso genes attenuated the zzso zzso Furthermore, knocking down zzso induced a marked increase in the levels of zzso zzso oxygen species under hypoxic conditions, and the zzso effect of zzso depletion was reversed by zzso with the zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso significantly contributes to the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso cells by adjusting their cellular zzso zzso
