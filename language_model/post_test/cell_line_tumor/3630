The activity against human cancer cell lines including zzso zzso zzso cell up take, zzso and nature of interaction with zzso zzso DNA have been studied for four zzso complexes code named zzso zzso zzso and zzso having the general formula: zzso where zzso 5, 6 and 7 for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The compounds are found to exhibit significant zzso activity against zzso cancer cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in which the linking zzso has six carbon atoms is found to be the most active zzso As the number of carbon atoms in the linking zzso is decreased below six and increased above six, the activity is found to decrease, illustrating zzso zzso All the zzso compounds are believed to form a plethora of long-range zzso zzso zzso with DNA dictated by the sequence of bases in the DNA zzso zzso prevention of zzso zzso with the increase in concentration of the compounds is due to global changes in DNA zzso brought about by zzso long-range binding of the compounds with zzso
