To study the chemical constituents of zzso zzso and evaluate their zzso 

The compounds were isolated and zzso by various kinds of column zzso methods and their structures were determined by zzso data zzso zzso zzso against serum deprivation induced zzso cell zzso was evaluated by zzso method while zzso zzso activity was zzso in both zzso and specific zzso zzso screening zzso 

zzso compounds were obtained from an zzso portion of an zzso extract of the root of zzso zzso Their structures were zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 20 showed zzso activities against serum deprivation induced zzso cell zzso at a concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with relative protection rates of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 16 could increase zzso zzso response in both zzso and specific zzso zzso screening models at the concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso 1 was a new compound and all compounds were isolated from this zzso for the first zzso zzso zzso and 20 showed zzso activities while 16 exhibited zzso zzso zzso
