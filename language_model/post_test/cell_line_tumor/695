Head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso is the sixth most frequent cancer worldwide, zzso approximately 50% of all zzso in some developing zzso Our recent work identified protein zzso zzso zzso as a critical and zzso player in establishing an aggressive zzso in zzso In this study, we investigated the specificity and efficacy of zzso a novel zzso cancer cell zzso zzso zzso zzso as a treatment for zzso zzso zzso was designed by merging two separate technologies and zzso as a capped zzso with two functional zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso connected by a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso and zzso cells, two zzso cell lines, in comparison with oral zzso zzso zzso positive for zzso and zzso positive for zzso compared with zzso positive for oral zzso zzso In addition, zzso penetrated zzso cells in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso with these in zzso zzso systemic injection of zzso resulted in selective delivery of zzso into zzso zzso in nude zzso zzso blocked the zzso of active zzso in zzso cells, confirming zzso as a zzso zzso zzso inhibited cell invasion by 72 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso by 56 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5) in zzso zzso Moreover, in zzso zzso imaging showed that zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso the growth of zzso zzso in nude zzso Our work indicates that the zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a promising novel therapeutic strategy for zzso
