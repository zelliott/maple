We first report the application of zzso as a scaffold to develop potential drugs for breast zzso Seven novel zzso compounds were zzso by using a zzso synthesis zzso Those compounds exhibited different zzso against human breast cancer zzso cells, with the best activity of zzso for compound zzso A zzso Mechanics zzso zzso zzso zzso study was carried out to investigate the binding interactions between these compounds and zzso zzso alpha zzso The simulation results showed that the trend of zzso binding interactions was same as that of their zzso zzso A detailed analysis indicated that compound 1 possesses the highest Van der zzso and hydrogen bond interactions compared to the other six compounds and better zzso are achievable by enhancing the hydrogen bond zzso Based on these results, we addressed that zzso is an attractive scaffold for designing drugs against breast zzso
