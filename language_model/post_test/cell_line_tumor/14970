The cancer stem cell marker, zzso is an important indicator of zzso signaling zzso and a functional component of zzso zzso zzso A zzso screening zzso was developed to identify zzso of zzso growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines were assessed for differential sensitivity to a zzso zzso zzso Libraries zzso zzso pure compounds and zzso crude or partially zzso natural product extracts were tested, and 12 pure compounds and 67 natural product extracts were identified for further zzso Three active compounds and the positive control were further characterized in terms of effects on zzso zzso Treatment of zzso zzso cells resulted in loss of zzso expression as assessed by flow zzso This reduction was incomplete (most cells continued to express zzso but resulted in generation of cell populations expressing lower levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso ) reduced median zzso expression to zzso of control after zzso and zzso of control after zzso Reduction in zzso expression preceded growth zzso suggesting that a threshold of zzso expression may be required for growth of zzso zzso The identification of compounds with a variety of possible molecular targets suggests a likelihood of multiple mechanisms for zzso of zzso cell zzso
