zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso can shift tumor cell metabolism from zzso zzso to zzso zzso with zzso of zzso activity and zzso zzso In zzso zzso could thus potentially enhance the frequently moderate zzso response of cancer cells that results from their zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate zzso zzso by zzso in zzso and in a human tumor zzso mouse model in zzso 

The interaction of zzso with zzso beam radiation was investigated in the human tumor cell lines zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as in the human normal tissue cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso induction in zzso was assessed by zzso zzso and zzso flow zzso cell survival was zzso by zzso zzso The effect of zzso in zzso was investigated in zzso zzso tumors growing zzso on zzso mice, with and without zzso zzso zzso examination included zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso respectively, as well as zzso labeling for zzso 

zzso treatment led to decreased zzso survival and increased specific zzso rates in tumor cell lines zzso zzso but not in normal tissue cells zzso zzso zzso However, this significant zzso zzso by zzso in zzso was not reflected by the situation in zzso The growth suppression of zzso zzso tumors after zzso was reduced upon additional zzso treatment zzso by zzso expression zzso although early tumor cell zzso rates were significantly increased by zzso This apparently paradoxical effect was accompanied by a marked zzso induction of zzso in zzso 

zzso induced zzso zzso in zzso but not in zzso zzso also induced development of zzso in tumor tissue in zzso Further investigations relating to the interplay between tumor cell metabolism and tumor zzso are necessary to explain the limited success of zzso targeting in zzso
