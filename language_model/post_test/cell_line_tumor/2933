zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells generates zzso products that were reported previously to have a cap or zzso zzso We confirmed that this zzso modification is indistinguishable from the cap on full-length zzso and Western zzso zzso and zzso labeling identified a population of capping zzso in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso capping zzso sediments in a zzso complex that contains a zzso which, together with capping zzso converts zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso shows diffuse and zzso zzso throughout the zzso and its zzso does not overlap with P bodies or stress zzso zzso of inactive capping zzso in a form that is restricted to the zzso reduced the ability of cells to recover from zzso stress, thus supporting a role for capping in the zzso and suggesting that some zzso may be stored in an zzso zzso
