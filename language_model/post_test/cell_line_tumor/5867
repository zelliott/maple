zzso zzso zzso has been identified as a novel zzso zzso by an zzso gene with specific zzso zzso located on zzso zzso zzso has been associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as zzso zzso and restless leg zzso However, little information is available about zzso in Alzheimer's disease zzso In this study, therefore, we investigated the expression and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the cerebral zzso of zzso and control cases using real-time zzso chain reaction zzso as well as in zzso zzso zzso We also examined protein expression using zzso zzso In addition, we used in zzso methods to further explore the effect of zzso stress and zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso To do this we examined zzso zzso and protein expression changes in the human zzso cell line, zzso after treatment with zzso zzso or zzso The zzso effect of zzso on zzso stress induced by zzso was measured by zzso zzso The in zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso zzso was detected mainly in zzso to a lesser degree in zzso cells in the cerebral zzso The zzso intensity and the number of positive cells were increased in the cerebral zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso confirmed that zzso expression levels in the cerebral zzso were significantly higher in zzso cases than that in control cases at both the zzso and the protein zzso Cell culture experiments demonstrated that the expression of both zzso zzso and protein were increased by treatment with zzso or a combination of zzso and zzso but not with zzso zzso Finally, zzso expression showed a significant zzso effect against zzso zzso stress ( zzso The present study suggests that zzso is involved in the pathology of zzso and may play a zzso role against zzso zzso
