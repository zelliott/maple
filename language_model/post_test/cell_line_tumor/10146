We have investigated zzso zzso regulation in the context of human zzso zzso zzso using primary human zzso zzso zzso immortalized zzso zzso individual zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and cervical zzso zzso Here, zzso was suppressed in the presence of zzso whereas its expression was not affected in zzso or zzso zzso zzso could be zzso after DNA zzso but was decreased again upon drug zzso zzso zzso could also be accomplished when E6 was knocked down, suggesting a contribution of E6 in zzso de zzso zzso We identified a single zzso island near the zzso start site as being involved in selective zzso zzso To prove the functional relevance of zzso in building up an zzso response, zzso was zzso expressed in cervical zzso cells where protection against zzso zzso zzso zzso could be zzso zzso of zzso was accompanied by an increase of zzso zzso and zzso factors, which was reversed by knocking down either zzso or zzso by small interfering zzso This suggests the existence of a positive feedback loop between zzso zzso and components of zzso signaling zzso to maintain an zzso zzso Our in zzso findings were further zzso in biopsy samples of cervical cancer patients, in which zzso was also zzso when compared with normal donor zzso This is the first report showing an zzso zzso of type I zzso after zzso zzso expression and revealing a novel strategy on how high-risk zzso can abolish the innate immune response in their genuine host zzso
