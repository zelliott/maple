There is strong evidence for a role of zzso zzso zzso in cancer cell proliferation and tumor zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso convert zzso acid to zzso which can be zzso to zzso by zzso zzso zzso The human prostate cancer cell line zzso expressed high amounts of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso expression also was zzso in human prostate cancer zzso where it appeared more abundant compared with benign zzso By using zzso we established stable and practically complete zzso of zzso both in zzso cells with high zzso expression and in the zzso cell lung cancer cell line zzso where zzso is zzso For zzso prepared from zzso zzso conversion of zzso to zzso was reduced by zzso This resulted in clear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso capacity and slower growth of zzso tumors (with disintegrated tissue zzso in nude zzso For zzso cells, zzso zzso gave increased zzso in response to zzso stress zzso which could be rescued by zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso is an alternative therapeutic target in cancer cells expressing this zzso
