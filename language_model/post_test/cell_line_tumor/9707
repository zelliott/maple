Although there is now evidence that the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences are key players in major zzso functions, their zzso status in human cells is still poorly zzso The main reason for this lack of data is the complexity and high level of zzso of these repeated zzso which zzso straightforward analyses by available zzso zzso Here a zzso zzso dedicated to the analysis of CT and zzso expression is developed and validated in zzso zzso zzso zzso For the first time, the expression status of CT and zzso sequences is analyzed in a series of normal and cancer human cells and zzso demonstrating that they are zzso in all normal zzso except in the zzso where zzso transcripts are zzso Moreover, zzso sequences are specifically expressed in HS cells in a zzso Factor 1 zzso fashion, and we show here that another independent pathway, involving DNA zzso can also trigger their zzso Interestingly, CT and zzso were found zzso expressed in zzso cancer samples, whereas zzso were zzso in zzso cancer, suggesting that the expression of CT and zzso sequences may represent a good indicator of zzso zzso occurring in response to environmental changes or in cell zzso
