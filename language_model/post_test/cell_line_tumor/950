Bone zzso zzso a zzso and zzso zzso that is expressed by zzso zzso zzso is also produced in tumors that zzso to zzso To facilitate studies of zzso expression in normal and pathological human zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was raised against human bone zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown by zzso zzso to recognize the zzso zzso zzso acids zzso that is zzso in zzso zzso zzso However, whereas the zzso recognized zzso zzso expressed in bacteria, it did not recognize native forms of rat or pig zzso in which the first zzso of the zzso zzso sequence appears to be zzso zzso of embryonic human zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso showed strong reaction in zzso and zzso with relatively weak zzso of the bone zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is partially masked in the bone zzso zzso zzso zzso also stained zzso cells and normal zzso cells in the zzso in areas of zzso zzso Cancer cells in primary breast tumors, zzso zzso and secondary bone zzso from individual patients were stained strongly by zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso zzso also stained breast cancer zzso cell lines and zzso zzso cells, zzso of zzso zzso could not be demonstrated in breast cancer zzso zzso the zzso of zzso in the breast cancer cells was diffuse contrasting the zzso zzso typical of zzso zzso in zzso zzso These studies, therefore, have identified a unique zzso in human zzso recognized by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which can be used for the unequivocal identification of zzso in normal and pathological human zzso
