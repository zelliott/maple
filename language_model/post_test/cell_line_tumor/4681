The cellular origin of Ewing tumor zzso a tumor of bone or soft zzso characterized by specific zzso between zzso and zzso zzso is highly zzso Through gene expression analysis comparing zzso with a variety of normal zzso we show that the profiles of different zzso Ewing cell lines zzso toward that of zzso stem cells zzso Moreover, upon zzso zzso two different Ewing cell lines can differentiate along the zzso lineage when incubated in appropriate differentiation zzso In addition, Ewing cells can also differentiate along the zzso lineage upon long-term zzso of zzso These in zzso and experimental data strongly suggest that the zzso of zzso may allow Ewing cells to recover the zzso of their zzso zzso
