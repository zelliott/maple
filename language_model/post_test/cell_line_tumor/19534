We have already shown that the zzso activity of zzso that had been reported to be dependent on the area under the concentration - time curve zzso was actually peak concentration zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso zzso has also been reported to be dependent on zzso whereas its cumulative zzso has been reported to be zzso zzso In this study, we evaluated whether the zzso and cardiotoxic effects of zzso were zzso or zzso dependent, and compared their zzso effects, utilizing the computer-controlled in zzso zzso simulation system or a conventional culture system for a zzso cell line and measuring the zzso zzso amount or the proportion of beating cells for the zzso In zzso cells, the zzso rate decreased as the simulated infusion time or exposure time increased with the same zzso value in the simulation and conventional culture system zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso and proportion of beating cells also increased with prolonged zzso exposure time with the same constant concentration - time product value zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in heart zzso These results indicated that both the zzso effects and the zzso were zzso zzso However, a comparison of the two showed that zzso was more zzso dependent than the zzso zzso These results suggested that the continuous infusion treatment schedule of zzso may have the clinical advantage of reducing zzso more markedly than the zzso zzso
