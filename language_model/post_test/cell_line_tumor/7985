zzso (also called zzso or zzso is a zzso zzso involved in the degradation of several proteins that regulate cell cycle and zzso Recently, we demonstrated that this protein has a role also in the maintenance of zzso stability and in the response to zzso damaging zzso Here we report for the first time that zzso interacts with the zzso leukemia protein zzso accumulates in zzso nuclear bodies zzso but it does not play any role in normal or zzso zzso zzso However, zzso seems to regulate zzso number, since its zzso causes an increase in zzso which can be overcome by increased levels of zzso and its zzso has the opposite zzso We additionally found that zzso interacts with the DNA damage checkpoint zzso zzso whose presence is necessary for the increase of zzso induced by zzso zzso and that zzso depletion resulted in a partial restoration of zzso in zzso derived zzso Altogether, these results underline a new role for zzso in the control and regulation of zzso zzso zzso
