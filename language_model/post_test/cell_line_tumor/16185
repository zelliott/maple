zzso chemotherapy is the frequent administration of low doses of zzso agents targeting zzso zzso zzso We examined the efficacy of zzso zzso combined with zzso ultrasound zzso in human zzso zzso and evaluated its zzso mechanism by measuring the circulating zzso zzso cells zzso a surrogate marker of zzso A human zzso zzso cell line, zzso was used in the present study because this tumor is one of the most zzso zzso of human solid tumors and it also has a high zzso zzso The combination of zzso zzso and US zzso significantly inhibited the tube formation of zzso and vascular zzso growth factor expression of tumor cells in zzso The zzso zzso in nude mice were treated using US at a low intensity zzso zzso 1 zzso for 4 zzso three times per week each after the zzso administration of zzso this treatment was continued for 5 zzso The tumor zzso was assessed by zzso color zzso US in real zzso The combination treatment significantly inhibited the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso compared with the zzso This combination therapy showed a significant reduction in tumor volume, resulting in a significant zzso of survival, in comparison with each treatment zzso These results suggest that the effect of zzso chemotherapy for human zzso zzso was accelerated by US zzso in zzso and this combination might therefore be potentially effective for new cancer zzso
