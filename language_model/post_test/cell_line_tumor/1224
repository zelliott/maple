To study the expression of zzso alpha 6 beta 4 in human zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso To explore the mechanism and the effects of zzso alpha 6 beta 4 in human zzso zzso cell zzso 

zzso was used to zzso the surface expression of zzso alpha 6 beta 4 in human zzso zzso cell zzso zzso 6 and zzso 4 specific zzso zzso were used in adherence zzso zzso and in zzso invasion zzso 

zzso of zzso alpha 6 beta 4 were present in both zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso 6 and zzso 4 specific zzso zzso together blocked the alpha 6 beta 4 on the surface of the cells resulting in low adherence on the zzso zzso and weak invasion through the zzso zzso 

zzso alpha 6 beta 4 play a zzso role in the zzso and invasion of zzso zzso zzso 6 and zzso 4 specific zzso zzso together can block the function of zzso alpha 6 beta zzso So treatment with zzso 6 and zzso 4 specific zzso zzso may reduce the development of zzso zzso
