zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso aggressive zzso zzso that develops rapid resistance to conventional zzso In efforts to identify novel approaches to block proliferation of zzso cells, we found that zzso a natural compound isolated from the root plant zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso in a zzso manner in several zzso cell zzso Our data show that zzso treatment of zzso cells results in zzso of death zzso 5 zzso expression via generation of zzso oxygen species zzso and causes zzso of zzso and zzso of Bid zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso causing zzso changes in zzso leading to loss of zzso membrane potential and release of zzso c to the zzso zzso release of zzso c results in zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to induction of zzso zzso In addition, we show that zzso of zzso cells with zzso a universal inhibitor of zzso abrogates zzso and zzso zzso and prevents cell death induced by zzso Moreover, treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso expression of inhibitor of zzso proteins zzso Finally, zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso generation of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso changes, zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso Taken together, our findings suggest that zzso is a potent zzso of zzso of zzso cells via zzso of zzso and raise the possibility that this agent may be of value in the development of novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of zzso
