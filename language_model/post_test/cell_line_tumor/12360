There is growing body of evidence that zzso events zzso addition to genetic zzso the progression of zzso zzso These zzso zzso may provide targets for new therapeutic zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso a group of cellular zzso which contain zzso elements in their 3' untranslated zzso To investigate a possible contribution of zzso changes to the progression of colon cancer and to zzso of zzso we studied expression of zzso and zzso a cohort of zzso zzso and in colon cancer cell zzso All cell lines showed an expression of zzso zzso and zzso In tumor tissue of colon zzso we observed two different zzso patterns of zzso A nuclear expression in zzso as well as an additional zzso expression in zzso of zzso zzso was expressed in zzso of zzso zzso expression of zzso was significantly associated with increased zzso expression as well as with high tumor zzso In zzso zzso analysis, zzso tumor stage and zzso status but not zzso or zzso expression were zzso factors for overall zzso Our results suggest that the zzso of zzso in colon cancer may be part of a regulatory zzso that controls the zzso stability of zzso and provides an interesting example for a contribution of a zzso of zzso stability to the progression of zzso zzso Based on our results, further studies are necessary to investigate whether zzso might be a potential target for a molecular tumor zzso
