A series of zzso complexes with zzso derivatives of zzso as carrier zzso and zzso zzso as leaving groups were zzso and zzso All complexes were characterized by zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso The in zzso zzso activities were tested by zzso zzso against four human cancer cell zzso breast zzso zzso and colon cancer zzso cells were particularly sensitive, especially to complexes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that representative compounds exert zzso toward zzso and zzso cells through induction of zzso and zzso of zzso progression in the S phase, similar to zzso The interaction between the zzso complexes and zzso zzso DNA was observed by zzso gel zzso revealing that complex zzso has the capacity to distort zzso DNA in a manner distinct from that of zzso
