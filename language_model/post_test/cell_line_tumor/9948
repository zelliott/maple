The present work deals with the zzso effect of zzso derivatives associated with the zzso zzso By varying the functional group at zzso of the zzso by different zzso zzso several zzso derivatives zzso were zzso Their chemical structures were confirmed by zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso zzso The zzso compounds were examined for their zzso effects against human leukemia cell lines, zzso and zzso The preliminary results showed most of the derivatives had moderate zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso exhibited good zzso compared to other zzso acid zzso In addition DNA fragmentation results suggest that zzso is more zzso and able to induce zzso
