The zzso system zzso reporter zzso zzso is widely used to study gene zzso signal zzso and other cellular zzso Although zzso of reporter zzso DNA to zzso cell lines is an indispensable experimental step, the zzso efficiency of DNA varies among cell lines, and several cell lines are not suitable for this type of zzso because of the low zzso zzso In this study, we confirm the zzso efficiency of reporter DNA to several cancer and normal cell lines after transient zzso by zzso zzso zzso images could be obtained from living single cells after transient zzso and the calculated zzso efficiency of this method was similar to that of the conventional reporter zzso using a zzso We attempted to measure the activity of the zzso promoter under zzso zzso stress conditions using both high and low zzso efficiency cells for zzso DNA at the zzso level, and observed zzso of this promoter even in cells with the lowest zzso zzso These results show that zzso imaging of single cells is a powerful tool for the analysis of gene expression based on a reporter zzso using limited samples such as clinical specimens or cells from primary culture, and could provide additional information compared with the conventional zzso
