Present cancer gene therapy using zzso genes has had limited success because the therapy is prone to cause side effects as a result of the lack of tissue and cancer zzso To target cancer cells without damaging normal cells, we have designed a novel dual promoter system in which a zzso zzso system under the control of a zzso promoter drives expression of a therapeutic zzso The zzso of this system was demonstrated by adapting it to target lung zzso We termed this lung cancer system zzso zzso gene under the control of human zzso reverse zzso promoter and human zzso protein A1 zzso The zzso system showed much higher promoter activity in lung cancer cells compared with other kinds of cancer and normal lung cells, including stem zzso Moreover, zzso of negative zzso responsive elements in the system allows it to be drug zzso The approaches that we have used could be adapted to target other types of zzso We report a novel zzso zzso dual promoter system designed for gene zzso
