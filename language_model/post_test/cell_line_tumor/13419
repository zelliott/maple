zzso a zzso acid zzso zzso the last committed step of the de zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid, a major element of bacterial surface zzso Here we report a functional zzso zzso of zzso zzso a zzso agent, and systematically address its molecular and zzso role in bacterial zzso zzso of zzso led to thinner capsules and more zzso to zzso and zzso zzso resulted in complete absence of zzso zzso These two zzso both exhibited increased zzso and invasion to zzso cells and improved sensibility to zzso Not only do they retain the capability of inducing the release of host zzso zzso but also result in the faster zzso of zzso zzso cleaning up of the zzso strains in whole blood is consistent with zzso zzso seen with experimental infections of both mice and zzso Therefore we concluded that altered architecture of zzso zzso surface zzso its zzso
