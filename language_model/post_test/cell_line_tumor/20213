zzso derived from skin zzso zzso mice provide resistance to both skin and lung zzso over the zzso of the zzso zzso In an effort to map tumor modifier zzso affecting both tumor types, we carried out a genetic linkage analysis in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice and identified a locus zzso on zzso 1 linked to both skin zzso score zzso zzso and lung zzso score zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso residing in this locus and belonging to the zzso growth factor binding protein family were expressed at significantly greater levels in normal lung tissue from zzso zzso mice than in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso genes in two lung cancer cell lines significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we have identified a single zzso locus that affects skin and lung zzso and identify zzso and zzso as candidate modifier genes of lung zzso
