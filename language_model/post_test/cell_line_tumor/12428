zzso of tumor cells to treatment with zzso drugs depends on expression and function of zzso and zzso zzso The goal of our study was to determine the functional role of the novel zzso protein zzso V zzso in protection of human lung zzso cell lines against zzso Analysis of expression of zzso in multiple lung zzso cell lines revealed a positive correlation between the expression of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso of the lung zzso cells zzso with zzso expression of zzso or with its impaired zzso function zzso of zzso zzso demonstrated increased sensitivity to treatment with zzso drugs zzso and zzso zzso of these clones with zzso zzso did not change their sensitivity to zzso suggesting the involvement of a zzso activity of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso mainly affected the zzso zzso of zzso as assessed by zzso c release zzso zzso of the zzso zzso function also affected zzso potential and calcium loading capacity of zzso as well as zzso zzso Altogether, these findings suggest that zzso is a zzso zzso which is essential for protection against zzso induced by zzso zzso
