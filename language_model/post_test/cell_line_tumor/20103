Half sandwich zzso complexes zzso zzso zzso are being studied for their zzso zzso We investigated here the zzso zzso of three such complexes, namely zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pic zzso zzso and their interaction with DNA model zzso The aim of the study was to assess how they are affected by the nature and charge of the zzso zzso The model reactions of 1-3 with the zzso derivatives zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were studied by zzso zzso All reactions lead, although with different rates and to different zzso to the formation of zzso zzso with the zzso derivatives zzso to the zzso zzso Two products, the complexes zzso zzso and zzso zzso were structurally characterized also by X-ray zzso The structure of 4 is stabilized by strong zzso zzso between an zzso of en and the zzso zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso of complexes 2 and 3, as well as the zzso and the mechanism of the reaction of complexes 1-3 with the biologically more relevant zzso zzso were studied by zzso zzso The rate of the reaction of 1-3 with zzso depends on the nature of the zzso zzso rather than on the charge of the complex, decreasing in the order zzso zzso zzso The measured zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso 0, zzso zzso zzso support an zzso mechanism for the substitution zzso
