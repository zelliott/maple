Although breast zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors zzso are the most common form of zzso zzso in humans, it has been difficult to develop a suitable mouse model showing similar steroid hormone zzso zzso zzso factors play critical roles in zzso zzso zzso but the precise role of zzso remains zzso zzso we show that a subset of human breast zzso display reduced zzso expression and that mice lacking zzso surprisingly develop zzso zzso zzso 

We used a combination of approaches, including zzso examination, gene targeted mice, gene expression analysis, tumor zzso and zzso to pursue this zzso 

zzso percent zzso of human zzso and zzso zzso of zzso breast zzso display zzso or low levels of zzso expression in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso expression is elevated in zzso cells of normal breast zzso adjacent to the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is selectively zzso in the tumor cells during tumor zzso Interestingly, the expression levels of zzso in the zzso zzso cells remain zzso indicating that zzso resolution analysis of zzso level in primary breast cancer zzso is necessary for accurate zzso Female mice lacking functional zzso spontaneously develop zzso zzso that comprise zzso zzso zzso tumor cells, and depend on zzso for tumor zzso and zzso zzso marker analyses demonstrate that zzso zzso tumors arise from zzso zzso cells, but not zzso zzso In addition, the molecular signature of the zzso zzso tumors zzso closely to that of human zzso breast zzso Finally, introduction of zzso zzso but not a zzso zzso lacking the critical zzso zzso into zzso zzso tumor cells results in zzso demonstrating that the tumor zzso function of zzso is zzso and requires its zzso zzso 

Our findings demonstrate that zzso suppresses zzso tumor formation and its expression is frequently lost during breast cancer zzso zzso zzso tumors that develop in zzso mice closely zzso the zzso zzso hormone zzso and molecular characteristics of human zzso breast cancer, the most common zzso of human breast zzso and thus represent a valuable platform for testing novel treatments and detection zzso
