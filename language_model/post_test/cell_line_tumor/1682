In the present study, we demonstrated the use of zzso zinc oxide zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso structure possesses a high surface to volume ratio due to its zzso and zzso zzso can be used as an efficient zzso carrier zzso We were able to grow zzso zzso on the tip of zzso glass zzso zzso zzso and zzso this with zzso for efficient zzso drug zzso The zzso zzso on the zzso tip could be excited zzso with zzso zzso light, and the zzso zzso red light zzso in the presence of zzso activated a chemical reaction that produced zzso oxygen species zzso The procedure was tested in zzso cells and led to cell death within a few zzso The zzso changes in zzso cells were examined by zzso The viability of control and treated zzso cells with the optimum dose of zzso light was assessed using the zzso zzso and zzso were detected using a zzso zzso zzso
