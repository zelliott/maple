The molecular zzso heat shock protein 90 zzso is involved in the maturation and stabilization of a wide range of zzso client proteins for zzso and zzso cell zzso which renders this protein a promising target in the development of cancer zzso zzso is a zzso zzso inhibitor with less toxicity in normal cells than in cancer zzso In this study, we examined the in zzso zzso activity and molecular mechanisms of action of zzso in human lung cancer cell zzso zzso enhanced the sensitivity of the zzso and zzso cancer cells to zzso When the cancer cells were zzso with zzso the repair of DNA zzso breaks zzso was markedly inhibited after zzso compared with the cells that were not zzso with zzso as evaluated by counting the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso We further demonstrated that zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso formation, a critical protein for the zzso zzso zzso of DNA zzso zzso These data indicate that targeting zzso with zzso may be novel therapeutic strategy for zzso zzso
