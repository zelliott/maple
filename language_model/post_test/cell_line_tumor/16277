zzso used clinically zzso to treat zzso has been reported to increase zzso zzso transport in zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso 

To identify the underlying signaling pathway, we explored the effects of short-term and overnight zzso treatment on second zzso signaling and zzso zzso 

zzso transport was assessed either as zzso across zzso zzso grown on zzso and mounted in zzso chambers or by the zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured by zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell surface zzso protein levels was assessed by Western zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso level was studied by zzso 

zzso and the zzso zzso zzso caused comparable and zzso increases of zzso in zzso zzso The zzso effects of zzso and zzso were each suppressed if the tissue had previously been treated with the other zzso These responses were zzso even if the zzso were treated with zzso zzso zzso increases in zzso zzso were zzso of those obtained with zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso or zzso greatly attenuated zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso inhibitor zzso did zzso Compared to controls, zzso increased zzso zzso by zzso fold, and zzso caused a zzso increase in zzso membrane zzso as seen by zzso following cell surface zzso 

zzso activates zzso zzso in zzso cells via zzso protein zzso A, and by increasing zzso membrane zzso zzso
