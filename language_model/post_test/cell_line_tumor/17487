A novel member of zzso carrier zzso has been identified from human bone zzso zzso cells zzso and designated as human zzso zzso carrier protein zzso It encodes a 321 zzso protein with three tandem related zzso of about 100 zzso zzso Each domain contains two zzso stretches, which are thought to span the membrane as zzso Distant relationship analysis indicates that the protein is highly zzso between species from zzso zzso to zzso zzso gene is mapped to zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is zzso in various human zzso and cell zzso By zzso imaging, zzso is localized to zzso and also detected in the zzso zzso of human breast zzso zzso zzso When zzso into zzso cells zzso zzso could enhance zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a zzso zzso and widely expressed zzso carrier protein which perhaps associates with zzso zzso zzso
