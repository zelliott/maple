zzso growth factor zzso inhibitor type 1 zzso is a zzso zzso inhibitor that regulates the activities of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso has two zzso inhibitor zzso with the zzso zzso domain zzso responsible for zzso known target zzso Previously, we reported that zzso of zzso in the human pancreatic zzso cell line zzso resulted in zzso to zzso zzso To evaluate the role of zzso in zzso we examined the zzso capability of zzso cells that did or did not zzso express zzso zzso zzso in an experimental pulmonary zzso zzso using nude zzso The extent of pulmonary zzso was verified by zzso examination and direct measurement of human zzso 19 zzso zzso One week after injecting zzso cells into mouse tail zzso apparent zzso colonization was observed in zzso zzso of mice injected with zzso zzso whereas none zzso of the control mice were positive for zzso After 2 weeks the zzso positive ratios were zzso zzso and zzso zzso and after 4 weeks the ratios were zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and control zzso cells, zzso Thus, loss of zzso promoted pulmonary zzso zzso of zzso zzso abolished zzso produced by zzso zzso cells after 1 zzso Moreover, zzso zzso restored zzso levels in zzso zzso zzso cells and reduced their zzso in zzso These data indicate that zzso regulates pulmonary zzso of zzso and zzso may have therapeutic application for zzso zzso cancer cell zzso
