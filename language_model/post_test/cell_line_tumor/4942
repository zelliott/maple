The zzso hydrocarbon zzso nuclear zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso zzso factors and regulates several genes as zzso with other zzso zzso zzso is also able to zzso but no zzso target genes for the zzso have been zzso We identified a zzso zzso element in the zzso regulatory region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene that was found to be important for zzso zzso in primary zzso and was found by zzso zzso zzso to interact with zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments with in zzso translated zzso showed binding without zzso partner, indicating binding as a zzso zzso studies in zzso and zzso zzso cells revealed that zzso expression is necessary for full activity of the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso mouse line, the level of zzso zzso zzso was decreased zzso zzso studies with an zzso expression zzso lacking the zzso domain zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso is needed for zzso zzso which suggests that zzso zzso zzso as a zzso In primary zzso the zzso levels of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 were increased during zzso zzso zzso factors 1 and zzso were also able to bind to the same zzso as zzso indicating that there may be competition for DNA binding between these zzso Indeed, the upstream zzso factors activated the zzso promoter through the zzso only in the presence of zzso nuclear zzso while zzso zzso was independent of zzso nuclear zzso In conclusion, these results indicate that zzso controls zzso zzso and thus, for the first time, suggest active involvement of the zzso zzso in zzso gene zzso
