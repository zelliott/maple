Although the Chinese herb zzso zzso has been used as a remedy for zzso for hundred years, the active compounds and molecular mechanisms underlying its zzso activity have not been zzso Recently a new zzso of zzso compound, zzso zzso was isolated from this Chinese zzso In the present study, we examined the potential of zzso in zzso activity and the mechanisms involved in human cancer cell zzso We found that zzso exhibited significant zzso effects on human zzso cancer cell growth that was accompanied by marked zzso induction as well as zzso of the zzso inhibitor of zzso protein zzso Further studies have shown that zzso zzso of zzso protein expression was only observed in zzso zzso but not in constitutionally zzso expressed zzso in the same cells, excluding the possibility of zzso regulating zzso expression at the level of protein zzso We also identified that zzso zzso zzso gene zzso via zzso of zzso zzso There was no significant effect of zzso on zzso and colony formation of cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso current studies, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, identify zzso as a major active compound for the zzso activity of zzso zzso by zzso of zzso expression and induction of zzso through specific targeting of a zzso pathway, and cast new light on the treatment of the cancer patients with zzso zzso
