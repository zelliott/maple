zzso screening of the zzso genes in breast cancer families is mostly done on zzso zzso For families with a very strong family history and no zzso identified in the coding sequences or the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis is an efficient approach to uncover gene inversion and zzso zzso defaults missed by conventional zzso zzso 

We analyzed zzso from patients of negative zzso families by reverse zzso zzso and identified an zzso in one family that we characterized by sequencing and by using a zzso zzso zzso More than 2,000 additional zzso negative families were subsequently screened for this zzso using a dedicated zzso zzso 

Nine families were found to harbor a zzso zzso transcript containing a zzso cryptic zzso between zzso 12 and zzso This cryptic zzso results from a new zzso located deep into zzso 12, zzso zzso G, which reinforces the strength of a zzso zzso zzso site, turning it into a perfect consensus zzso It is systematically included in transcripts produced by the zzso zzso in cells from zzso carriers or produced by a zzso zzso reporter zzso The inclusion of the cryptic zzso was prevented when we zzso the zzso with zzso zzso complementary to the 3' or zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This first deep zzso zzso zzso emphasizes the importance of analyzing zzso to provide comprehensive zzso diagnostic tests and opens the possibility of using zzso therapy in the future as an alternative strategy for cancer zzso
