The zzso zzso acid zzso and its active zzso induce zzso arrest and programmed cell death zzso in cancer cells independently of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso Its zzso zzso acid zzso selectively antagonized cell zzso events zzso expression and zzso zzso but not the zzso events zzso arrest and zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso and its zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso are zzso zzso studies on zzso zzso and three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggested reasons for their zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso functional theory studies indicated that the zzso zzso groups of the zzso and zzso zzso assumed positions that were nearly zzso with the aromatic rings of their polar zzso In contrast, in the zzso of the zzso zzso having zzso and zzso groups, rather than a hydrogen, zzso to the zzso bonds, the zzso bond zzso angles increased so that the zzso groups were oriented out of this zzso zzso and molecular dynamics of zzso zzso and these zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain illustrated how specific zzso on the zzso and zzso scaffolds modulated the positions and dynamics of the zzso zzso As a result, the position of zzso zzso zzso in forming the zzso site was impacted in a manner consistent with the experimental effect of each analogue on zzso zzso zzso
