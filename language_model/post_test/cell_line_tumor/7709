zzso zzso coated with zzso zzso peptides were developed as a vehicle for the targeted delivery of the cancer drug zzso zzso to treat breast zzso zzso D, a breast cancer cell zzso zzso triggered the release of zzso by digesting the protective zzso layer of zzso zzso zzso were successfully detected with ultrasound imaging in both in zzso conditions and in zzso mouse cancer zzso Cell viability experiments were conducted to determine the efficacy of zzso zzso specific to breast cancer cell zzso These experimental results were compared with the outcome of a viability experiment conducted on zzso zzso zzso decreased in human zzso zzso zzso and mouse zzso zzso zzso cells, while that of zzso zzso zzso cells remained zzso Next, a real-time video of zzso flow in mouse models was obtained using in zzso ultrasound zzso The fluorescent profile of zzso was used as a means to examine zzso zzso in zzso zzso show the distribution of zzso concentrated primarily within zzso and tumor sites of subject mice zzso These findings support the use of zzso coated zzso in target specific therapy for breast cancer zzso
