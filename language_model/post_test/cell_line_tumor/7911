zzso stress is thought to play a major role in the zzso of zzso cancer zzso a frequent complication of alcoholic liver disease zzso However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly zzso In zzso of zzso patients, we recently detected by zzso significantly increased levels of zzso zzso zzso that are formed by the reaction of the major zzso zzso product, zzso zzso with zzso In the current study, we show that zzso zzso and zzso zzso both strongly correlate with zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Increased levels of zzso zzso were also detected in the liver of zzso lean zzso and obese zzso zzso zzso The number of zzso in zzso stained positively for zzso zzso correlated significantly with zzso expression zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso To further assess the role of zzso in the formation of zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with human zzso were exposed to ethanol with or without zzso zzso a specific zzso zzso Ethanol increased zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso cells in a zzso and zzso manner, but not in zzso zzso control zzso zzso blocked the generation of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our data support the assumption that zzso induction of zzso zzso leading zzso zzso to highly zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso may play a central role in zzso in patients with zzso
