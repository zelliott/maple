zzso cells are characterized by zzso zzso which provides biomass for zzso proliferation and leads to zzso zzso through zzso of zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso causes variable zzso which zzso zzso cell survival and zzso Brain zzso frequently occur in patients with advanced breast zzso treatment strategies are therefore needed against brain zzso from breast zzso 

In order to identify differences in the capacity for zzso exchange, human zzso breast cancer cells and human zzso zzso cells were grown under 4 % or 20 % oxygen conditions and examined for zzso zzso and zzso expression on plasma zzso by quantitative post embedding zzso electron zzso Whereas previous studies on zzso expression in zzso have recorded zzso and protein levels in cell zzso we examined zzso of the proteins in the zzso plasma membrane zzso specialized for zzso zzso 

In zzso both zzso cell types highly expressed the low affinity zzso zzso which is thought to mainly mediate zzso zzso while for high affinity transport the breast zzso cells zzso expressed zzso and the brain zzso cells resembled brain zzso in expressing zzso rather than zzso The expressions of zzso and zzso were zzso in hypoxic conditions in both breast and brain zzso zzso The expression of zzso also increased in hypoxic breast cancer cells, but decreased in hypoxic brain zzso zzso zzso zzso showed similar zzso induced changes in the protein zzso 

The differential expression and regulation of zzso in the surface zzso of hypoxic and zzso zzso cells of different types provide a foundation for innovation in zzso therapy through the selective targeting of zzso Selective zzso of various zzso could be an efficient way to zzso an important energy source in both original breast zzso and zzso cancer tissue in the zzso
