The zzso zzso IV zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso While insulin regulated zzso zzso zzso has been proposed as a potential zzso for zzso IV, the zzso pathways of zzso IV through zzso remain zzso We applied high-resolution mass zzso to perform a systemic quantitative zzso of zzso zzso cells treated with and without zzso IV using zzso zzso labeling by zzso acids in cell culture zzso and identified a reduction in the zzso of a major zzso protein zzso 1 zzso upon zzso IV zzso In addition, zzso zzso a zzso regulatory protein that plays important functions in the neural system, was expressed at higher zzso zzso revealed decreased zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the major cell cycle zzso zzso protein zzso These changes are consistent with an observed decrease in cell zzso Taken together, our study suggests that zzso IV functions via regulating the activity of zzso
