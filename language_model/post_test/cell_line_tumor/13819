zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are pharmaceuticals previously characterized as zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso in various cell lines and animal zzso In this study, the eight zzso pharmaceuticals were investigated in highly aggressive zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso and zzso breast cancer cell lines, and their effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and cell migration were zzso zzso zzso was used as a positive zzso The zzso zzso activities of the pharmaceuticals depended on structure, response, and cell zzso Most compounds induced one or more zzso responses in zzso cells, whereas in zzso zzso cells effects of the zzso pharmaceuticals were highly zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not induce zzso in zzso zzso moreover, in combination with zzso zzso was a potent zzso zzso zzso was a partial zzso and zzso also exhibited some zzso zzso zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso and zzso were full and partial zzso zzso respectively, in both breast cancer cell zzso These data indicate that the zzso pharmaceuticals are selective zzso zzso and applications of these drugs for targeting the zzso must be confirmed by studies using the most relevant cell zzso
