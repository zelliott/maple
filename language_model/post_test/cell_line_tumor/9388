To investigate the effect of zzso zzso on growth of gastric cancer and its possible zzso 

zzso tumors were induced by zzso injection of zzso cells in nude zzso zzso growth was measured by calipers in two zzso zzso zzso was determined with tumor zzso density zzso by zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso protein level and zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso were examined by Western zzso zzso zzso expression was determined by zzso and zzso release in tumor culture medium by zzso zzso cell proliferation was studied by zzso zzso cell migration by gelatin modified zzso chamber zzso and in zzso zzso by zzso tube formation in zzso 

zzso injection of zzso inhibited the growth of gastric cancer by zzso zzso in tumor zzso treated with zzso was markedly zzso zzso treatment reduced zzso protein level in zzso and in zzso zzso and zzso expression of zzso in tumor cells were also suppressed by zzso in a zzso zzso This zzso effect was associated with reduced zzso of zzso but zzso treatment did not change the total zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso cell zzso migration and tube zzso 

zzso zzso the growth of gastric cancer by reducing zzso production and zzso and is a promising candidate for zzso treatment of gastric zzso
