The zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso are members of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso these zzso zzso from the zzso to the nucleus, where they induce zzso processes such as proliferation and zzso The mechanism of zzso of this zzso involves zzso of two zzso zzso within a nuclear zzso signal zzso which allows binding to zzso and a subsequent penetration via nuclear zzso Here we show that the zzso of both zzso zzso is zzso mainly by zzso zzso 2 zzso and that active zzso may assist in the zzso of the zzso zzso We also demonstrate that the zzso is dependent on the release of zzso from zzso zzso zzso Crystal structure of the zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso creates an zzso patch in zzso Our model is that in resting cells zzso is bound to zzso zzso which prevent its zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain releases zzso and allows zzso of its zzso by zzso and active zzso to generate a zzso charged patch in zzso binding to zzso 7 and nuclear zzso These results provide an important role of zzso in regulating nuclear zzso zzso
