zzso evidence links deregulation of the zzso zzso 22 zzso zzso to cancer development and progression in a select group of tumor types, but its specificity and underlying mechanisms of action are not well zzso Here we show that zzso is a critical promoter of lethal tumor zzso that acts by modulating nuclear zzso and zzso zzso In multiple zzso models of human cancer, modeling of zzso zzso deregulation demonstrated that zzso controls zzso zzso zzso and zzso and that it enhances expression of critical target genes zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso not only zzso zzso zzso function, but was sufficient to induce the transition to therapeutic zzso zzso in zzso depletion experiments revealed that zzso is critical to maintain zzso associated with zzso zzso This was a significant finding given clinical evidence that zzso is highly zzso in tumors, which have achieved therapeutic zzso Taken together, our findings define zzso as a critical zzso of tumor zzso which drives lethal zzso zzso this zzso as an appealing therapeutic target to treat advanced zzso
