In a departure from conventional strategies to improve treatment outcome for zzso zzso we report the isolation of zzso peptides using a zzso display library screened with freshly obtained human zzso leukemia zzso 

A zzso display library was screened by 5 rounds of zzso with freshly isolated human zzso zzso Individual colonies were randomly picked and after zzso zzso activity zzso and zzso on fresh zzso cells was zzso Ten peptides were zzso for further biological zzso Multiple peptides were found to selectively bind to acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso The peptides bound to leukemia cells, were zzso and could induce proliferation and/or differentiation in the target patient zzso Two of the zzso zzso and zzso appeared to have a novel mechanism of inducing differentiation since they did not cause zzso arrest in cycling cells even as the expression of the differentiation marker zzso zzso 

zzso induced differentiation of leukemia cells offers a novel treatment strategy for zzso zzso whereas their ability to induce proliferation could be harnessed to make cells more sensitive to zzso zzso these leukemia specific peptides can also be used to refine diagnosis, document minimal residual disease, and selectively deliver toxins to zzso zzso
