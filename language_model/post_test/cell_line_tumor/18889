zzso is zzso by invasive growth and a high degree of zzso zzso a regulator of zzso zzso is highly expressed and known to induce zzso in human zzso In this study, we examined the effect of zzso suppression on zzso in zzso zzso cells, while focusing on zzso aberration and zzso instability zzso We suppressed zzso by small interfering zzso zzso and examined the zzso using a zzso zzso and a zzso blue exclusion zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso wild zzso zzso To assess the zzso status, we determined the number of zzso using an zzso analysis, and the zzso copy number by zzso in zzso zzso As a result, the zzso differed regarding the zzso status as zzso cells quickly developed extreme zzso amplification zzso and enhanced the zzso while zzso amplification and zzso increased more gradually in zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso did not lead to zzso after zzso This cell death was accompanied by an increased degree of zzso suggesting zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso may be an attractive therapeutic target to overcome the zzso while, in addition, proper attention to zzso zzso zzso is considered important for improving zzso in human zzso
