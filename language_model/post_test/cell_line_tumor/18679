The dysfunction of zzso and/or zzso gap zzso zzso communication zzso has been implicated in zzso of many kinds of zzso Here we have characterized zzso and the expression of zzso in six human lung zzso cell lines and normal lung zzso zzso Compared with zzso all the zzso cells showed reduced or little zzso zzso They expressed remarkably reduced zzso zzso and variable levels of zzso zzso but neither zzso nor zzso protein could be zzso However, using a zzso zzso transfer of zzso was observed between donor zzso cells and first order neighboring recipient tumor cells zzso cells in zzso zzso Transfer from tumor to zzso cells under the same conditions was not seen, although increasing the ratio of donor tumor cells to recipient zzso cells and zzso the cells at low density did reveal weak transfer from tumor cells to zzso zzso of zzso into giant cell zzso PG cells increased zzso communication and eliminated the zzso behavior of zzso zzso This indicates that the apparent zzso of dye transfer between normal and tumor cells was a product of low rates of zzso transfer linked to zzso rapid dilution of the dye to below zzso limits through a very well coupled cell population zzso to zzso and zzso concentration of dye in immediate neighbors in a poorly coupled cell population zzso to tumor zzso These results suggest that the zzso levels may need to exceed a certain threshold to allow propagation of signals over a sufficient distance to affect behavior of a cell zzso We propose that the relative rates of zzso and zzso zzso of cell populations and the zzso zzso of shared zzso in tumor cells and the surrounding normal tissue are likely to be very important in the regulation of their zzso
