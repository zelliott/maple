The purpose of the investigation was to prepare a new type of zzso namely zzso zzso zzso zzso and to evaluate the behavior and zzso effect of zzso zzso were prepared and characterized using the zzso electron microscope zzso and zzso scan zzso Cellular zzso and zzso zzso studies were performed to evaluate the in zzso behavior of zzso An in zzso imaging technique was used for the evaluation of the targeting of zzso To study the zzso effect, zzso zzso were zzso The particle size of zzso was zzso and the zzso potential was zzso zzso contained a surface layer that was obviously different from the core, according to the zzso zzso A zzso scan analysis demonstrated the incorporation of zzso in zzso and it also revealed a structure different from free zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso cells occurred in a zzso and zzso zzso According to the zzso study, the zzso of zzso was zzso zzso zzso could distribute and accumulate in the tumor site by an enhanced zzso and retention zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso could significantly inhibit the growth of zzso zzso For a similar zzso effect, the required cumulative dose of zzso was only zzso compared to that of zzso (the commercial zzso of zzso This study demonstrated the effective zzso of zzso by zzso cells, the passive targeting of zzso at tumors and the better zzso effect of zzso
