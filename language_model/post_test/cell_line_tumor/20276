The zzso and safety of zzso zzso zzso the human zzso tumor zzso gene zzso were examined in this zzso study for in zzso prostate cancer gene zzso First, the in zzso zzso effects of zzso in normal and cancer cells derived from the prostate and liver were zzso zzso zzso effects were observed at 100 zzso zzso of zzso in prostate cancer cells zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso and zzso however, no effects were seen in normal zzso To analyze the safety of zzso zzso administration, the zzso and zzso after zzso injection were evaluated in various zzso of normal male zzso zzso In a supporting study, zzso dissemination following intravenous injection of zzso into tail veins was zzso To evaluate whether zzso was present in the collected tissue zzso human zzso gene detection was performed using zzso zzso treatment administered at lower doses showed zzso zzso into the zzso urinary zzso and zzso At higher doses, zzso dissemination was observed in zzso more distant from the zzso including the zzso zzso heart, liver and adrenal zzso After intravenous injection of zzso dissemination was observed in the liver and zzso These results indicate that the zzso of zzso is determined by the dose and route of zzso Although acute inflammatory effects were observed in the prostate after zzso administration at higher doses, no abnormal zzso findings were noted in the other zzso including those of zzso treated zzso Regarding the safety of zzso administration, no deaths and no signs of toxicity or unusual behavior were observed in the mice in any treatment zzso Based on these zzso experiments, zzso in zzso zzso gene therapy is considered to be safe for use as a treatment for human prostate zzso
