zzso and zzso receptors zzso play important roles in zzso and zzso breast cancer zzso zzso against zzso zzso or zzso have been used in breast cancer treatment for many zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether zzso zzso has zzso effects on zzso zzso In the present study, we found that zzso significantly reduced the growth of zzso human breast cancer zzso cells, and suppressed the zzso and protein level of zzso zzso alpha zzso Interestingly, zzso decreased zzso protein levels by promoting the degradation of zzso protein in the zzso The zzso can be activated through a zzso and/or a zzso zzso The activated zzso zzso was shown to directly zzso zzso at its zzso zzso and cause zzso independent zzso Our results showed that zzso might inhibit the zzso zzso zzso zzso either through directly zzso zzso zzso activity or through zzso zzso of the upstream zzso zzso zzso The depletion of zzso family zzso including zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso was also zzso zzso treatment also led to a zzso decrease in the expression of the zzso zzso D1 zzso These findings suggested that zzso might be a useful zzso or therapeutic agent for zzso breast cancer through suppressing the functions of zzso by zzso depletion and modulating the zzso zzso
