Increased zzso oxygen species zzso production has been reported as a distinctive feature of different zzso including zzso zzso we assessed whether increased zzso production in the cancer zzso could be selectively exploited to develop a selective zzso zzso For this purpose, we constructed a novel zzso promoter, based on a zzso motif located in the zzso gene promoter placed, in turn, downstream of a second zzso motif obtained from the early growth response 1 zzso gene zzso The activity of the zzso promoter was largely dependent on variations in zzso zzso levels and showed a high zzso response to zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene driven by the zzso promoter, followed by zzso zzso administration, inhibited human zzso cancer and melanoma cell growth in zzso and in zzso Moreover, zzso of the zzso gene followed by zzso administration exerted a potent therapeutic effect on established zzso This response was improved when combined with zzso zzso Thus, we show for the first time that a distinctive zzso state can be used to develop new selective gene zzso for zzso
