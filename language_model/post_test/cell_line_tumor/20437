There is substantial evidence indicating that the zzso signaling zzso is activated in various cancer cell types including breast zzso Previous studies reported that zzso a small zzso inhibitor of the zzso signaling pathway, decreased growth of cancer cells but not normal zzso suggesting this zzso plays a role in tumor progression and zzso In this study, we tested zzso as a potential inhibitor for zzso zzso of breast cancer cells including migration, invasion, and zzso zzso significantly inhibited growth, migration, and invasion of triple negative zzso breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso in zzso We demonstrate that zzso was a potent growth inhibitor for zzso breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso but not for other, zzso breast cancer cell lines zzso zzso or zzso when cultured in three zzso zzso type I collagen zzso Western zzso analyses suggest that treatment of zzso cells with zzso markedly inhibited the expression of zzso but not zzso of zzso zzso or downstream targets such as zzso and zzso We demonstrated that zzso was specifically associated with zzso but not with zzso zzso or zzso in zzso zzso zzso of gene expression profiles in breast cancer zzso suggest that zzso expression is higher in zzso breast zzso many of which are zzso than any other zzso These results suggest not only a mechanism for migration and invasion involving the zzso zzso pathways but also novel strategies for treating patients who develop zzso breast zzso
