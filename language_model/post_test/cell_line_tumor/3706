zzso and zzso are zzso zzso that promote zzso of zzso signaling zzso leading to stabilization of certain zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso type I zzso binds zzso and zzso and subsequent recruitment of the zzso zzso accessory protein zzso zzso signal zzso Two alternatively spliced zzso soluble zzso zzso and zzso which lack zzso and zzso zzso have been zzso The zzso and possibly zzso can inhibit zzso zzso zzso expression of the different zzso zzso zzso may be an important zzso of responsiveness to zzso We show that although both zzso and zzso zzso are widely expressed in human zzso their relative proportions differ significantly in a zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that the zzso zzso has a zzso of approximately 48 h in both the kidney cell line zzso and the zzso cell line zzso The zzso zzso has a similar zzso in zzso cells, but a considerably shorter zzso of approximately 5 h in zzso zzso Using zzso reporter zzso we demonstrated that this specific zzso of the zzso zzso in the latter cell type is zzso by its zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis further established that the cell zzso instability does not involve zzso zzso but is zzso by several novel elements that appear to act zzso such elements may be recognized by proteins expressed specifically in some, but not all, zzso These data demonstrate that the cellular capacity to respond to zzso is tightly regulated in a zzso zzso
