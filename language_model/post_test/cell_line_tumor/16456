zzso growth factor zzso zzso is an important zzso that promotes cell growth and zzso zzso a zzso zzso has been approved clinically for the treatment of chronic zzso leukemia and demonstrated to be effective against solid tumors in zzso through zzso zzso Here, we disclose that zzso degradation zzso zzso zzso in head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were treated with zzso and cell zzso zzso and underlying signal zzso were zzso zzso exhibited differential sensitivities against zzso zzso Growth zzso and zzso were correlated with its zzso on zzso zzso and zzso irrespective of zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso of zzso was a zzso of zzso zzso zzso inhibitor reversed zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity was increased by zzso indicating that zzso zzso zzso might be through zzso zzso zzso Increased zzso zzso by zzso administration rescued cells from zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso enhanced its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated to play a role in zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso at the zzso zzso zzso was associated with zzso in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso model showed that zzso inhibited zzso tumor growth through in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso In conclusion, degradation of zzso is a novel mechanism responsible for zzso zzso in zzso zzso
