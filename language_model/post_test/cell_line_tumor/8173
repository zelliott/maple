zzso zzso are a class of zzso agents with favorable zzso selectivity profiles compared to their natural product zzso zzso zzso Like many zzso agents, zzso S and zzso readily react with zzso small molecules such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso reduced cellular zzso levels can affect zzso S zzso zzso zzso zzso is a critical cellular zzso zzso that regulates the zzso ratio of zzso zzso In this study, we found that zzso zzso are zzso zzso and evaluated aspects of the zzso interactions as compared with the structurally related natural product zzso S and the known irreversible zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso zzso activity with zzso zzso however, up to 2 zzso zzso S did not inhibit zzso zzso The absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and the presence of zzso zzso zzso the natural zzso zzso which binds to the zzso active site, has a minimal effect in protecting zzso from zzso Furthermore, each compound can induce zzso zzso changes independent of the presence of zzso or zzso These results, together with zzso analysis results and mass zzso data, indicate zzso is a zzso inhibitor and zzso an irreversible inhibitor that can form a zzso with zzso by reacting with active site zzso Finally in a zzso zzso zzso S and zzso were found to inhibit zzso activity, but this zzso was not associated with the reduction of zzso levels in the zzso A model accounting for differences in mechanisms of zzso zzso by the series of compounds is zzso
