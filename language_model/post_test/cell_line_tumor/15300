A key issue for safe and zzso gene therapy approaches is the zzso and zzso expression of zzso zzso expression in zzso is either achieved by transfer zzso that deliver the gene of interest into a distinct cell type or by use of zzso expression zzso Here we present the generation of zzso zzso replicating zzso that are able to replicate in a tissue specific manner thus allowing tissue specific zzso expression in combination with zzso zzso The zzso replication of the zzso zzso zzso and its derivatives depends exclusively on a zzso unit starting from a zzso active promoter extending into the zzso attachment region zzso 

Here, we exchanged the zzso promoter in the zzso zzso zzso by the tumor specific alpha zzso zzso or the muscle specific smooth muscle 22 zzso promoter leading to specific zzso expression in zzso positive human zzso zzso zzso and in a zzso positive cell line, zzso The incorporation of the zzso zzso element into the expression cassette further zzso the expression levels with both zzso zzso zzso could be exemplary proven for the smooth muscle protein 22 zzso promoter in zzso With the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression could be achieved in zzso after systemic zzso application together with zzso as zzso zzso 

In this study we present an zzso zzso system designed for tissue specific zzso expression and zzso The human zzso in combination with the zzso zzso element was demonstrated to be a valuable zzso promoter for targeting zzso zzso with zzso gene delivery system, and tissue specific replication could be shown in zzso with the muscle specific zzso zzso In combination with appropriate delivery systems, the tissue specific zzso zzso system will allow higher zzso with less zzso side effects and is suitable for long term zzso expression in zzso within gene zzso zzso
