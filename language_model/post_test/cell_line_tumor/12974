zzso zzso production has been implicated in many types of zzso In this context, zzso has been explored as a viable therapeutic approach to reduce zzso zzso However, elevated levels of zzso in tumors are often associated with high expression levels of cellular zzso which consequently produce various sizes of saturated zzso fragments with divergent zzso zzso The current study shows that different zzso zzso of zzso and microbial zzso could elicit distinct zzso in cancer cell zzso Unlike saturated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso had no biological effect on growth of breast zzso zzso More importantly, zzso zzso process of zzso into zzso zzso significantly decreased breast cancer cell zzso migration and invasion by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results suggest that it may be possible to exploit zzso unique zzso activity in suppressing zzso tumor growth and zzso
