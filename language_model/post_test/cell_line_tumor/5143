There is a large need for better pharmacological treatment of neuroendocrine zzso The aim of this study was to investigate and zzso the zzso zzso effects resulting from a combination of five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A and zzso zzso chosen from a previous screening of zzso zzso active agents on neuroendocrine tumor cells, with standard zzso agents currently used in the treatment of neuroendocrine zzso 

The human pancreatic zzso cell line zzso human typical zzso zzso cell line zzso and the human zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso were zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso zzso and each one of the five agents were studied and simultaneous zzso were explored using the zzso zzso 

Most of the combinations of zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso and their remaining combinations were zzso Almost all of the zzso zzso interactions were zzso while zzso A and zzso displayed less zzso but more additive and zzso interactions in combination with the standard zzso 

The synergistic and additive interactions make zzso zzso and zzso zzso potential candidates for incorporation into combination chemotherapy regimens and these drugs might be the suitable candidates for further clinical studies in patients with zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso zzso
