zzso is the most common zzso solid tumor of zzso While survival rates are high for localized disease, treatment response remains poor for a subset of patients with large tumors or zzso zzso Thus, there remains much room for improvement in treatment strategies for this zzso Using in zzso and in zzso systems, we present zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a potential mechanism to treat zzso Using the specific zzso inhibitor zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso decreases the viability of zzso cells, as determined by cell proliferation zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, as determined by zzso V zzso and confirmed with zzso zzso Using flow zzso we are able to demonstrate that zzso zzso the zzso of cells in the zzso phase of the cell zzso Finally, we show that these in zzso results translate into delayed tumor growth in zzso using a zzso tumor model in nude mice treated with zzso These findings suggest that zzso is a potential molecular target for the treatment of zzso
