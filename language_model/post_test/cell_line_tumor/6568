zzso differentiation with the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso However, what role zzso plays in zzso biology has not been zzso We have addressed this question by zzso zzso induction by using zzso zzso Using a zzso system, we created zzso stable cell lines that express a zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso cells treated with zzso differentiate to a zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, expression of zzso short hairpin zzso effectively suppresses zzso zzso zzso and activity zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso for either zzso or zzso zzso it was found that zzso predominantly regulates zzso and plays a lesser role in zzso regulation in response to zzso zzso Furthermore, in intact zzso cells, zzso activity can be regulated by changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso does not prevent zzso cell zzso because several markers of zzso differentiation are zzso However, suppression of zzso expression alters some aspects of the zzso zzso because cell zzso zzso ability, and zzso expression are zzso The zzso analog zzso reverses the changes caused by zzso zzso Also, zzso zzso cells have lower zzso levels of zzso and zzso in the zzso state of several probable zzso zzso zzso Thus, the effects of zzso on differentiation may ultimately be zzso through decreased zzso In conclusion, zzso regulates a subset of zzso changes that occur upon zzso differentiation and likely also plays a role in differentiated zzso by regulating zzso zzso zzso
