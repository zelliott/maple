To investigate the effects of zzso zzso zzso on tumor cell zzso and its effects on the blood vessel zzso 

zzso and zzso values were used to assess the zzso effects of zzso on tumor cell zzso Chicken zzso zzso membrane and zzso zzso zzso isolated from rats were used to investigate the effects of zzso on the blood vessel zzso 

zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of several cancer cell lines, including human gastric zzso cell line zzso human zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso human melanoma cell line zzso human colon cancer cell line zzso human breast zzso cell line zzso and human leukemia cell line zzso zzso significantly decreased the formation of blood vessels in chicken zzso zzso membrane and in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso cancer cell proliferation and prevents blood vessel zzso
