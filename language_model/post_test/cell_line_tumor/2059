With current techniques, it remains a challenge to assess zzso binding of nuclear zzso for example, the zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso is critical in many breast tumors and is inhibited by zzso such as tamoxifen in cancer zzso zzso is also modified by zzso and zzso that affect responses to the zzso as well as interactions with zzso zzso of zzso at zzso is one of the mechanisms causing tamoxifen zzso zzso of resistance in patient samples would greatly facilitate clinical decisions on treatment, in which such patients would receive other treatments such as zzso zzso or zzso Here we describe a zzso zzso array that can be used for zzso analysis of full-length zzso zzso zzso The zzso chip can detect zzso binding in cell and tumor zzso We show that zzso zzso at zzso associates stronger to various zzso peptides on the zzso This implies that zzso zzso increases zzso zzso zzso As this is also detected in a breast tumor sample of a zzso patient, the zzso zzso as described here, may be zzso to detect tamoxifen resistance in breast tumor samples at an early stage of disease and contribute to personalized zzso
