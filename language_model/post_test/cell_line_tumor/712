We used live cell imaging to compare the fate of human zzso zzso and cancer zzso zzso cells as they entered zzso in zzso or zzso In the same field, and in either drug, a cell in all lines could die in zzso exit zzso and die within 10 zzso or exit zzso and survive zzso or zzso zzso Relative to zzso cells, significantly fewer zzso or zzso cells survived zzso or remained viable after zzso in zzso zzso that inhibit zzso zzso zzso or in 500 zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso cells, respectively, died in or within 10 h of zzso zzso while zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso This was even true for clinically relevant zzso zzso (5 zzso which killed zzso and zzso respectively, of zzso and zzso cells in zzso or within 10 h of escaping zzso compared to zzso of zzso zzso Together these data imply that studies using zzso or zzso cells, harvested after a prolonged block in zzso with zzso or zzso are significantly contaminated with dead or dying zzso We also found that the relationship between the duration of zzso and survival is drug and cell type specific and that zzso is related to the cell type and drug used to prevent satisfaction of the zzso attachment zzso Finally, work with a zzso inhibitor suggests that the primary zzso zzso triggered by zzso during zzso in zzso cells is not active in zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso zzso 2008 zzso zzso
