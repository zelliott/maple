We have observed that in three human zzso zzso cell lines, zzso zzso induced the zzso of the zzso factor zzso and the synthesis of zzso oxide zzso by zzso the zzso signaling zzso The incubation with zzso decreased the level of zzso zzso and the activity of zzso zzso and induced the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso leading to the nuclear zzso of zzso The effects of zzso fibers on zzso zzso and NO synthesis were zzso by zzso (an inhibitor of the zzso zzso and toxin B (an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso while they were reverted by zzso acid, the product of zzso zzso A zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso similarly to zzso inhibited the synthesis of cholesterol and zzso and the zzso of zzso these effects were prevented in the presence of zzso zzso This suggests that zzso fibers might inhibit the synthesis of zzso molecules at the level of the zzso zzso reaction or of an upstream step, thus zzso the zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso zzso can stimulate NO synthesis via a double zzso it can activate the zzso NO zzso via the zzso zzso and the zzso NO zzso via a direct zzso Our results suggest that zzso increases the NO levels in zzso cells by modulating both NO zzso zzso
