Nuclear zzso zzso is a zzso factor that plays crucial roles in inflammation and zzso zzso the positive and negative regulation of zzso activity is therefore of fundamental zzso A few previous studies reported that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso enhances zzso zzso zzso of zzso However, many aspects of the zzso negative regulation of zzso zzso remain to be zzso The present study was conducted to shed light on zzso zzso stimulus zzso and upstream mechanisms of the enhanced zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso shift zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso DNA binding in human zzso zzso zzso Moreover, another zzso inhibitor zzso also strongly enhanced zzso zzso DNA zzso while zzso an inactive analogue of zzso did not increase the zzso DNA zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso only a marginal enhancement of zzso DNA zzso zzso treatment also zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso DNA zzso Furthermore, zzso but not zzso increased zzso zzso zzso expression by zzso or zzso in zzso zzso Likewise, zzso zzso production by zzso was increased by zzso but not by zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso degradation and zzso nuclear zzso was elevated by zzso and zzso Among the tested cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso only zzso a zzso cell line, showed enhanced zzso DNA binding by zzso These results suggest that pharmacological zzso of zzso enhances the zzso pathways by zzso through zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells and the zzso enhancement is more robustly achieved by zzso than by zzso
