zzso zzso zzso is an inflammatory zzso disease of the central nervous system in which binding of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso causes zzso zzso zzso and zzso We previously reported a wide range of binding affinities of zzso to zzso in separate zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso We report here a second, independent mechanism by which zzso is affected by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso release and zzso cell zzso zzso we found in different cell lines, and with different zzso and zzso zzso that zzso was greatly zzso reduced in cells expressing zzso versus zzso Studies using a zzso zzso containing an zzso zzso and in cells expressing zzso in different zzso ratios, indicated that zzso zzso requires zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso produced by natural killer cells did not depend on zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso binding and complement attack complex zzso supported the conclusion that the greatly enhanced zzso by zzso is due to efficient, zzso binding of zzso to clustered zzso on zzso We conclude that zzso assembly in zzso is required for zzso in zzso establishing a new mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso may greatly reduce zzso dependent zzso and zzso zzso
