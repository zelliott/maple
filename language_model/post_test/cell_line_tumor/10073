A number of zzso zzso zzso have been studied for their ability to enhance immune zzso Although these zzso are effective in zzso and clinical studies, they are costly and have occasionally been associated with adverse effects such as zzso and zzso zzso Numerous studies have shown that treatment of mice with an zzso zzso clone zzso targeting zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso results in enhanced immune responses in zzso zzso zzso we evaluate the novel approach of zzso zzso cell zzso with zzso zzso the heavy and light chain of the zzso zzso We show the induction of significantly enhanced tumor immunity by zzso with a combination of zzso DC and tumor zzso zzso This enhancement is comparable to that seen with zzso delivered zzso along with the zzso zzso zzso when zzso was delivered using zzso DC, we observed no evidence of zzso zzso in any zzso zzso We also show enhanced induction of zzso zzso responses, which is only observed when the zzso and zzso DC are zzso at the same zzso To illustrate the broad utility of this strategy, we show that DC zzso with zzso zzso zzso fusion protein is also an effective tumor vaccine zzso
