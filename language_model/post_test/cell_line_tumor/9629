zzso zzso is an abused drug that may cause psychiatric and zzso damage, including zzso of zzso terminals and zzso of zzso cells in the zzso The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these zzso zzso effects remain to be zzso In this study, we performed a time course assessment to investigate the effects of zzso on zzso zzso stress and zzso zzso in a human zzso zzso zzso cell zzso We characterized that zzso zzso a zzso sequence of several cellular events including, zzso a decrease in zzso membrane potential within 1 h of the zzso treatment, zzso an extensive decline in zzso membrane potential and increase in the level of zzso oxygen species zzso after 8 h of the treatment, zzso an increase in zzso mass after the drug treatment for 24 zzso and finally, a decrease in zzso copy number and zzso proteins per zzso as well as the occurrence of zzso after 48 h of the zzso zzso vitamin E attenuated the zzso increases in zzso zzso level and zzso mass, and prevented zzso cell zzso Our observations suggest that enhanced zzso stress and zzso zzso zzso may play critical roles in zzso zzso zzso
