To investigate the expression of zzso zzso factor zzso in multiple myeloma zzso cells and the correlation between zzso and zzso zzso 

The expressions of zzso zzso transcripts and protein in zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso were determined by zzso and Western zzso respectively, zzso levels in culture zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso of human zzso vein zzso cells zzso mixed with zzso culture medium at different zzso was examined by zzso zzso The effects of zzso culture medium on zzso migration and tube formation were studied by modified zzso chamber zzso and tube formation zzso zzso 

zzso was expressed in and zzso by zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in culture zzso were within the range of its biological zzso zzso culture medium induced a zzso proliferation of zzso The number of zzso at a concentration of 50% zzso culture medium and at full zzso culture medium were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso increase, respectively zzso zzso compared with that of zzso The zzso activity of zzso was reduced on the addition of zzso zzso to the culture zzso zzso culture medium also zzso the migration and differentiation of zzso in zzso the zzso index of zzso at a concentration of 50% zzso culture medium and at full zzso culture medium were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso Full zzso culture medium also zzso zzso tube formation in zzso zzso zzso and addition of zzso zzso zzso neutralized these effects zzso 

zzso cell lines expressed and zzso biologically active zzso which may be involved, at least in part, in zzso zzso
