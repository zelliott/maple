The ability of microbial pathogens to target specific cell types is a key aspect of the zzso of infectious zzso zzso zzso by infecting zzso cells, contributes to nerve injury in patients with zzso Here, we investigated mechanisms of zzso interaction in the peripheral nerve zzso of zzso We found that the expression of the zzso zzso zzso known to be expressed on tissue zzso and to mediate the zzso of zzso zzso was present on zzso cells, zzso with the zzso cell marker, zzso zzso zzso zzso along with the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the peripheral nerve biopsy zzso In zzso human zzso zzso cells, both from primary cultures and a long-term line, have a higher binding of zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso known to be expressed in skin zzso from zzso patients, increased zzso expression on human zzso cells and subsequent zzso cell binding to zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso did not induce zzso expression on these zzso zzso the regulated expression of zzso represents a common mechanism by which zzso cells and zzso bind and take up zzso zzso contributing to the zzso of zzso
