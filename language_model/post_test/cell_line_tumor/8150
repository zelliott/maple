zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso drugs zzso represent a promising new class of drugs developed to provide a safer alternative than their conventional zzso counterparts in zzso We tested the effects of zzso 2 on Phase I and Phase II zzso zzso In zzso human zzso cells and in zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso 2 inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso and zzso zzso zzso These effects were further characterized as being zzso through zzso zzso zzso 2 inhibited binding of zzso zzso zzso hydrocarbon zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 suppressed zzso expression of zzso zzso nuclear zzso The fate of zzso zzso depends not only on zzso by zzso zzso but also zzso by Phase II zzso Both zzso and zzso cells treated with zzso 2 showed an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with two other zzso compounds, zzso and the organic zzso zzso zzso the zzso effects of zzso 2 on zzso zzso activity and zzso expression were considerably more zzso Furthermore, aspirin alone had no zzso effect on zzso zzso activity, nor did aspirin zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso to the effects on zzso zzso zzso 2 inhibited zzso zzso formation and DNA damage zzso by zzso or zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso 2 may be an effective zzso agent by favorably affecting the zzso and enhancing effects of Phase I and Phase II zzso zzso thereby protecting DNA from zzso zzso
