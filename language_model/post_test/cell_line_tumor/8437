In previous work, we constructed short hairpin zzso zzso expression plasmids that targeted human zzso and IGF-1 receptors zzso zzso respectively, and demonstrated that these zzso could induce zzso of human zzso cell lines zzso and inhibit zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

We have constructed multiple zzso expression zzso of targeting zzso zzso and zzso which were zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso expression was assessed by zzso The growth of the cells, cell cycle zzso zzso of the cells, zzso tumor cells and the proteins of zzso zzso and zzso were analyzed by zzso flow zzso zzso therapy or Western zzso 

In group of simultaneously blocking zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso expression was decreased by zzso zzso and zzso and the protein expressions was diminished to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Meanwhile, the cell zzso increased by zzso zzso and zzso and zzso cells increased by zzso zzso and zzso in the second, third and fourth day cultures, zzso 

zzso blocking zzso zzso and zzso genes is capable of altering the balance between zzso versus zzso and zzso cells in the favor of both of zzso and zzso and, therefore, the tumor cells zzso
