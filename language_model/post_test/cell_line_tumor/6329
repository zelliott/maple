In zzso zzso have localized zzso zzso to individual cells, revealed genetic zzso of rhythm generation, identified molecular players in zzso synchronization and determined zzso events regulated by zzso zzso Although they allow strict control of experimental conditions and reduce the number of variables compared with in zzso studies, they also lack many of the conditions in which cellular zzso zzso normally zzso The present review highlights methods to study zzso timing in cultured zzso cells and how they have shaped the hypothesis that all cells are capable of zzso zzso
