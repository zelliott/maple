zzso blood collections from cohort studies provide the means to search for proteins associated with disease before clinical zzso We investigated plasma samples from the Women's Health Initiative zzso cohort to determine quantitative differences in plasma proteins between subjects subsequently diagnosed with zzso cancer zzso and matched controls that remained zzso during the period of zzso zzso analysis of zzso samples collected before diagnosis of zzso resulted in the identification of six proteins with significantly zzso zzso zzso elevated zzso in cases compared with zzso zzso analysis of two zzso cell lines showed that five of the six proteins were produced by cancer zzso zzso protein zzso family member 1 zzso zzso growth zzso protein 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were individually zzso by zzso linked zzso zzso zzso in 58 pairs of newly diagnosed zzso samples and controls and yielded significant zzso zzso zzso zzso among cases relative to zzso A combination of these four markers resulted in a receiver operating characteristics curve with an area under the curve value of zzso and 57% sensitivity at zzso zzso This combination rule was tested in an independent set of zzso samples collected within 7 months before diagnosis from cases and matched controls resulting in zzso sensitivity at zzso zzso A panel consisting of zzso zzso zzso and zzso has zzso value in zzso zzso zzso
