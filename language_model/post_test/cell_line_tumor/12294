To investigate and compare the zzso activities of zzso acid B zzso and zzso zzso extract zzso zzso in zzso solution, rat zzso and the cellular zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was generated using zzso zzso system and zzso zzso system, and the effects of zzso and zzso zzso on the generation of zzso achieved by zzso measurement of the product formed on reduction of zzso blue zzso Two different methods were used to assess the scavenging effects of the extracts on zzso radical zzso zzso zzso method was used for zzso of zzso OH by zzso zzso of zzso zzso to form zzso zzso in zzso zzso To confirm the zzso data, zzso was also measured by zzso using a commercial detection zzso The zzso zzso effects of the extracts in zzso of rat brain, liver and kidney induced by zzso were determined by zzso acid zzso zzso The protective effects of the extracts on zzso hydrogen zzso zzso damage in zzso cells were investigated by assessing cell viability zzso the level of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso 

Both zzso and zzso zzso were able to zzso zzso and zzso OH, inhibit zzso zzso of zzso and protect zzso cells against zzso zzso zzso However, the concentration of zzso was far lower than that of zzso zzso when a similar effect was zzso 

The zzso efficiency of zzso was greater than that of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso like zzso zzso has promising potential in treating zzso zzso neurodegenerative zzso
