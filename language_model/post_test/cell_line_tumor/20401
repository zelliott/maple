zzso levels of zzso exert zzso effects, whereas high zzso of zzso may cause zzso in part via zzso of zzso To characterize the zzso effects of combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso we zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and examined its effects in zzso and in zzso zzso was zzso by chemically combining a slow releasing zzso donor zzso acid zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso levels in human zzso cells zzso zzso as high as that was achieved by zzso zzso with zzso after zzso following oxygen and zzso deprivation zzso protected zzso cells and zzso primary cortical zzso more markedly than did zzso or zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso in primary cortical zzso were aggravated by sodium zzso zzso or zzso but suppressed by zzso and zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso depletion in zzso cells more markedly than did zzso or zzso Administration of zzso after global cerebral zzso and zzso more robustly decreased cerebral zzso volume and improved survival and neurological function of mice than did zzso or zzso These results suggest that an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prevents zzso zzso death, providing a novel therapeutic strategy for zzso brain zzso
