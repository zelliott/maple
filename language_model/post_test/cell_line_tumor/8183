zzso is a zzso zzso avian cell line widely used to study cell autonomous gene function because of the high rates with which DNA zzso are zzso zzso into its zzso Here, we demonstrate that the power of the zzso system can be extended yet further through the use of zzso interference as an alternative to gene zzso We have generated and characterized stable zzso zzso in which both zzso 2 genes have been in zzso zzso using gene zzso and from which the zzso of both zzso 2 zzso can be zzso depleted through the zzso expression of short hairpin zzso The cell cycle zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells has been compared with that previously reported for other zzso cells depleted either of zzso zzso through gene zzso or depleted of both zzso simultaneously by transient zzso In addition, the zzso zzso system has been used to explore whether excess zzso arising through zzso 2 depletion is sufficient to trigger the zzso zzso (or zzso checkpoint, proposed to exist in differentiated zzso zzso
