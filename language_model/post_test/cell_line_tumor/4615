Breast zzso lacking zzso and zzso zzso expression and zzso amplification exhibit distinct gene expression profiles and clinical features, and they comprise the majority of zzso zzso Here we demonstrated that the zzso family member zzso controls a zzso for zzso zzso sensitivity specific to these zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso exclusively within a subset of zzso primary breast zzso that commonly exhibited zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso promoted survival of breast cancer cells by binding zzso and thereby zzso its zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso interference led to zzso induction of zzso zzso family members and zzso Breast cancer cells expressing zzso and zzso exhibited zzso sensitivity that was uniquely dependent on zzso Thus, in response to treatment with zzso but not other zzso agents, zzso underwent zzso zzso which promoted zzso of the zzso protein complex, zzso zzso of zzso zzso family members, and zzso These findings define zzso as a survival factor in a subset of breast zzso zzso they provide what we believe to be a novel mechanism for zzso sensitivity in these zzso zzso and they suggest that such zzso may share the zzso sensitivity of zzso zzso
