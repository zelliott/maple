We evaluated zzso effect of combined chemotherapy and zzso zzso gene therapy in in zzso and in zzso experimental zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso 

zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso genes using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was added to the experimental samples at a final concentration of 20 zzso Four groups were assigned in zzso zzso cells, zzso cells, zzso cells plus zzso and zzso cells plus zzso Death rates zzso and cellular zzso changes were zzso zzso tumor model was established by subcutaneous injection of zzso cells to the nude zzso Four groups were assigned in zzso control zzso zzso zzso zzso gene group and zzso gene plus zzso zzso After injection of combined zzso and zzso gene therapy, tumor size and zzso levels were zzso 

In zzso zzso DR in the zzso + zzso gene therapy group zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher than zzso group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso cells plus zzso group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso A higher amount of zzso changes and necrosis on transmission electron microscope analysis were observed in zzso cells plus zzso zzso In zzso zzso A significant tumor zzso was found in zzso gene in combination with zzso group when compared with any other groups that were treated without zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in serum were significant high in zzso gene groups zzso zzso zzso 

The combination of zzso chemotherapy and zzso gene therapy showed an additive zzso effect on zzso cancer cells in zzso and in zzso Further investigation should be focused on high-level zzso protocols in zzso
