Cancer cells produce energy through zzso zzso but contributions of host zzso to cancer energy metabolism are zzso In this study, we aimed to zzso the zzso energy production relationship, in particular, between cancer energy production and host zzso During the development and progression of zzso cancer, expression of the zzso zzso stress protein zzso increased in the muscle of zzso zzso This effect was associated with decreased expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity in muscle via the zzso zzso for advanced zzso zzso zzso However, muscle zzso energy production was zzso In contrast, zzso addition to zzso cancer cells increased zzso zzso In the muscle, zzso addition induced zzso by decreasing levels of active zzso and increasing zzso zzso plasma zzso and zzso incorporation into zzso In a mouse model of colon zzso a zzso increase in zzso occurred in serum and zzso zzso with an increase in zzso associated with altered plasma free zzso acid levels, increased zzso and decreased zzso zzso These differences were abolished by administration of an zzso zzso zzso Similar results were obtained in a mouse zzso model of human zzso zzso Taken together, our findings suggest that zzso released during zzso recruits muscle to supply zzso to cancer cells as an energy zzso
