The reaction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso afforded the zzso or zzso complexes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso structures of 2 and 4 were determined by X-ray zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso complexes zzso was tested against human cell lines zzso zzso zzso cancer, zzso head and neck zzso zzso lung zzso zzso zzso cancer, zzso colon zzso and compared with those of zzso and zzso zzso 4 seems to be slightly more active against zzso zzso and zzso and substantially more active than all the other complexes against zzso with an zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso very close to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were less toxic on normal human zzso zzso than on the investigated tumor cell lines and more selective to cancer cells than zzso DNA zzso method showed that treatment of the zzso cell line with zzso doses of zzso resulted in the induction of zzso zzso 1 caused zzso by zzso of zzso 2, 3 and zzso Since no activity of zzso 9 is observed, complex 1 is causing zzso triggered by an zzso zzso zzso tests have been also carried zzso Solutions of all the studied complexes have been treated with different zzso of fish zzso DNA zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which gave intrinsic binding zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso were observed, however, no notable interaction with zzso zzso DNA was zzso
