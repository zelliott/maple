zzso zzso with specifically designed functionality have wide applications in biomedical zzso We reported zzso the synthesis and characterization of a zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso groups in the zzso A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso to provide the title zzso zzso via zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited high activity toward the zzso in terms of molecular weight zzso and zzso conversion, whereas the attempt with zzso zzso In the presence of molecular zzso zzso the highest zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso was obtained in zzso with an initial zzso concentration of zzso M at 75 zzso in the presence of 10 zzso % of zzso to the zzso zzso that influence the zzso including reaction temperature, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were investigated zzso The zzso data suggested zzso characteristics for this zzso zzso and the zzso feature seemed independent of the zzso zzso The zzso conducted in mixed zzso zzso showed that product zzso were heavily dependent on the zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated to be zzso by zzso zzso The obtained zzso was found to be soluble in most of the organic zzso and interestingly in zzso as zzso In zzso zzso degradation of zzso as monitored by zzso indicated the degradation was a relatively fast zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso zzso was the main product after zzso zzso presented low zzso toward human zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso cells zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso
