The ability of zzso to zzso key zzso pathways in tumor cells suggests that zzso may act as a tumor zzso The detailed mechanism of how zzso functions in prostate cancer zzso however, remains zzso Here we demonstrate that in the presence of zzso zzso protein expression can be suppressed in zzso prostate cancer zzso Further studies reveal that zzso can selectively suppress zzso zzso and zzso protein expression positively zzso with increased zzso protein level and enhances zzso zzso ability in zzso zzso We also found that zzso strongly zzso zzso cell colony formation, while zzso zzso enhances zzso activity and zzso cell colony zzso Together our results suggest that zzso may suppress prostate cancer cell growth by zzso zzso zzso and/or enhancing zzso zzso
