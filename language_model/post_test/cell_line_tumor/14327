The development of effective cancer therapy will require the simultaneous targeting of multiple steps in tumor zzso We have previously described an zzso gene therapy zzso Ad zzso which expresses a soluble zzso zzso capable of zzso tumor zzso and zzso We have also described an zzso virus, zzso whose replication and subsequent zzso are restricted to cancer cells with a loss of the zzso cell cycle zzso Here we have zzso methods for combining these therapies, yielding significantly greater zzso effects than the respective zzso In cultured tumor lines, zzso with both Ad zzso and zzso allowed replication and zzso of the zzso Ad zzso and enhanced soluble zzso zzso zzso Similar zzso and increased gene expression were demonstrated in zzso using zzso imaging zzso Finally, zzso of these therapeutic viral therapies in zzso produced significantly enhanced zzso effects in colon zzso 116 and prostate zzso zzso in zzso This increased therapeutic benefit correlated with replication of Ad zzso viral zzso increased zzso levels of zzso zzso and decreased zzso density, consistent with enhanced zzso zzso
