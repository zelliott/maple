zzso expression of regulators for zzso is involved in zzso There is an urgent need to identify and characterize regulators concerned with zzso in the early stages of zzso In the present study, we found that the expression of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso a zzso zzso that functions as a zzso for nuclear hormone receptors and several zzso factors, was elevated in zzso and zzso in zzso during zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso zzso of liver sections revealed that zzso was highly expressed in the nucleus of tumor marker zzso zzso zzso form zzso zzso zzso transformation of zzso zzso guides the formation of zzso zzso zzso expression was not elevated in zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso reporter analysis revealed that zzso activated the zzso promoter in zzso a zzso zzso cell zzso This zzso was zzso by the zzso element responsible for the zzso expression of zzso and nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso in zzso cells inhibited cell zzso These findings suggest that zzso expressed zzso in tumor zzso cells promotes zzso in the early stages of zzso
