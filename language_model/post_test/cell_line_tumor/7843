zzso zzso depends on zzso checkpoint systems that ensure correct zzso and spatial coordination of zzso segregation by the zzso zzso zzso zzso in these checkpoint systems can lead to zzso instability, an important aspect of zzso Here we show that the von zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso in zzso and sporadic forms of zzso cell zzso zzso to the zzso zzso in zzso cells and its functional zzso provokes zzso zzso zzso checkpoint weakening and zzso zzso zzso zzso is linked to unstable astral zzso and is zzso by the restoration of zzso zzso in zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso disease zzso that are defective in zzso zzso zzso zzso checkpoint function and zzso instability are the result of reduced zzso zzso arrest deficient 2) levels zzso by zzso and are rescued by zzso of either zzso or zzso in zzso zzso An association between zzso zzso reduced zzso levels and increased zzso was also found in human zzso cancer, zzso that the newly identified functions of zzso in promoting proper zzso orientation and zzso stability probably contribute to zzso zzso
