zzso zzso line) and zzso zzso line) cells provide a model for the study of zzso the induction of which is often accompanied by zzso zzso of proteins involved in zzso zzso One of these proteins is zzso zzso zzso which is responsible for zzso zzso and zzso A number of recent reports also suggest involvement of zzso maturation and stability in the induction of specific pathways of cell zzso In this study we identified zzso activity levels and zzso zzso in two different cell lines zzso and zzso and related them to DNA fragmentation (a hallmark of zzso and cell cycle phase specificity in terms of the zzso sequence of events and the time that elapsed between administration of the zzso zzso (the widely used zzso drug zzso and the observed zzso Treatment of both cell lines with 20 zzso zzso induced zzso after four hours in zzso cells and only after 24 hours in zzso cells, as revealed by two independent zzso In zzso cells the zzso activity levels and zzso were zzso prior to zzso reduction, DNA fragmentation and the zzso changes of the nucleus, whereas in zzso cells no zzso activity and zzso zzso were observed prior to the early hallmarks of zzso
