zzso three-dimensional systems are desirable in the field of high zzso screening zzso due to their potential similarity to in zzso zzso We have used zzso human zzso cells cultured in 3-D collagen zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to assess the merit of the system as a functional, zzso zzso Our results show differences between zzso and 3-D resting membrane potential development profile upon zzso There was no statistically significant difference in zzso proliferation rate between zzso zzso and 3-D collagen culture zzso A large percentage of cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not develop resting membrane potential value equal to or lower than zzso zzso instead cells exhibited a zzso resting membrane potential zzso In response to high zzso zzso zzso zzso 3-D cells were less responsive in terms of increase in zzso zzso in comparison to zzso cells, supporting the hypothesis that zzso cell calcium dynamics may be zzso zzso zzso expression levels based on zzso results was inconsistent with Bay K zzso channel zzso results, strongly suggesting that either the majority of the channels were zzso or could not be activated by Bay K zzso In general, the results in this study confirm the zzso differences in zzso calcium release when cultured using a zzso versus a 3-D zzso
