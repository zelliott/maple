To study the effects of zzso zzso a compound traditional Chinese herbal medicine, on proliferation of lung zzso cell line zzso cells and their production of zzso zzso and zzso induced by tumor necrosis zzso zzso 

zzso cells were incubated with rat serum containing zzso zzso at zzso for 24, 48 and 72 h zzso The cell proliferation was examined by zzso zzso zzso salt zzso zzso The production of zzso and zzso was tested by zzso zzso zzso after zzso treatment of zzso and the expressions of zzso and zzso zzso were detected by reverse zzso chain zzso 

zzso containing zzso zzso had obvious zzso functions in zzso cell proliferation after zzso and zzso zzso (1 zzso strongly induced the production of zzso and zzso as compared with the control serum in zzso cells, and the induced zzso production was significantly suppressed by zzso serum containing zzso zzso ( zzso In addition, serum containing zzso zzso could inhibit the zzso expressions of zzso and zzso ( zzso 

zzso zzso can inhibit zzso and zzso production induced by zzso It is therefore expected to be a new strategy for treating lung zzso
