The zzso gene encodes a zzso protein to prevent zzso Although there have been many reports of the nuclear functions of zzso little is known about the zzso functions of zzso Here, we found that zzso is present in zzso as well as zzso under zzso conditions and binds to zzso heavy chain zzso zzso is known to play a role in zzso zzso Based on our findings, we examined the effect of zzso on zzso zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso with zzso at the plasma membrane in response to zzso zzso In cells with zzso zzso expression by zzso zzso zzso was delayed and zzso signaling from zzso was zzso Thus, our findings provide evidence that zzso zzso may participate in the regulation of zzso zzso to control the correct signaling from zzso
