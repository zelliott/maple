zzso zzso is a zzso zzso extracted from zzso zzso zzso zzso is reported to inhibit drug resistance by zzso zzso a drug zzso zzso and recently to induce zzso In the present study, we examined the effects of zzso as an inhibitor of zzso zzso resistance on zzso zzso and zzso First, we established zzso zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells showed a higher level of zzso zzso zzso activity than parent zzso zzso was zzso in resistant zzso The zzso zzso level of resistant cells was lower than that of parent zzso One zzso zzso zzso eliminated the degradation of zzso zzso of resistant zzso that is, to a level equivalent to that of the parent zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso which was not zzso when used alone, significantly increased the zzso sensitivity of resistant cells, to a level similar to the parent cell zzso zzso zzso a potential zzso zzso agent, combined with zzso further increased the zzso sensitivity of resistant cells, indicating a synergistic effect of zzso and zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso microscopic observation revealed that zzso zzso induced zzso much more than necrosis for both parent and resistant cells, and that the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso accelerated zzso in resistant zzso Finally, we clarified the property by which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This property might be a new mechanism that explains how zzso overcomes zzso zzso
