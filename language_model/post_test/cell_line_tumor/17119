zzso is a cellular zzso DNA zzso that serves to maintain the tandem zzso of zzso zzso repeats at zzso zzso zzso One of the human zzso components is zzso which has three alternative spliced sites that introduce eight zzso of zzso zzso The expression of these zzso in gastrointestinal cell lines is zzso We developed a zzso zzso for detecting these zzso zzso In gastric and zzso zzso cell lines, the gamma deletion zzso and its combination zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso were frequently zzso while they were not detected in zzso zzso cell zzso Our results provide important information of use for more detailed studies on the regulation of zzso zzso
