A series of zzso complexes of the general formula of zzso (where R zzso zzso zzso zzso 2-6, 8) were zzso and characterized using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis, mass zzso and differential scanning zzso zzso The in zzso zzso activities of these compounds were evaluated against human cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using the zzso cell proliferation zzso Several zzso coordination compounds were found to have greatly enhanced activity compared to zzso after a one hour treatment in all cell lines zzso A zzso relationship was observed, that is, the activity increases as the carbon chain length of the zzso group zzso The activity was maximum when the carbon chain length reached four or five zzso and decreased with the longer carbon chain zzso Fluorescence zzso and flow zzso data indicate that the main mode of cell death is through zzso with some zzso zzso
