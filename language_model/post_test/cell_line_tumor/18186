zzso zzso has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso 2 in work from this zzso zzso results in decreased salvage of zzso to zzso which may lead to depletion of the zzso pool and result in the zzso dysfunction and zzso depletion observed with zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso zzso in growing cells expressing zzso zzso 1 has not been zzso Three cell lines were used in these zzso zzso derived from rat zzso zzso derived from human zzso and zzso derived from human zzso zzso inhibited growth in a zzso manner in zzso cells, but not the other cell zzso The zzso of zzso or zzso was determined during log zzso All cell lines salvaged and zzso zzso to zzso with zzso the major zzso The zzso cells had a much more active salvage zzso than the other zzso All cell lines zzso zzso to the zzso but the major product was zzso The zzso zzso of growth of the zzso cells did not correlate with levels of the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was shown to inhibit zzso zzso in all lines with 50% zzso zzso zzso ranging from zzso to zzso Since the zzso cells expressed higher activity of the salvage zzso than the other cell lines, the zzso cells may rely more heavily on the salvage zzso for zzso zzso accounting for zzso zzso of zzso
