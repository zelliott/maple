zzso zzso acid zzso represents the therapy of choice for patients with acute zzso leukemia zzso However, patients often zzso due to zzso The molecular basis of zzso zzso indicates that addition of a zzso zzso inhibitor to zzso may restore the sensitivity to zzso We explored the in zzso and in zzso effects of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso on a zzso acid zzso human zzso cell line, zzso and on its zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso induced growth arrest and terminal differentiation in zzso zzso cells (as confirmed by an increased expression of zzso family members and zzso zzso zzso whereas it inhibited the growth of zzso cells by zzso paralleled by an increase in the levels of zzso 3 and zzso In zzso zzso treatment of zzso severe combined zzso mice resulted in a statistically significant increase in survival time ( zzso comparable to that induced by a maximum tolerated dose of zzso zzso Also on zzso mice, zzso was active in contrast to zzso that was completely zzso Present findings suggest that, zzso to the simultaneous presence of zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso might be useful in controlling the proliferation of zzso cells and the differentiation of zzso zzso
