zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are active in cancer zzso zzso engaged during these clinical responses need to be zzso We reported previously that zzso growth factor stimulation markedly increased zzso D1 protein expression in human zzso zzso zzso cells, and this was opposed by zzso with zzso zzso The current study sought to determine whether the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso D1 protein expression in immortalized zzso cells, lung cancer cell lines, and clinical zzso tract zzso 

The zzso immortalized zzso cell line was exposed to varying zzso of zzso and effects on zzso cell cycle distribution, zzso zzso zzso and zzso D1 reporter activity were zzso zzso lung cancer cell lines were also evaluated for changes in proliferation and zzso protein expression after zzso zzso A proof of principle clinical trial was zzso During this study, patients underwent a zzso course of zzso zzso zzso and zzso tumor zzso were zzso and changes in candidate zzso were determined by zzso Plasma zzso and tumor tissue zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso at clinically achievable zzso zzso zzso cell growth, triggered zzso arrest, and zzso reduced zzso D1 protein expression and zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso proliferation and zzso D1 protein expression in responsive, but not zzso zzso lung cancer cell zzso This occurred in the presence of zzso zzso sequence at zzso 18, 19, and zzso Five patients were enrolled onto an zzso proof of principle clinical trial, and four cases were zzso zzso studies established therapeutic zzso plasma levels in all patients, but tissue levels exceeding 2 zzso were detected in only two zzso zzso these cases had pathological evidence of response zzso in zzso zzso as compared with zzso zzso In these cases, marked repression of zzso D1 and the proliferation marker zzso was detected by zzso zzso Cases without pathological response to zzso did not exhibit changes in zzso D1 or zzso zzso expression and had much lower zzso tissue levels than did responding zzso 

Taken together, these in zzso and in zzso findings provide direct evidence for repression of zzso D1 protein as a surrogate marker of response in zzso tract zzso to zzso zzso These findings also provide a rationale for combining an zzso zzso with an agent that would zzso repress zzso D1 expression in clinical trials for zzso tract cancer therapy or zzso
