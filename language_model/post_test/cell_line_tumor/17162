A diet low in copper results in increased levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso a critical zzso zzso zzso protection against zzso stress, in rat liver zzso The mechanism for this was investigated using cultured zzso cells, a human zzso zzso zzso zzso activity increased zzso during incubation in a medium supplemented with zzso fetal bovine serum, with a corresponding zzso of its zzso zzso Metal depletion also decreased zzso and zzso zzso levels to zzso zzso of zzso When zinc zzso were added to the medium at zzso levels, zzso zzso was zzso however, copper zzso had essentially no effect on zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso status was shifted to a more oxidized state by metal zzso we examined the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso factor that plays a primary role in zzso zzso A gel shift zzso indicated that the zzso activity of zzso was increased in cells maintained in zzso culture, suggesting the involvement of the zzso function of zzso in this zzso This was further supported by the observation that zzso suppressed both the zzso activity of zzso and the induction of zzso zzso in cells cultivated under zzso zzso These results suggest that the level of zzso rather than copper, is a critical regulatory factor in zzso zzso It is possible that a zzso of zinc in the zzso diet may be primarily involved in zzso zzso
