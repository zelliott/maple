In the last decades, free radical processes delineated an interdisciplinary field linking chemistry to biology and zzso Free radical mechanisms became of importance as molecular basis of zzso and pathological zzso zzso in particular, zzso fatty zzso are susceptible of free radical zzso The zzso of the double bond toward free zzso is well known, in particular the zzso addition of radical species to this functionality determines the zzso double bond zzso Since the prevalent geometry displayed by zzso fatty acids in zzso is zzso the occurrence of the zzso zzso by free zzso zzso to the loss of an important structural information linked to biological zzso The formation of trans zzso can have important meaning and consequences connected to radical zzso Free radical zzso of membrane fatty acids has been the subject of research zzso the zzso approach by model studies, such as zzso chemistry in zzso with the bottom-up approach dealing with the examination of cell membrane zzso in living systems under several zzso zzso zzso and molecular libraries have been zzso for both zzso experiments and the examination of the radical stress in biological zzso This chapter will give an overview of the current procedures used for zzso models and the zzso zzso experiments, in order to zzso a library of trans geometrical fatty acid zzso
