zzso of zzso of zzso zzso 2 zzso an zzso zzso occurs in various zzso and is associated with poor zzso however, the functional role of zzso zzso in cancer versus zzso tissue remains zzso In this study, we found an inverse correlation between zzso and zzso gene expression in gastric cancer zzso zzso of zzso by short interfering zzso in gastric cancer cells resulted in a restoration of the zzso zzso We showed that the zzso complex existed with zzso zzso and zzso which were zzso on zzso promoter regions in gastric cancer zzso The restoration of zzso was not involved in the change of the DNA zzso status in the zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso confirmed the expression of zzso protein present in the cell membrane was restored after zzso of zzso resulting in changing the cancer zzso such as its invasive zzso In zzso the relationship of inverse expression between zzso protein and zzso protein was observed at the individual cellular level in gastric cancer zzso This study provides into the mechanisms underlying the functional role of zzso zzso in gastric cancer cells and a new zzso of regulation of zzso expression in zzso mechanisms of tumor zzso zzso Our present study zzso the way for exploring the blockade of zzso zzso as a novel approach to treating zzso
