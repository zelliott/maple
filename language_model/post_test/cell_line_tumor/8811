zzso cancer is a highly lethal disease with a poor zzso the molecular mechanisms of the development of this disease have not yet been fully zzso zzso downstream regulated gene 2 zzso one of the candidate tumor zzso zzso is frequently zzso in pancreatic cancer, but there has been little information regarding its expression in surgically zzso pancreatic cancer zzso We investigated an association between zzso expression and prognosis in 69 primary zzso pancreatic cancer specimens by zzso and observed a significant association between poor prognosis and zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso A, a zzso zzso zzso predominantly zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, no increased zzso expression was observed after treatment with zzso zzso a DNA zzso agent, and no zzso was detected in either pancreatic cancer cell lines or surgically zzso specimens by zzso specific zzso Our present results suggest that zzso zzso is functioning as one of the candidate zzso genes in pancreatic zzso zzso zzso mechanisms such as zzso modifications play an essential role in zzso zzso and zzso the expression of zzso is an independent zzso factor in pancreatic zzso
