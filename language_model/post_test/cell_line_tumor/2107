The DNA binding modes and zzso properties of novel zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes zzso depend on the lengths of their rigid bridging zzso zzso zzso zzso and strong DNA zzso properties were observed for the zzso zzso complexes 1 (B zzso zzso and 3 (B zzso zzso whose zzso zzso distances are about zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso and CD zzso were in accordance with a stable intertwined zzso mode for pairs of zzso of 5 (B zzso zzso whose much longer zzso distance of zzso zzso allows a stack of five aromatic zzso to be sandwiched between its effectively parallel zzso zzso Whereas both 1 and 3 zzso DNA in the dark, complex 5 exhibited only zzso zzso zzso A significantly higher zzso activity towards zzso breast zzso cells was observed for the zzso 1 and 3, whose zzso values of zzso and zzso were much lower than that of zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso only slightly higher than that of 5, were recorded for the zzso complexes 4 and 6, whose bridging zzso are identical to those of 3 and 5, zzso zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with increased levels of zzso oxygen species and zzso induction was recorded for both 3 and 5 towards zzso cells at zzso of 5 zzso and zzso Online studies with a sensor chip system indicated that 5 zzso solutions of these complexes invoke a rapid and massive reduction in zzso cell zzso
