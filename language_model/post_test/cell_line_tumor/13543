zzso zzso of Signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso signaling is frequently detected in breast and pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling represents a promising molecular target for therapeutic zzso Using zzso design, we developed a zzso zzso small zzso termed as zzso which targeted zzso zzso zzso was found to inhibit zzso zzso zzso and induce zzso in human breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines expressing elevated levels of zzso zzso zzso could also inhibit zzso zzso zzso in cancer cell lines expressing low zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling by zzso was confirmed by the zzso of downstream targets of zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso at zzso zzso In addition, zzso inhibited colony formation, cell migration, and enhanced the zzso of zzso drugs when combined with zzso or zzso Our results indicate that zzso may be a potential therapeutic agent for breast and pancreatic zzso with zzso zzso zzso
