Diabetes and obesity are associated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso however a direct link between zzso stress and increased zzso zzso remains zzso Here we show that zzso stress triggers a significant increase in expression of zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso together with reduced zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso stress contributed to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter in zzso and zzso cells via zzso binding motif zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso is recruited to the zzso promoter during zzso stress and is reversed by zzso with a zzso inhibitor that zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso was suppressed by the zzso zzso or zzso active zzso while dominant negative zzso increased zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso stress triggers suppression of zzso while increasing zzso and zzso expression which activates zzso gene zzso zzso how zzso stress suppresses zzso zzso and increases zzso expression could lead to a potentially novel zzso for treatment of zzso
