In the zzso treatment of patients with zzso zzso zzso resistance zzso is a major zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso of zzso zzso cassette (ABC) zzso was demonstrated to be associated with zzso forms of zzso zzso of cancer zzso To overcome the zzso zzso two specific zzso small interfering zzso zzso were designed for transient triggering of the zzso zzso interference zzso zzso in the human gastric zzso cell line zzso exhibiting an zzso zzso zzso Because both zzso showed biological activity, for stable zzso of zzso corresponding short hairpin zzso zzso expression zzso were zzso By treatment of zzso cells with these zzso expression of the targeted zzso zzso and transport protein was inhibited zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso cells increased cellular drug zzso to the same level measured in zzso parental zzso These effects were accompanied by complete reversal of the drug-resistant zzso Thus, the data indicate that zzso and zzso zzso gene therapy may be zzso in preventing and reversing zzso zzso zzso
