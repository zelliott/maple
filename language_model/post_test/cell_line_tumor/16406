To investigate the expression of a novel zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and explore its biological zzso 

The zzso zzso levels were analyzed by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso in 23 specimens of zzso zzso and 20 specimens of control zzso zzso The expression of zzso in these specimens was detected by real-time zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the expression of zzso in zzso cancer zzso cells was determined by zzso zzso zzso and protein level of zzso cells was compared in the two groups treated by zzso and zzso at 24 zzso 48 h and 72 zzso zzso Furthermore, the expression of zzso was analyzed in liner concentration range of the zzso drug, and the potential relation between zzso expression and cell zzso rate was zzso 

The level of zzso zzso was significantly higher in zzso cancer zzso than those of control zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso in zzso cancer zzso with a positive rate of zzso zzso than that in the control zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso The expression of zzso was markedly decreased by treatment with zzso and zzso and there was a direct correlation between zzso expression and zzso rate, especially in a liner concentration range of zzso at 48 zzso 

zzso is highly expressed in zzso cancer cells and zzso and it may be a promising zzso for diagnosis and a new target for zzso cancer zzso
