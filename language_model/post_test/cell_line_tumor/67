To investigate whether zzso zzso T zzso zzso could be induced by zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso gene by zzso zzso and whether these zzso would display zzso activities against human zzso cancer cell zzso zzso a member of the inhibitor of zzso protein family, is expressed in most zzso but not in normal zzso 

zzso zzso zzso the human zzso gene was zzso Human zzso from healthy donors were zzso with human zzso gene by infection with zzso zzso zzso the human zzso gene using the zzso zzso zzso zzso were induced from zzso peripheral blood zzso cells by zzso zzso with the zzso zzso The ability of zzso to lyse cancer cell lines was assessed using the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso with zzso gene could induce zzso zzso against various zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and prostate cancer zzso This zzso activity could be blocked by zzso and zzso zzso complex class I zzso We also found that this zzso activity was specific for the zzso protein and human zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso with the zzso gene induced potent zzso zzso responses in zzso This suggests that cancer zzso targets for zzso might offer a novel approach to treating various zzso zzso
