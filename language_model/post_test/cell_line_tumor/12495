zzso is an essential zzso factor for the commitment of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso suppression results in zzso of B zzso to an zzso zzso cell stage, whereas zzso suppression in mature B zzso leads to further development into plasma zzso Here, we have analyzed the fate of plasma cell lines following zzso zzso Human B cell lines were infected with zzso zzso zzso either zzso or zzso zzso analysis of specific plasma cell zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso suggests that zzso zzso does not induce zzso of plasma cells into B zzso Interestingly, the viability of zzso and zzso multiple myeloma cell lines markedly declined at zzso days zzso whereas other plasma cell lines maintained their zzso zzso analysis through zzso V measurement also revealed a higher level of zzso in zzso myeloma cell zzso Finally, Western zzso analysis of zzso and zzso proteins revealed that the zzso protein zzso was zzso in zzso multiple myeloma cell zzso In conclusion, our results show that the expression of zzso in plasma cell lines zzso zzso exclusively in multiple zzso This might represent a potential therapeutic avenue in the treatment of multiple zzso
