zzso cancer zzso is a major cause of morbidity and mortality for cancer worldwide, but many patients with zzso are resistant to zzso We therefore investigated the therapeutic mechanism and clinical effect of combined chemotherapy of zzso zzso with zzso zzso on zzso zzso represents a potential zzso agent of Chinese zzso Mice carrying the zzso human zzso zzso cells were injected into zzso cavities with different drugs: zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Treatment of mice with OH caused the decrease in the volume of tumor and the expression of zzso but increased the zzso rate and zzso zzso compared to those of animals treated with zzso or zzso or control zzso Thus, the combination of zzso with zzso could more effectively induce the zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, 56 patients with zzso were treated with zzso and zzso zzso cases, OH zzso or zzso plus zzso plus zzso zzso cases, zzso group), then reviewed the response rate, survival rate and zzso The one-year survival rate was zzso in OH group and zzso in zzso zzso However, the occurrence of anemia zzso or zzso zzso was higher in OH group than that of zzso or zzso in zzso zzso The clinical results suggest that zzso plus zzso combined chemotherapy could increase the survival time of zzso Taken together, the present study indicates that the combined chemotherapy of zzso with zzso could become a new zzso treatment for zzso
