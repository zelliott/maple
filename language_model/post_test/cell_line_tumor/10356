The zzso zzso factor is the key regulator of zzso development during zzso and is also frequently found in melanoma zzso While zzso is known to regulate zzso zzso survival, proliferation and migration during development, it is not clear if its function is maintained in adult zzso and melanoma zzso To clarify this we have assessed which genes are targeted by zzso in these zzso We show here that similar to its roles in development, zzso regulates complex differentiation networks in both melanoma cells and zzso in order to maintain cells as zzso zzso (via zzso and zzso We show also that zzso of migration zzso and zzso are common to both cell types but more so in melanoma zzso By contrast, zzso regulation of melanoma cell proliferation (through zzso and survival (via zzso and zzso differs from that in zzso These results suggest that by controlling cell zzso survival and migration as well as maintaining a less differentiated zzso cell like zzso zzso may contribute to melanoma development and zzso
