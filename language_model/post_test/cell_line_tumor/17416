zzso proteins can act as effective zzso zzso zzso with tumor zzso protein zzso to the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso protects mice from tumor challenge with the zzso T cell zzso zzso The immune mechanisms responsible for this tumor protection are of interest for designing more effective vaccine zzso Previous studies using depletion experiments had suggested a zzso component of protection induced by zzso zzso In this study we used zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso knockout mice to investigate the relative roles of zzso T cells and zzso in protective immunity induced by zzso zzso We found that zzso T cells are not required for tumor protection, although they may contribute to zzso zzso zzso are sufficient to mediate protection against this zzso T cell zzso through an zzso zzso This was confirmed with zzso zzso which protect challenged zzso Additionally, zzso gene zzso zzso can mediate zzso cellular zzso against this tumor in the presence of bound zzso zzso zzso knockout mice demonstrated a requirement for zzso probably via generation of zzso zzso in zzso tumor zzso zzso knockout mice were not protected by zzso and had a severe impairment in zzso zzso production in response to zzso Although zzso zzso zzso could transfer tumor protection, zzso zzso zzso were unable to transfer tumor protection to zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso tumor protection in the zzso system is primarily attributable to the induction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
