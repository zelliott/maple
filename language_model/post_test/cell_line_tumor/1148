The effectiveness of zzso zzso tumor vaccines in the treatment of mouse tumors could be enhanced by concurrent application of zzso and zzso zzso We investigated the therapeutic potential of zzso zzso melanoma vaccine in combination with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso known to favor development of zzso immune response, in a zzso zzso melanoma model in zzso 

Mice injected with zzso melanoma cells were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso responsible for the zzso effects of the treatment were investigated using zzso cell zzso analysis, a standard zzso releasing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

Single injection of zzso cells had no effect on tumor growth, whereas seven consecutive daily injections of zzso zzso markedly inhibited tumor progression with occasional zzso zzso When used in zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso caused additional tumor growth reduction and zzso of tumors in zzso of treated zzso The combined treatment activated local inflammatory response against tumor but also induced systemic zzso zzso In zzso studies have shown that when used together, zzso cells and zzso zzso induced a potent zzso response and suggested the role of zzso in zzso of the host immune zzso The zzso effects in zzso mice were accompanied by the development of zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso of zzso 

The results provided the evidence that the combination of zzso zzso melanoma vaccine and zzso zzso zzso zzso systemic and local zzso zzso
