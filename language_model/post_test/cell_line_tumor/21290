zzso zzso zzso is a zzso of the head and neck region that is associated with zzso zzso zzso treatments for zzso achieve modest survival rates, zzso a need to develop novel zzso We evaluated the therapeutic potential of a zzso zzso zzso virus zzso as single treatment zzso or in combination with zzso radiation zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso was used to assess cell viability in zzso zzso was measured using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso experiments were conducted using zzso nude mice with or without local zzso (4 zzso zzso was assessed in excised tumor sections with terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso 

Our data showed that zzso cells are exquisitely sensitive to zzso zzso which correlated with the presence of zzso zzso of zzso against zzso cells was further zzso when combined with zzso A single systemic injection of zzso achieved 50% survival in treated mice, which increased to zzso when combined with local tumor zzso In addition to induction of zzso an zzso effect of zzso was observed in zzso suggesting a novel zzso mechanism for zzso This virus also prevented growth of zzso zzso cells in zzso showing potential utility in targeting zzso zzso 

Our data represent the first report showing that zzso zzso cells are exquisitely sensitive to zzso zzso and documenting the successful zzso of this zzso regimen as a novel zzso therapeutic strategy for zzso
