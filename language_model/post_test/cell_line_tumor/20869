zzso zzso zzso is a DNA repair protein that removes zzso from the zzso in DNA and is a crucial defense against zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated here that two zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso were more sensitive to zzso zzso than their parental zzso zzso sensitivity to zzso in these two zzso cells involved zzso repression of the zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso gene zzso in zzso cells was not through gene zzso zzso stability, and zzso island zzso However, the high level of zzso protein 2 zzso and zzso of zzso in the promoter region were found in zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, increased zzso binding on zzso promoter was also found to be correlated with zzso zzso in short-term zzso zzso thus, enhanced zzso sensitivity was found in zzso zzso Taken together, we suggest that zzso is able to suppress the zzso of the zzso gene through recruiting of zzso and zzso zzso thus causing a synergistic interaction with zzso These findings provide a possible explanation regarding why the combination of zzso and zzso results in a better objective response than zzso zzso In addition, this study supports a new indication for treating patients who are receiving zzso zzso derivatives with zzso
