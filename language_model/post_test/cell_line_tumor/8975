An in zzso zzso zzso using zzso human zzso cells is a useful tool for the fast identification of compounds that affect the production of testosterone and zzso Selective and sensitive hormone measurement by liquid zzso mass zzso zzso can make this zzso more zzso zzso in the present study, a sensitive and selective method for the zzso of testosterone and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso was developed and fully validated using zzso coupled with an online sample enrichment zzso To prove its zzso the method developed was applied to investigate the effect of zzso on zzso Cell medium samples were diluted and prepared using zzso zzso The samples were prepared on ice and were not kept for more than 30 zzso to prevent degradation of zzso The extracts were dried, zzso zzso and analyzed by zzso with polarity switching zzso zzso The validation results for zzso zzso effect, recovery, zzso precision, and accuracy were zzso The limits of detection for testosterone and zzso were 5 and 10 zzso respectively, and the limit of zzso for both testosterone and zzso was 10 zzso which was in accordance with the zzso zzso No degradation was observed under the storage conditions for 7 and 14 days at zzso zzso as well as after three zzso cycles, whereas zzso was zzso after 1 h on ice during sample zzso The method developed was successfully used for the investigation of the effect of zzso on zzso This method can be very useful for the initial selection of drugs with zzso and/or zzso effects for specific purposes, zzso in the selection of drugs that are used to reverse the effects of chemical zzso
