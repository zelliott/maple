The zzso properties of soybean zzso were investigated by evaluating zzso zzso zzso and zzso production in zzso zzso The zzso expression levels of zzso and zzso were determined by zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso zzso and tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso were determined by gelatin zzso and/or zzso The invasion of a zzso membrane by human zzso zzso and zzso colon cancer cells was zzso assessed by counting the migrated zzso The treatment of zzso cells with soybean zzso inhibited the zzso expression of and reduced the amounts of zzso zzso and zzso whereas it increased the amount of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited the invasion of zzso cells through a zzso zzso The zzso properties by soybean zzso were further confirmed by in zzso mice experiment via the tail vein injection of zzso colon cancer cells after feeding the mice the dietary soybean zzso The zzso of zzso tumor colonization of lungs of mice moderately decreased 2 weeks after the tail vein injection of zzso zzso Our current data support the notion that soybean zzso zzso tumor cell zzso by suppressing zzso and zzso zzso and stimulating zzso zzso thereby suggesting that soybean zzso has a zzso property against cancer zzso
