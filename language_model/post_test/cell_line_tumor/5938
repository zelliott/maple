Cancer cells are defined by their ability to invade through the basement zzso a critical step during zzso While increased zzso of zzso which zzso degradation of the basement zzso and zzso in the zzso architecture of cancer cells have been previously zzso the contribution of the mechanical properties of cells in invasion is zzso Here, we applied a magnetic zzso system to establish that zzso of patient tumor cells and cancer cell lines zzso zzso with migration and invasion through three-dimensional basement zzso a correlation known as a power zzso We found that cancer cells with the highest migratory and invasive potential are five times less stiff than cells with the lowest migration and invasion zzso Moreover, decreasing cell zzso by zzso zzso of zzso II increases zzso whereas increasing cell zzso by restoring expression of the zzso zzso zzso decreases zzso These findings are the first demonstration of the zzso relation between the zzso and the zzso of cancer cells and show that mechanical zzso can be used to grade the zzso potential of cell populations with the potential for single cell zzso The measurement of a mechanical zzso taking minutes rather than hours needed for invasion zzso is promising as a quantitative diagnostic method and as a discovery tool for zzso By showing that altering zzso predictably alters zzso our results indicate that pathways regulating these mechanical zzso are novel targets for molecular therapy of zzso
