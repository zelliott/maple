zzso zzso factor zzso zzso is a zzso zzso inhibitor that may suppress tumor cell invasion and zzso zzso expression is often lost in cells derived from tumors of diverse zzso We have examined whether zzso zzso of the zzso end of the zzso gene is associated with its loss of zzso After zzso treatment of three cell lines lacking zzso expression zzso zzso cells, zzso breast zzso cells, and zzso prostate zzso zzso zzso transcripts could be detected by zzso In these three cell lines, zzso of the zzso end of the zzso gene was zzso while two prostate zzso cell lines in which the zzso gene was zzso zzso and zzso showed no zzso However, all the three cell lines which lacked zzso expression also contained zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso zzso promoter was zzso in the three cell lines, but function was attained following treatment with zzso Our results indicate that while zzso of the zzso gene is associated with its zzso it is not the sole cause, and we suggest that one or more components of pathways regulating zzso expression have also undergone zzso zzso in these cell zzso
