zzso zzso zzso zzso are the largest extant zzso zzso This species, now confined to zzso is endangered from the emergence of a zzso cancer, devil facial tumor disease zzso In the present study, we use zzso and molecular techniques to examine the stability of devil facial tumor zzso cell lines across time and zzso This article describes disease progression from February 2004 to June zzso We demonstrate evolutionary changes in the disease, which affects zzso in different sites across zzso and over a period of several years, producing several zzso zzso zzso that are capable of transmission between zzso We describe the evolution of zzso in the field and speculate on the possible impacts on the disease, including zzso development of less aggressive forms of the zzso zzso of more aggressive forms of the zzso zzso development of forms capable of affecting closely related species of zzso zzso zzso zzso extinction of the disease as it acquires additional deleterious zzso that affect either cell viability or zzso and zzso zzso of the disease and the zzso We also speculate about the future of the zzso devil in the zzso We note that although zzso are regarded as unstable by comparison with another much older zzso cancer, canine zzso zzso tumor zzso the potential for development of less aggressive forms of zzso or for development of resistance in zzso is limited by zzso small numbers, low genetic diversity, and restricted geographical zzso
