zzso a zzso zzso makes crucial contributions to zzso egg fusion, other cellular zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso cell zzso and tumor zzso Here we characterize a low affinity zzso zzso zzso which binds zzso to zzso zzso Using zzso zzso as a zzso we show that cell surface zzso zzso is promoted by expression of zzso and zzso zzso and by zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is shifted toward zzso upon expression of zzso partner proteins zzso and zzso or other zzso or upon zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso showed enhanced zzso association, thereby demonstrating a previously unappreciated role for zzso zzso and zzso how zzso and zzso association may collaborate to shift zzso from zzso to zzso In conclusion, we have used a novel molecular probe zzso zzso to demonstrate the existence of multiple types of zzso complex on the cell zzso A shift from zzso to zzso zzso may be functionally significant because the latter was especially obvious on zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso because of its specialized properties, zzso may be more useful than other zzso zzso for monitoring zzso during tumor zzso
