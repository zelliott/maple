zzso are sulfur containing highly modified zzso antibiotics with a central zzso ring with up to three zzso zzso on positions 2, 3 and zzso zzso antibiotics with central zzso nucleus have a zzso loop connecting zzso rings at position 2 and 3 described as ring zzso In addition antibiotics with central zzso nucleus have a zzso acid zzso also connected to zzso on position 2 described as ring zzso We have demonstrated before that zzso antibiotics zzso and zzso A act as zzso zzso in zzso tumor zzso Here we decided to test whether other known zzso antibiotics such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso acid ring zzso demonstrate this zzso We found that none of them act as zzso zzso Moreover, structural modification of zzso to zzso zzso zzso (with open B zzso also did not demonstrate this zzso These data suggest that B ring of zzso and zzso A that is absent in other zzso antibiotics determines the zzso zzso activity of these zzso
