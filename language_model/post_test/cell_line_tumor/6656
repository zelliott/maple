In recent years, zzso has received considerable attention because zzso studies showed that consumption of zzso diets was associated with a lower zzso of certain human zzso in Asian zzso In zzso studies further showed that such zzso and zzso effects were associated with the zzso activity of zzso and inhibitor activities on cell proliferation and zzso zzso was shown to arrest the growth of zzso melanoma in zzso and to inhibit ultraviolet zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso Recently, it has been demonstrated that zzso as other zzso zzso is partly absorbed without previous zzso and does not have to be zzso to be biologically zzso zzso not only zzso zzso but also zzso can be of zzso zzso In the present study, we evaluated in zzso systems the effect of zzso and zzso on zzso DNA zzso induced by zzso zzso generated from zzso zzso of hydrogen zzso and their zzso zzso scavenging zzso In addition, we investigated the growth zzso activity of these zzso against human melanoma cell line zzso Under our experimental conditions, zzso and zzso showed a protective effect on DNA damage and exhibited a zzso zzso effect, but only zzso was able to reduce significantly the vitality of zzso cells, confirming the importance of the zzso structure in the A zzso These results suggest that also zzso due to its zzso and zzso properties, contributes to the overall biological activity of soy and could have promising applications in the field of zzso
