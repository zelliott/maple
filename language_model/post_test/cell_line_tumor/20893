To investigate the effects of zzso zzso on the growth of breast zzso 

Forty female zzso zzso mice underwent subcutaneous injection of breast cancer cells of the line zzso zzso zzso zzso Ten days later when tumor zzso were formed, the mice were randomly divided into 4 equal groups to be administered with zzso of the zzso of 25 zzso 50 zzso 100 zzso and 200 zzso zzso d respectively by gastric zzso The tumor size was observed every 3 day till 3 weeks zzso Ten mice were used as normal control group, undergoing gastric zzso of vegetable zzso Parts of the animals were killed 2 weeks later, and the remaining mice were all killed 3 weeks zzso The tumors were taken out and underwent zzso to measure the protein expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was used to measure the zzso density zzso 

The growth zzso of tumor of the mice of zzso groups were all slower than that of the control group (all P zzso The zzso levels of the zzso groups all decreased zzso and zzso zzso showed that in the tumor zzso zzso was zzso pathological zzso was more zzso zzso ratio was greater, zzso was deep blue, zzso was zzso and zone of zzso necrosis became zzso in comparison with the control zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso groups were all significantly lower, time and zzso than those of the control group (all P zzso 

zzso zzso the growth of breast cancer by the mechanisms related to zzso promotion and zzso of zzso so it can be used in breast cancer zzso zzso
