The role of zzso zzso stress in the zzso and progression of chronic inflammatory airways diseases has received increasing attention in recent zzso Nuclear zzso 2 related factor 2 zzso is the primary zzso factor that regulates the expression of zzso and detoxifying zzso In this study, yellow zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso products, elevated nuclear zzso protein zzso in both the zzso lung cell line and the lungs of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, AK increased the zzso expression of zzso zzso regulated by zzso leading to a reduction in zzso airway zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Additionally, AK prevented zzso zzso and zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso generation in zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso molecules zzso zzso and zzso were substantially reduced by AK zzso zzso the zzso effect of AK on zzso zzso production and immune cell zzso was abolished by zzso small interfering zzso This is the first study to illustrate that AK acts as a novel zzso zzso for modulating the zzso stress zzso to improve the lung injury and zzso the development of airway zzso
