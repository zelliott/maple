The DNA repair protein zzso zzso zzso protects from toxicity and zzso incurred following zzso agents by removing zzso zzso Using zzso mice, we examined zzso role in protecting from in zzso zzso induced by three different zzso agents, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were determined in the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso from zzso mice zzso and zzso following zzso zzso or zzso Following zzso the zzso frequency was significantly greater in zzso mice zzso and zzso zzso zzso for 7 and 10 zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso mice zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso were not increased over vehicle in zzso zzso The zzso frequency of mice treated with zzso zzso zzso was the same regardless of zzso zzso Similarly, zzso of zzso mice with 30 zzso zzso a potent zzso of zzso prior to zzso (15 zzso did not result in significantly more zzso than mice treated with zzso zzso Following zzso zzso zzso significantly increased from zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice to zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice, although the difference in zzso compared with zzso was not zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso were not zzso in zzso and zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso significantly protects against in zzso zzso zzso and that zzso zzso does not result in greater zzso frequency following zzso or zzso compared with zzso zzso
