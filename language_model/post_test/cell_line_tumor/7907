DNA zzso contributes to zzso by zzso key tumor zzso zzso Here we report an zzso and reliable zzso zzso zzso for detection and zzso of DNA zzso zzso DNA is subjected to zzso amplification with zzso that would differentiate between zzso and zzso zzso zzso dots are then used to capture zzso zzso and determine the zzso status via zzso resonance energy transfer zzso Key features of zzso include its low intrinsic background noise, high resolution, and high zzso This approach detects as little as 15 zzso of zzso DNA in the presence of a zzso excess of zzso zzso enables reduced use of zzso (as low as eight zzso and allows for zzso zzso The high sensitivity of zzso enables zzso detection of zzso at zzso zzso and zzso genes in patient zzso samples that contain low zzso of zzso DNA, which normally would require a zzso zzso zzso The direct application of zzso on clinical samples offers great promise for its zzso use in early cancer diagnosis, zzso assessment of tumor behavior, as well as monitoring response to therapeutic zzso
