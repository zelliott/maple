zzso specific zzso 1 zzso has been identified and zzso characterized in zzso but the pathological roles of its dysfunction in lung cancer remain to be zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso significance of zzso expression in patients with zzso cell lung cancer zzso and to define its exact role in lung cancer zzso migration and zzso 

The protein levels of zzso in surgically zzso samples from zzso patients were detected by zzso or Western zzso The zzso levels of zzso were detected by zzso The correlation of zzso expression with clinical characteristics and prognosis was determined by statistical zzso Cell proliferation rate was assessed by zzso zzso and zzso Cell migration and invasion were detected by scratch test, zzso zzso and zzso invasion zzso 

zzso expression was higher in lung cancer tissue more than in normal lung zzso Our results showed that zzso of zzso protein were associated with shorter overall survival of zzso zzso zzso was localized mainly to the cancer cell zzso zzso of zzso using zzso or a chemical zzso zzso suppressed zzso migration and invasion of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Meanwhile, zzso of zzso enhanced cell zzso Finally, zzso was shown to regulate zzso transition in lung cancer zzso 

zzso of zzso was associated with poor prognosis in zzso and promoted tumor cell zzso migration and zzso These results suggest that zzso is a zzso factor with promising therapeutic potential for zzso
