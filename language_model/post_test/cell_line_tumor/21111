Cellular stress by DNA damage zzso checkpoint zzso zzso zzso and stabilization of the zzso zzso factor, leading to induction of zzso by zzso of a subset of zzso zzso target zzso including zzso and zzso This report characterizes an interaction between the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso factor, and zzso that results in the zzso of zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso expression zzso zzso of zzso expression causes a significant zzso of zzso stress, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which can be blocked by small interfering zzso zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso protects these cells from zzso cell zzso In cells expressing both zzso zzso and zzso interact independently of the zzso protein zzso because zzso and zzso zzso from extracts of zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso indicate that zzso and zzso bind to the zzso promoter at a region containing a consensus zzso binding site but no zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso induction by a zzso active zzso expression zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso blocks the zzso induction of zzso and zzso and the zzso of zzso cells resulting from zzso zzso of zzso These results point to a zzso zzso function of the zzso zzso that likely plays a role in tumor zzso
