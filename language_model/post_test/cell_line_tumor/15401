To examine the zzso activity of a new zzso of zzso called zzso zzso Cell viability was assessed using the zzso zzso and zzso cells and zzso oxygen species were evaluated using flow zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso activity against breast cancer cells and melanoma and to a lesser extent against zzso cancer zzso Interestingly, compared to zzso zzso a selective zzso against human cancer cells but not human normal zzso The potential of zzso to inhibit cellular growth in zzso breast cancer cells and zzso melanoma cells was largely due to induction of zzso zzso as confirmed by zzso zzso and zzso of its zzso zzso In addition, results indicated that zzso zzso is zzso by generation of zzso oxygen zzso These findings revealed that zzso has a selective zzso activity against cancer cells and warrants further clinical zzso
