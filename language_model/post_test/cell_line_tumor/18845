zzso identified as a zzso binding zzso zzso B zzso is an inflammatory zzso that zzso zzso of T zzso to zzso by a mechanism dependent on zzso and alpha 4 beta 1 zzso Recent findings have suggested that another cell membrane zzso zzso may cooperate with zzso to regulate zzso zzso zzso Based on these functional zzso we examined the contribution of zzso in the zzso activity of zzso by utilizing the responsive zzso cell line zzso We demonstrated that zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso the responses induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso with previous data, zzso confirmed the existence of a zzso wherein zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso We then demonstrated that zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso were dependent on the participation of zzso zzso and subsequent zzso of protein zzso zzso Finally, zzso the expression of zzso by zzso interference zzso reduced zzso cell responses, thus confirming the role of zzso in the zzso activity of zzso Altogether, our results support a model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso via interaction with a zzso unit formed by the association between zzso zzso and zzso zzso
