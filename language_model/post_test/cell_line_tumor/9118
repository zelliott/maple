To investigate the zzso activity and zzso effects of zzso on human zzso cell zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines were treated with zzso Cell viability was assessed using the zzso zzso zzso status, zzso effects, and the expression of zzso proteins were evaluated by flow zzso fluorescent zzso DNA fragmentation zzso and Western zzso The effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso expression was studied by zzso and Western zzso 

zzso inhibited cell growth in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso The induction of zzso zzso arrest was also seen in the cells treated with zzso The induction of zzso by zzso was confirmed by increased expression of the tumor zzso protein zzso and the increased ratio of the zzso zzso zzso induced zzso to the same extent in both cell lines without regard to zzso levels in the zzso 

zzso inhibited the growth of and induced zzso in both zzso and zzso human zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was not influenced by the presence of high levels of the zzso zzso
