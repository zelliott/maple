Many types of pulp and paper mill zzso have the ability to induce zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso protein in exposed male zzso The search for the compounds responsible for zzso induction has led to several classes of compounds, among them zzso and zzso The objective of this study was to investigate the biological activities of candidate zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were extracted from Scotch pine zzso zzso and zzso to evaluate their ability to induce zzso activity in zzso using zzso zzso activity in a rat zzso cell line zzso As these compounds may be zzso during pulp zzso zzso of zzso was zzso producing zzso and zzso zzso zzso which were also zzso zzso were tested for zzso ability in zzso by exposing juvenile rainbow tout zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso for 4 zzso zzso were also tested for their ability to induce zzso in trout primary liver cells in zzso The zzso were weak zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was induced by all four compounds, with the most potent induction by zzso followed by zzso the zzso mixture, and then zzso zzso for all four zzso was from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso as potent as zzso and about zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso as potent as zzso Juvenile rainbow trout did not show zzso induction after zzso to zzso zzso or the zzso mixture, whereas zzso caused activity fourfold above that of zzso zzso zzso and zzso all zzso induced zzso in rainbow trout zzso The most potent zzso of zzso was zzso followed by zzso and zzso The results show the ability of zzso zzso to cause weak zzso induction in fish and in rat liver cells and to zzso induce zzso in fish liver zzso
