zzso zzso cancer is the leading cause of death among zzso zzso zzso may increase the risk of zzso zzso and play an important role in zzso zzso Our previous studies showed that zzso increases the expression of zzso through zzso In this study, the function and mechanism of zzso in zzso cancer were further zzso We found that zzso promoted proliferation and prevented zzso of zzso cancer cells by zzso zzso through the zzso and zzso zzso zzso also zzso the expression of programmed cell death gene 6 zzso and death zzso 5 zzso two molecules required for induction of zzso zzso interference was applied to knock down zzso and zzso zzso and we found that the zzso of zzso reversed the effects of zzso on zzso and zzso whereas knock down of zzso enhanced these zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso E correlated with zzso zzso but zzso did zzso Using zzso zzso we further showed that zzso zzso zzso samples had higher expression of zzso than did benign zzso zzso and borderline zzso samples ( zzso Furthermore, zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso specimens was correlated with disease stage ( zzso Our results suggest that zzso promotes zzso cancer development by regulating the expression of zzso zzso and zzso Greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and development will ultimately help in the development of a novel targeted therapy for zzso zzso
