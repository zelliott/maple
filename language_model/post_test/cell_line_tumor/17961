While the zzso machinery has been extensively dissected at the molecular level, little is known about regulation of zzso organization in the three-dimensional space of the nucleus to achieve integrated zzso responses to diverse signaling zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso rapid zzso interactions among zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso units, with a dramatic reorganization of nuclear territories requiring nuclear zzso transport machinery, zzso light chain 1 zzso and a specific subset of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We establish a requirement for the zzso zzso zzso zzso in directing specific zzso interaction zzso to distinct zzso zzso long thought to be zzso sites for zzso machinery, and demonstrate that these three-dimensional zzso interactions are required to achieve enhanced zzso of specific zzso target zzso These findings reveal roles for the zzso of nuclear architecture in orchestrating regulated zzso programs in the zzso zzso
