We examined the contribution of carbon monoxide zzso an zzso product of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, because this gas zzso is reported to activate zzso which plays a protective role against zzso cell zzso Exposure of zzso cells to CO gas resulted in protection against zzso zzso with zzso of zzso Interestingly, zzso with zzso IX, a specific inhibitor of zzso caused a reduction in zzso zzso activity and thus enhanced sensitivity to zzso No induction of zzso 1 of HO zzso was seen during zzso exposure, but zzso expression of zzso 2 zzso occurred, suggesting that CO produced by zzso is the main participant in the protection against zzso zzso Studies of small interfering zzso zzso of zzso in the cells supported this zzso Our results suggest that CO gas and its producing zzso zzso are key molecules in cellular protection against zzso presumably through zzso zzso of zzso
