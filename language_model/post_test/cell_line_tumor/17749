zzso is a component of the traditional Chinese medical herb zzso zzso zzso which is widely used to treat diseases such as viral zzso cardiac zzso and skin zzso As indicated by previous reports, the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso effect has been poorly zzso In this study, we used both in zzso and in zzso models to investigate zzso zzso effect and its possible molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were cultured in the presence of zzso at various zzso zzso - zzso zzso A zzso zzso effect was zzso The 50 % zzso concentration zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso effects of zzso were associated with an increase in cells arrested in the G zzso phase of the cell zzso zzso changes, flow zzso analysis and expression of the zzso protein zzso indicated that this zzso effect was zzso via zzso In zzso zzso efficacy was evaluated following zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in strong in zzso zzso zzso Our results showed that seven doses of zzso at 50 zzso inhibited zzso % of tumor zzso zzso electron microscope zzso analysis and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso proteins also indicated induction of zzso in tumor zzso by zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that zzso possesses strong zzso activities in zzso and in zzso zzso of cell proliferation and induction of zzso are the likely mechanisms responsible for zzso zzso zzso
