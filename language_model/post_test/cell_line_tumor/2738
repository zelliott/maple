Barrett's zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are regarded as complications of zzso zzso disease, although all the factors that contribute to the development of these zzso are zzso Acid zzso drugs are widely used for symptomatic therapy of zzso disease but may induce zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be a growth factor for zzso zzso We have examined the effects of zzso zzso zzso an alternative product of zzso processing on zzso in the zzso Barrett's zzso cell line and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso zzso in all three cell lines, zzso was only effective in zzso zzso By contrast to the effects of zzso the zzso effect of zzso was independent of both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso also increased zzso and protein levels of the zzso proteins zzso and zzso but did not affect the levels of zzso zzso or zzso Novel small zzso zzso of zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso blocked the zzso effects of zzso and inhibited the induction of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso via mechanisms distinct from those activated by zzso and involving zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso peptides in response to acid zzso therapy may adversely influence the dynamics of the zzso in zzso
