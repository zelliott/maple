Human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso is expressed by the majority of human zzso and is a risk factor for poor zzso Unlike breast cancer, zzso cells express zzso at too low, a level for patients to benefit from zzso zzso zzso We reasoned that this limitation might be overcome by genetically zzso T cells with zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso because even a low frequency of zzso engagement could be sufficient to induce zzso cell killing of the zzso zzso T cells were generated by zzso zzso with a zzso zzso containing a zzso signaling zzso zzso T cells recognized zzso zzso cells as judged by their ability to zzso produce zzso T helper 1 zzso and kill zzso zzso cell lines in zzso The adoptive transfer of zzso T cells caused zzso of established zzso zzso in zzso as well as zzso mouse zzso In contrast, delivery of zzso zzso T cells did not change the tumor growth zzso zzso modification of T cells with zzso specific for target zzso expressed at too low a level to be effectively recognized by zzso zzso may allow zzso to be more broadly zzso for human cancer zzso
