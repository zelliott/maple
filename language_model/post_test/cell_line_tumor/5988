zzso is an eye lens protein with a zzso zzso zzso We previously identified this protein as a lung zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso protein is zzso irrespective of the zzso type of lung zzso but not in normal zzso other than the zzso zzso to significantly extend the use of zzso zzso zzso for the treatment of patients with lung zzso we searched for zzso zzso from this protein by screening predicted zzso candidate peptides for the induction of zzso zzso Four zzso peptides were selected by computerized zzso based on a zzso zzso binding zzso and were used to zzso zzso transgenic zzso zzso Two of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso zzso T zzso zzso in zzso mice, and thus were used to stimulate human peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also induced human zzso zzso and we were able to generate zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso clone specifically recognized zzso zzso cells, zzso cells expressing zzso and zzso and zzso lung zzso cells in an zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso clone failed to recognize zzso target cells in the absence of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is naturally processed and presented by zzso molecules on the surface of lung zzso cells and may be a new target for zzso zzso zzso against lung zzso
