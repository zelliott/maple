The zzso fusion protein is a zzso active protein zzso zzso that is found in zzso of patients with zzso acute zzso leukemia and that promotes proliferation and survival of zzso Although zzso is sensitive to zzso zzso zzso development of resistance to these compounds is a major clinical problem, underlining the need for additional drug targets in the sparsely studied zzso signaling zzso In this work, we identify and validate the zzso family zzso zzso as a protein whose activity is absolutely required for the proliferation and survival of zzso acute zzso leukemia cells that depend on zzso zzso These findings underscore the potential of zzso zzso zzso and of the dual zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso acute zzso zzso In addition, we used mass zzso to identify protein interaction partners of zzso Our results strongly support that the signaling network of zzso is distinct from that previously reported for zzso Moreover, we found that three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are strictly required for the proliferation and survival of zzso zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso In conclusion, this work identifies zzso zzso zzso and zzso as four new potential drug targets in zzso zzso acute zzso zzso
