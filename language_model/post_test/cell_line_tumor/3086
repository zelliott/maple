Current treatment options for zzso fail to eradicate the disease in the majority of high-risk patients, clearly mandating development of innovative therapeutic zzso Gene therapy represents a promising approach for reversing the zzso zzso or driving tumor cells to zzso We presently studied the effects of zzso gene transfer of human zzso zzso zzso a zzso with zzso properties, in zzso zzso zzso expression was driven by either the zzso zzso promoter or by a zzso promoter derived from progression elevated zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that efficient zzso zzso of zzso cells and robust zzso expression are feasible zzso that the zzso promoter is capable of selectively targeting gene expression in the majority of zzso cells, and that zzso zzso profound growth suppression and zzso of zzso zzso cells, while exerting limited effects on normal neural zzso zzso These findings support future applications of zzso for targeted zzso therapy of zzso and suggest that combination with the zzso promoter holds promise for creating a potent and selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2009 zzso zzso
