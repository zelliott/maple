The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to have two faces with regard to its role in tumor zzso On the one side, it is well documented that zzso of zzso slows down cancer cell growth, whereas on the other side zzso also has a zzso zzso We set out to examine the role of zzso in tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso thought to be a zzso tumor surveillance mechanism and failure to undergo zzso might contribute to zzso zzso We show that zzso of zzso at moderate levels is able to protect cells from zzso zzso While zzso zzso and Bid zzso were not affected by zzso we detected a marked decrease in zzso zzso pointing to a zzso resistance zzso Indeed, we found that zzso cells showed reduced zzso c and no zzso release into the zzso The resulting lack of zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso most likely caused the TRAIL resistance as zzso against zzso zzso activity and TRAIL zzso Our results show that zzso oxygen species are involved in zzso zzso release and in zzso zzso zzso high levels of zzso which decompose and neutralize these zzso oxygen species, might contribute to zzso formation by allowing zzso tumor cells to escape from zzso tumor zzso As part of TRAIL regimens, zzso treatment with zzso zzso in the form of zzso zzso or zzso zzso might be able to break TRAIL resistance of zzso tumor zzso
