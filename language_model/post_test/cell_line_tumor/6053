zzso iron zzso zzso selectively and significantly zzso zzso inhibit proliferation of zzso and zzso cells in zzso at doses as low as 5 zzso but have little adverse effect on normal healthy control zzso The particle treatment caused delay in zzso zzso especially in the zzso There was no significant difference in the zzso zzso between cancer and control cells, and zzso resulted primarily from the iron core, before zzso rather than from the zzso zzso released from the zzso In contrast with magnetic zzso that usually serve as drug carriers, diagnostic zzso or zzso media, the iron, before zzso in the zzso selectively suppressed cancer cell growth and left healthy control cells unaffected in zzso and in zzso This novel zzso holds great promise as a therapeutic tool in zzso 

zzso iron zzso zzso selectively suppressed zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso cancer zzso cell growth, but left healthy control cells unaffected both in zzso and in zzso The particles were equally zzso by all cells, but delayed cell progression only for cancer zzso The origin is related to the iron zzso neither iron zzso nor the oxidized zzso have the same zzso
