zzso an inhibitor of the zzso zzso target of zzso zzso zzso arrest and/or zzso Although zzso and its zzso are attractive candidates for cancer therapy, their sensitivities with respect to growth zzso differ markedly among various cancer zzso Using human breast zzso cell line zzso as an experimental model system, we examined the zzso effects of combinations of various agents and zzso to find the agent that most zzso enhances the zzso effect of zzso 

We evaluated the zzso effect of zzso plus various agents, including zzso A (a novel zzso of differentiation of zzso zzso zzso to zzso cells, using either zzso zzso or zzso blue dye exclusion zzso The cell cycle was analyzed using zzso zzso zzso Expressions of several genes in zzso cells with zzso plus zzso A were studied using zzso zzso analysis and zzso The in zzso results of zzso cells treated with zzso plus zzso A were further confirmed in zzso in a mouse zzso zzso 

We found that the sensitivity of zzso to zzso cells was markedly affected by zzso zzso This treatment induced growth arrest of the cells at the zzso phase, rather than zzso and induced zzso zzso zzso We examined the gene expression profiles associated with exposure to zzso and zzso A using zzso zzso We found that expressions of zzso zzso transforming growth zzso 68 zzso zzso zzso killer, and growth factor zzso 7 were markedly induced in zzso cells treated with zzso plus zzso zzso Furthermore, combined treatment with zzso and zzso A significantly inhibited the growth of zzso cells as zzso without apparent adverse zzso 

zzso and zzso A zzso induced growth arrest in breast zzso zzso cells in zzso and treatment with zzso and zzso A combined more strongly inhibited the growth of zzso cells as zzso in zzso than treatment with zzso or zzso A alone, suggesting that this combination may have therapeutic value in treating breast zzso We also identified several genes that were markedly modulated in zzso cells treated with zzso plus zzso zzso
