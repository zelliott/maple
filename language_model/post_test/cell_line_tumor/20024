Japanese encephalitis virus zzso is an enveloped zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso three structural and seven zzso zzso To date, the role of zzso zzso protein 2A zzso in the viral life cycle is largely zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso the zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso zzso after sensing viral zzso and results in global translation arrest as an important host zzso defense zzso In this study, we found that zzso zzso could antagonize zzso growth zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso In human cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso and the subsequent zzso zzso and cell death triggered by zzso and zzso were also zzso by zzso zzso Moreover, among the four zzso zzso zzso specifically blocked the zzso zzso zzso by zzso and attenuated the zzso cell death induced by the zzso drug zzso A single point zzso of zzso zzso 33 from zzso to zzso zzso abolished the zzso potential of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso showed reduced in zzso growth and in zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso has a novel function in blocking the host zzso response of zzso during zzso zzso
