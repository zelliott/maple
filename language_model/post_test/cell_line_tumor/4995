To explore the potential function of the BK channel in the inner zzso membrane under zzso and hypoxic conditions, we used zzso and zzso zzso Single BK channels had a zzso of zzso zzso under symmetrical zzso solutions, were zzso and zzso and were inhibited by zzso zzso zzso In response to zzso BK increased open zzso shifted its reversal potential zzso zzso in the positive direction and did not change its zzso We conclude that zzso the properties at rest of this zzso zzso channel are similar to those of BK channels in the plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso an increase, rather than a decrease (as in the zzso in the open probability of this zzso channel, leading to zzso zzso from the zzso zzso to the zzso We speculate that this increase in zzso zzso from zzso into the zzso is important during zzso in maintaining zzso zzso
