The zzso expression patterns of zzso zzso are important to the zzso of their predicted zzso zzso is the accepted technique for the zzso of zzso zzso however, zzso zzso and zzso zzso the two most frequently used methods, are not very convenient in practice and have poor zzso zzso 

We have developed an optimal approach that zzso these two methods and allows specific and rapid detection of tiny amounts of sample zzso and reduces costs relative to other zzso zzso of the same sample are zzso and reverse transcribed into zzso using a universal zzso zzso primer and then used as templates for zzso Green real-time zzso The technique has a dynamic range of eight orders of magnitude with a sensitivity of up to zzso fM zzso or as little as 10 zzso of total zzso Virtually no zzso is observed among the zzso zzso family members and with zzso that have only a single zzso difference in this highly specific zzso The spatial constraint of the zzso structure of the modified zzso primer allowed detection of zzso directly from cell zzso without zzso total zzso isolation, and the zzso tail made it possible to use multiplex zzso reactions of zzso and zzso in the same zzso 

The cost-effective zzso of zzso with zzso zzso primer is simple to perform and highly specific, which is especially important for samples that are precious and/or difficult to zzso
