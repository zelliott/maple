An in zzso study was made to evaluate the effect of zzso and zzso upon oral zzso cell zzso 

zzso was administered at doses of 3, zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso oral zzso cell zzso cultures zzso with different doses zzso zzso and 5 zzso followed by evaluation of the effects upon cell viability after 24, 48 and 72 zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso 

The application of zzso to the zzso tumor cells during 24, 48 and 72 h of incubation without zzso exerted an inhibitor effect upon cell zzso The zzso concentration at which the zzso of cell viability proved maximum was zzso zzso with statistically significant differences for 24 h zzso zzso zzso 48 h zzso zzso zzso and 72 h of incubation zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the combination of zzso and zzso exerted a zzso zzso greatest effects in relation to cell viability being recorded with a zzso concentration of zzso zzso and 5 zzso of zzso in the studied cell zzso 

zzso increases zzso activity in the zzso zzso cell line, while the combination of zzso and zzso exerts a zzso zzso
