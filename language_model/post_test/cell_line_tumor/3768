The zzso zzso stimulates the proliferation and migration of various immature cell types, including zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso zzso cell interaction has been less zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso zzso causes several structural deficits in blood vessels in zzso zzso zzso including decreased zzso zzso of zzso cells, diminished formation of zzso zzso and reduced assembly of the vascular zzso zzso These deficits result in decreased tumor vessel zzso increased vessel zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso mechanisms of zzso interaction with zzso cells are further explored in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso leads to reduced formation of zzso networks, reduced formation of zzso positive zzso cell zzso and increased zzso of zzso cell zzso We also show that zzso zzso results in loss of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, revealing a mechanism for zzso cross talk between zzso and zzso zzso
