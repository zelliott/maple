zzso zzso therapy is widely used for the treatment of advanced prostate zzso However, the effectiveness of this intervention strategy is generally short-lived as the disease ultimately zzso to a zzso zzso In recent years, it has become clear that even in zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso signaling axis is intact and is required for prostate cancer zzso Thus, there is a heightened interest in developing small molecules that function in part by zzso zzso expression in zzso Paradoxically, zzso expression has been shown to be important in preventing the zzso of zzso prostate cancer cells toward a neuroendocrine zzso associated with tumor zzso zzso we have evaluated the relative effect of prostate cancer zzso that function in part by depleting zzso levels on neuroendocrine differentiation in established cellular models of prostate zzso These studies reveal that although zzso zzso zzso can zzso zzso expression they increase the expression of neuroendocrine markers and alter cellular zzso zzso of zzso signaling using classic zzso zzso or small interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso incomplete neuroendocrine zzso zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso effectively zzso zzso expression while having no effect on neuroendocrine zzso Taken together, these data show that the zzso responses to zzso agents used in the clinic to prevent the progression of prostate cancer are not zzso a finding of significant therapeutic zzso
