In this study we have identified a functional role for zzso in cancer cell invasion and zzso zzso expression profiling of human zzso cell lines indicated that zzso levels were reduced in more invasive cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso in both lung and pancreatic cancer cell lines resulted in a significant reduction in the invasion zzso as well as in zzso zzso zzso zzso profiling of cells zzso with zzso or zzso resulted in the identification of over 100 zzso regulated zzso The fold change of protein expression was generally zzso the range zzso Only 14 were predicted zzso to have zzso seed sequences in their 3' zzso zzso zzso studies using zzso to knock down several candidate proteins from the zzso zzso experiment identified zzso (a member of the zzso zzso zzso which significantly reduced the invasive capability of a model lung cancer cell zzso We conclude that zzso has a significant zzso and zzso effect on lung cancer cells in zzso and functions as an zzso This function is likely zzso through the zzso fine tuning of the cellular levels of several zzso both directly and zzso and in particular we provide some evidence that zzso represents one of zzso
