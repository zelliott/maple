Protection against zzso zzso is a desirable feature of future gene therapy zzso in particular for those applications in which zzso expression will not zzso growth advantage to zzso zzso The ubiquitous zzso opening element zzso consisting of the zzso zzso island encompassing the dual zzso transcribed promoters of the human zzso zzso genes zzso has been shown to shield zzso active zzso promoters from zzso modifications and zzso position zzso However, it is unclear if this element can be used to improve expression from zzso zzso while maintaining tissue specificity in zzso zzso Here, we evaluated the potential of the zzso in combination with the zzso zzso related protein 8 zzso promoter to target zzso expression specifically to zzso cells in zzso and in zzso from a zzso zzso zzso The inclusion of the zzso did not interfere with specific zzso of zzso promoter activity during zzso differentiation and zzso sustained and zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso the zzso did not protect the zzso promoter from zzso in the zzso zzso zzso cell line, suggesting that this element maintains the inherent zzso state and zzso activity of cellular promoters in their native zzso Thus, the zzso could represent a useful protective genetic element in gene therapy zzso ensuring zzso zzso regulation of zzso promoters independent of the zzso integration zzso
