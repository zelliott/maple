The effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were investigated on lung cancer zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso releasing zzso zzso or zzso B zzso increased significantly the zzso growth of zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso zzso Also, zzso addition to zzso or zzso cells caused zzso zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso releasing zzso zzso or zzso B zzso caused zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso was not inhibited by addition of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso but was blocked by zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso reduced zzso growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibit specific zzso binding to zzso cells with an zzso values of zzso 21, 15 and zzso zzso The ability of zzso to regulate zzso zzso in zzso cells was reduced by zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso may stimulate lung cancer growth as a result of zzso zzso and that the zzso is regulated by zzso in a zzso zzso oxygen and zzso zzso zzso
