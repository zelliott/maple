The zzso of prostate cancer zzso bone pain zzso has both inflammatory and zzso zzso Previously, we showed that small zzso zzso II type 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso selectivity over the zzso II type 1 zzso produced zzso analgesia in a rat model of zzso zzso Here, we assessed the zzso efficacy and mode of action of the zzso R zzso zzso in a rat model of zzso 

At zzso days after unilateral zzso injection of zzso zzso cells, rats exhibiting zzso hypersensitivity received single intravenous zzso doses of zzso zzso or vehicle, and zzso efficacy was zzso The mode of action was investigated using zzso Western zzso and/or molecular biological methods in zzso zzso root zzso zzso removed from zzso and zzso zzso rats relative to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso doses of zzso produced zzso analgesia in zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso II, nerve growth factor zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso were increased significantly zzso zzso in zzso rats, zzso the corresponding levels for sham zzso zzso produced analgesia in zzso rats by reducing elevated zzso II levels in the zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso R zzso This in turn reduced zzso zzso signaling in the zzso zzso The net result was zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Small zzso zzso R zzso are worthy of further investigation as novel analgesics for relief of intractable zzso and other pain types where zzso worsens zzso
