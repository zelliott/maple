An understanding of differential gene expression in highly zzso zzso could provide gene targets for treatment of zzso We compared gene expression profiles of zzso zzso and low- zzso zzso zzso cell lines in an in zzso tissue culture model and examined several zzso regulated genes in zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized an zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cells would establish a primary zzso and the gene expression profile of cells grafted in this fashion would resemble the gene expression profile observed in an in zzso zzso Thirty-five days after zzso animals were zzso and both zzso were harvested and rapidly frozen in liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso was present in two of four zzso zzso with zzso cells and three of four zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso displaying the presence of human cells were zzso by zzso reverse zzso zzso chain zzso We observed poor correspondence of in zzso to in zzso gene expression for either cell zzso zzso in zzso zzso gene expression data must be interpreted with caution until confirmed in zzso Our zzso injection model allowed in zzso study of differential gene expression between these two cell lines but did not show zzso evidence of an established primary zzso
