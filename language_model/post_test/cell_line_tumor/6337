zzso clear cell zzso zzso carries a poor prognosis because of its zzso to zzso We previously found an association between reduced proliferation of CCC and zzso here we investigated the mechanism of the reduced zzso 

We assessed cell cycle function by measuring the activity of zzso zzso zzso and the protein expression of zzso the zzso zzso and zzso in 22 zzso cancer cell lines and 60 human zzso cancer zzso We examined the cellular location of zzso zzso zzso at zzso 157 zzso and zzso protein by zzso zzso and western zzso We tested the effect of the inhibitor of zzso zzso and small interfering zzso against zzso zzso in two CCC cell lines zzso zzso 

CCC cells had lower zzso activity and higher zzso expression than zzso zzso zzso zzso Low zzso activity correlated with high zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso but zzso inhibitor or zzso maintained zzso in the nucleus and restored its zzso In human zzso zzso was mostly in the zzso and was zzso associated with zzso zzso activity was lower in the CCC than in the zzso zzso zzso enhanced the zzso effect of zzso zzso and zzso in both zzso cells and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso activity via the zzso zzso of zzso by zzso may contribute to suppression of CCC zzso A prospective study is needed to determine whether the zzso zzso of zzso results in the zzso of zzso
