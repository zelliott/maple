zzso acid, a group of zzso resulting from the decomposition of organic matter has been implicated as a possible zzso factor for Black foot disease and zzso However, the role of zzso acid in zzso is not well zzso In this study, we evaluated the enhancement effect of zzso acid on the progression of zzso human lung cancer zzso Our findings showed that zzso acid increased the migration, zzso and invasion of zzso cells significantly after treatment at the concentration of 50 and 100 zzso for 24 and 48 h as compared with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso indicated that zzso acid enhanced the activity of zzso zzso 9 zzso By western zzso analysis, zzso acid increased the expression of zzso focal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that may mediate cell zzso and zzso Since the zzso of signal pathways such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso may play a role in the cell invasion, we detected the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The result indicated that all zzso stated above were activated by zzso acid in zzso zzso However, by adding an inhibitor respectively in the invasion zzso only zzso zzso and zzso pathways were found to be involved in the enhancing the invasion of zzso cells by zzso zzso In addition, results of zzso mobility shift zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso acid increased nuclear extract binding to the DNA probe of zzso protein 1 zzso and nuclear factor zzso zzso respectively, zzso that zzso acid enhanced the progression of zzso lung cancer cells through zzso multiple signaling pathways including zzso zzso and zzso and increasing the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso
