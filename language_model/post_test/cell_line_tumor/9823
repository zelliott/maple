It is accepted that zzso fixation of cells can affect zzso of zzso however, the effects of tissue processing on zzso have not been analyzed zzso We investigated the effects of zzso fixation and the various cumulative steps of tissue processing on zzso detection of specific zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cancer cell lines were cultured as zzso on microscope zzso zzso detection of zzso and zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso was evaluated after various fixation times in zzso neutral zzso zzso and after each of the several cumulative steps of tissue zzso The effect of zzso retrieval zzso was evaluated zzso as an additional zzso Our results indicate that in addition to zzso each of the tissue processing steps has effects on zzso of the zzso recognized by these zzso zzso zzso through zzso to absolute ethanol had only modest effects, except for the detection of zzso in zzso cells where the effect was zzso In general, however, establishment of a zzso environment by zzso resulted in the greatest decrease in zzso zzso compensated for most, but not all, of the losses in zzso following fixation and exposure to zzso however, zzso gave consistent results for most steps of tissue processing, which suggests that zzso also should be used for zzso zzso The cellular variations that were observed indicate that the effects of fixation and other steps of tissue processing may depend on how zzso are packaged by specific zzso
