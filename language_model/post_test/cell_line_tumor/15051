We previously reported novel zzso zzso which induced zzso in lung and breast cancer zzso In this study, we designed and zzso novel zzso zzso that showed zzso in lung cancer zzso The effects of these zzso were studied in zzso human large cell lung zzso cells that are zzso for zzso and normal lung zzso cell lines zzso The effects of the zzso were investigated by zzso zzso zzso based zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, flow zzso and western zzso zzso Our data indicated that derivatives 4 and 6 decreased cell proliferation and induced zzso in zzso cells more than zzso zzso zzso 4 and 6 reduced percent of cells in zzso phase in zzso cells more than zzso cells and these results were confirmed by increased expression levels of zzso zzso Furthermore, derivatives 4 and 6 increased zzso activity, zzso and zzso and zzso expression level in zzso Additionally, derivatives 4 and 6 induced zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso All these results confirm that our zzso derivatives provoke zzso in lung cancer cells through the interplay of key zzso molecules in different compartments of the cell beginning with an increase in zzso zzso
