The present study was designed to investigate the zzso effects of zzso extract of zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso leukemia zzso zzso It significantly reduced the zzso release from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso production in these zzso The zzso effect of zzso on these zzso was found to be nuclear zzso zzso dependent, as it attenuated the degradation of zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso In addition, zzso significantly attenuated the zzso zzso zzso zzso release from these cells, which makes us speculate strongly that the decreased zzso zzso is involved in the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso Taken together, zzso effects of zzso suggest possible therapeutic application of this extract in allergic zzso
