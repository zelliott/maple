We previously reported that zzso M zzso is an active agent to induce zzso in human prostate cancer zzso but the molecular mechanisms of action remain largely zzso Here, we demonstrate that Mar zzso inhibited zzso and zzso zzso activities of zzso zzso both in in zzso and zzso systems and significantly induced the zzso of zzso proteins in zzso zzso The zzso modeling analysis suggested that Mar zzso bound to active sites of zzso zzso and zzso zzso resulting in a zzso zzso zzso zzso by Mar subsequently resulted in zzso zzso zzso stress, as evidenced by elevated zzso protein 78 and zzso increased zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso However, zzso cell death was not completely impaired by a pan inhibitor of zzso Further studies revealed that the zzso cell death was greatly associated with the zzso of zzso as indicated by the significant induction of zzso zzso light zzso beta zzso expression and zzso zzso microscopic and green fluorescent zzso zzso analyses further demonstrated the ability of zzso induction by zzso Time kinetic studies revealed that Mar induced a rapid and highly sustained processing of zzso in treated cells and simultaneously decreased the expression of zzso zzso blockade or zzso of zzso and zzso attenuated zzso cell zzso The zzso response triggered by Mar required the zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and suppression of the zzso zzso target of zzso axis via preventing zzso and expression of zzso Our results identified a novel mechanism for the zzso effect of Mar, which strengthens it as a potential agent in cancer zzso
