The current treatment of zzso using zzso zzso and third zzso remains zzso We revisited the concept of destruction of the zzso zzso for the treatment of zzso by using an zzso technique to specifically destroy this zzso This approach was based on the observation that, as an zzso zzso zzso zzso expresses a number of specific zzso proteins that represent excellent potential targets for the creation of a zzso zzso zzso 

In this study, we characterized sheep and human zzso zzso cells (including zzso and zzso cell zzso using zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso of rat brain and confirmed the presence of a number of zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso zzso were then manufactured by linking these zzso to zzso A chain and zzso zzso zzso These zzso were delivered to zzso zzso cells in culture, and the results were compared with results of exposure to a zzso zzso 

Complete cell death of zzso zzso cells was seen after only a zzso exposure to the specific zzso as opposed to the minimal cell death seen with a zzso zzso after several hours of zzso 

These results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso zzso may be a viable method of treating zzso and zzso zzso zzso
