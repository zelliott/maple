Despite several clinical and experimental studies, the mechanisms behind the development of port site zzso in zzso surgery have remained largely zzso The current study was designed to investigate the effect of zzso on blood flow in the abdominal wall and its possible effects on tumor growth at this zzso 

A total of 40 zzso zzso rats had a laser zzso probe placed on their left zzso muscle and a suspension of 50,000 zzso cells was injected into their right zzso zzso The experimental group zzso zzso zzso was zzso with air at 10 zzso for 45 zzso while abdominal blood flow was registered before and during zzso and after zzso The control group zzso zzso zzso was not zzso but the blood flow was recorded in the same zzso After 9 days, all animals were killed and the occurrence of tumor was zzso The tumors were analyzed with respect to weight and zzso 

The zzso caused an zzso reduction in blood flow in the experimental group zzso zzso zzso No reduction in blood flow was registered in the control zzso zzso zzso developed significantly more often in the zzso group zzso compared to the controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso weight zzso zzso zzso and volume zzso zzso zzso were significantly increased in the zzso zzso 

zzso seems to enhance tumor zzso It also causes a significant reduction in blood flow in the abdominal wall, which may contribute to the increased zzso of tumor zzso
