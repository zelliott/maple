Numerous studies have shown that human zzso zzso W family zzso envelope gene zzso is related to various diseases but the underlying mechanism has remained poorly zzso Our previous study showed that there was abnormal expression of zzso zzso in zzso of patients with zzso In this paper, we reported that zzso of the zzso zzso elevated the levels of small zzso zzso zzso channel protein 3 zzso in human zzso zzso Using a zzso reporter system and zzso interference method, we found that functional zzso response element site was required for the expression of zzso triggered by zzso zzso In addition, it was also found that the zzso channel was activated by zzso zzso Further study indicated that zzso response zzso protein zzso was required for the zzso of the zzso zzso Thus, a novel signaling mechanism of how zzso zzso influences zzso activity and contributes to mental illnesses such as schizophrenia was zzso
