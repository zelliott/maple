Despite incremental progress in the treatment of pancreatic zzso the prognosis of patients remains zzso Here, we report the zzso studies in pancreatic cancer cells that demonstrate the efficacy of zzso zzso a synthetic zzso both as a zzso and as a zzso zzso The zzso effects of zzso on the pancreatic cancer cell lines zzso and zzso were determined using cell zzso flow zzso and western zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso was also investigated in two zzso models of pancreatic cancer zzso and zzso As a zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso of the intrinsic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso independent and death zzso independent, whereas cell necrosis was zzso zzso Using combination index analysis, we have shown that zzso of pancreatic cancer cells with zzso enhanced the zzso effect of zzso the standard of care used to treat advanced pancreatic zzso In zzso models of pancreatic cancer, the rate of tumor proliferation on mice zzso with zzso and zzso was significantly reduced when compared with the corresponding tumor proliferation rates from the respective zzso and zzso zzso zzso was recently granted zzso New Drug status by the US Food and Drug zzso These data justify the zzso of clinical studies investigating the utility of combining zzso and zzso in patients with zzso and late-stage pancreatic zzso
