zzso zzso Lewis acid induced zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso various zzso on the aromatic zzso obtained from a zzso zzso were carried out under fairly mild conditions to furnish zzso zzso in good to excellent zzso The ability of zzso to undergo zzso was found to be affected significantly by the electronic features of the zzso on the aromatic zzso The rates of the zzso reactions were observed to be increased by zzso and decreased by zzso zzso The experimental findings on the zzso transformations were supported by calculations of the proposed mechanism at the zzso level of theory, indicating a noteworthy zzso mainly of the initial zzso step, and hence of the whole process, on the character of the zzso The zzso was estimated to occur via a zzso intermediate rather than involving a pure concerted zzso The zzso activities of the structurally related zzso derivatives were tested in zzso on three zzso human cell lines zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso revealed that several compounds exerted marked cell zzso zzso The highest zzso activities, displayed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso cells, respectively), were better than those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
