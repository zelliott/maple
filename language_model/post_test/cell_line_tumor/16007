We performed here zzso zzso using both metal oxide affinity zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The former method identified mainly zzso and zzso of nuclear or zzso zzso whereas the latter did zzso including more plasma membrane proteins and zzso The overlap between these two methods was limited (24 zzso zzso sites out of zzso and, by combining the two, coverage of the signaling molecules was enhanced as exemplified by zzso zzso We also performed whole cell zzso using an zzso zzso and found zzso of the proteins identified by zzso Thus, the expression levels of zzso were roughly zzso In addition to many zzso zzso sites, the zzso includes 136 sites that were zzso verified elsewhere to be zzso by a total of 83 zzso and zzso groups out of the 256 registered in the zzso zzso With the integration of various zzso analyses and information from database, the responsible zzso of the identified zzso sites and possibly their activity status were predicted by zzso status and expression levels of their zzso and thus our method may be able to monitor the activity status of zzso zzso
