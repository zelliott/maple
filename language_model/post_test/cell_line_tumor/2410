A dearth of protein zzso clinical zzso currently zzso advances in personalized zzso A well-organized protein zzso validation process that includes facile measurement of protein zzso would accelerate development of effective zzso zzso Toward zzso protein zzso analysis, we introduce a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso performs all zzso steps: zzso zzso of resolved zzso zzso probing of immobilized zzso and all interim wash zzso zzso zzso zzso transport zzso the need for pumps and zzso A three-dimensional bulk zzso zzso eliminates manual zzso In addition to simplified operation and zzso directed zzso transport through our zzso zzso zzso zzso yields superior performance over the state-of-the-art in enhanced capture efficiency (on par with membrane zzso and sparing consumption of zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso as supported by empirical and by zzso zzso We apply our fully integrated zzso zzso to protein zzso of zzso prostate specific zzso zzso in zzso minimally processed human prostate cancer cell zzso zzso zzso limit of zzso and zzso crude zzso from zzso prostate cancer zzso The zzso functionality establishes a zzso zzso framework for zzso targeted zzso as is relevant to personalized medicine through robust protein zzso zzso systematic characterization of new zzso zzso for functional zzso and, more broadly, to characterization of human zzso zzso
