The tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which contributes to zzso in many cancer zzso While zzso zzso occur in some zzso their precise zzso consequences have yet to be zzso We sought to identify novel downstream zzso of zzso using a combination of zzso and functional zzso zzso analysis of 53 melanoma cell lines identified 610 genes zzso expressed ( zzso between zzso lines and those with zzso zzso Many of these genes are known to be involved in the zzso zzso and other signaling pathways influenced by zzso zzso of differential gene expression by zzso was performed in the original 53 cell lines and an independent set of 18 melanoma lines with known zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that contributes to tumor zzso was more abundant at both the zzso and protein level in zzso zzso The inverse correlation between zzso and zzso expression was validated ( zzso by zzso using melanoma tissue zzso Finally, treatment of cell lines with the zzso inhibitor zzso caused a reduction in expression of zzso These data indicate that zzso acts downstream of zzso in melanoma and provides insight into how zzso loss contributes to melanoma zzso
