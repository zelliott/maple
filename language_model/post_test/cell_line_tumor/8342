zzso cancer cell zzso fate is governed by an intricate network of signaling zzso some of which are the direct target of DNA zzso whereas others are functionally zzso As a consequence, cells acquire the ability to grow under nutrients and oxygen shortage zzso We earlier reported that zzso activity is necessary for proliferation and survival of zzso in a cell zzso manner and regardless of their zzso and zzso Here, we show that zzso sustains the expression of zzso target genes zzso for zzso zzso zzso and that its zzso causes a drastic decrease in zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso zzso of zzso triggers zzso nuclear zzso of zzso and subsequent zzso of its target zzso leading to zzso cell cycle arrest and cell zzso In zzso pharmacological blockade of zzso zzso zzso growth in zzso nude mice and zzso zzso mice, achieving both a zzso and zzso effect, associated with high nuclear expression of zzso and increased expression of its target genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso affects the zzso zzso metabolism specific of cancer cells and might be taken advantage of as a therapeutic strategy targeted against zzso
