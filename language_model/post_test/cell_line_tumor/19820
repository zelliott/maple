We sought to determine the zzso mechanism of zzso growth factor, zzso growth factor zzso as a regulator of zzso synthesis of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso the zzso inhibitor of zzso and a potential zzso of zzso 

zzso increased zzso zzso expression and zzso protein zzso in the zzso media of human zzso zzso cells, and increased zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was attenuated by zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso increased the human zzso promoter zzso to zzso zzso activity, and deletion and zzso analysis uncovered a functional E box zzso at positions zzso to zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso demonstrated that this E box binds upstream zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression zzso increased zzso promoter zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso promoter zzso 

Because zzso are involved in the regulation of carbohydrates and zzso zzso zzso zzso production may provide a novel link between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso may zzso the zzso risk in high-risk zzso
