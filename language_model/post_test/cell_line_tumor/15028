zzso of whole grains has been associated with reduced risk of developing major chronic zzso These health benefits have been attributed in part to their unique zzso Little is known about the complete profiles of zzso and zzso activities of different zzso zzso The objectives of this study were to determine the zzso profiles of the three zzso zzso including both free and bound of total zzso and total zzso and to determine the total zzso activity of zzso The free, bound, and total zzso contents of zzso samples ranged from zzso to zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso g of sample, from zzso to zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso g of sample, and from zzso to zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso g of sample, zzso On average, the bound zzso contributed zzso of total zzso content of the zzso varieties zzso The free, bound, and total zzso contents of zzso samples ranged from zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The average values of bound zzso contributed zzso of total zzso of the zzso varieties zzso The percentage contribution of zzso content to zzso content of free, bound, and total ranged from zzso to zzso from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso The free, bound, and total oxygen radical zzso capacity zzso values of zzso samples ranged from zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The average zzso values of bound zzso contributed zzso of total zzso activity of the zzso varieties zzso The content of total zzso and the zzso capacity are obviously different among different zzso zzso 5 zzso and zzso 1 zzso are significantly better than zzso zzso zzso The zzso extracts have obvious zzso zzso on human liver cancer cells, and substantially in the experimental concentration range, the zzso sample itself has no zzso Knowing the zzso profiles and zzso activity of zzso gives insights to its potential application to promote zzso
