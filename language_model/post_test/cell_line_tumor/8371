zzso domain zzso proteins are zzso and zzso zzso that mediate the rapid destruction of zzso factor alpha zzso Whereas zzso and zzso zzso has been shown to be regulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso destruction, protein regulation of the main oxygen sensor responsible for zzso factor alpha regulation, zzso remained zzso We recently reported that the zzso protein zzso 38 specifically interacts with zzso and determines zzso protein stability in a zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso array binding zzso zzso zzso and zzso resonance energy transfer analysis, we defined a minimal linear zzso zzso binding domain in the zzso part of zzso and showed that this domain forms a high affinity complex with zzso Vice versa, zzso zzso with a zzso zzso motif containing the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso finger domain with zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso overlapped with zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso An additional fraction of zzso was found in the zzso In zzso zzso association, as well as regulation of zzso protein abundance by zzso is dependent on zzso anchored zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso our data indicate that zzso protein stability is regulated by a zzso zzso zzso involving zzso as zzso protein that mediates zzso zzso We zzso that zzso zzso is constantly zzso whereas zzso zzso is stable and able to function as an active zzso
