The zzso zzso motor generates pulling forces to center and orient the zzso zzso within the zzso During this positioning process, zzso zzso from one pole of the cell zzso to the other but only accumulates at the pole farthest from the zzso Here, we show that zzso light chain 1 zzso is required for this zzso cortical zzso of zzso and has a specific function defining zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso formed by zzso and zzso via zzso motifs in zzso In cells depleted of zzso or zzso the zzso zzso failed to orient correctly in relation to the growth zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso motif zzso localized to the zzso zzso but failed to recruit zzso to zzso zzso and did not correct the zzso orientation or zzso zzso zzso These findings support a model where zzso and zzso form part of the regulatory system feeding back zzso position to zzso at the cell zzso
