The zzso box O zzso class of zzso factors are involved in the regulation of several cellular responses including cell cycle progression and zzso Furthermore, in model organisms zzso act as tumor zzso and affect zzso Previously, we noted that zzso and zzso are remarkably similar within their spectrum of regulatory zzso For example, the zzso zzso zzso removes zzso from both zzso and zzso However, zzso has been identified as zzso zzso for zzso whereas zzso is the prime zzso zzso for zzso 

Here we provide evidence that zzso acts as an zzso zzso for zzso as zzso In zzso incubation of zzso and zzso results in zzso zzso of zzso similar to zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and consistent with this result, zzso depletion of zzso zzso zzso of zzso induced by hydrogen zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso is likely to be direct since zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso 

These data identify zzso as a novel zzso zzso for zzso and extend the analogous mode of regulation between zzso and zzso
