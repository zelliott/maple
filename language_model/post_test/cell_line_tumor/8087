zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were converted into zzso derivatives by means of zzso reactions zzso by the aromatic zzso of bacterial origin zzso using zzso zzso as zzso zzso instead of the natural zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred in zzso with respect to the zzso zzso in both zzso zzso derivatives were readily converted into zzso products via a selective zzso zzso involving the oxygen atom from the zzso zzso and the double bond of the zzso zzso a process zzso by zzso These findings set up the basis of a most convenient zzso zzso process which allows for easy recovery of the zzso products in high zzso The zzso derivatives thus obtained were tested for zzso and zzso activity using zzso zzso cells, a line of human colon zzso
