zzso are very important regulators in biological processes such as development, cellular zzso and zzso Given the important role of zzso in zzso and development, it is worth investigating whether some zzso play roles in the zzso mechanism of zzso However, such a role has not yet been zzso We previously selected the promising zzso agent zzso zzso in zzso experiments, which may serve as a leading compound for developing more potent zzso drugs or zzso zzso The present study aims to investigate the zzso activities of zzso against zzso zzso 

The experimental model of breast zzso was developed by zzso injection of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in rats was detected by zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was evaluated by real-time quantitative zzso Cell zzso was analyzed by flow zzso or terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso membrane potential was zzso using zzso zzso dye by zzso laser scanning zzso The level of zzso C in zzso was evaluated by western zzso 

Our study showed that oral administration of zzso effectively suppressed zzso breast zzso in rats, decreasing the cancer zzso by zzso The detection of zzso indicated that the concentration of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso in plasma of rats within 2 hours after administration, and was zzso zzso zzso zzso in urine within 24 zzso zzso administration of zzso to zzso nude mice bearing breast cancer cell zzso also significantly suppressed tumor growth in zzso Furthermore, our study revealed that the global zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso in breast zzso could be reversed by zzso which significantly zzso zzso expression and decreased zzso expression - inducing zzso of breast cancer cells in zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso induced by zzso zzso or zzso of zzso by zzso markedly promoted the zzso effect of zzso zzso of zzso or overproduction of zzso compromised the zzso effects of zzso 

These findings indicate that zzso is a potent natural zzso agent, and that zzso and zzso play roles in zzso breast zzso and the zzso mechanism of zzso
