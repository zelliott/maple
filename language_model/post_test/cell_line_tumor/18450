The aims of this study were to assess the zzso capability of zzso killer zzso cells from zzso zzso blood zzso to compare them with those of peripheral blood zzso cells against zzso zzso cell line zzso and zzso cell line zzso and to identify which mechanism and genes were involved in zzso 

The zzso cells were generated by zzso from zzso and zzso The zzso property of zzso cells against the target cells zzso zzso were estimated using a visual survival cell zzso The mixed target and zzso zzso cells were analyzed for whether DNA fragmentation was present or zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis was then performed to estimate the statement of the zzso and zzso genes in activated and zzso cells from zzso 

The higher in zzso zzso properties of the zzso cells from zzso were observed in comparison to the zzso cells from zzso against the zzso and the zzso ( zzso zzso may be one of the zzso mechanisms of target cells by the zzso cells from zzso The contributing genes could be zzso and zzso 

This study suggests that zzso may be used as a source of zzso cells in adults and children suffering from zzso zzso or zzso
