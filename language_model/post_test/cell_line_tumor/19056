zzso expression of the zzso factor type zzso zzso zzso but not zzso and zzso was observed in higher passage cultures of human zzso zzso zzso zzso studies further demonstrated an increase in zzso zzso and protein levels with higher passage numbers zzso 20 zzso Although the zzso zzso was expressed at higher levels than the zzso zzso both receptors were easily distinguishable from one another by selective zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso such as zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso production in zzso to zzso responses of approximately 100 zzso cells, whereas the exclusive zzso zzso zzso zzso and 3 zzso zzso production to zzso responses of approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso stimulation was zzso blocked by the approximately zzso selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso only blocked zzso responses at zzso zzso 10 zzso When the zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to activate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was a more potent inhibitor than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso and 3 treatment zzso and rapidly zzso the zzso zzso responses in zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso cells express functional zzso and zzso receptors and that the zzso zzso protein is zzso during prolonged zzso
