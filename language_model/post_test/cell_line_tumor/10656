The aim of this study was to investigate the role of zzso zzso on zzso C virus zzso replication in zzso zzso Using zzso array analysis, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified as zzso whose expression levels were altered by zzso zzso Among them, zzso and zzso were capable of enhancing replication of the zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso activity or cell proliferation was not increased by forced expression of zzso or zzso Investigation of signaling pathways revealed that zzso specifically suppressed the zzso zzso zzso zzso Under zzso of zzso zzso by zzso the zzso effect of zzso on zzso replication was zzso indicating that suppression of zzso replication by zzso was dependent on the zzso zzso zzso zzso altered by zzso infection would then affect zzso zzso which implies a complicated mechanism for regulating zzso zzso zzso zzso may be involved in changes in cellular properties including zzso
