zzso between the dual zzso and aurora zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso were examined in zzso leukemia cells, including those resistant to zzso zzso zzso particularly those with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso dramatically increased zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso regimen was highly active against primary zzso chronic zzso leukemia zzso cells and zzso cells bearing various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso cells exhibiting zzso zzso zzso These events were associated with zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, treatment with zzso resulted in zzso of cells with zzso or more DNA content, whereas zzso of zzso markedly enhanced aurora zzso zzso by zzso and zzso killed zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso also zzso with a selective inhibitor of aurora zzso A and B to zzso zzso without zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso markedly induced zzso zzso while blockade of zzso induction by zzso dramatically diminished the capacity of this agent to zzso zzso zzso Together, these findings indicate that zzso zzso increases zzso activity against zzso and zzso zzso cells through zzso of zzso and aurora zzso as well as by induction of zzso
