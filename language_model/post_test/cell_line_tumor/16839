The aim of this study was to create zzso zzso zzso for tumor cell zzso in zzso by magnetic resonance zzso A method for obtaining zzso zzso based on zzso oxide with the magnetic nucleus diameter of 12 zzso 3 zzso coated with zzso and forming stable water zzso was zzso The structure and size of the zzso were studied by zzso electron zzso dynamic light zzso and zzso phase zzso Their zzso zzso was comparable with that of the available commercial zzso Low zzso of these zzso was demonstrated by zzso test on primary and immortalized cell zzso The zzso were zzso by zzso zzso to zzso 43 zzso zzso binding of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso cell zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with high zzso fit for use as zzso contrast for the diagnosis of poorly differentiated zzso were zzso
