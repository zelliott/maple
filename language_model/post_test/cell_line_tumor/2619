zzso a new zzso compound originally derived from a marine zzso is clinically effective in soft tissue zzso The drug has shown a high selectivity for zzso zzso characterized by the zzso zzso zzso leading to the expression of zzso fusion zzso zzso appears to act interfering with mechanisms of zzso zzso In particular, the zzso activity of zzso was found to be impaired by zzso zzso Even after prolonged response resistance occurs and thus it is important to zzso the mechanisms of resistance to zzso To this end we developed and characterized a zzso zzso cell line resistant to zzso zzso obtained by exposing the parental zzso cell line to zzso increases in drug zzso The aim of this study was to compare zzso zzso and proteins profiles of zzso and zzso cells through a systems biology zzso We identified zzso zzso 47 zzso and 336 proteins zzso expressed between zzso and zzso cell zzso Interestingly three zzso among those zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso binding sites in their promoter zzso We used zzso approaches to integrate the three regulatory layers and to generate a molecular map describing the altered circuits in sensitive and resistant cell zzso By combining zzso and zzso data, we reconstructed two different networks, zzso zzso and cell cycle regulation, that could play a key role in modulating zzso zzso This approach highlights the central role of genes such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in both zzso and zzso regulatory zzso The validation of these results in in zzso models might be clinically relevant to zzso zzso zzso patients with different sensitivity to zzso zzso
