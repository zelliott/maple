This study reports the synthesis and in zzso biological properties of zzso zzso The zzso zzso platform was zzso to zzso zzso as a means to analyze cell binding and zzso Two different zzso zzso and zzso which bind to zzso and zzso membrane zzso zzso respectively, were used as model targeting zzso The binding of the zzso zzso to zzso cells was evaluated by flow zzso zzso zzso and a new zzso optical fiber zzso detection zzso The zzso specifically bound to the zzso cells in a zzso and zzso fashion, with affinity similar to that of the free zzso zzso microscopic analysis suggested at least some cellular zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso are a suitable platform for targeted zzso delivery into zzso zzso
