Plants have been the source of several effective drugs for the treatment of cancer and over zzso of zzso drugs originate from natural zzso zzso extracts of the zzso of zzso zzso an zzso plant from Guatemala which is used for the treatment of inflammatory conditions, were investigated regarding their zzso zzso By using several zzso the methanol extract was by far the most potent against zzso cell proliferation zzso zzso at 60 zzso Furthermore, zzso of this extract yielded fraction zzso which exhibited enforced zzso activity, and activated zzso zzso that are relevant for cell cycle progression and zzso as well as zzso were investigated by western zzso This revealed that the methanol extract increased the levels of zzso and this may have caused cell cycle zzso The zzso fraction zzso induced zzso through the intrinsic pathway, which correlated with the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso induction of zzso 9, then zzso 8 and zzso zzso In zzso the methanol extract and the zzso fraction zzso of zzso zzso showed zzso effects in zzso cells and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso breast cancer cells but not in zzso zzso breast cancer zzso Based on our data zzso zzso may be a promising source for novel zzso zzso
