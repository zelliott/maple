zzso zzso one of the hallmarks of zzso disease zzso are composed of paired zzso filaments of zzso zzso zzso The zzso of these zzso zzso in zzso zzso with synaptic loss and severity of zzso zzso the zzso involved in the pathological zzso of zzso may identify novel targets for zzso We used an unbiased approach to study the effect of 352 human zzso on their ability to zzso zzso at zzso associated with zzso The zzso were zzso together with the longest form of human zzso in human zzso zzso zzso of total and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured in cell zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be the most active zzso zzso zzso zzso at all four zzso We further dissected the effects of zzso and zzso using pharmacological and genetic tools in zzso primary cortical zzso zzso analysis of the zzso identified in the screen suggested mechanisms for regulation of total zzso levels and zzso zzso for example, zzso that affect total zzso levels do so by zzso or zzso of zzso A network fishing approach with the zzso hits identified other key molecules zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso including the zzso signaling through the Ras family of zzso zzso zzso zzso The findings identify novel zzso zzso and novel pathways that may be relevant for zzso and other zzso
