zzso zzso zzso zzso are in principle able to provide long-term zzso expression in the absence of integration into the target cell zzso The zzso attachment region zzso located zzso of the human zzso gene zzso has been shown to zzso a stable zzso replication and retention function within zzso zzso when zzso zzso and selected in zzso zzso The minimal requirement for the zzso zzso to function in DNA replication and zzso retention is zzso through this zzso We used the zzso zzso locus control zzso gene zzso zzso cassette as a model to assess zzso expression from within an zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso plus zzso combination zzso provided either high or low levels of zzso through the zzso zzso Our results show that the zzso zzso is able to zzso and zzso express at full zzso levels on an zzso copy number zzso In addition, our data show that even low levels of zzso from zzso through the zzso element are sufficient to allow efficient zzso replication and zzso These data provide the principles upon which generic and flexible expression zzso zzso can be designed for a wide range of zzso
