The primary structure of native human zzso zzso dependent zzso zzso was presented zzso years ago, so was first data on its zzso expression in cell zzso of zzso Then, the channel had already entered cancer research as the zzso zzso for zzso at outer zzso zzso Cell membrane standing zzso met the cancer field only four years ago, when it was reported that normal and zzso prostate cells from a single patient differed in the expression level of the zzso Meanwhile studies on a role of zzso in cell zzso zzso cancer and even pharmacology increase, mostly focused on zzso in the outer membrane of zzso but sometimes also pointing to the channel in the zzso zzso prostate cancer cells on their way to zzso The synopsis presented discusses some recent papers on this issue, and argues in favor of considering zzso dependent zzso zzso volume regulated zzso channel complexes in studies focused on zzso and cancer, where the channel might be part of the zzso cell death zzso In this context, heed should also be given to the interaction of zzso zzso and zzso receptors alpha in cell membrane zzso Finally, it is zzso to search for natural zzso against zzso zzso what in combination with other established markers might help in early diagnosis of prostate zzso
