Recently, we demonstrated that zzso zzso of an zzso single zzso functionality in the zzso region zzso high gene transfer properties to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso Gene zzso 2003, 10, zzso However, whether zzso attachment of multiple zzso zzso in the zzso region are capable of further enhancing the gene transfer zzso of zzso zzso remains to be zzso To this end, zzso we report on the design, zzso zzso zzso in zzso gene transfer properties, and serum zzso of three novel nontoxic zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso in their zzso regions zzso zzso in multiple cultured zzso zzso findings in both the reporter gene expression zzso and the whole cell zzso zzso zzso zzso support the notion that there is no linear correlation between the in zzso zzso zzso and the number of zzso zzso in the polar zzso regions for zzso zzso zzso The relative gene transfer zzso as well as the serum zzso of the present zzso zzso zzso were found to be zzso dependent on the medium of zzso zzso Most importantly, high serum zzso (up to 50% added zzso of the zzso of lipids 1 and 3 make them promising zzso zzso zzso for future systemic zzso
