zzso of the expression of major zzso complex class I zzso on the surface of high-risk zzso cells may contribute to their high zzso potential, which enables them to escape immune recognition by zzso T zzso In this study, we show that the viral zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso of the major zzso complex zzso class I genes by targeting the class I promoter in zzso containing zzso tumor zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso and specific zzso including zzso zzso and zzso are physically associated with the class I promoter and the zzso of the class I promoter was zzso zzso down of zzso expression with the zzso small interfering zzso induced the release of zzso as well as zzso and zzso from the class I zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso resulted in a dramatic increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso class I zzso expression was zzso on the surface of cells zzso with the zzso zzso but not on that of zzso zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that the zzso protein is associated with the zzso class I promoter and mediates zzso class I zzso by zzso zzso zzso
