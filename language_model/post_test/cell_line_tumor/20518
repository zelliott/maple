We have recently reported a series of synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso ) containing a central zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid that display low toxicity against zzso cells and high zzso zzso In the present study, we have further investigated the effects of increasing the rigidity and zzso of two of our lead zzso by preparing a series of seven to five zzso zzso peptides containing the two most promising zzso zzso acid derivatives as part of the central zzso zzso The peptides were tested for zzso activity against human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity against human red blood cells zzso and zzso against healthy human lung zzso cells zzso The results demonstrated a considerable increase in zzso potency following zzso zzso zzso especially for the shortest derivatives lacking a zzso zzso zzso zzso studies and molecular dynamics simulations together with an zzso and zzso zzso fluorescent zzso showed that the peptides had a membrane disruptive mode of action and that the more potent peptides penetrated deeper into the zzso zzso The need for new zzso drugs with novel modes of action is zzso and development of short zzso zzso peptides with an overall zzso and zzso structure is a promising approach to new zzso zzso
