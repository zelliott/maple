Aurora zzso are potential targets for cancer zzso Previous studies have validated Aurora zzso A as a therapeutic target in multiple myeloma zzso and have demonstrated in zzso zzso effects of small zzso Aurora zzso zzso that inhibit both Aurora A and zzso This study demonstrated that Aurora B zzso was strongly expressed in myeloma cell lines and primary plasma zzso The selective Aurora B inhibitor zzso zzso death in myeloma cell lines at zzso zzso with a cell cycle zzso consistent with that reported previously for Aurora B zzso In some cases, zzso in combination with zzso showed increased zzso activity compared with the use of either agent zzso zzso was active against sorted zzso zzso plasma cells from myeloma patients but also, as expected, was toxic to zzso zzso cells from the same zzso In a zzso myeloma zzso model, zzso zzso growth at zzso doses and induced cell death in established zzso with associated mild, transient zzso zzso shows promise in these zzso studies as a novel treatment for zzso
