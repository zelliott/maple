Until recently, zzso members were almost solely viewed as nuclear proteins with a principal function of zzso zzso dependent zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso cell cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso family that binds and zzso all the zzso complexes, thus often referred as a universal zzso zzso However, emerging studies now suggest that zzso proteins play additional roles outside of the zzso Indeed, previous reports have linked zzso to the regulation of zzso dynamics and cell zzso In this study, we constructed a model of zzso zzso cells by using the zzso zzso a kind of zzso zzso in zzso Our results present evidence that zzso drives zzso cell migration without altering cell zzso Further, actively zzso cells which zzso high zzso of zzso at zzso and induced its zzso zzso In this process, zzso and zzso were also zzso Thus zzso of zzso at zzso is necessary for both zzso zzso and induction of cell zzso These observations solidified a genetic role of zzso in cell migration and this was independent of zzso zzso Eventually, we zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso cells, found that zzso of zzso inhibited cell migration but not cell zzso These data linked zzso of zzso at zzso and cell zzso zzso the major zzso site at zzso of zzso played a pivotal role in the migration of zzso zzso zzso
