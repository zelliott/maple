zzso zzso cell zzso zzso when isolated from zzso tissue or when embedded with zzso zzso is a potent zzso vaccine consisting of numerous zzso shock zzso including the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso regulated protein 94, and zzso We have previously documented that zzso provides both a source of zzso zzso and danger signals triggering zzso presenting cell zzso In this report we describe the zzso of potential zzso extracted from zzso prepared from a zzso zzso Using mass zzso techniques we identify almost 60 different proteins of origin for the zzso zzso we determine that the parental proteins come from essentially all parts of the cell, and are involved in a broad range of zzso Further in zzso analysis demonstrates that the parental proteins are components of major zzso networks of vital importance for cancer cell survival, zzso and zzso In many instances the peptides identified possess zzso acid sequences that would allow their putative binding and display by zzso major zzso complex class I and II zzso and there are also predicted binding motifs for zzso zzso By mixing zzso pools of peptides with zzso zzso zzso zzso we were able to zzso effective zzso activity of the zzso showing that the peptides are indeed the major zzso of zzso zzso zzso
