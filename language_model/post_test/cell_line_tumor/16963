The present study focuses on the correlation between the expression pattern of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 1 zzso zzso in oral zzso cell zzso The study also aims to investigate the interaction between zzso and zzso in oral zzso Furthermore, we also analyzed the zzso significance of zzso zzso and zzso 1 in oral zzso cell zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso 1 were done in 62 cases of oral zzso cell zzso zzso analysis was done to study the possible interaction between zzso and zzso in oral zzso zzso method was used to estimate overall and zzso survival, and the zzso test was used to compare the resulting zzso zzso significant positive correlation was found between the zzso of zzso and the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso zzso zzso no significant association was found between the expression pattern of zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, interaction between zzso and zzso was observed in oral zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso may be related to worst survival in oral zzso zzso significant positive association between zzso of zzso and expression of zzso suggests that they might have dependent roles in maintaining the proliferation of oral zzso zzso In addition, the zzso expression of zzso 1 was related to invasion and differentiation status of oral zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso may be used as independent zzso markers of oral zzso On the other hand, interaction of zzso with zzso may be a key event in maintaining the proliferation of oral zzso zzso The present study indicates that zzso and zzso may be used as independent zzso markers of oral zzso and the interaction of zzso with zzso may be a crucial event in regulating proliferation and differentiation of oral zzso cells, which may be used as a target for therapeutic zzso
