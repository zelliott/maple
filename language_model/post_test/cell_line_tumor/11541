zzso translation initiation is a tightly controlled process responding to zzso availability and zzso zzso Serving as one of the most important negative regulators of protein translation, zzso binding protein 1 zzso binds to translation initiation factor zzso and zzso zzso translation in a zzso zzso Although it has been demonstrated previously that the zzso of zzso is controlled by zzso target of zzso in the zzso target of zzso complex 1, the mechanism underlying the zzso of zzso remains zzso Here, we report the identification of zzso as the zzso of zzso A zzso experiment reveals that zzso binds to zzso in cells and that zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso in zzso and colon cancer zzso cells results in an increase in the zzso of zzso at both the zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the time course of zzso zzso induced by zzso acid zzso or zzso target of zzso zzso is slowed down significantly in zzso zzso zzso zzso the amount of zzso bound to the zzso translation initiation complex is decreased when the expression of zzso is zzso As a result, the rate of zzso translation, cell size, and protein content are increased in zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our study has identified protein zzso zzso as a novel regulator of zzso protein translation by zzso controlling the zzso of zzso
