In this study, zzso extracted from zzso zzso zzso and its combination with human zzso zzso zzso were investigated for the zzso effect on zzso B virus zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso DNA and viral zzso were analyzed by a quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso in zzso zzso The results showed that zzso or zzso alone could inhibit zzso DNA in zzso cells with the 50% zzso concentration zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We further investigated the combination of zzso and zzso for zzso activity and found that they zzso inhibited zzso replication in zzso zzso In combination with zzso zzso zzso the apparent zzso value for zzso was 154 zzso This zzso increase in zzso activity of zzso suggested that zzso could zzso with zzso These results indicate that zzso in combination with zzso might provide a potentially effective therapy against chronic zzso zzso
