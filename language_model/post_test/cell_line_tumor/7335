Although zzso hormone zzso plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the zzso zzso the mechanism of zzso gene expression in the zzso cell is not completely zzso In this study, we examined the zzso regulation of human zzso gene zzso using a human zzso zzso cell line expressing intrinsic zzso In particular, we focused on the involvement of zzso zzso zzso which are known to play an important role in zzso gene expression through the rise in zzso calcium in the central nervous zzso zzso analysis confirmed the expression of zzso as well as zzso zzso in zzso zzso When we introduced approximately zzso zzso of the zzso region of the human zzso fused with zzso reporter gene into the cells, a substantial zzso activity was observed, and this was further increased by the zzso of the zzso zzso We then examined the effect of zzso of zzso by introducing the expression zzso of each zzso revealing a potent zzso effect of zzso but no effect of zzso zzso of the cells caused an increase in zzso promoter activity, which was completely abolished by the treatment with the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso a dominant negative form of zzso antagonized the effect of the zzso zzso Altogether, we conclude that not only the zzso but also the zzso signaling zzso is involved in the regulation of zzso gene zzso Furthermore, zzso is thought to be involved in zzso as well as zzso zzso gene zzso Since the zzso gene is expressed in the zzso cells of the zzso the zzso signaling zzso may play an important role in the zzso regulation of zzso zzso
