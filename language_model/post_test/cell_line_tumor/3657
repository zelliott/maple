The zzso Tax of human zzso leukemia virus type I zzso is the major zzso of viral zzso in infected zzso zzso of Tax under the regulation of the human zzso B promoter in mice results in a zzso disorder resembling adult zzso zzso zzso Tax expression is associated with the production of high levels zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso We examined the role of zzso in zzso by mating zzso mice with a zzso knockout for zzso zzso zzso mice show accelerated tumor onset zzso 4 versus 6 zzso dissemination zzso 5 versus 7 zzso and death zzso 7 versus 10 zzso compared with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso characteristics of tumors from all zzso are zzso except for enhanced zzso 2 zzso zzso and suppressed zzso zzso zzso zzso expression on tumors from zzso zzso transgenic zzso zzso tumors demonstrate enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with those from zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis identified 4 zzso of zzso growth zzso expressed in tumors from zzso mice compared with zzso zzso As confirmed by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso loss of zzso results in zzso of tumor necrosis zzso zzso and tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso while zzso expression of vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso These results provide insight into a possible mechanism by which zzso contributes to host resistance against zzso tumors through an zzso zzso
