We report here the expression and properties of the zzso zzso zzso zzso channel in the zzso human zzso cell zzso zzso zzso currents on zzso cells displayed a mean zzso of zzso zzso at 0 zzso at day 1 after zzso The current was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated the expression of zzso zzso the zzso channel in zzso zzso zzso currents recorded using the zzso zzso had a zzso of 25 zzso a zzso for zzso of 188 zzso at zzso zzso and no zzso zzso We tested whether the zzso channel expression in zzso cells could be the result of an increased zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 5 zzso virtually suppressed the zzso current in zzso zzso zzso treatment also increased the length of cellular processes and zzso the zzso zzso marker zzso A significant reduction of the zzso current zzso was also observed with time in culture, with mean currents of zzso zzso at 1-2 days, and zzso zzso at 5-6 days after zzso This zzso zzso of the zzso current was not accompanied by changes in the zzso activity, as assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated a zzso reduction of the zzso channel zzso resulting from zzso zzso and a approximately 50% reduction with time in zzso
