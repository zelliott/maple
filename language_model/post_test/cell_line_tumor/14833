Human primary zzso integration cluster zzso transcript is the precursor of zzso The zzso of them has been widely observed in the progression of various types of zzso Our objective was to investigate the effect of zzso agents on the expression of zzso and possible signal pathways that involved zzso 

zzso real-time reverse zzso zzso chain reaction was used to measure the expression of zzso Chemical zzso against zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2, protein zzso C, checkpoint zzso 1, and zzso 3 zzso zzso were used for the evaluation of involved signal zzso zzso interference was used to knock down the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and Western zzso was carried out to evaluate the zzso zzso 

zzso integration cluster expression was induced by a representative zzso cancer drug, zzso in human pancreatic cancer zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 and zzso zzso zzso zzso but not the checkpoint zzso 1 and protein zzso C zzso suppressed the zzso of zzso zzso integration cluster zzso was also significantly inhibited by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso interference studies showed that zzso zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso and zzso related was involved in the zzso 

Our results show that multiple pathways can be involved in the zzso of zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso of zzso zzso
