zzso zzso the tumor zzso are attractive targets for developing new cancer zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso support tumor growth in zzso and maintain the zzso of cancer zzso cells in an in zzso model using an established zzso cell zzso We found that zzso is abundantly expressed on zzso This zzso is a cancer stem cell marker in several tumors, but its role in zzso when expressed by zzso has not been zzso It is generally accepted that hypoxic and zzso conditions are triggers of cancer zzso We found that zzso strongly express zzso in hypoxic and avascular areas in the tumor and that its expression on established zzso is zzso under hypoxic and zzso conditions in zzso In addition, zzso zzso in tumor zzso was increased after treatment with zzso of zzso Using zzso and tumor sphere formation zzso zzso from zzso mice were found to sustain the zzso of cancer zzso cells, while zzso zzso did zzso Furthermore, zzso was involved in zzso cancer cell drug resistance zzso In conclusion, our study suggests that zzso on zzso is a functional zzso contributing to the maintenance of cancer stem cell populations in the tumor zzso
