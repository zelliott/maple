For most bacteria, adherence to human cells is achieved by bacterial zzso binding to zzso surface zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified by us as one of zzso zzso cell wall zzso zzso which elicits an zzso immune response in zzso This study zzso the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso as an zzso and its ability to elicit a protective immune response in zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso interference in zzso of three genetically unrelated zzso zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso and two genetically unrelated zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso to zzso type II lung zzso cell was zzso zzso mice were zzso with zzso and zzso after 3 zzso zzso mice were challenged zzso with a lethal dose of zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso cells of three zzso zzso zzso strains and two zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, in a zzso manner zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso produced in mice significantly inhibited bacterial zzso to zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of mice with zzso protected zzso zzso zzso zzso of mice for 5 days and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the mice for 21 days following zzso lethal zzso We have identified zzso as a zzso zzso zzso protein capable of acting as an zzso zzso importance to bacterial zzso was demonstrated by the ability of zzso to elicit a protective immune response in zzso
