zzso play an important role in interrogating molecular processes both in zzso and in zzso However, current methods are limited to measuring average zzso zzso in large cell populations and, as a result, lack the ability to zzso zzso zzso Here we apply a new technique, termed zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso in single living cells, in a standard zzso zzso zzso In this technique, live cells are cultured sparsely on a thin zzso plate and incubated with a zzso Light produced following beta zzso is measured using a highly sensitive zzso zzso zzso revealed strong zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso in single cells, which was found consistent with zzso imaging of a zzso zzso We also verified that dynamic zzso of zzso in single cells followed the standard zzso zzso zzso zzso we zzso cells with a fusion zzso reporter gene and found that zzso of zzso (a PET zzso for zzso zzso coincided with expression of the fluorescent zzso Together, these results indicate that zzso zzso can zzso zzso zzso with zzso resolution, which may find a use in the precise characterization of zzso
