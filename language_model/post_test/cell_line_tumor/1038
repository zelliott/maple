Human zzso zzso zzso plays a major role in escape of zzso cells from maternal zzso Unless its zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line maintained the capacity of zzso zzso For the analysis of function and mechanisms of zzso immune regulation, a human cellular model with suppressed zzso would be very zzso zzso interference zzso is a very elegant method for this approach, but the design of appropriate zzso sequences may provide zzso We designed zzso to interfere exclusively with zzso zzso which were applied at different zzso to 50% zzso zzso zzso After 36 zzso the zzso content in zzso cells was analyzed by Western zzso zzso the described zzso method and zzso the cellular content of zzso was zzso reduced as assessed in several independent Western zzso This method provides a tool for extensive investigation of zzso functions in zzso and if zzso
