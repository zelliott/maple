To prepare a transgenic tumor cell vaccine zzso the fusion gene of zzso zzso colony stimulating factor zzso and human zzso zzso using zzso cells, and explore its specific zzso immunity against zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso expressing the fusion gene zzso was zzso into zzso cells followed by radiation exposure to construct the tumor cell zzso which was used to zzso zzso mice by subcutaneous zzso The mice zzso zzso with zzso cells, cells zzso with the empty zzso zzso or with PBS served as the zzso A week later, zzso cells were injected zzso into zzso mice for establishing the zzso model, and their serum levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected using zzso zzso zzso zzso with the survival of the mice zzso The zzso cells were obtained from the mice zzso with the tumor cell zzso the zzso mice and the normal control mice to assess their zzso against the parental zzso cells in zzso using zzso zzso 

The transgenic zzso cell vaccine zzso with zzso fusion gene was successfully zzso The killing rate of zzso cells by the zzso cells from the mice zzso with the transgenic cell vaccine was significantly higher than those by the zzso cells from the zzso mice or normal control mice zzso vs zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso mice zzso with the transgenic cell vaccine was significantly higher, and serum zzso significantly lower than those of the control groups ( zzso The survival time of the zzso mice injected with the transgenic cell vaccine was also significantly zzso 

zzso tumor cell vaccine genetically modified by zzso fusion gene zzso can elicit specific cellular immune response and enhance the host zzso immune response to extend the survival time of zzso zzso
