To investigate the relationship between zzso expression and cell proliferation and prognosis in gastric cancer zzso 

zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso human embryonic kidney cell line zzso human zzso cell line zzso and surgical specimens of gastric zzso and adjacent normal gastric zzso from 65 patients were included in this zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used to detect zzso expression in gastric cancer cell lines and surgical specimens of gastric zzso zzso zzso was used to determine cancer cell viability and zzso to detect cell zzso zzso survival curve and zzso statistics were used to analyze the relationship between zzso expression and survival of zzso with gastric zzso 

zzso cancer cell lines were mostly negative for zzso zzso and zzso was zzso after the cells zzso with zzso gene by zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in the decrease of cancer cell viability and cancer cell cycle arrest with increased zzso phase and decreased S zzso zzso expression in cancer specimens was zzso zzso significantly lower than the zzso zzso in normal zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso survival was significantly shorter in zzso patients than that in zzso patients zzso zzso zzso but not the overall survival zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly correlated with differentiation and zzso zzso zzso but not significantly correlated with sex, age, tumor size or invasion depth of the gastric zzso 

zzso gene is important for cancer cell zzso The zzso gives cancer cells a high activity for proliferation and zzso and then influences the zzso survival of gastric cancer zzso
