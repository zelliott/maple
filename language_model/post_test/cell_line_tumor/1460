We present zzso a tool for analyzing zzso zzso and dynamics from zzso microscope zzso The tool provides automated quantitative analysis of zzso motion by optical flow zzso and of zzso by zzso of individual branches of the zzso structure of the zzso zzso zzso several features of individual zzso such as zzso zzso and speed, and of the zzso structure, such as zzso area and degree of zzso We validate the methods and apply them to the analysis of sequences of images of zzso human cells with zzso labeled zzso 

zzso code, Windows software and Manual available at zzso 

zzso data are available at zzso zzso
