The tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso protein is a zzso zzso for zzso zzso Ring zzso complexes zzso containing a zzso domain that associates to the zzso zzso zzso zzso targets zzso factor zzso to zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso which also possesses a zzso domain that interacts with the host zzso zzso thereby acting as a viral zzso zzso zzso associates with both zzso and zzso to form zzso complexes targeting the host protein zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso We show that zzso protein expression zzso zzso protein degradation leading to zzso factor zzso stabilization and induction of its downstream zzso We also characterize the zzso mechanism that drives zzso protein degradation via zzso Interestingly, expression of zzso of zzso Signaling zzso zzso viral proteins and cellular zzso proteins leads to zzso protein degradation, in a zzso zzso zzso Our work underscores the exquisite ability of viral zzso to uncover new regulatory mechanisms by zzso key cellular zzso
