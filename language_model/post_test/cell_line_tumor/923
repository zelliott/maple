The candidate tumor zzso gene zzso is zzso in many types of adult and childhood zzso However, the mechanisms by which zzso exerts its tumor zzso functions have yet to be zzso To this end, we performed a zzso zzso screen to identify novel zzso proteins in a human brain zzso zzso zzso percent of interacting clones had zzso to zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso association with zzso and zzso was subsequently confirmed in zzso cell zzso This suggested that zzso may exert its zzso functions through interaction with the zzso We demonstrate that zzso associates with the zzso causing them to exist as zzso circular zzso We found that two naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso in the zzso coding region, zzso and zzso zzso the association of zzso with the zzso The zzso and zzso in addition to zzso showed reduced ability to induce zzso zzso and were unable to protect the zzso against the zzso action of zzso In addition, zzso zzso but not the zzso or the zzso is able to block DNA zzso Our data identify a role for zzso in the regulation of zzso and cell cycle dynamics that could be part of the zzso by which zzso exerts its growth zzso on cancer zzso
