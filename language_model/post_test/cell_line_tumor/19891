Nearly zzso of all pancreatic cancer zzso results from genetic zzso Although abnormalities in sporadic zzso have been zzso little is known about the zzso of zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to identify novel genes expressed in patients with a presumed genetic predisposition or zzso zzso 

We defined zzso zzso as patients having one or more first-degree relatives with zzso zzso of the zzso Using a zzso zzso and enrichment zzso zzso difference analysis zzso pancreatic tumor zzso was zzso from pooled zzso zzso from six such patients zzso and compared to pooled zzso from five normal zzso zzso zzso gene fragments were identified and confirmed to be zzso in familial zzso by comparative zzso Six zzso cell lines, 11 sporadic tumors, 5 neuroendocrine tumors, and 3 chronic zzso zzso were screened to determine the specificity of these zzso 

zzso analysis revealed several sequences of unknown significance and six genes previously described in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 19, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of cell lines and pancreatic tissue types showed varying degrees of specificity for familial and sporadic zzso The zzso gene was zzso in familial zzso 

The pattern of frequency in all screened tissue suggests that these genes are associated with conditions that produce significant zzso responses and are difficult to differentiate from chronic inflammatory zzso zzso A4 is zzso expressed in familial patients, suggesting that the importance of fatty acid synthesis in zzso be investigated zzso
