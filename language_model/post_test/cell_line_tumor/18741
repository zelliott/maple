zzso were carried out to investigate the kinetic characteristics of zzso of zzso by zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso breast cancer cell zzso zzso Cancer cells were mixed with zzso at a ratio of 1:10 and zzso were examined using zzso preparations stained with either zzso or zzso acid and zzso zzso and by using flow zzso A high attachment of zzso to cancer cells zzso was detected as early as 10 zzso Following attachment, cancer cells zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso and zzso cells was significantly higher zzso than that of zzso cells zzso A similar trend was observed with respect to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso by tumor cells was inhibited significantly by both zzso B zzso and by lowering temperature to 4 degrees C zzso zzso was not associated with zzso burst in any cell lines zzso In conclusion, zzso breast cancer cells possess zzso activity which may explain their invasive zzso
