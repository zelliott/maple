zzso of zzso cells zzso combined with zzso zzso tumor cells has shown good therapeutic efficacy in several tumor zzso Nevertheless, the engineering of zzso zzso tumor cell line could represent a tedious step limiting its application for treatment in zzso We therefore developed in rats, an zzso in zzso strategy of combined vaccination using an in zzso local zzso of the tumor as a source of tumor zzso for DC vaccines and an zzso source of zzso We report here that zzso zzso zzso by local injections or surgical zzso of zzso pumps did not allow zzso the therapeutic efficacy observed with in zzso prepared combined zzso To bypass this limitation possibly due to the short zzso of zzso zzso we have generated zzso virus coding for zzso and tested their efficacy to zzso tumor cells in zzso and in zzso The in zzso vaccines combining local zzso and zzso zzso showed high therapeutic efficacy allowing to cure zzso of the rats with zzso tumors, as previously observed with in zzso prepared zzso zzso efficacy has been observed with a second generation of vaccines combining DC, local tumor zzso and the controlled supply of zzso zzso in zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso By generating a successful zzso in zzso vaccination protocol combining tumor zzso with DC vaccines and a straightforward supply of zzso we have developed a therapeutic strategy easily zzso to clinic that could become accessible to a much bigger number of cancer zzso
