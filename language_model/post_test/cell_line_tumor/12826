zzso of zzso growth factor and zzso growth factor signaling play important roles in human zzso zzso zzso leading to frequent zzso of their downstream targets, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Target of zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso analog that has been shown to block zzso and/or zzso zzso in several non zzso tumor cell zzso We investigated in zzso the effect of zzso on cell growth as well as its mechanism of action in human zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso and its in zzso effect in a subcutaneous zzso model with zzso zzso 

zzso induced a time and dose dependent growth zzso in zzso cells through zzso of proliferation and partially through induction of zzso A 50 percent reduction in cell growth was obtained in all three cell lines at a dose of 150 zzso when they were cultured with zzso By contrast, zzso was more potent at reducing cell growth after stimulation with zzso or zzso under zzso conditions, with an zzso ranging from 60 zzso to 85 zzso The drug-induced zzso effect was associated with zzso of zzso A and to a lesser extent of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso induction was related to a global zzso balance with zzso 3 zzso zzso c release, death zzso zzso and a reduced zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso These effects were associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso without reduction of zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso reduced zzso growth from day 5 zzso After 12 days of treatment, mean tumor weight was diminished by 56 percent in the treated zzso 

Our results show for the first time that zzso zzso the growth of human zzso cell lines through zzso of proliferation and induction of zzso which is associated with zzso and zzso zzso The therapeutic potential of zzso in human zzso was further confirmed in a subcutaneous zzso zzso
