Both zzso zzso zzso and zzso V zzso are linked with focal zzso zzso however, their function in this context is zzso Here, we show that zzso binding to zzso zzso functions together with zzso to stabilize focal zzso zzso zzso within zzso and thereby promotes zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso lattice alone zzso zzso and cell zzso However, zzso stabilization in zzso also requires expression of zzso In cells lacking the zzso zzso zzso is not sufficient to promote zzso stabilization, zzso zzso and zzso In human zzso cancer cells, zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange and stimulates de zzso zzso formation in zzso cellular zzso Thus, zzso zzso between the zzso lattice and zzso promotes zzso turnover by stabilizing zzso within zzso defining previously unknown, zzso roles for zzso and zzso in tumor cell zzso
