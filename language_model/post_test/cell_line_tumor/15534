Studies of mechanisms zzso resistance to chemotherapy led to the discovery of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B, member 1), often expressed in zzso cells of patients with acute zzso leukemia zzso Most clinical trials evaluating the strategy of zzso zzso zzso resistance have been zzso clearly indicating the need for a better zzso 

This study investigated the clinical relevance of 380 genes whose expression has been shown to affect the response to chemotherapy, mostly through in zzso studies, in 11 paired samples obtained at zzso diagnosis and at zzso The expression profiling of these 380 genes was performed using zzso quantitative zzso zzso chain zzso Patients had a median age of 58 years at diagnosis, a median duration of complete zzso of zzso days, and a median overall survival of zzso zzso zzso abnormalities were detected at diagnosis in 4 patients, whereas 5 displayed a normal zzso and 2 were not zzso 

zzso zzso shows that samples taken at diagnosis and zzso clustered in pairs for 6 patients of the 11 zzso suggesting recurrence of the same zzso blast, whereas for the other 5 patients, the data indicate their zzso blasts arose from different zzso A zzso analysis of the paired samples led to the striking observation that each had a unique gene signature representing different mechanisms of zzso 

The data underline the need for personalized molecular analysis to tailor treatment for patients with zzso
