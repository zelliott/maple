The production of zzso in the tomato zzso zzso zzso fruit is normally absent or poor, but a number of zzso or zzso lines are known to increase zzso levels in zzso and zzso zzso Through conventional zzso a genetic combination was obtained with the remarkable zzso of a deep purple fruit zzso due to an zzso of zzso on the zzso Such a zzso was named Sun Black zzso as a consequence of its sensitivity to light zzso When characterized for zzso traits, zzso plants showed increased zzso Purple fruits displayed an arrangement of the zzso cells different from normal tomatoes, a feature that could account for different mechanical properties and zzso zzso The zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, its single zzso parents showed the capacity to accumulate zzso in the zzso root when grown under zzso This zzso which was greatly improved by the addition of zzso to the zzso zzso proved to be useful as selection index and gave new insights for in zzso production of zzso zzso To assess the zzso potential of purple tomatoes, we tested the activity of zzso skin extracts on the proliferation of two human cancer cells zzso Cell proliferation was significantly inhibited by zzso extract in a zzso zzso When the zzso of zzso extracts was compared with that of other zzso fruits or vegetables, a significant zzso interaction was zzso suggesting a crucial role for the extract composition in terms of zzso and other eventual cell zzso zzso
