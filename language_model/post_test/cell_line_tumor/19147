zzso zzso growth factor zzso is zzso in the vast majority of human zzso The zzso of zzso not only plays important roles in tumor zzso but also provides a target for tumor treatment with small interfering zzso zzso that targets zzso however, it is unclear whether a quite high zzso of zzso will affect the efficiency of zzso interference strategies targeting zzso A high level expression of zzso was found in zzso cells from a zzso zzso cell zzso In this study, we investigate whether zzso zzso can effectively suppress zzso expression in zzso cells, and study the methods for the use of zzso zzso as potential therapeutic zzso zzso cells with high zzso expression induced by zzso were zzso with zzso zzso The expression of zzso was effectively suppressed by zzso zzso measured by zzso Western zzso analysis and zzso Furthermore, experiments in nude mice bearing zzso zzso zzso were initiated 5 d after injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso were modified with zzso then injected into the tumors, and a zzso zzso zzso system and ultrasound exposure were used to help delivery of the zzso zzso growth was reduced significantly after 3 zzso zzso These studies suggest that zzso zzso still can effectively suppress zzso expression even in tumor cell lines with a relatively high level of zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso modified with zzso can be used as potential agents for tumor zzso
