In our previous study, we found that several tumor cell lines displayed high zzso binding zzso one of which, the human pancreatic zzso zzso cell line, demonstrates high affinity binding of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, zzso cells, as a representative model, were further applied to evaluate various zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We observed quick zzso zzso in zzso cells as well as high binding zzso Furthermore, zzso cells have high expression of zzso zzso genes zzso and show zzso zzso zzso Various zzso zzso zzso were zzso and evaluated in the zzso cell model via in zzso and in zzso zzso We found that all the tested zzso displayed potent zzso ability in zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are most likely to increase sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso Our findings suggest that appropriately defined tumor cell lines may provide zzso relevant zzso evaluations of novel zzso zzso and zzso zzso
