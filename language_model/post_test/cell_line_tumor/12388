zzso zzso growth factor zzso 1 zzso is present on zzso cells and zzso of human tumor cells, raising the hypothesis that zzso factors may promote tumor growth both by inducing zzso and directly signaling through zzso of zzso on tumor zzso Here, we report that zzso is expressed on a panel of 16 human breast tumor cell lines, and the zzso and the tumor cell compartment of a subset of breast zzso zzso and that selective signaling through zzso on breast cancer cells supports tumor growth through downstream zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso proliferation of breast tumor cells was inhibited by specific blockade with an zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso significantly suppressed the growth of zzso zzso zzso and zzso breast zzso in zzso zzso zzso examination of zzso zzso treated tumor zzso showed a significant reduction of zzso of the zzso zzso or zzso pathways in tumor cells resulting in an increase in tumor cell zzso zzso zzso with zzso targeting human zzso on tumor cells and zzso zzso on zzso led to more potent growth zzso of breast tumor zzso The results suggest that zzso receptors may not only zzso zzso but also directly influence the growth of zzso zzso expressing zzso
