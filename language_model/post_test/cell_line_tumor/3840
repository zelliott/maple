zzso imaging enables in zzso zzso of zzso in living organisms and creates numerous opportunities for basic biological research and early disease zzso As zzso zzso for molecular imaging, zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit superior performance compared to conventional fluorescent zzso in many ways, including high tissue penetration depth and minimized zzso and zzso making them particularly advantageous for imaging zzso Although various synthesis methods have been reported, the preparation of high quality, zzso zzso remains zzso For in zzso imaging, zzso on the cell surface are particularly attractive due to their key roles in cellular activity and disease occurrence and zzso However, zzso imaging is a challenging task due to their diverse structures and zzso with genetically zzso fluorescent tagging zzso zzso we report a new type of highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso atom transfer radical zzso zzso for selective cell membrane zzso labeling and cancer cell zzso zzso modification results in controlled growth of zzso zzso on the zzso surface and zzso zzso structure, producing zzso with improved zzso and intact zzso zzso Furthermore, the numerous functional groups on the zzso brush shell provide a large number of binding sites and zzso support for zzso zzso The increased loading density and diversified architecture of the immobilized zzso zzso zzso binding between the zzso and the zzso on the cell surface and leads to selective labeling of highly zzso zzso zzso cells zzso in zzso and successful in zzso imaging of zzso zzso zzso
