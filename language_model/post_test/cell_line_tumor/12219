zzso gene delivery systems are useful for basic research in zzso In these systems, gene expression is regulated by a cassette of regulatory elements within the zzso and the zzso activity differs among cell zzso In the present study, we used zzso and zzso human zzso cell lines to systematically compare the zzso activities of several expression zzso and those of a control zzso made up of a zzso virus 40 zzso promoter, a zzso zzso zzso and an zzso We also found that zzso of zzso elements enhanced zzso activities in the following order: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Of several PA signals tested including those from zzso bovine growth hormone, and the minimal rabbit zzso the latter had the highest zzso activities zzso and zzso over control zzso in zzso and zzso cells, zzso zzso of a second zzso increased the zzso activity in these zzso We also found that gene expression level can be controlled by selecting the expression zzso These results should be useful for further zzso experiments in zzso and zzso zzso
