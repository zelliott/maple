zzso calcium channels are zzso complexes that regulate calcium influx and are important contributors to cardiac zzso and zzso The auxiliary zzso zzso zzso binds a zzso domain (the zzso domain zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso channel gating properties and promote cell surface zzso Recently, members of the zzso family of small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been identified as novel contributors to the regulation of zzso calcium channel zzso Here, we describe the zzso domain within zzso zzso The Rem interaction module is located in a approximately zzso region within the highly zzso zzso zzso domain that also directs AID zzso zzso zzso beta zzso were identified that lost the ability to bind AID but retained their association with zzso indicating that the AID and Rem association sites of zzso zzso are structurally zzso In zzso binding studies indicate that the affinity of Rem for zzso zzso interaction is lower than that of AID for zzso zzso Furthermore, in zzso binding studies indicate that Rem association does not inhibit the interaction of zzso zzso with zzso Instead, zzso beta can simultaneously associate with both Rem and zzso zzso Previous studies had suggested that zzso proteins may regulate zzso channel activity by blocking the association of zzso beta zzso with zzso zzso to inhibit plasma membrane zzso However, surface zzso studies in zzso cells indicate that Rem can acutely zzso channel function without decreasing the density of zzso channels at the plasma zzso Together these data suggest that zzso zzso channel zzso involves formation of a Rem zzso zzso beta zzso AID regulatory complex without the need to disrupt zzso zzso zzso zzso beta association or alter zzso zzso expression at the plasma zzso
