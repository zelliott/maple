By virtue of their accumulated genetic zzso tumor cells may acquire vulnerabilities that create opportunities for therapeutic zzso We have devised a zzso parallel strategy for screening short hairpin zzso zzso collections for stable zzso zzso We zzso from zzso to 20,000 zzso simultaneously to identify genes important for the proliferation and survival of five cell lines derived from human zzso zzso zzso zzso common to these cell lines targeted many known zzso regulatory zzso Cell zzso sensitivities to suppression of protein complexes and biological pathways also emerged, and these could be validated by zzso interference zzso and zzso These studies establish a practical platform for zzso screening of complex zzso in zzso cells and demonstrate that zzso can be used to expose zzso zzso
