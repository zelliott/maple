zzso a targeted zzso comprised of zzso 13 zzso and a zzso form of zzso zzso zzso specific killing of tumor cells expressing abundant levels of the zzso zzso We hypothesized that tumor cells killed by the zzso may release zzso and/or zzso bodies when cells are dying, which then induce adoptive zzso and that the zzso portion of zzso may act as a stimulant for the induction of a zzso zzso 

To test this hypothesis, we established zzso melanoma tumors with or without expression of the zzso chain in both zzso of zzso mice, and then zzso was injected in the right flank tumors zzso 

When animals with zzso zzso tumor (right) were injected with zzso right flank tumors expressing the zzso chain not only showed dramatic zzso but zzso tumors zzso zzso also showed tumor zzso Cell depletion experiments in zzso animals indicated that both zzso and zzso T cells contribute to the zzso of zzso tumors through zzso zzso in the periphery and cellular zzso into zzso In addition, zzso treatment into zzso tumors of mice bearing zzso lung tumors with zzso showed not only the reduction of treated zzso tumor but also the reduction of lung zzso Thus, zzso mediates an zzso effect not only directly but also indirectly by inducing a host zzso T cell immune zzso zzso targeted zzso may be used to treat local disease even if they cannot be administered zzso and yet may still induce a reasonable systemic zzso zzso
