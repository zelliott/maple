The role of zzso virus zzso zzso cycle gene expression in zzso in the zzso of zzso diseases is incompletely zzso The ability to physically separate zzso induced from zzso infected cells from the same population and to examine them in parallel would significantly enhance understanding of the zzso zzso and environmental factors that govern zzso of an zzso cell to zzso cycle induction stimuli at the single cell zzso This study zzso using a flow zzso system, that human serum zzso from individuals immune to zzso zzso discriminate between and can be used to physically separate zzso induced from zzso infected B zzso Using this new quantitative and sensitive technique, two novel observations about zzso cycle zzso were zzso First, the zzso of zzso cycle zzso by zzso zzso zzso is more rapid than induction by a DNA zzso zzso zzso Second, zzso cells which are initially zzso to zzso cycle zzso can be induced upon subsequent exposure to the inducing zzso zzso zzso to zzso cycle induction of a zzso infected B cell is governed by environmental and zzso factors and not by permanent cellular or viral genetic zzso
