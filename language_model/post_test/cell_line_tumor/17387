zzso is a zzso zzso factor essential for pancreatic development and mature beta cell zzso zzso proteins typically recognize short zzso DNA motifs in zzso this binding displays paradoxically low specificity and zzso given the extremely high specificity of action of these proteins in zzso To better understand how zzso selects target genes in zzso we have examined the interaction of zzso with natural and artificial binding zzso zzso of zzso binding sites in several target promoters revealed an zzso zzso pattern of zzso zzso the zzso zzso Using competitive in zzso DNA binding zzso we defined three groups of binding sites displaying high, intermediate and low zzso zzso experiments revealed a striking correlation between the ability of each sequence to activate zzso in cultured beta cells, and its ability to bind zzso in zzso Site selection from a pool of zzso zzso zzso revealed a zzso preference for particular zzso at the zzso locations, resembling natural zzso binding zzso Taken together, the data indicate that the intrinsic DNA binding specificity of zzso in particular the bases adjacent to zzso plays an important role in determining the spectrum of target zzso
