The presence of zzso zzso gene zzso a poor prognosis in zzso zzso We describe validation of a zzso specific zzso and evaluate its association with zzso and prognosis in zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso was raised to zzso downstream of the zzso zzso representing its unique zzso as compared to other Six family zzso zzso were zzso with zzso and Western zzso was performed to demonstrate zzso zzso zzso cancer cell lines were analyzed for zzso zzso and zzso and zzso was zzso zzso cancer tissue zzso zzso were analyzed for zzso by zzso and scored by two blinded zzso The zzso tumors of 15 stage zzso high grade zzso zzso zzso were analyzed with zzso zzso and zzso and expression was compared to clinical factors and zzso 

The zzso zzso is specific for zzso Cell line zzso in zzso mice zzso with zzso levels both by zzso zzso U zzso and by protein zzso zzso absence, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was present in up to zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein expression in zzso zzso correlated with worsened survival in a sample zzso of high grade zzso stage zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso is specific and able to detect zzso in cell lines and tumor zzso zzso protein detection is common in zzso cancer and is associated with zzso and poor prognosis in this group of patient zzso zzso zzso should be further validated as zzso zzso
