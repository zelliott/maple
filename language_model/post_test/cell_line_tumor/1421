zzso combination of zzso drugs is a promising alternative to zzso therapies in zzso In the present study, zzso and zzso were loaded into mixed zzso and tested against zzso sensitive zzso and resistant zzso zzso cell zzso Combination chemotherapy was further evaluated by zzso analyses and combination index zzso Drugs were loaded into zzso by the film casting method using zzso and vitamin zzso zzso characterization studies included the determination of particle size, zzso efficiency, in zzso release zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso The in zzso release of both drugs was slower from the mixed zzso which maintained an zzso efficiency zzso and chemical stability over a storage period of 45 zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso determined by zzso zzso were zzso and zzso respectively, while the combination had an zzso of zzso in zzso zzso In the zzso resistant cell lines, the zzso values of zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso respectively, while the combination had an zzso of zzso The efficacy of zzso and zzso against both cell lines significantly increased when the drugs were zzso in mixed zzso Mixed zzso caused zzso cell death, which was significantly higher than the zzso cell death caused by the drugs in solution against zzso sensitive cell zzso In zzso resistant cell lines, the cell death caused by mixed zzso was zzso as compared to zzso cell death caused by zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso in mixed zzso increased the zzso activity of zzso against resistant and sensitive lung cancer cell zzso
