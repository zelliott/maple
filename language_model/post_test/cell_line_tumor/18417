zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso present in zzso tumor areas might be improved after zzso of tumor cells to zzso a targeted form of zzso To that end, we constructed an zzso zzso designated zzso zzso human zzso fused to a human zzso zzso zzso against the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and preceded by a signal sequence for zzso zzso specificity and zzso activity were retained in the fusion protein zzso by tumor cells infected with zzso zzso of fusion protein from zzso tumor cells within zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso and zzso resulted in growth zzso comparable to treatment with zzso zzso Treatment of well-established zzso human zzso cancer zzso with intravenous injection of zzso zzso zzso resulted in a tumor zzso time of zzso days compared to zzso days for zzso saline zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso before zzso enhanced the growth zzso and increased the tumor zzso time to zzso days zzso zzso zzso while virus alone had no zzso Thus, we have successfully shown that an zzso zzso zzso a zzso targeted form of human zzso can further improve zzso zzso
