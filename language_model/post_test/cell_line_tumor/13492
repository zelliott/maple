It has been shown that the function of zzso cell zzso is suppressed in pancreatic cancer zzso however, the detailed mechanism involved in it remains zzso Here, we used medium zzso by a highly zzso human pancreatic cancer cell line zzso zzso medium zzso to culture human zzso zzso zzso in zzso Both DC differentiation and zzso presentation function were inhibited by zzso The zzso zzso expression is zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso expression partly zzso the zzso defects in differentiation and function of zzso which may be through regulation of zzso zzso Taken together, our findings indicate that zzso zzso expression is one of main factors responsible for zzso of DC maturation and zzso presentation function, and this zzso effect on zzso may be due to the repression of zzso zzso signal zzso by zzso
