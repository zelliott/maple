zzso is a common feature of solid tumors and is associated with their zzso zzso The zzso factor zzso zzso zzso is a major regulator of adaptation to zzso and is implicated in the zzso progression of zzso Here, we studied whether zzso and zzso expression contribute to the development of bone zzso using a zzso animal model of bone zzso in zzso human breast cancer zzso To study the role of zzso in bone zzso we tested the effects of the fusion protein zzso the zzso degradation domain of zzso fused with zzso and zzso zzso selectively induced zzso in hypoxic tumor cells in zzso and significantly reduced bone zzso in zzso We next examined the role of zzso in bone zzso by establishing zzso cells zzso zzso active or zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Bone zzso of zzso were significantly increased with elevated number of zzso blood zzso In contrast, bone zzso were significantly reduced in zzso Because the progression of zzso bone zzso is due in part to the imbalance between bone formation and bone zzso we examined the effects of zzso and zzso on the differentiation of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso markedly inhibited zzso zzso whereas zzso increased zzso cell zzso In conclusion, these results suggest that zzso zzso and zzso expression promote the progression of bone zzso in breast zzso Our results also suggest that zzso and zzso lead to the development of zzso bone zzso by suppressing zzso differentiation and promoting zzso
