The poor prognosis of zzso zzso zzso is largely attributed to their highly invasive nature and zzso plays a pivotal role in regulating zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are small zzso zzso that have been shown to regulate a wide range of biological processes via targeting zzso zzso Previous reports have shown many zzso regulate survival and invasion via targeting zzso in zzso But no literature indicates that zzso regulate zzso cell invasion through targeting zzso Here, we show zzso zzso zzso a poor prognosis in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso specific zzso expression profile zzso positively and 31 zzso correlated zzso with zzso was established via zzso zzso in 60 zzso zzso Among them, two zzso zzso and zzso were chosen for functional validation for their high positive correlation with zzso zzso And zzso of zzso and zzso were demonstrated to reduce the levels of zzso expression and inhibit cellular invasion in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso suppressed zzso cell invasion via targeting zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify the zzso specific zzso signature which may provide potential targets for zzso therapy in zzso
