High expression of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso has been implicated in the development of pancreatic zzso zzso is an orally active and selective zzso zzso zzso zzso that blocks signal zzso pathways responsible for the proliferation and survival of cancer cells, and other zzso processes promoting cancer zzso This study investigated the zzso effect of zzso on human pancreatic cancer cells and the molecular mechanism zzso We first evaluated the effect of zzso on cell proliferation with zzso zzso and the results demonstrated that zzso significantly inhibited the proliferation of pancreatic cancer zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso induced a delay in cell cycle progression and a zzso arrest together with a zzso zzso these were associated with increased expression of zzso zzso zzso inhibitor combined with decreased expression of aurora zzso Besides, zzso reporter zzso revealed that zzso mechanism was responsible for the zzso of aurora B protein by zzso Overall, the results suggest a zzso connection among these events to provide new insights into the mechanism underlying the zzso effect of zzso on pancreatic cancer and supplement a theory basis of zzso in clinical treatment of pancreatic zzso
