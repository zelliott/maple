zzso are important for the acute phase of zzso infection and subsequent persistence in sensory nervous zzso In this study, we showed that zzso zzso were zzso to zzso induction of an zzso state to zzso infection, while zzso did induce an zzso state in zzso zzso This led us to examine the possible role of zzso of zzso zzso zzso in this zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso expression in zzso cells showed a zzso increase for zzso while having a negligible effect on zzso A similar pattern was observed at the level of zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso in zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso A direct effect of zzso on the zzso promoter was shown in a zzso reporter gene zzso We have developed a small zzso zzso of zzso zzso that had both an zzso effect in zzso against zzso as well as a synergistic effect on zzso induction of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso in zzso cells and was less effective than zzso virus in induction of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso plays an important role in the zzso of the zzso effect of zzso in zzso infected with zzso The use of zzso zzso to abrogate this zzso could have a transformational effect on therapy against viral zzso
