zzso zzso zzso zzso nearly all humans and then persists for the life of the zzso In some people who later develop cancer, zzso DNA is present within zzso cells and zzso at elevated levels in the zzso In the current study, we validated five novel quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso zzso targeting disparate but highly zzso segments of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Each zzso was sensitive to as few as 50 copies of zzso DNA per reaction and was linear across at least four orders of zzso When applied to zzso zzso in concert with zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso were the most zzso while use of the entire battery of zzso zzso zzso may help identify zzso zzso or zzso Higher viral loads were found in the 17 zzso compared with the 13 zzso tumors zzso zzso versus 22 copies of zzso per 100,000 cells, zzso The five zzso zzso were also zzso in plasma samples where zzso was measurable in all nine patients with zzso or infectious zzso whereas zzso was zzso in all nine healthy zzso The findings suggest that zzso is an effective method of distinguishing zzso virus from incidental virus in zzso tissue and in plasma zzso
