The literature contains numerous references describing zzso for tumor zzso including cell zzso zzso zzso potential, and response to zzso However, data regarding zzso zzso are zzso In this study, we investigated the degree of zzso zzso zzso present in head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso In addition, we investigated the biological relevance that this zzso may have in the context of zzso directed zzso zzso zzso were harvested from zzso specimens using laser capture zzso zzso Gene expression profiling of the zzso extracted from these specimens demonstrated zzso in the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and principal component analyses zzso demonstrated the presence of unique patient zzso suggesting that there may be two potentially distinct pathways by which zzso induce zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that play functional roles in zzso zzso was performed on the original patient samples as well as a larger panel of normal, zzso and zzso specimens to validate the zzso expression observed in the gene expression profiling zzso Finally, the therapeutic response of zzso tumor zzso to zzso therapy was found to be dependent on the amount of zzso produced by the tumor zzso These findings support the hypothesis of zzso zzso zzso They imply that there are differences with regard to the specific molecular mechanisms by which individual tumors within the same zzso type induce zzso Moreover, they demonstrate the need for a more in-depth understanding of the zzso of the zzso zzso within a given type of zzso when designing zzso targeted zzso zzso Finally, they suggest that studies in conjunction with the ongoing clinical trials that explore the correlation between target expression and clinical outcome are zzso
