The zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in maintaining zzso zzso zzso but in tumors the zzso zzso zzso is often zzso contributing to tumor resistance to radiation and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the first and zzso reaction in zzso zzso and zzso function is controlled by zzso feedback zzso or by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and modifier zzso zzso However, it has recently been reported that the activity of zzso and the formation of zzso can be modified by zzso zzso products derived from zzso zzso Due to the zzso of zzso to zzso modifications by zzso zzso we examined the potential for zzso zzso to zzso zzso and regulate zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso was found to directly modify both zzso and zzso in zzso resulting in a significant zzso of zzso and zzso zzso activity without altering zzso affinity or feedback zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso zzso and formation of the zzso zzso complex while not causing zzso of zzso zzso This zzso could be of particular importance in zzso zzso where zzso necrosis provides an abundance of zzso which can be zzso by zzso zzso zzso to form zzso zzso is expressed at high levels in human zzso tumors and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells results in a significant increase in cellular zzso zzso zzso
