zzso zzso growth factor zzso is a critical zzso factor in solid zzso However, its expression and role in human neuroendocrine tumor development and progression remains zzso 

Using zzso zzso and zzso expression patterns were investigated in 50 cases of human gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumor having various zzso zzso 

It was found that strong zzso expression was detected in tumor cells, whereas no or very weak zzso expression was detected in zzso cells surrounding or within the zzso The levels of zzso expression directly correlated with the expression levels of zzso and zzso zzso Strong, weak, and negative zzso expression was observed in zzso zzso and zzso of cases, zzso Compared with the group with negative zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was associated with zzso zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso The median zzso survival zzso zzso of patients with strong and weak zzso expression were 29 months and 81 months, zzso With a median follow-up duration of 50 months, the median zzso duration for the group with negative zzso expression has not been zzso Compared with the zzso test, zzso expression was associated with poor zzso zzso zzso zzso Using in zzso and in zzso models, human zzso cell lines were treated with zzso a zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso did not inhibit the growth of zzso cells in zzso but significantly reduced tumor zzso and impaired tumor growth in zzso 

The data suggest that zzso of zzso promotes the growth of human neuroendocrine tumors in part through zzso of zzso
