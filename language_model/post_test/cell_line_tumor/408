The cause of the zzso change of normal cellular prion protein zzso into its zzso form is zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso are known to induce protein zzso zzso Here, we investigated whether zzso could induce the zzso change of zzso because zzso contains several zzso motifs and has been found recently in the zzso in which zzso generally zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso 43 zzso in an in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso became zzso K zzso formed zzso zzso zzso and formed zzso that were zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity or zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso eliminated the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in zzso but not zzso mice zzso These results raise the possibility that zzso could represent a zzso mechanism of zzso conversion in zzso
