A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso for zzso zzso zzso In water, zzso zzso into zzso with an average diameter of zzso and shows a zzso quantum yield of zzso zzso zzso zzso reveal that zzso has a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso at zzso in zzso The active zzso group on the zzso zzso allows further zzso of zzso with zzso acid to yield zzso zzso with similar optical and physical properties as those for zzso Cellular imaging studies reveal that zzso zzso has increased zzso by zzso cells relative to that for zzso due to specific interactions between zzso acid and folate receptors on the zzso cell zzso This study demonstrates the effectiveness of zzso as a molecular engineering strategy to yield zzso materials with a large zzso zzso zzso zzso for targeted zzso zzso
