zzso zzso is one of the most zzso and aggressive zzso Increased zzso and zzso of pancreatic cancer cells are believed to be associated with zzso transition zzso However, the molecular basis of zzso in pancreatic cancer cells is poorly zzso In this study, we examined the relationship between zzso zzso protein 2 zzso which is an zzso zzso and zzso in human pancreatic zzso zzso We demonstrated that transforming growth zzso zzso promoted zzso growth factor zzso zzso in zzso human pancreatic zzso cells and that zzso zzso reversed the zzso that was induced by zzso with zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso plays a principal role in zzso through its association with zzso in human pancreatic zzso cells and that zzso may be a molecular target for pancreatic zzso zzso
