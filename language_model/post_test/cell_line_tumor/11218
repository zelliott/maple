Gold zzso zzso were zzso in zzso in a green and rapid method from the reaction of reducing linear and zzso peptides containing zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with an zzso solution of zzso and were evaluated as cellular zzso delivery zzso The zzso or linear nature of the zzso was found to determine the zzso and size of the formed zzso and their in zzso molecular transporting zzso While zzso zzso formed sponge-like zzso linear zzso demonstrated zzso zzso A comparative flow zzso study showed that the cellular zzso of zzso zzso drugs zzso zzso and zzso zzso in human leukemia zzso cells, and a zzso charged zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso cells was significantly higher in the presence of zzso zzso than that of linear zzso parent zzso zzso and linear zzso zzso For example, the cellular zzso of zzso was enhanced zzso by zzso zzso zzso revealed the zzso of zzso in the presence of zzso mostly in nucleus in zzso cells after 1 zzso On the other hand, zzso delivered zzso in zzso These data suggest that zzso penetrating peptides can be converted to efficient molecular zzso through zzso zzso zzso
