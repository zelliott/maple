In human cancer, expression of the zzso family is significantly reduced, and this is associated with shorter survival times in zzso However, the mechanisms leading to zzso zzso in cancer are still largely zzso Since an zzso in zzso is one of the causes of gene deregulation in cancer, we examined copy number zzso of the zzso family in zzso cancer specimens from a high-resolution zzso array zzso We found that there was a reduction in the copy number of zzso genes in a zzso specific zzso zzso focal deletion of four zzso family members was found in three cancer zzso zzso zzso and zzso breast cancer zzso and zzso cancer zzso For example, the zzso locus harboring zzso was deleted in zzso of the specimens from zzso cancer zzso We also found a positive correlation between the copy number of zzso and mature zzso expression in zzso zzso Finally, we showed that restoration of zzso expression dramatically reduced zzso tumor growth in zzso and in zzso Our results indicate that copy number deletion is an important mechanism leading to the zzso of expression of specific zzso family members in zzso breast, and zzso zzso Restoration of zzso expression in tumor cells could provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of zzso
