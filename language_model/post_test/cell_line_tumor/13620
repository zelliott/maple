The purpose of this study was to target zzso cancer cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso against zzso zzso able to recognize zzso and zzso that are located at cell surface in cancer cells whereas they are in the zzso zzso in healthy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coated with zzso zzso zzso were successfully prepared and zzso zzso between tumor cells and zzso or zzso was observed by zzso with zzso labeled zzso and the efficacy of the different zzso was compared by a viability zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso showed a higher binding to the cells even though the zzso rate appeared zzso The effect of zzso on cell viability zzso was compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso in combination with zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso Our data indicate that zzso significantly increase sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso compared to other zzso This study confirms the interest of zzso therapy by targeting cell surface zzso and zzso on cancer cells, and demonstrates the efficiency of zzso zzso zzso to zzso
