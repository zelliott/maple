We investigated the response to high zzso pressure zzso of zzso cells, since zzso is proposed to be suitable to zzso zzso cells in zzso and patient's zzso We observed that cells were not restricted in their viability by pressures up to 100 zzso zzso cells die when treated with pressures of 200 zzso or zzso But the effects of zzso 300 or 400 zzso do not follow the same zzso At 200 zzso cells die in a way that is related to zzso Some zzso characteristics like zzso zzso exposure and zzso zzso appear very zzso Other features like a higher exposure of zzso zzso zzso and pronounced degradation of DNA and zzso zzso are unique features of zzso induced zzso zzso treated with 300 and 400 zzso die immediately following a unique zzso pathway, since treated cells zzso high DNA and zzso degrading zzso
