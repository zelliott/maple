Cancer stem cells zzso are recognized as contributors to cancer progression and therapeutic resistance in liquid and solid zzso We analyzed a panel of human colon cancer cell lines for zzso populations by side population and zzso zzso zzso IGF-1 zzso these putative colon zzso populations in a zzso zzso Chemical zzso of zzso zzso SP cells, and conversely, the zzso of a zzso active zzso version of zzso is sufficient to enrich zzso zzso zzso a fully human zzso with specificity to the IGF-1 zzso is currently being tested in clinical trials for a variety of solid zzso zzso reduces zzso populations in colon cancer cell lines in zzso and reduces tumor growth in zzso We have identified a novel role for IGF-1 in the enrichment of zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso has preferential activity against putative zzso populations and, therefore, may complement current standard zzso regimens that target cycling zzso
