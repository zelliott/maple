Long zzso nuclear zzso zzso are highly repetitive DNA elements that are capable of altering the human zzso through zzso To protect against zzso zzso the cell zzso the expression of zzso proteins by various mechanisms, including zzso zzso zzso of zzso promoters and zzso destruction of zzso zzso In this report, a large number of zzso responsive zzso or zzso DNA binding sites, were detected in zzso elements within the human zzso At least some of these zzso responsive elements are functional and can act to increase the levels of zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein can directly bind to a short zzso sequence within the zzso zzso This zzso responsive element within zzso is a recent addition to evolution, appearing approximately 20 million years zzso This suggests an interplay between zzso zzso which have a rich history of causing changes in the zzso and the zzso zzso the function of which is to protect against zzso zzso To understand these zzso a model is proposed in which the increased expression of zzso zzso by zzso actually increases, rather than zzso the zzso stability through amplification of zzso processes for zzso zzso
