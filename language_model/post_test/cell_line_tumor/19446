To increase the functionality of synthetic genetic circuits for programming cell populations and zzso behavior across a population, we developed and analyzed an artificial zzso communication system in zzso cells using zzso oxide signaling elements by zzso zzso oxide synthesis with the zzso promoter, whose zzso activity could be triggered by the zzso oxide zzso In the system, engineered zzso cells zzso the zzso zzso zzso oxide, which diffused into the environment and activated the zzso promoter, and zzso green zzso protein zzso reporter expression in nearby engineered zzso zzso Next, the zzso module was integrated into the receivers under zzso regulation, resulting in population zzso zzso expression in a zzso zzso This artificial zzso communication system in zzso cells could serve as a versatile tool for regulated gene expression and as building blocks for complex artificial gene regulatory networks for applications in gene therapy, tissue engineering, and zzso
