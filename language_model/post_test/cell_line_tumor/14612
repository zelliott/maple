We designed to investigate the effects of zzso the tumor zzso gene 101 zzso on the proliferation and zzso of the human breast cancer zzso cell line, and the role of the zzso signal zzso in this zzso The zzso against zzso was zzso into the breast cancer zzso cell line using zzso zzso After zzso zzso the proliferation of zzso cells was measured by the zzso zzso The cell cycle distribution and zzso were examined by using flow zzso while cell migration was measured using a zzso zzso The protein level of zzso was further assessed by zzso and western zzso Our results are as following, the zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso proliferated significantly slower and exhibited significantly increased rates of zzso compared to the control zzso In the zzso zzso zzso cells, the percentage of cells in the zzso and S phase of the cell cycle was significantly higher and lower, respectively, compared to the control zzso Moreover, the migration ability of zzso zzso zzso cells was lower than the control zzso Lastly, the level of zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso cells was significantly decreased compared with the control zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso in breast cancer cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso depleted cells are arrested at the zzso transition of the cell zzso The migration of breast cancer cells is also impaired by zzso zzso zzso may play a biological role through zzso of the zzso signaling zzso in breast zzso
