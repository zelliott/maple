zzso growth zzso zzso binding protein 3 zzso is an zzso protein expressed in various zzso including lung zzso This study aimed to identify zzso peptides derived from zzso that can induce zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso for lung cancer zzso Forty human zzso peptides predicted to bind to zzso were analyzed to determine their capacity to induce zzso T cells in zzso zzso transgenic mice zzso We found that three zzso peptides primed zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Among them, human zzso lines zzso to zzso zzso zzso were zzso established from zzso healthy donors and lung cancer zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso and zzso zzso from healthy donors, but did not sensitize zzso in the zzso zzso zzso these two zzso zzso zzso generated from healthy donors and cancer patients effectively killed the cancer cells naturally expressing both zzso and zzso zzso was significantly inhibited by zzso class I and zzso zzso zzso but not by the zzso II zzso zzso In addition, natural processing of these two zzso derived from the zzso protein was confirmed by specific killing of zzso zzso but not the parental zzso cell line by zzso zzso This suggests that these two zzso peptides represent highly zzso zzso zzso that may be attractive targets for lung cancer zzso
