zzso zzso the most common zzso of primary brain tumors, are characterized by high zzso great invasion, and neurological destruction and considered to be the deadliest of human zzso zzso zzso zzso one of scorpion toxic zzso has been shown to have zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso not only zzso the proliferation of zzso cell zzso and rat zzso cell zzso but also suppresses the migration of zzso cells during wound zzso To explain these phenomena, we find that zzso leads to cell cycle of zzso arrested in zzso phase accompanied by suppressing zzso cell cycle regulatory proteins zzso zzso and zzso by means of the zzso protein expression of zzso Meanwhile, zzso significantly decreases the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and further suppresses the zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso These findings suggest zzso inhibit proliferation and migration of zzso cells by arresting cell cycle and interfering zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso
