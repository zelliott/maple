Small cell lung cancer zzso is a rapidly zzso incurable cancer that frequently spreads to zzso New insights are needed to identify therapeutic targets to prevent or zzso zzso zzso zzso Human zzso zzso cells in mouse zzso models home to skeletal and zzso sites, whereas human zzso zzso cells only zzso zzso zzso Because zzso zzso often act as tumor regulators, we investigated their role in zzso models of zzso zzso expression profiling revealed selective and reduced expression of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells, compared with zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso expression correlated with bone zzso zzso whereas zzso expression did zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells significantly reduced cell migration, invasion, zzso colony formation, and zzso induction in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso 10), there were minimal zzso zzso in the majority of mice and none in three zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso zzso key zzso of bone zzso were elevated in zzso as compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells reduced zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, loss of zzso promoted zzso zzso skeletal zzso via deregulation of zzso and zzso pathways and was associated with zzso zzso skeletal zzso 

These zzso findings establish a need to pursue the role of zzso in human zzso with zzso skeletal zzso
