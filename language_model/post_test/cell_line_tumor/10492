Several protein zzso C zzso zzso have been shown to influence different cellular processes that may contribute to the zzso of breast cancer zzso To obtain insight into mechanisms zzso the zzso effects, global gene expression was analyzed in zzso breast cancer cells in which zzso zzso or zzso had been zzso with zzso Gene set enrichment analyses revealed that zzso genes were enriched among genes that increased in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, was particularly zzso following depletion of zzso and was also induced by zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso also led to increased zzso protein zzso The results demonstrate that zzso suppresses the expression of zzso in breast cancer zzso
