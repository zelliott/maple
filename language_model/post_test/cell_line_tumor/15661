zzso zzso zzso are zzso benign tumors but, on rare occasion, can invade adjacent zzso nerves, causing significant zzso especially in association with zzso 2 zzso We aimed to determine the role of the growth factors zzso zzso and the hormone, zzso in promoting such invasive behavior in zzso as well as their mechanisms of zzso 

zzso zzso showed expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso VS zzso Western blots and zzso showed expression of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso an immortalized cell line derived from human zzso zzso zzso invasion zzso were used to study the effect of zzso zzso and zzso on invasive behavior in zzso Western zzso showed levels of zzso and zzso in zzso upon addition of growth factors plus zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed to determine the expression of zzso and zzso after treatment with growth zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in VS tissue and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso increased cellular invasion by 10 and zzso zzso zzso had minimal effect on zzso zzso indicated that zzso is involved in zzso but not zzso invasion, while zzso is involved in both zzso zzso treatment moderately induced zzso but is unlikely to account for the observed zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso may promote invasive behavior in VS through zzso and zzso signaling zzso Further investigation will be necessary to zzso their potential as useful targets in the treatment of zzso
