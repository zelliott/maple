Cancer cells generate more zzso than normal cells under both zzso and hypoxic zzso the so-called Warburg zzso However, the relationship between the Warburg effect and tumor zzso potential remains zzso We intend to investigate whether the higher zzso reflects higher tumor zzso zzso 

We used zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso to compare zzso zzso in zzso in mouse zzso of the highly zzso zzso and the relatively zzso zzso human breast cancer cell zzso We obtained the kinetic parameters of the zzso zzso zzso reaction by three methods of data analysis including the differential equation fit, zzso fit, and ratio fit zzso 

zzso results from the three methods showed that the highly zzso tumors exhibited a smaller apparent forward rate constant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than the relatively zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The ratio fit generated the greatest statistical significance for the difference zzso zzso zzso No significant difference in the reverse rate constant was found between the two tumor zzso 

The result indicates that the less zzso breast tumors may produce more zzso than the highly zzso ones from the injected zzso and supports the notion that breast tumor zzso risk is not necessarily associated with the high levels of zzso and zzso zzso More studies are needed to confirm whether and how much the measured apparent rate zzso are affected by the membrane zzso activity and whether they are primarily determined by the zzso zzso
