zzso zzso canine kidney zzso cells (of zzso zzso zzso have been used to study transport of organic zzso These cells have not been shown to possess zzso zzso Neither has transport activity been demonstrated in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso of zzso zzso type II cells were incubated with zzso zzso of zzso zzso and sodium zzso in the absence or presence of known zzso of zzso resistance protein zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso A zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso potential zzso of the organic zzso transporting zzso zzso zzso zzso were also zzso zzso zzso were identified by zzso liquid zzso zzso or zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso in zzso type II cells were higher than those in zzso human fetal liver, and Chang liver zzso A significant decrease in zzso with a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso was observed with zzso zzso and zzso and with zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso had the opposite zzso 

zzso zzso zzso type II cells provide a suitable system for the study of the zzso processes of zzso zzso zzso and transport of zzso zzso in kidney zzso Based on the action of specific zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso it was concluded that zzso and zzso zzso are possibly responsible for the transport of zzso zzso
