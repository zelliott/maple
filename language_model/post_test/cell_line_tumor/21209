Human zzso zzso zzso which is strongly related to zzso exposure, exhibits high resistance to many zzso zzso zzso zzso deposition in the lung may cause zzso and iron zzso at the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso which is zzso by a decreased availability of oxygen and iron, controls the expression of membrane zzso such as zzso zzso which actively zzso the zzso zzso The present study aimed to assess whether zzso may play a role in the induction of zzso resistance in zzso cells through the zzso of zzso and an increased expression of zzso After zzso incubation with zzso zzso or with the iron zzso zzso or under zzso zzso cells were tested for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and sensitivity to its toxic zzso zzso zzso and zzso caused zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased resistance to zzso zzso and zzso These effects were prevented by the zzso with the zzso iron salt zzso zzso which caused an increase of zzso iron zzso measured as increased activity of the iron regulatory zzso zzso zzso and zzso induce zzso resistance in human zzso zzso cells by increasing zzso zzso activity, through an zzso zzso
