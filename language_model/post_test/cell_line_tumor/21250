Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths among zzso women zzso At the moment the treatment regime is such that patients receive different zzso and/or hormonal treatments dependent on the hormone zzso status, the zzso status and zzso However, in zzso sensitivity testing of tumor zzso could zzso and improve the choice of zzso and hormone zzso zzso devices, using zzso techniques, make detailed cellular analysis possible using fewer cells, enabling working with a patients' own cells and performing zzso and hormone sensitivity testing in an ex zzso zzso This article describes the development of two zzso devices made in zzso zzso to validate the cell culture properties and analyze the zzso of zzso cells zzso zzso positive human breast cancer zzso in response to the drug zzso zzso In both cases, cell viability was assessed using the zzso zzso zzso and the death dye zzso zzso zzso zzso cells could be zzso cultured for up to 7 days in the zzso zzso A 30 zzso flow with zzso and a subsequent 24 h zzso incubation in the incubator induced zzso in zzso cells, as shown by a disappearance of the zzso zzso a decrease in zzso zzso and an increase in zzso zzso This work provides valuable leads to develop a zzso chip to test the zzso of tumor cells in response to zzso and in this way improve cancer treatment towards personalized zzso
