zzso virus zzso infection in zzso causes transformation of B cells and generates B zzso cell lines zzso These zzso have been widely used for the diagnostic of several genetic zzso zzso However, up to now, efficiency of zzso generation has been based on misleading zzso zzso In this study, quantitative analyses have been performed to indicate efficiency of zzso transformation to measuring human zzso acid zzso associated with: zzso type I, zzso disease and zzso type zzso zzso blood zzso cells were isolated from 13 subjects, and zzso were produced by zzso them with zzso for 12 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured before and after zzso in liquid nitrogen for 30 zzso Efficiency of the zzso transformation was screened every 4 days by the zzso of cell zzso cell counts and changes in zzso estimated by flow zzso We observed the generation of 13 zzso Cell transformation was confirmed by the gradual increase of cellular zzso cell size and zzso In addition, we determined that the activity of the zzso mentioned above did not change following zzso These data suggest that our zzso approach for screening of zzso is efficient for the zzso determination of human zzso acid zzso and may thus replace misleading zzso zzso
