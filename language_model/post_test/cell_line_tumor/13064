The concept of sequential zzso which states that successive chemical attacks on cellular constituents can be more deleterious to zzso than normal cells, was evaluated using a series of zzso 1 and related zzso acids 2, which were screened against a panel of zzso and normal cell zzso The compounds proved to be not only potent zzso zzso of the zzso figures are zzso but to display greater zzso to the zzso zzso zzso revealed that both zzso zzso and selective toxicity were increased by a rise in the zzso properties and a decrease in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso concept and evaluation of zzso properties revealed zzso as the lead zzso zzso This zzso activated zzso in zzso cells but not in the zzso cell zzso While zzso caused zzso DNA fragmentation in zzso cells, it did not elicit this effect in either zzso and zzso zzso Clearly zzso exerts its zzso zzso by different mechanisms and such zzso is likely the principal reason for the remarkable display of preferential toxicity towards zzso cells of the compounds in series 1 and zzso
