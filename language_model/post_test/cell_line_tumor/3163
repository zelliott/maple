We examined whether zzso attenuated the zzso potential of colon cancer through the induction of heat shock protein 70 zzso 

zzso cells were separated into four groups: zzso no zzso zzso zzso at 42 degrees C for 1 hour, zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso M for 2 hours, and zzso zzso after zzso zzso We measured cell zzso and the contents of zzso We assessed nuclear zzso zzso status with and without tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso For in zzso study, zzso cells were injected via the tail vein or into a subcutaneous area of mice and the numbers of lung zzso zzso or the volumes of subcutaneous tumors were zzso zzso cells were incubated with zzso Experimental zzso models were then generated and used to assess the fixed cancer zzso 

zzso development in the subcutaneous tumor models and cell zzso were similar among the four zzso However, the zzso plus zzso group had fewer lung zzso zzso in the experimental lung zzso model and higher zzso induction than the other cell zzso The zzso plus zzso zzso group also showed a lower number of fixed cells in lungs and lower zzso of zzso by zzso than the other cell zzso 

It is suggested the zzso potential but not the proliferation potency of cancer cells is inhibited by the transient induction of zzso
