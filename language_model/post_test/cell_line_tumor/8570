zzso zzso has been clinically evaluated for its potential use as an zzso zzso Although zzso is generally thought to inhibit the zzso zzso through zzso of zzso zzso it may also interfere with various other biological zzso Here, to further understand the role of zzso as an inhibitor of tumor zzso we assessed the metabolism of zzso in a human zzso cancer cell line using zzso zzso mass zzso zzso A total of 113 target zzso zzso were identified and 90 zzso of them were zzso Furthermore, we present a new methodology which uses zzso zzso profiling following introduction of an artificial zzso to evaluate zzso zzso zzso Aside from zzso we detected the presence of unique zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso These zzso may be responsible for the zzso of global metabolism in cells and act as various biological zzso
