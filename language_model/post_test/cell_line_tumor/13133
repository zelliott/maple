zzso evidence shows the beneficial effects of fish oil on breast cancer growth and invasion in zzso and in animal zzso zzso of zzso zzso stimulating zzso by breast cancer cells acts as potent zzso of zzso and zzso In this report, we used two human breast cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso to show that the zzso fish oil component zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso and its zzso from these cancer zzso We found that the tumor zzso protein zzso regulates zzso expression through zzso 3 zzso signaling via a zzso zzso The enhanced abundance of zzso zzso in breast cancer cells contributes to the growth and zzso Interestingly, zzso significantly inhibited expression of zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso targets, markedly decreased expression of zzso and its zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso zzso and its zzso were prevented by expression of zzso zzso lacking zzso region zzso and zzso recognition zzso zzso zzso reversed zzso reduction of zzso expression and zzso Finally, we found that expression of zzso as well as zzso was significantly attenuated in breast tumors of mice receiving a diet supplemented with fish zzso Our results reveal a novel mechanism for the therapeutic function of fish oil diet that blocks zzso thereby increasing zzso levels to prevent expression of zzso in breast zzso
