zzso zzso zzso is an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso which degrades zzso including zzso in the zzso zzso was originally added to an oral zzso zzso zzso to yield prolonged zzso zzso in serum and tumor zzso We have already reported that zzso had zzso effects by partially zzso zzso zzso zzso in the repair of DNA double strand zzso We investigated the mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso focus formation of various kinds of proteins involved in zzso was carried zzso zzso for zzso were zzso to zzso cells to investigate the target protein for zzso with zzso zzso zzso was carried out to examine whether zzso depletion by zzso inhibited zzso repair of DNA double strand zzso Tail moments in neutral comet zzso increased in zzso zzso zzso restrained the formation of zzso of zzso and replication protein A zzso whereas it increased the number of zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso When zzso cells were zzso with the zzso zzso before zzso the cells became more zzso The degree of zzso by zzso of zzso zzso was similar to that of zzso zzso did not sensitize zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso significantly reduced the frequency of zzso clones in zzso zzso zzso partially zzso the early step in zzso It was found that zzso is the target protein for zzso by zzso The zzso of zzso such as zzso could enhance the efficacy of zzso through partial suppression of zzso DNA zzso
