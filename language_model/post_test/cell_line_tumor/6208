Emerging evidence suggests that pancreatic zzso is zzso organized and sustained by pancreatic cancer stem zzso Furthermore, elimination of these cells is possible and zzso zzso This study aimed to investigate the expression patterns of pancreatic cancer stem cell surface markers zzso zzso and zzso in pancreatic zzso cell lines and explore the influence of their local zzso 

zzso zzso was used to analyze the expression patterns of zzso zzso and zzso in five pancreatic zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, the capacity for zzso in zzso medium of four cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso Then, the same zzso were performed when tumor cell spheres were zzso The role of sonic zzso zzso in cell spheres from zzso and zzso were also assessed by zzso 

zzso and zzso were detected in zzso Only zzso expression was detected in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were all detected in zzso zzso cell spheres developed in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso This was accompanied by an increase in zzso expression and a decrease in zzso expression in zzso Interestingly, the expression of zzso and zzso returned to initial levels once the medium was changed back from zzso to zzso zzso No significant change in the expression of zzso was detected in zzso Furthermore, the relative zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cell spheres was significantly higher than that in cells cultured in the zzso zzso 

The expression patterns of the pancreatic cancer stem cell surface markers zzso zzso and zzso were diverse in different pancreatic zzso cell lines and changed with their local zzso
