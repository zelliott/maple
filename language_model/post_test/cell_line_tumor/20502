zzso of drinking water is the most successful measure to reduce zzso diseases and protect zzso However, zzso byproducts zzso formed from the reaction of zzso such as chlorine and zzso with organic matter may cause zzso cancer and other adverse health zzso In this study the formation of zzso through a zzso water treatment plant serving a metropolitan area in Australia was assessed using in zzso zzso tools, as well as through zzso of zzso zzso organic zzso zzso characterization of organic matter, and zzso zzso of selected regulated and emerging zzso The water treatment train consisted of zzso sand zzso zzso addition of lime and zzso storage, and zzso zzso toxicity peaked midway through the treatment train after the zzso and storage zzso The dissolved organic matter concentration decreased after the zzso step and then essentially remained constant during the treatment zzso zzso of zzso increased upon initial zzso and continued to increase through the plant, probably due to increased chlorine contact zzso Most of the zzso zzso followed a trend similar to that of zzso with maximum zzso observed in the final treated water after zzso The mostly zzso and zzso zzso formed during treatment also caused zzso toxicity to increase after zzso Both zzso with and without zzso zzso and the induction of the zzso stress response zzso showed the same pattern as the zzso zzso with a maximum activity midway through the treatment zzso Although measured effects cannot be directly translated to adverse health zzso this study demonstrates the zzso of zzso tools to investigate zzso formation in a drinking water treatment plant, despite zzso and sample preparation not yet being zzso for volatile zzso As such, the zzso are useful as monitoring tools as they provide sensitive responses even at low zzso zzso
