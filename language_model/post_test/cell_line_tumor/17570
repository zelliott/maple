zzso acid zzso a natural product isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso tree, was discovered to be a potent zzso zzso using our zzso and zzso zzso screening zzso zzso acid was found to have an zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso The zzso activity of zzso acid was further characterized by a nuclear fragmentation zzso and flow zzso analysis in human breast tumor cells zzso zzso acid was found to induce zzso independent of cell cycle, which is different from zzso that arrests cells in the zzso zzso To understand the zzso relationship zzso of zzso acid, derivatives of 2 with modifications to different function groups were zzso zzso studies of zzso acid, as measured by the zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso double bond of the zzso zzso is important for biological activity, while the zzso and zzso group can tolerate a variety of zzso The importance of the zzso zzso double bond was confirmed by the traditional growth zzso zzso The high potency of 2 as an zzso of zzso its novel mechanism of action, easy isolation and abundant supply, as well as the fact that it is amenable to chemical zzso makes zzso acid an attractive zzso for the development of zzso zzso
