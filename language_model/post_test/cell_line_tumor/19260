In three-dimensional zzso cancer cells move with a rounded, zzso zzso that is controlled by zzso contraction of zzso In this study, we show that zzso is required for zzso of zzso light chain and cell zzso both on zzso gels and in zzso zzso of zzso alters the zzso of zzso and reduces its ability to drive cortical zzso zzso This form of zzso regulation does not require zzso zzso activity, but instead involves direct binding of zzso to zzso at the plasma zzso zzso competes directly with zzso for binding to zzso In the absence of zzso negative regulation by zzso zzso causing reduced zzso zzso and zzso This work zzso a novel zzso role for zzso in regulating cortical zzso and cell zzso
