The zzso effect of a specific small zzso interfering zzso zzso on cell proliferation and the expression of zzso in human prostate zzso cell lines zzso and zzso was zzso To zzso zzso zzso a zzso targeting against zzso was zzso and zzso into zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso expression at both zzso and protein levels were detected by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and Western zzso zzso The zzso activity was determined by zzso zzso Cell proliferation zzso rates were determined by soft zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso on cell cycle distribution and cell zzso was determined by flow zzso zzso zzso interference efficiently suppressed the zzso expression in zzso and zzso zzso At 96 h after zzso the expression zzso rate was zzso at zzso level detected by zzso and zzso at protein level by Western zzso zzso The cell proliferation zzso rates at 24, 48, 96 and 120 h after zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were 5, zzso zzso and zzso respectively for zzso cells and 23, zzso zzso and zzso respectively for zzso zzso The zzso rate was similar for both zzso and zzso and the number of cells was increased in zzso phase from zzso to zzso and decreased in S and zzso phase at 96 h after zzso zzso of zzso results in significant zzso of tumor growth in zzso The zzso of zzso expression can induce zzso of zzso zzso The use of zzso zzso deserves further investigation as a novel approach to cancer zzso
