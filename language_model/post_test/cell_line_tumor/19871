zzso zzso zzso is becoming one of the common zzso tumors worldwide and is characterized by high zzso zzso zzso of new zzso is critical for growth and progression of various human solid zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso growth factor zzso family, and its signal action is zzso through zzso receptors zzso In this study, to understand the role of zzso in relation to zzso in zzso we examined zzso zzso and involvement in zzso of zzso and zzso The results revealed that expression of zzso zzso and tumor growth zzso zzso zzso in zzso was increased by zzso zzso and zzso respectively, as compared with those in the zzso zzso Increased expression of zzso protein was observed in 31 zzso of 51 zzso zzso and the level of tumor growth zzso protein was higher in 17 zzso of 51 zzso specimens than in zzso zzso zzso was predominantly expressed in zzso cells, whereas zzso was observed in zzso zzso cells of zzso in 25 tumors zzso zzso was zzso in all 4 examined zzso cell zzso The zzso specimens showing positive zzso expression in tumor zzso cells had a significantly higher zzso density than those without zzso expression zzso zzso zzso A strong correlation was found between zzso expression in cancer cells and zzso expression in tumor zzso cells zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso of zzso by zzso cells and zzso by tumor zzso cells enhance zzso in a zzso zzso
