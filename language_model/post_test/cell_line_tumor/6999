We previously demonstrated that zzso zzso protein zzso was a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we further showed that zzso an alternative spliced zzso of zzso enhanced zzso function of zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed that its zzso which almost corresponded to that of zzso but not its zzso was able to interact with zzso Additional analysis suggested that zzso and zzso were able to form both zzso and zzso zzso inhibited the zzso formation of zzso and the zzso dot formation of zzso We propose that in the unique regulation system of zzso zzso two spliced zzso of zzso act as zzso and zzso zzso
