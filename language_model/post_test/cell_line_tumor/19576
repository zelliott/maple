Single high dose rate zzso of 4 zzso in zzso cells, derived from zzso cell lung cancer, led to increased activities of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso and zzso The activity of zzso increased by approximately zzso between 1 and 5 h after zzso after which the activity returned to the level of control cells by 8 h after zzso zzso activity also increased by zzso between 1 and 6 h after zzso The decline to normal levels of zzso concurred with a further increase in the activity of zzso 8 h after zzso zzso activity was below control levels during the first 4 h after zzso but rose zzso at 8 and 16 h after zzso The activities of zzso and zzso had returned to approximate control levels 24 h after zzso The observation that zzso zzso activity increased to a very high level after zzso may indicate that the activity of this zzso is not only important for the damage to zzso DNA, the increased activity may also be instrumental for repair of damage to nuclear zzso We zzso that the increase in activity of zzso after zzso is limited to cells in zzso zzso of cells into zzso to replace cells killed by zzso is probably too slow to offer an explanation for the enhanced activity of zzso 8 h after zzso The increase in activity of both zzso and zzso and 2 might be involved in an zzso response of the cells to radiation by zzso of DNA zzso The expression of protein zzso C zzso decreased during the first 5 h after zzso At 5 h after zzso the level of expression had decreased by zzso The decrease in zzso expression is concurrent with the increase in zzso zzso This suggests a role of zzso in the signal zzso from DNA damage to the increase in activity of zzso instrumental in DNA zzso
