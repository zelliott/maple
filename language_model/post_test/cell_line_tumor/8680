The zzso zzso is associated with the zzso of most human zzso zzso its experimental zzso elicits zzso zzso Besides zzso a formidable therapeutic target, zzso also has an essential function in normal zzso thus creating the need for zzso targeting zzso The analysis of zzso zzso activity zzso yields novel targets for zzso zzso Specifically, following regulatory network analysis in human zzso we identify a novel role of the zzso zzso as a regulator of zzso activity and a candidate target for zzso zzso in zzso zzso We found that zzso regulates zzso protein stability and turnover in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso abrogates zzso following zzso zzso zzso whereas its zzso significantly decreases zzso levels and increases zzso Moreover, zzso zzso suppresses growth of zzso tumors in zzso thus providing a novel viable target for treating these zzso
