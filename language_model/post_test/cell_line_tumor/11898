Previous studies have shown that the short arm of zzso 5 zzso exhibit frequent genetic changes in invasive cervical zzso zzso and that these changes arise early during the zzso in zzso zzso These data therefore suggest that loss of candidate tumor zzso genes located on zzso is associated with the development of zzso However, the precise location of zzso deletions is not zzso 

We performed a detailed deletion mapping of zzso in 60 cases of invasive zzso We found that zzso of the tumors exhibit a zzso loss of zzso zzso The patterns of zzso allowed us to identify two minimal regions of zzso one at zzso spanning a zzso zzso genetic distance and a second site of 7 zzso at zzso In addition, we also identified zzso deletions in zzso zzso of high-grade cervical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in zzso of zzso 16 positive tumors, while only zzso tumors with other zzso had zzso zzso The differences in frequency of zzso zzso between tumors harboring zzso in combination with other zzso types and tumors harboring zzso DNA alone were significantly higher, suggesting a synergistic effect of high-risk types in causing zzso zzso 

These findings zzso the presence of tumor zzso zzso on zzso relevant to zzso zzso
