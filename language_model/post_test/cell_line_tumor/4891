zzso is zzso in a variety of human tumors and is involved in zzso and zzso This study investigated the zzso effect of the hairpin zzso small interfering zzso zzso on the expression of the zzso gene in the zzso zzso human lung zzso cell line zzso and the effect of zzso zzso on drug zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and negative zzso plasmids were constructed and zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and Western zzso analysis were used to detect the target gene zzso zzso zzso of cells was detected by zzso orange and zzso zzso zzso Drug sensitivity of the cells to zzso was analyzed with zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso and protein in zzso stable zzso were clearly reduced as compared with negative zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso results indicated that zzso zzso had a higher cell zzso rate than the negative zzso or zzso cells after treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed increased zzso in zzso zzso zzso After the addition of 20 zzso zzso zzso targeting of the zzso gene specifically zzso gene expression in zzso cells, increased spontaneous zzso and zzso cells to zzso The results showed that zzso zzso contributed to an increase of zzso cell death in zzso lung cancer and zzso cells to zzso leading to increased the effectiveness of the drug in treating zzso lung zzso
