To investigate the molecular mechanism of the influence of zzso protein on zzso resistance associated zzso zzso resistance 1 zzso zzso related protein zzso lung resistance related protein zzso in zzso cells and the potential role of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in this zzso 

A cell model zzso expressing the zzso protein was established by zzso zzso of zzso gene into zzso cell zzso The expression of zzso resistance associated genes and proteins was detected by zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso was used to confirm the zzso resistance zzso zzso of zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was measured by Western zzso through comparing the ratio of zzso of zzso to total zzso zzso After treated with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso the zzso cells were zzso Then zzso Western zzso and zzso were used to analyze the zzso in the expression of zzso resistance associated genes and the zzso zzso after zzso 

Compared with the control group, the zzso cells showed a higher expression of zzso associated genes and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were observed in the zzso cells ( zzso zzso revealed that the zzso of zzso associated proteins was due to amplification of such genes zzso zzso fold, zzso zzso fold, zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that the zzso activity was remarkably high in the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso as measured by the ratio of zzso zzso bands zzso to the total zzso bands, was increased by zzso in zzso cells compared with cells zzso with the empty zzso After treated with the zzso zzso zzso the level of zzso associated genes and proteins in the zzso cells decreased to some zzso Compared with controls, a significant decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso was observed in the zzso treated zzso cells after 12 zzso Western zzso also demonstrated that the protein expression of these zzso associated genes slightly reduced after treated with zzso for 12 h zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This change was accompanied with the rise of cell zzso ratio confirmed by zzso zzso zzso The zzso index of zzso cells increased by zzso fold, compared with that of zzso zzso Obviously, the zzso zzso of these cells was obviously related with increased activities of the zzso zzso 

zzso protein might be one of the causes for the occurrence of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso might be involved in this zzso
