The zzso protein zzso plays a pivotal role in regulating cell proliferation and zzso zzso a small zzso zzso zzso blocking interaction between zzso and zzso activates zzso resulting in cell growth arrest or zzso in various cancer zzso However, the molecular basis for the different cellular responses upon zzso treatment is not fully zzso In this study, we show that zzso activates zzso resulting in a dramatic increase in zzso expression and a marked reduction in total zzso protein zzso Interestingly, zzso reduces the levels of zzso zzso and zzso massive zzso in zzso cells, which can be largely rescued by zzso of zzso or by expression of zzso active zzso By contrast, zzso treatment of several human cancer cells, including zzso zzso and zzso results in an zzso of zzso zzso and cell cycle arrest but not zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso of zzso by zzso does not lead to zzso zzso nor does zzso play a critical role for zzso zzso in zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso plays a critical role in influencing cellular response to zzso of zzso zzso by zzso
