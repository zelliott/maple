zzso zzso most of which show an elevated level of vascular zzso cell growth factor zzso zzso are well known for their zzso One of the possible zzso of zzso in tumor cells is zzso oxide zzso which is zzso by NO zzso and stimulates soluble zzso zzso zzso in tumor zzso Here, we report that 2 of 9 human zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and showed increased expression of both or either zzso of soluble zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso into these two zzso cell lines markedly reduced the content of zzso and expression of zzso The zzso activity in zzso was subsequently zzso which was determined by induction of zzso cell zzso Furthermore, subcutaneous tumor formation by zzso cells in nude mice was dramatically suppressed to less than zzso in volume by zzso of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso which was accompanied by the significant decrease in vascular index to about zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso is an upstream zzso of zzso expression in zzso cells and that soluble zzso zzso could be the target molecules for controlling zzso in a subset of human zzso zzso
