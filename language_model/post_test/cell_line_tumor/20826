zzso zzso is a primary zzso tumor of the bone that typically presents in the second decade of life and has a poor zzso especially in zzso zzso zzso signaling contributes to the zzso of tumors such as colon cancer and zzso zzso zzso signaling controls normal bone formation during zzso and zzso in adult organisms, thus we evaluated zzso signaling in zzso 

We surveyed the expression of zzso their zzso zzso and zzso and soluble zzso zzso zzso in four zzso cell lines by zzso We also tested biological response of zzso cell lines to zzso zzso by measuring zzso stabilization, zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso Human zzso tumor zzso were evaluated for expression of zzso by zzso 

All cell lines tested showed expression of at least three zzso and one zzso zzso zzso and zzso treatment induced zzso zzso zzso stabilization and zzso zzso activity in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso cell lines showed better zzso response to zzso than the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso studies of 44 human zzso samples demonstrated that zzso expression correlated with decreased overall zzso 

These results further supports a possible zzso or zzso zzso zzso in zzso potential of zzso
