We recently showed an increase in zzso zzso of zzso in patients with gastrointestinal zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso To understand the phenomenon in more detail, we investigated whether zzso zzso by different zzso zzso leads to a zzso and zzso change in the zzso of zzso zzso and whether zzso zzso is related to changes in cell viability resulting from zzso 

zzso and zzso cells were treated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso as zzso The cell viability and net zzso of zzso after a zzso pulse was determined at different times after drug zzso 

In both cell lines, zzso zzso increased after a zzso treatment with zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased at 24 and 48 h post zzso zzso also produced a similar zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells at all time zzso Cell viability was compromised only after 24 zzso 

Using two types of zzso zzso we have shown an increase in zzso zzso in a zzso manner, a few hours after zzso zzso when the cell viability was not zzso This effect was not seen with a zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso can be used to study zzso zzso in zzso at early time points when cell viability is not compromised and may therefore be helpful in the development of new zzso zzso and in zzso between patients with zzso sensitive to zzso zzso and those unlikely to zzso
