zzso affects zzso of couples and growing evidence from clinical and zzso studies suggests an increasing zzso of male zzso zzso There is a male factor involved in up to half of all zzso zzso The zzso of male zzso can be reflected by defective zzso due to failure in germ cell proliferation and zzso We report here in zzso generation of a germ cell line zzso from the zzso zzso cells by a novel zzso sequential selection strategy and show that the zzso cell line form mature zzso zzso structures, and support zzso after transplantation into recipient zzso To select differentiated germ cell population, we generated a fusion construct zzso zzso the zzso zzso promoter region of germ line specific gene zzso and coding region of enhanced green zzso zzso This region was sufficient to direct gene expression to the zzso stem cells in zzso of transgenic zzso The zzso cells expressed the known molecular markers of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso and zzso characteristic of the stem cell zzso This cell line zzso zzso and can develop into zzso when transplanted into germ cell depleted zzso zzso zzso were viable and functional, as shown by zzso after zzso injection into mouse zzso This approach provides the basis that is essential for studying the development and differentiation of male germ line stem cell, as well as for developing new approaches to zzso engineering and zzso zzso
