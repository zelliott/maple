To investigate the effect of zzso on cell zzso and possible mechanism in human zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cells were treated with zzso at different zzso Cell viability was assessed by zzso zzso Cell zzso rate was determined with flow zzso The zzso activity of zzso and zzso and the expression of zzso were evaluated using zzso and Western zzso The influence of zzso on cell zzso was observed using zzso interference zzso zzso zzso 

zzso significantly inhibited cell growth in zzso cells in a zzso and zzso manner, and induced cell zzso in a zzso zzso Moreover, zzso promoted the zzso of zzso and zzso and inhibited the zzso and protein expression of zzso Through the specific zzso on zzso gene with zzso cell zzso increased, and the zzso was enhanced by the zzso activity of zzso and zzso 

zzso could inhibit cell growth and induce zzso in human zzso zzso zzso cells via the zzso of zzso
