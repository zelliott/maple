zzso between nuclear receptors involved in the control of drug metabolism is being increasingly zzso as a source of drug side zzso zzso is a well known zzso of the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso We investigated the regulation of zzso by zzso a degradation zzso of zzso using zzso zzso zzso reporter gene zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso and drug metabolism analysis in mouse zzso human zzso cells and primary human zzso zzso is a pure zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso In zzso cells, zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso to a zzso form, zzso a specific pattern of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso nuclear zzso and subsequent degradation in response to zzso However, in highly differentiated primary human zzso treated with zzso an zzso of the zzso X zzso zzso zzso behaves as an zzso of zzso zzso of drug zzso zzso by zzso restores the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso analysis reveals that zzso zzso zzso is efficiently converted to zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso a target gene of zzso in primary human zzso but not in zzso cells in which zzso is not zzso This report provides the first evidence for a zzso between zzso and zzso In addition, it clearly shows that conclusions drawn from experiments carried out in cell lines may lead to erroneous in zzso predictions in zzso
