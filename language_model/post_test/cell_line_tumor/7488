Cell cultures have seen much progress in the numbers available cell lines, their applications and culture zzso Three zzso cultures and zzso are examples of strategies that bring in zzso conditions closer to natural in zzso zzso We describe here, the formation of cell zzso in three-dimensional conditions for the cell lines zzso and zzso utilizing zzso zzso The optimal conditions for best zzso formation were identified and the culture zzso for the cell lines as zzso and as zzso were zzso zzso in protein profiles, zzso to a zzso drug and the zzso properties of the protein extracts of the two cell lines, as can be induced by their zzso formation were zzso The results from the four approaches indicate the usefulness of zzso cells as zzso Such systems using simple material and methods offer us an efficient way of utilizing cell lines for a variety of zzso
