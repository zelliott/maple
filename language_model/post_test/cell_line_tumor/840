We assessed whether the zzso zzso could improve the zzso of zzso IX zzso and zzso in zzso cells as well as the depth of treatment of skin zzso on the topical zzso acid zzso zzso 

zzso cells were incubated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for 4 hours, zzso zzso IX content was zzso by zzso and cell viability was assessed by use of the zzso zzso zzso four hours after exposure to zzso In comparison with the pictures before and after treatment, depth of treatment could be determined using a zzso zzso 512 zzso system in paired zzso 

zzso zzso increased with increasing zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Adding 1 zzso of zzso increased zzso zzso zzso over the same period of incubation in the concentration of 1 zzso zzso zzso difference was observed between the zzso alone group and zzso combined zzso zzso group in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell viability after exposure to light decreased with adding zzso zzso a statistical difference in a same zzso above zzso zzso between two groups was demonstrated zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso of treatment of skin zzso were increased in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso could improve the zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could increase the depth of treatment in the zzso zzso
