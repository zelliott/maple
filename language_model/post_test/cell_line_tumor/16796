The zzso tumor zzso protein is a zzso factor that exerts its effects on the cell cycle via regulation of gene zzso Although the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso has been zzso the molecular basis for zzso repression has been zzso The zzso family of zzso factors has been implicated in regulation of cell zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso playing key roles in zzso In response to cellular DNA damage, zzso but not zzso or zzso is zzso in a zzso manner, with zzso being sufficient to increase expression of zzso Indeed, zzso occupies the promoter of the zzso gene after zzso stress, consistent with zzso being a novel zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression abrogates zzso repression of a subset of its targets, including zzso and zzso in response to DNA zzso Furthermore, zzso occupancy of the zzso and zzso promoters is zzso and expression of zzso is sufficient to inhibit cell zzso Taken together, these results show that zzso zzso zzso of its target, zzso leads to repression of relevant gene zzso In turn, this zzso mechanism contributes to zzso cell cycle arrest in response to DNA zzso
