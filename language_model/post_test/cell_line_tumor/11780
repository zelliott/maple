Alternative strategies beyond current chemotherapy and radiation therapy regimens are needed in the treatment of advanced stage and zzso zzso zzso There is considerable promise for zzso agents targeting the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for treatment of these zzso Many downstream zzso of the zzso signaling pathway, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and their roles in zzso zzso have not yet been zzso In this study, we tested the importance of zzso zzso in zzso cancer cell lines and in zzso zzso zzso of zzso by either zzso zzso zzso or specific zzso inhibitor VIII showed zzso and zzso effects on multiple zzso cancer cell lines, with little effect on the immortalized normal zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed a zzso cell cycle arrest in both type I zzso zzso and zzso and type II zzso zzso cancer cell zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to the chemotherapy agent zzso Administration of zzso to zzso zzso mice resulted in partial or complete zzso of some zzso Thus, zzso activity is associated with zzso cancer zzso and its zzso zzso reduces cell proliferation and tumor zzso
