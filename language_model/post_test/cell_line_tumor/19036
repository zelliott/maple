zzso zzso of zzso significance zzso is a common disorder of aging and a precursor zzso to full-blown multiple myeloma zzso The mechanisms underlying the progression from zzso to zzso are incompletely understood but include the suppression of innate and zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso an zzso zzso on natural killer zzso cells, zzso T zzso and zzso class I zzso protein A zzso an zzso zzso induced in zzso plasma cells through DNA damage, contribute to the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso expression is increased on plasma cells from zzso patients compared with normal donors, whereas zzso patients display intermediate zzso levels and a high expression of zzso a protein zzso zzso linked to zzso shedding zzso zzso but not zzso patients harbor circulating zzso which triggers the zzso of zzso and impaired zzso zzso In contrast, zzso but not zzso patients generate zzso zzso zzso that antagonize the zzso effects of zzso and stimulate zzso cell zzso of zzso plasma zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor with zzso clinical zzso activates the DNA damage response to augment zzso expression in some zzso cells, thereby enhancing their zzso by zzso zzso Together, these findings reveal that the zzso in the zzso zzso are associated with the progression from zzso to zzso and raise the possibility that zzso zzso zzso might prove therapeutic for these zzso
