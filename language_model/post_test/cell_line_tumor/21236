zzso cancer cell lines provide ideal in zzso systems for the identification and analysis of prostate tumor zzso and zzso A detailed characterization of the architecture of prostate cancer cell line zzso would facilitate the study of precise roles of various genes in prostate zzso in zzso To contribute to such a zzso we used the zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso array for analysis of zzso and relative DNA copy number changes across the zzso of 11 cell lines derived from both normal and zzso prostate zzso For comparison purposes, we also examined the zzso observed in the cell lines in zzso pairs of clinical samples from 72 zzso Along with zzso maps of DNA copy number changes and loss of zzso for these cell lines, we report previously zzso zzso deletions and zzso zzso in prostate zzso in this zzso The zzso deletions affected a number of biologically important zzso including zzso and zzso identified in this study and zzso reported zzso Although most amplified zzso regions tended to be large, zzso at zzso were of particular interest because the affected regions are relatively small, are found in multiple cell lines, are located near zzso an zzso strongly implicated in prostate zzso and are known to harbor zzso that are associated with inherited zzso for prostate zzso The zzso zzso revealed in this study provide an important catalog of zzso information relevant to efforts aimed at deciphering the molecular genetic basis of prostate zzso
