zzso acids zzso form the zzso end of the bulk of cell zzso zzso They are, therefore, major elements in zzso communication zzso The addition of zzso to zzso requires zzso zzso to zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso This highly zzso zzso is located in the cell nucleus in all zzso investigated to date, but its nuclear function remains zzso Here, we describe the identification and characterization of two zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso one of which is exclusively localized in the zzso We show that the two zzso genes most likely originated from the third whole zzso duplication, which occurred at the base of zzso zzso zzso zzso were maintained in zzso of the zzso zzso whereas one copy got subsequently lost in zzso zzso rainbow zzso In zzso the two genes exhibited a distinct spatial expression zzso The products of these genes zzso and zzso zzso not only with respect to zzso zzso but also in zzso zzso Nuclear zzso favored zzso acid, whereas the zzso zzso showed highest affinity for zzso zzso The zzso zzso was confirmed for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Nuclear entry of zzso was zzso by a zzso nuclear zzso zzso which seemed irrelevant for other zzso zzso With the current demonstration that in zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso we introduce a novel and unique model to detail the roles that zzso has in the nucleus and in the zzso pathways of animal zzso
