This study reports the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for sustained release and targeting zzso The zzso was zzso by air zzso zzso and the effects of several critical factors including concentration of zzso solution, flow rate of zzso solution, flow rate of air, the distance between zzso and calcium bath, and stirring rate of calcium on the particle size of the zzso zzso were zzso For studying the sustained release properties of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was used as a model drug, and we compared the release properties of zzso and zzso using different zzso of zzso zzso and volumes of zzso saline (PBS) buffer zzso The sustained release behavior of the zzso system can be prolonged to 20 days with an optimal condition of 1 zzso zzso to 2 zzso PBS (10 zzso To achieve targeting therapy, an zzso drug, zzso zzso was loaded into zzso and a zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso was zzso onto the surface of zzso for the purpose of specific zzso The results showed that the zzso drug delivery efficiency was greatly enhanced zzso zzso for the zzso drug delivery zzso
