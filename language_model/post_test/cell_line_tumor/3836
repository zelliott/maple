Cancer in bone is frequently a result of zzso from distant sites, particularly from the breast, zzso and zzso zzso is a common and often severe pathological feature of zzso in bone, and is a significant impediment to the maintenance of quality of life of patients living with bone zzso Cancer cell lines have been demonstrated to release significant amounts of the neurotransmitter and zzso zzso zzso via the system zzso zzso zzso We have developed a novel mouse model of breast cancer bone zzso to investigate the impact of zzso cancer cell zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso mice were zzso zzso with the human breast zzso cell line zzso then treated zzso later via zzso pumps inserted zzso with zzso zzso or zzso Both zzso and zzso attenuated in zzso cancer cell zzso release in a zzso manner via the system zzso zzso Animals treated with zzso displayed reduced zzso zzso and an extended time until the onset of zzso evidence of zzso Animals treated with a lower dose of zzso did not display this reduction in zzso zzso These results suggest that a reduction in zzso zzso from zzso in bone with the system zzso inhibitor zzso may provide some benefit for treating the often severe and intractable pain associated with bone zzso
