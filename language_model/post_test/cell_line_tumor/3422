zzso are highly expressed in terminally differentiated cells, but this expression is zzso in various cancer cell zzso Exposure to low doses of zzso zzso is sufficient to zzso zzso suggesting that a mild zzso stress zzso a response zzso zzso and zzso Here we show that this zzso is sustained even after the zzso of zzso zzso After exposure to a zzso dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso lung cancer cells are blocked in the zzso cell cycle zzso After removal of zzso cell death occurs, accompanied with an increase in zzso zzso suggesting an effect of zzso in this zzso Three days zzso treatment, surviving zzso cells were zzso and only a half of them zzso to the culture zzso zzso cells zzso mainly in the zzso cell cycle zzso were still unable to grow and progressively entered in an zzso zzso This study suggests that effects of a low dose of zzso were still present even 1 week after drug removal and that zzso is a good marker of zzso
