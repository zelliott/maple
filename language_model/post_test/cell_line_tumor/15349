zzso as a biodegradable, nontoxic and zzso natural protein is a good candidate for gene zzso In this study, zzso gelatin zzso were prepared and characterized for the expression of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were prepared by the ethanol zzso technique and evaluated for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The prepared particles were zzso in shape with sizes varying from zzso to zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso and greater than zzso zzso zzso The particles were nontoxic to zzso zzso zzso The zzso prepared using zzso gelatin solution zzso with a mean particle size of zzso zzso zzso index zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated maximum zzso efficiency with zzso higher expression compared with the naked zzso 

zzso zzso using zzso gelatin solution had minimal zzso and can be used as a suitable candidate for further gene delivery studies and zzso
