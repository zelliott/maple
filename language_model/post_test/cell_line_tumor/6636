The reaction of zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso R zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso led to the isolation of zzso complexes of the zzso type zzso zzso zzso zzso In all cases, two geometric zzso zzso were formed, as evidenced by zzso zzso and confirmed by X-ray zzso In both zzso the coordination geometry about the metal zzso is a distorted zzso defined by the two nitrogen atoms of the zzso zzso the three sulfur atoms of the zzso zzso and the oxygen atom of the zzso zzso The zzso positions of the zzso are occupied by the oxygen of the zzso group and, in one of the zzso the nitrogen of the zzso zzso of zzso while, in the second zzso the zzso nitrogen of zzso The complexes are stable, neutral, and zzso Complete zzso and zzso zzso assignments are reported for all zzso The synthetic reaction was also successfully transferred at the zzso zzso level by zzso exchange reaction using zzso as precursor in the presence of zzso and zzso The structure of the zzso complex was established by zzso liquid zzso comparison with the analogous zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso serves as a preliminary model for zzso which possesses interesting properties for the development of zzso and zzso zzso for tumor imaging and/or zzso as well as in zzso diagnosis of Alzheimer's zzso
