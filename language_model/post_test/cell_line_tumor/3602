zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso is a newly discovered zzso which plays a key role in tumor zzso This study was to observe zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso on proliferation and invasive potential of human highly zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso 

zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was used to amplify zzso zzso fragments with 2 different restriction sites at its zzso zzso products were cloned into zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso into zzso zzso Changes of cell zzso zzso protein zzso activities of zzso and zzso and cell invasion ability were detected by zzso zzso Western zzso zzso gelatin zzso and zzso in zzso invasion zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso expression zzso zzso was constructed zzso After zzso zzso with zzso proliferation of zzso zzso cells was significantly lower than that of control zzso Compared with control cells, the expression of zzso zzso protein in zzso cells was decreased with a zzso rate of zzso The zzso of zzso was remarkably zzso and the mean invasive cell percentage was zzso in zzso cells, which was far less than zzso in control cells zzso zzso 

Both cell proliferation and invasive potential of zzso cells were inhibited effectively by zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may be a proper molecular target of zzso therapy for human zzso zzso
