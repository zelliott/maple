The new zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso is zzso toward zzso tumor cell lines, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The mechanism of cell death triggered by zzso has been deeply investigated in leukemia cell zzso zzso data indicate a similar zzso membrane zzso between zzso resistance cells and their sensitive counterpart revealing that zzso is not a zzso of the zzso export zzso zzso this zzso promotes a zzso zzso that is unusual in the zzso zzso The primary event of the zzso zzso is the zzso of zzso zzso zzso from the complex with zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, leukemia zzso cells show lower zzso values and a higher degree of zzso and zzso activity than their zzso zzso The increased zzso of the zzso resistance cells toward the zzso action may be related to a lower content of zzso zzso zzso Given the low toxicity of zzso in zzso this compound may represent an attractive basis for the selective treatment of zzso zzso zzso
