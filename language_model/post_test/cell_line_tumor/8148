The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is known to be a major component of the zzso inclusions characteristic of zzso lateral sclerosis and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso Although zzso is a nuclear zzso it disappears from the nucleus of affected zzso and zzso cells, implicating zzso loss of function in the zzso of zzso Here we show that the zzso of zzso in differentiated zzso cells inhibited zzso outgrowth and induced cell zzso In zzso cells, the zzso family members zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and membrane zzso of these molecules was zzso In addition, zzso depletion significantly suppressed protein zzso a key regulating factor of zzso family activity and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso the cellular damage caused by pharmacological zzso of zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso partially restored cell viability and zzso outgrowth in zzso zzso zzso In zzso our data suggest that zzso plays a key role in the maintenance of zzso cell zzso and survival possibly through protein zzso of zzso family zzso
