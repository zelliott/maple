The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso were constructed by alternating deposition of zzso at high pH and zzso at low zzso The exponential growth of the zzso was proved to be amplified by increasing the pH difference between the two deposition zzso The exponential growth zzso of zzso assembled at different pH were zzso as reservoirs for loading a zzso zzso factor zzso zzso The zzso laser scanning zzso zzso results indicated that the zzso zzso could diffuse throughout the zzso growing zzso zzso The amount of zzso embedded within zzso could be adjusted by both zzso assembly pH and the zzso loading zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso means that the zzso film was constructed by using zzso at pH a and zzso at pH zzso the zzso zzso film can be loaded with more zzso zzso at the same loading pH zzso The excess of positively charged zzso zzso within zzso zzso film could not only be ascribed to its extraordinary thickness but also be attributed to its zzso negative charge density enhanced by the pH difference between film buildup and zzso loading zzso zzso of the zzso loading pH from zzso to zzso which increases the pH difference between zzso assembly and zzso loading process, enhances the zzso charge density within zzso zzso film and zzso the zzso density from zzso to zzso zzso Compared with direct zzso assembly of zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso into zzso zzso film was loaded much more zzso The zzso of zzso into a rapid growth zzso can be more favorable to load and zzso release functional zzso The cell culture results indicated that the zzso embedded within the film maintained the ability to traverse across the zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso film was more efficient than the equivalent amount of free zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso within an exponential growth zzso can serve as an effective approach for localized and sustained zzso zzso
