To investigate the influence of zzso cells zzso on the prevalence and function of regulatory T cells zzso in zzso induced killer zzso zzso 

The blood samples of 20 patients with solid tumors were zzso The peripheral zzso cells zzso were zzso zzso cells were added into the culture fluid without zzso cells zzso zzso and the culture fluid of regular zzso respectively, and the proliferation and zzso of the zzso cells were detected by zzso method and with the cells of human lung zzso breast zzso colon zzso and zzso as target cells zzso zzso cells were added into another culture fluid of zzso cells at the proportions of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, then the proliferation and zzso of the zzso cells were detected as described zzso zzso zzso was used to detect the surface markers of zzso zzso To identify the influence of zzso on the zzso activity of zzso zzso were isolated from the patients with solid tumor to culture the zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells were harvested on day 7 and zzso with the zzso cells zzso zzso The frequency of zzso in zzso was determined by flow zzso The zzso was examined by zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were analyzed by zzso 

The rates of the main zzso cells in zzso cells zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the regular zzso cells and zzso cells zzso zzso method showed that the zzso towards tumor cells of the zzso cells The rates of the main zzso cells in zzso cells zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the regular zzso cells and zzso cells zzso zzso method showed that the zzso towards tumor cells of the zzso cells was higher than that of the regular zzso cells zzso zzso zzso however, after the addition of selected cells, the zzso of the zzso cells zzso zzso zzso showed that the proportions of zzso zzso cells in the zzso cells and zzso cells were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso After the DC induction the zzso of zzso cells was significantly higher than that of the regular zzso zzso zzso showed that after DC induction the levels of zzso and zzso of the zzso group were significantly lower than those of the regular zzso cells zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the level of zzso was significantly higher in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso regulatory T cells inhibit the zzso activity of zzso zzso The interaction between zzso cells and zzso is sufficient for the zzso of the properties of regulatory T zzso zzso cells have the desirable properties for zzso approaches, especially after zzso with zzso
