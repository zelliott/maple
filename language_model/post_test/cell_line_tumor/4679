zzso zzso zzso zzso expression has been described in human zzso including zzso zzso We here report zzso and zzso regulation of zzso expression in chronic zzso leukemia zzso using zzso analysis zzso and zzso quantitative real-time reverse zzso chain reaction zzso In 3 zzso cell lines, expression of zzso zzso within the zzso zzso cluster is specifically zzso zzso to zzso by both zzso treatment and zzso zzso interference zzso In addition, zzso zzso reduces zzso expression in zzso cells in which zzso can specifically repress reporter gene zzso as demonstrated by specific zzso zzso with zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso increased zzso partial resistance against zzso zzso and enhanced sensitivity to zzso cell zzso Finally, we determined zzso expression in zzso normal zzso zzso zzso early zzso zzso zzso zzso 24), and zzso zzso zzso zzso 7) zzso zzso cells and found zzso of zzso zzso transcripts in zzso and mature zzso in zzso but not in BC zzso These data are in accordance with a zzso zzso that mediates enhanced zzso expression in zzso but not BC zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression may contribute to the zzso of the disease and may provide potential targets for therapeutic zzso
