Taking into account the rising trend of the zzso of zzso of various zzso effective therapies are urgently needed to control human zzso The rapid emergence of hundreds of new agents that zzso an ever-growing list of zzso molecular targets offers tremendous hope for cancer zzso However, almost all of the chemotherapy drugs currently on the market cause serious side zzso Based on these facts, the design of new chemical entities as zzso agents requires the simulation of a suitable zzso zzso The zzso not only should have the required potency but must also be safer on normal cell lines than on tumor zzso In this perspective, zzso scaffolds with zzso zzso activity profile have fueled intense academic and industrial research in recent zzso This paper is intended to highlight the recent advances along with current developments as well as future outlooks for the design of novel and zzso zzso agents based on zzso zzso
