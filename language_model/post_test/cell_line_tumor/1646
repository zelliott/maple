zzso cancer therapy has been extensively developed to improve the quality of treatment by reducing the systemic exposure of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso targeting agents are widely investigated because they offer zzso in particle size, drug release profile and zzso 

Here, we have prepared targeted zzso zzso composed of a zzso zzso zzso zzso quantum dots and zzso and targeted them to zzso zzso zzso cells with a zzso zzso 

zzso characterization of zzso zzso showed stable particles with sizes of zzso zzso In zzso drug release and blood contact studies showed a sustained release profile, with limited zzso In zzso zzso and cell zzso studies were carried out in zzso zzso and zzso cell lines using zzso zzso zzso zzso fluorescent microscopic images and zzso 

Our studies revealed higher zzso activity and zzso in cell lines that zzso the zzso zzso All these results suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be used as a potential zzso against zzso
