To achieve the zzso expression in sufficient amounts of therapeutic genes for successful and safe gene therapy, natural zzso promoters can be used to direct the expression of therapeutic genes in the liver, whereas strong viral enhancers were used to obtain sufficient amounts of expressed therapeutic gene zzso However, very often use of either the former or the latter does not guarantee both potent and zzso therapeutic gene zzso Here we conglomerate them and thus create a potent zzso promoter by characterizing and using the zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso harboring its zzso box and a zzso binding zzso Alone it hardly activated its reporter gene expression in zzso or zzso However, in the presence of the zzso viral zzso zzso which is active in multiple cell types, it was able to zzso activate its reporter gene expression specifically in zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso by the viral zzso was attributed to zzso binding to the zzso Taken together, these results support the idea that the zzso active zzso could be used to activate the zzso in a zzso manner in the presence of zzso To our knowledge, this is the first study to zzso zzso and its binding site, in the context of the zzso to generate a zzso promoter that is zzso activated zzso in a zzso manner by a viral zzso that is active in multiple cell zzso
