zzso to their applications in zzso and molecular zzso zzso zzso fluorescent zzso are being extensively zzso Most of the existing zzso zzso exhibit poor quantum yield, which zzso their translation to zzso and clinical zzso zzso zzso are known to act as tiny antennae for efficiently focusing the electromagnetic field into zzso zzso The zzso zzso from zzso zzso can be enhanced by more than thousand times by precisely placing them in proximity to gold zzso We have employed zzso zzso zzso using zzso assembly as zzso zzso for precisely tuning the distance between gold zzso and zzso zzso The aspect ratio of the gold zzso was tuned to match the zzso localized surface zzso resonance wavelength with the zzso maximum of the zzso dye to maximize the zzso enhanced zzso The design criteria derived from this study lays the groundwork for zzso zzso bullets for in zzso and in zzso molecular zzso
