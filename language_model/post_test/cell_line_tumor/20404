Hu zzso R zzso is an zzso protein belonging to the zzso zzso It is highly expressed in cancer and involved in cell survival and zzso The impact of zzso regulation of zzso and resulting cellular effects are poorly zzso In the current report, we describe a direct interaction between zzso and zzso in zzso We determined that zzso specifically zzso zzso at the zzso 202 zzso in the unique hinge zzso The molecular consequences of this interaction are an altered zzso ability to zzso zzso and promote translation of zzso At the cellular level, the anomalous zzso zzso at this site evokes robust defects in zzso zzso and cohesion as well as arrest of cell cycle zzso zzso zzso and zzso technique confirm a direct integration of zzso and zzso with zzso We propose that zzso stores zzso in the zzso and that zzso zzso by zzso controls de zzso protein synthesis in near proximity to zzso and, thus, impacts zzso zzso
