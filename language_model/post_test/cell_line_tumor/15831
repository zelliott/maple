zzso stress fiber assembly and zzso in zzso zzso cells requires zzso of zzso regulatory light chain zzso zzso and zzso are zzso by zzso zzso which is targeted to zzso fibers by the association of its regulatory zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso protein zzso In the present study, we identify the zzso zzso as a second protein targeted by zzso to zzso zzso Association of zzso with zzso increases zzso zzso and promotes formation of stress zzso This activity does not require the zzso activity of zzso but is dependent on both zzso and zzso indicating that the zzso association zzso fiber zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels are strongly induced by stimuli increasing zzso fiber formation, and zzso is required for fiber maintenance in zzso growing cells, implicating zzso in a zzso loop regulating zzso stress fibers independently of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso The identified zzso association reveals a novel mechanism for the maintenance of zzso stress fibers through zzso zzso and, together with recent results, implicates the zzso proteins as important regulators of the zzso zzso acting in both a zzso and zzso zzso
