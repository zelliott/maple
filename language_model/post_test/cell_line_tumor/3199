Novel agents that target multiple aspects of zzso zzso zzso signaling are desirable for zzso and treatment of prostate cancer zzso We aimed to identify compounds isolated from medicinal herbs as such drug zzso 

In the zzso human zzso sensitive zzso cell model, we tested five compounds zzso from zzso zzso zzso in the range of zzso zzso for growth zzso and zzso specific zzso zzso suppressing zzso We determined the relationship between these activities and zzso tumor zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso of zzso We compared these compounds to the zzso drug zzso to identify zzso zzso 

Among 3 zzso compounds, zzso decreased zzso and zzso zzso and protein levels in zzso cells and inhibited zzso zzso zzso from the zzso to the zzso This compound also increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells, but required higher dosage than for suppressing zzso Interestingly, this compound did not inhibit the growth of zzso zzso prostate zzso zzso The zzso compound zzso suppressed zzso and zzso in zzso cells without zzso 

Our data support novel zzso actions of these herbal compounds distinct from zzso and merit further investigation as drug zzso
