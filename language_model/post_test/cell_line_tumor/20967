The presence of organic pollutants in wastewater zzso and their possible impact to the environment contribute to decrease interest for the agricultural spreading of zzso It is thus important to have a better overview of sewage sludge quality in terms of organic zzso content and zzso zzso It is also necessary to better understand the impact of zzso composting processes on the zzso and toxicity zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso aromatic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and linear zzso zzso zzso zzso and some of their associated toxic effects were determined at different stages of a composting process zzso respectively, chemical analysis and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso X zzso reporter cell zzso zzso zzso were higher in the final zzso than in zzso due to dry matter reduction through zzso Mass balance calculation shows a positive impact of the zzso treatment on the removal of the most zzso zzso The three zzso activities were measured in both zzso and in the initial and final zzso zzso activity increased whereas zzso and zzso X activities zzso The difficulty in zzso chemical and zzso results zzso the importance of combining both approaches in order to improve the assessment of the zzso zzso
