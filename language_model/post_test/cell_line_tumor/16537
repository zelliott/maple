zzso Associated zzso 80 zzso is a zzso of the zzso complex and targets zzso to DNA damage sites in response to DNA double strand zzso Since zzso of zzso are associated with familial zzso zzso we screened 26 zzso zzso cell lines for zzso zzso and found that zzso cells harbor a zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso generates a stop zzso at zzso which zzso the partial zzso region and the zzso zinc fingers of zzso Interestingly, both the zzso and wild type zzso of zzso lose their expression due to promoter zzso suggesting that zzso is a zzso cell zzso In these cells, not only is the zzso complex zzso but the relocation of the remaining zzso in the zzso complex including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is significantly zzso Moreover, zzso cells are hypersensitive to zzso radiation, which is due to the compromised DNA damage repair capacity in these zzso zzso of zzso cells with wild type zzso zzso these cellular defects in response to DNA zzso Thus, our results demonstrate that zzso is a scaffold protein in the zzso zzso Identification of zzso as a zzso zzso tumor cell line will be very useful for the study of the molecular mechanism in DNA damage zzso
