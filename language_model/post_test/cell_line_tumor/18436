zzso growth factor zzso zzso signals to zzso zzso zzso a role for zzso in modulating zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso controls zzso zzso and may have other roles that zzso zzso zzso To clarify the role for zzso and other zzso zzso in regulating zzso function, we have generated and characterized a new zzso zzso to zzso zzso as well as a novel zzso zzso system for analyzing roles of individual zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso growth factor induced striking zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso localized to zzso junctions and zzso and was significantly enhanced in cells around the colony zzso A screen of zzso cell lines revealed that some contain unusually high steady state levels of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso activity in tumors may affect zzso by zzso cross talk to zzso zzso Despite these zzso zzso of zzso and other prominent zzso zzso zzso sites did not noticeably reduce the ability of zzso to assemble junctions and induce zzso of cultured zzso Although zzso cells display significant zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso our data suggest that these account for only a fraction of the steady state activity that targets zzso zzso and that zzso family zzso are not necessary zzso for zzso growth zzso signaling to zzso zzso
