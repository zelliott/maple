The human protein zzso which belongs to the zzso zzso associated with various cellular zzso family, is zzso in several zzso and its zzso in zzso leads to zzso cell growth arrest and zzso making it a good target for cancer zzso In particular, high levels of expression were found in zzso zzso for which the therapeutic arsenal is rather zzso The three-dimensional structure of zzso has been resolved zzso revealing a zzso assembly with one zzso zzso zzso in each zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso zzso virtual screening of zzso commercial molecules was conducted into the zzso site formed by a zzso of zzso in order to prioritize the best zzso zzso to the in zzso zzso a versatile and sensitive zzso zzso was set up to measure the disruption of the zzso activity of zzso This zzso allowed the determination of zzso zzso for more than 20 zzso compounds, resulting in the identification of four zzso presenting an zzso constant in the zzso concentration zzso Three of them inhibited zzso cell zzso The association of virtual screening and experimental zzso thus proved successful for the discovery of the first zzso zzso of zzso
