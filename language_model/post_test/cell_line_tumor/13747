zzso zzso play a key role in cancer zzso by zzso zzso numerous target genes involved in cell zzso migration and zzso The zzso region in zzso zzso that encompasses zzso is frequently deleted in solid zzso including zzso however the expression and functional role of zzso has not been previously studied in zzso Here, we zzso the expression status and performed functional characterization of zzso in melanoma zzso and cell zzso We found that zzso of zzso was a common event in melanoma tumors and cell lines and was associated with zzso loss in a subset of zzso zzso of zzso gene expression was also a result of zzso zzso by DNA zzso and via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in various melanoma cell lines inhibited cell migration and zzso zzso targets include zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and the melanoma specific zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso resulted in zzso of zzso and a zzso of its target gene zzso increased expression of zzso was associated with melanoma progression and overall patient zzso Taken together, our study supports a tumor zzso role for zzso in melanoma and identifies novel therapeutic zzso
