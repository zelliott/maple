A rigorous zzso modeling procedure employing zzso PRO zzso has been zzso for the prediction of more efficient zzso zzso Experimental data concerning the effect on leukemia zzso cell line tumor growth of 34 compounds zzso at a dose of 10 zzso was related to their chemical structures by a zzso zzso zzso Four zzso and zzso derivatives zzso zzso 8, zzso predicted as active by this model, together with 11b predicted to be of low activity, were zzso and screened for zzso activity utilizing 55 different tumor cell zzso zzso 8 and zzso showed zzso properties against most of the adopted cell lines with growth zzso exceeding zzso The highly promising preliminary zzso properties of compounds 8 and zzso were screened at serial zzso zzso zzso for determination of their zzso and zzso against the screened human tumor cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is more effective than compound 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso against the target leukemia zzso cell zzso zzso zzso also exhibits highly pronounced zzso properties against zzso zzso zzso cell lung zzso zzso 205 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus zzso could be a suitable lead towards the design of broad spectrum zzso active agents targeting various human tumor cell zzso
