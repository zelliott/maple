The embryonic zzso zzso factor zzso is zzso expressed in a range of human zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that zzso is a driver of the zzso transition zzso a process associated with cancer zzso zzso expression in human tumor cells enhances tumor zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso resistance to various conventional zzso including chemotherapy and zzso These zzso and the selective expression of zzso for a range of human tumor types zzso normal adult zzso make zzso an attractive tumor zzso Due to its zzso zzso and the zzso character of zzso factors, available options to target zzso are currently zzso Here we report on the development and characterization of an zzso platform for the efficient targeting of zzso tumors consisting of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vaccine zzso as zzso that expresses the full-length human zzso zzso We demonstrate that human zzso cells treated with zzso zzso can activate and expand zzso zzso and zzso T cells in zzso that, in turn, can effectively lyse human tumor cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso of mice with zzso zzso is also shown here to elicit zzso zzso and zzso zzso responses, and to induce zzso immunity in the absence of zzso Based on these results, a Phase I clinical trial of zzso is currently ongoing in patients with advanced zzso to our knowledge, this is the first vaccine platform aimed at targeting a driver of tumor zzso that has successfully reached the clinical zzso
