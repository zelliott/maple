zzso zzso is a potent tool for specific gene zzso In this study, we developed an zzso for conditional replication in zzso tumor cells that uses zzso expression of a zzso directed against essential zzso zzso Compared to a control virus that expressed a scrambled zzso zzso zzso selectively attenuated viral replication in cells with zzso active zzso but not in zzso tumor cells where both viruses zzso zzso Since these results were confirmed by an in zzso comparison of both viruses after infection of zzso and normal mice, we could demonstrate that attenuated replication was indeed a result of zzso exhibition of zzso zzso Addressing the therapeutic zzso we could show that the application of zzso virus efficiently zzso zzso tumors in zzso and in zzso but resulted in drastically reduced load of zzso in the liver of treated zzso We have generated a broadly zzso zzso for selective destruction of zzso tumors and thereby demonstrate that zzso zzso represent an efficient and versatile tool to modify viral zzso zzso can be applied to all zzso regulated zzso to zzso viral zzso and thus provide means to generate specifically replicating zzso for clinical zzso
