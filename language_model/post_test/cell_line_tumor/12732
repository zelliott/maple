zzso peptides have been considered as potential candidates for cancer zzso We report here the zzso of a library of 66 zzso zzso on human zzso cell lines, and their effects on zzso zzso assessed by zzso of zzso zzso zzso and cell signaling proteins zzso and zzso in cultured human cervical zzso zzso A design of experiments approach permitted to analyze the results of a subset of 16 peptides and define rules for high zzso activity against zzso breast zzso zzso Eight peptides were identified with zzso values ranging from zzso to zzso zzso against the five cell lines tested, being zzso cells the most zzso Among these zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso displayed specificity and high zzso against zzso cells zzso of zzso zzso showed low zzso activity and low zzso to zzso zzso and were stable to zzso in human zzso zzso of zzso by these peptides was observed and the zzso effect of zzso and zzso caused a marked decrease on the activated form of zzso zzso and an induction of zzso We further showed that zzso at low doses zzso the zzso effect of zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso may represent novel zzso agents providing a new strategy in cancer zzso
