zzso of zzso zzso or group A zzso zzso into host cells is zzso by zzso bound to surface zzso zzso or zzso forming a bridge to zzso zzso This interaction leads to zzso zzso and zzso of zzso We zzso that zzso zzso zzso which directly associates with zzso is the universal link between zzso and several bacterial zzso We showed that zzso of zzso expression by zzso zzso or zzso zzso activity by chemical zzso or expression of a dominant negative form of zzso reduced zzso invasion of zzso cells up to zzso To evaluate the zzso requirement for zzso zzso invasion, a zzso zzso strain within the zzso background was zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity also significantly reduced invasion of zzso cells by this zzso and zzso strain zzso that expresses zzso In addition, impaired zzso zzso activity results in significant reduction of zzso invasion zzso by zzso of two other important zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This study suggests that bacterial pathogens evolved different molecules and strategies to exploit the host zzso zzso zzso for their zzso
