zzso zzso 2 zzso interacting protein zzso is a member of the zzso protein for zzso the zzso signal zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of human zzso zzso levels was detected in prostate cancer cells due to the zzso zzso Here, we isolated a mouse zzso gene with a highly zzso sequence to that of the human and rat gene and mapped it at zzso zzso The zzso gene contains 14 zzso and 13 zzso and spans approximately 65 zzso zzso contains at least three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of mouse zzso encompasses zzso zzso containing several unique protein interaction motifs as well as a zzso zzso domain, which shares a high zzso with both humans and zzso Data from real-time zzso analysis revealed a diverse expression pattern of the zzso gene in various zzso zzso differential regulation of this gene from various zzso We have mapped a zzso segment containing a zzso region from zzso zzso as a promoter region zzso in zzso zzso cell lines zzso this region is highly zzso and zzso appears to be a zzso zzso It appears that zzso regulation, particularly zzso zzso of the zzso gene promoter, plays an important role in modulating its gene expression in the mouse prostate cancer zzso
