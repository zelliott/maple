zzso zzso is involved in various steps of cancer zzso In this report, we describe real-time imaging of zzso zzso molecular dynamics in human zzso zzso cells in zzso and in zzso We first generated zzso cells expressing zzso zzso green fluorescent protein zzso by zzso of an zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso When zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were seeded on a dish coated with zzso which is bound by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed by zzso zzso zzso When the zzso zzso zzso cells were seeded onto zzso zzso zzso zzso was diffuse within the zzso When zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso were zzso transplanted into the zzso of nude mice, the cells aligned along the collagen fibers within the tumor and had punctuate expression of zzso zzso In the zzso model, the invading zzso cells had zzso zzso zzso in the muscle tissue at the primary tumor zzso These results show that zzso zzso enables the imaging of the molecular dynamics of zzso zzso in zzso cells in zzso and in zzso
