zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso consistently detects significant differences in zzso zzso zzso of zzso versus benign breast zzso It is critically important to understand the molecular causes underlying these zzso differences, because this may identify novel targets for attack in cancer zzso In this study, differences in zzso membrane metabolism were characterized in breast cancer cells and normal human zzso zzso cells zzso labeled with zzso using zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso between membrane and zzso pool of zzso zzso were assessed by exposing cells to zzso for long and short periods of time to distinguish between zzso and anabolic pathways in zzso zzso Gene expression analysis using zzso was performed to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these zzso Breast cancer cells exhibited increased zzso zzso P zzso zzso total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with normal zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso of breast cancer cells compared with zzso indicating a higher zzso flux from membrane zzso to zzso and zzso in breast cancer zzso zzso zzso and zzso C were significantly zzso and zzso 1, zzso zzso and zzso D were significantly zzso in breast cancer cells compared with zzso The magnetic resonance zzso data indicated that elevated zzso in breast cancer cells was primarily attributable to increased zzso zzso activity and increased zzso zzso by increased zzso C zzso These observations were consistent with the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso C detected in the zzso zzso
