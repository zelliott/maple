The early growth zzso zzso is crucial in many cell regulatory processes related to the progression of human zzso Its zzso has been demonstrated in variable human zzso and may have zzso zzso The aims of this current study were to evaluate whether zzso affects invasive and zzso zzso of human gastric cancer cells, and to examine the relationships between its expression and various zzso zzso including survival in human gastric cancer zzso We investigated the zzso role of zzso in tumor cell behavior by using a small interfering zzso in human gastric cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso The expression of zzso by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso Western zzso and zzso was investigated in human gastric cancer zzso The zzso of zzso suppressed tumor cell migration and invasion in zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly increased in human gastric cancer and zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to the normal gastric zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Positive expression of zzso was significantly associated with tumor size, depth of invasion, zzso zzso zzso tumor stage and poor zzso These results indicate that zzso is associated with human gastric cancer progression through the zzso of tumor cell behavior, such as migration and zzso zzso expression may help in predicting the clinical outcomes of human gastric cancer zzso
