Brain tumors are one of the most lethal and difficult to zzso Their treatment is limited by the inadequate delivery of zzso drugs to the zzso In order to overcome this zzso the possibility of the zzso direct transport zzso was evaluated using zzso zzso as a model zzso zzso The direct transport of zzso zzso to the zzso fluid zzso was examined by comparing the concentration of zzso in the plasma and the zzso after zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The brain zzso of zzso was evaluated based on a zzso analysis by measuring the concentration of zzso in the plasma and in the zzso The feasibility of zzso chemotherapy was examined by three zzso zzso of zzso to zzso rats in zzso at two day intervals with zzso application as a positive zzso zzso showed a significant zzso effect on the in zzso growth of zzso zzso cells with 50% growth zzso concentration at zzso zzso The zzso studies clarified the significant direct transport of zzso from zzso cavity both to the zzso and to the zzso zzso chemotherapy with zzso significantly reduced the tumor weight as compared to zzso control and zzso zzso The strategy to zzso the zzso direct transport can be zzso to a new therapeutic system not only for brain tumors but also for other central nervous system disorders such as neurodegenerative zzso
