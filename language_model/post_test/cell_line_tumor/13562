The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is fundamental for cancer cell proliferation and is known to be frequently altered and activated in zzso including zzso zzso Based on the high frequency of zzso targeting components of the zzso signaling zzso is considered to be a promising therapeutic approach for cancer zzso Here, we have investigated the potential of targeting the axis of the zzso growth zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling in two common zzso of zzso zzso the most common zzso tumor in children and zzso the most frequent zzso childhood brain zzso By treating zzso and zzso cells with zzso a specific humanized zzso zzso against the zzso we could observe cell zzso responses and in some cases a strong decrease in cell zzso In contrast, targeting the zzso zzso with the specific inhibitor zzso resulted in broad zzso effects in a panel of zzso and zzso cell zzso Additionally, zzso to commonly used zzso agents occurred in zzso cells upon treatment with zzso or zzso Furthermore, by studying the expression and zzso state of zzso downstream signaling targets we found zzso signaling zzso zzso In addition, zzso occurred in zzso tumor cells after treatment with zzso or zzso Together, our studies demonstrate the potential of targeting the zzso signaling axis in zzso zzso zzso this knowledge will contribute to the development of urgently required new targeted therapies for zzso zzso
