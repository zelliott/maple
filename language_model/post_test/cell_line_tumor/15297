To investigate the possible biological function and mechanism of zzso in the zzso of human zzso zzso zzso 

Using zzso to predict the target gene of zzso the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso gene was cloned into zzso zzso zzso reporter gene zzso was employed to examine the repression of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression levels in zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso were zzso and the changes in the cell migration ability was assessed by zzso invasion zzso 

zzso prediction indicated the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso as a target gene of zzso and zzso reporter zzso showed that zzso directly combined with the zzso of zzso zzso and Western zzso demonstrated that the expression of zzso in zzso cells was zzso correlated to zzso and suppressed the migration of zzso zzso 

zzso can inhibit the invasion of zzso cells by negative regulation of zzso zzso which sheds light on the role of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso
