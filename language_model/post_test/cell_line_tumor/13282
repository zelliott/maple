zzso zzso have been reported to induce zzso in various types of cancer cells, stimulating the development of zzso as a cancer zzso or zzso zzso It was recently reported that zzso can induce zzso however, the mechanism for this remains zzso In the present report, we carried out zzso studies of the mechanism involved in zzso zzso using zzso extracted from black soybeans zzso zzso 3, zzso zzso clearly induced hallmarks of zzso including zzso zzso formation and the conversion of zzso to zzso in zzso human zzso zzso The induction of zzso was accompanied by the zzso of multiple protein zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso B zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso While chemical zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso failed to inhibit zzso zzso the suppression of zzso by compound C zzso as well as zzso against zzso reduced zzso zzso The treatment of zzso resulted in a decrease in zzso zzso contents and the zzso of zzso by zzso treatment also induced zzso It is noteworthy that the reduction of zzso via the zzso of zzso resulted in enhanced zzso in zzso zzso In addition, zzso against zzso box zzso zzso a downstream target of zzso suppressed zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased zzso in zzso zzso zzso it can be concluded that zzso induce zzso in zzso cells via zzso of the zzso zzso and protect cells from zzso zzso via the zzso zzso These results also suggest that zzso agents could contribute to the efficient development of zzso as zzso zzso
