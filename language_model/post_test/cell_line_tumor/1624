zzso zzso factors are implicated in diverse cellular zzso The founding member, zzso is endowed with contradictory activities, being able to promote zzso progression and induce zzso However, the mechanisms that zzso the opposing outcomes of zzso zzso remain largely zzso We show here that zzso is directly zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and that zzso zzso is responsible for regulating its zzso and functional properties, which impacts on zzso growth zzso Thus, depleting zzso causes increased zzso protein levels, which zzso with decreased growth rate and associated zzso zzso zzso influences zzso protein stability, and the enhanced zzso of a variety of downstream target genes reflects increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in zzso cells, and a reduced level of zzso is evident under DNA damage conditions that allow zzso stabilization and give rise to zzso zzso in a zzso of zzso cancer, high levels of zzso frequently coincide with low levels of zzso and reflect a poor clinical zzso Our results establish that zzso zzso regulates the biological activity of zzso activity, and raise the possibility that zzso zzso contributes to zzso by influencing the zzso zzso
