The zzso is a complex of zzso components of the zzso playing critical roles in cell zzso shape generation, and mechanical properties of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and intermediate zzso are major constituents of the zzso which constantly change their organization during cellular zzso The zzso zzso is especially zzso as zzso filaments can form multiple higher order zzso performing different zzso zzso information about zzso organization is critical for understanding its functions and mechanisms underlying various forms of cellular zzso Because of the zzso thickness of zzso zzso electron zzso zzso is a key tool to determine the structure of the zzso article describes application of rotary zzso (or metal zzso zzso for zzso of the zzso The procedure is zzso to thin cultured cells growing on glass zzso and consists of zzso extraction of cells to expose their zzso chemical fixation to provide stability, ethanol zzso and critical point drying to preserve zzso rotary zzso with platinum to create contrast, and carbon coating to stabilize zzso This technique provides easily zzso three-dimensional images, in which individual zzso fibers are clearly zzso and individual proteins can be identified by zzso zzso More importantly, replica zzso is easily compatible with live cell imaging, so that one can correlate the dynamics of a cell or its zzso zzso expressed fluorescent zzso with high resolution structural organization of the zzso in the same zzso
