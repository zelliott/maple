The zzso zzso zzso plays a central role in prostate cancer progression to the zzso zzso lethal zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso that increases in expression with disease progression and is zzso with the zzso in prostate zzso cells, where it may enhance zzso zzso Here, we zzso that the zzso zzso zzso zzso can suppress zzso of zzso and zzso prostate tumor zzso Treating zzso prostate cancer cells with zzso in zzso zzso suppressed the enhanced zzso zzso seen with zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited cell growth and decreased survival in zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on zzso of zzso and cell zzso was also observed in zzso prostate cancer cells zzso expressing zzso In zzso studies demonstrated that serum zzso zzso and tumor growth rates elevated zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were reverted to control levels with zzso zzso In zzso mice, treating zzso tumors, expressing zzso zzso with zzso delayed progression to the zzso state from 6 to 10 weeks, while serum zzso and tumor growth decreased zzso and zzso zzso Our study is a first time demonstration that zzso can abrogate zzso of zzso in prostate cancer cells and tumors, decrease serum zzso reduce tumor growth and delay zzso zzso Since zzso is clinically approved, it may be readily used as a novel therapeutic strategy to suppress zzso zzso activity and delay prostate cancer zzso
