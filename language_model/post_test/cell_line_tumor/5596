Bone zzso is a frequent and catastrophic consequence of prostate cancer for which only zzso treatment is zzso Animal models of bone zzso prostate cancer are necessary for understanding disease mechanisms but few models zzso 

We have used the zzso prostate zzso cell line zzso to generate a bone zzso model of prostate zzso zzso zzso injection of zzso cells followed by isolation of cells from bone tumors has yielded a cell line with strong zzso potential, zzso bone zzso zzso 

This cell line zzso to multiple zzso sites in over zzso of injected zzso mice and is far less zzso to soft zzso Bone tumors produced by the zzso cell line show no preference for particular skeletal sites as most bones are zzso zzso and zzso zzso show that zzso cells form zzso tumors, but with evidence of zzso zzso In zzso the zzso cells express zzso but not zzso do not form colonies in soft zzso are zzso but are more zzso than the parent cell zzso 

This model provides a novel means for identifying cellular and molecular mechanisms that contribute to bone zzso and allow for zzso testing of therapies to prevent and treat tumor zzso to zzso Finally as the zzso tumor cells are injected into zzso mice, this model will provide a means to study interactions between the immune system, tumors and bone, and therapies that target such zzso
