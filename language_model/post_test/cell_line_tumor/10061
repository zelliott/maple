The zzso checkpoint has evolved to prevent zzso zzso by delaying zzso when zzso zzso are zzso zzso severe zzso segregation errors by zzso the zzso checkpoint causes cell zzso Here we have analyzed the consequences of gradual increases in zzso segregation errors on the viability of tumor cells and normal human zzso zzso reduction of essential zzso checkpoint components in four tumor cell lines caused mild zzso zzso but no zzso These cells were, however, remarkably more sensitive to low doses of zzso which enhanced the amount and severity of zzso segregation zzso zzso to zzso was achieved by reducing levels of zzso or zzso proteins having dual roles in checkpoint zzso and zzso zzso but not by reducing zzso functioning solely in the zzso zzso Moreover, we find that zzso human zzso with reduced zzso levels could not be zzso to zzso doses of zzso Thus, targeting the zzso checkpoint and zzso alignment simultaneously may selectively kill tumor cells by enhancing zzso zzso
