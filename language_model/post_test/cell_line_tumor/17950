zzso and zzso of various cell lines is a widespread problem that can lead to zzso scientific zzso DNA zzso is a powerful identification technique, which can be effectively used for the zzso of human cell zzso In contrast to human cancer cell lines, little attention has so far been given to establishing zzso practices for zzso cell zzso Since the majority of zzso stem from zzso animals, they have high genetic zzso which reduces the zzso of DNA zzso In the present study, we propose zzso zzso sequencing as a method of choice for zzso zzso zzso This method focuses on the most diverse characteristic of zzso cell lines and thereby achieves a very high zzso zzso The sequencing of zzso variable regions has proven to be especially suitable for routine use because of its high success zzso Two other possible zzso methods, random amplified zzso DNA analysis and two-dimensional gel zzso were also zzso Compared to these and other methods that can be used for discrimination between zzso cell lines, zzso sequencing has many advantages, most notably those of a very high zzso power, zzso to changes in experimental conditions, simple data analysis, and accessibility to most zzso
