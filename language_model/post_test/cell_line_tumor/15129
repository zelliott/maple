zzso stem cell transplantation zzso is an established treatment for multiple myeloma zzso a plasma cell zzso To identify an improved zzso conditioning regimen, we investigated the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso combinations toward zzso cell lines and patient cell zzso A strong zzso of the two zzso zzso when combined at their approximate zzso zzso was zzso This zzso could be partly due to the observed zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso resulting in enhanced zzso of zzso and zzso Their zzso correlated with a robust zzso of the DNA damage response zzso zzso decreased the zzso membrane potential with a zzso release of zzso factors into the zzso and nucleus and the zzso of zzso Exposure of zzso cells to zzso also decreased the level of zzso zzso zzso which might have resulted in zzso stress, as reported zzso and caused a zzso cell zzso A reduction by approximately 50% in the zzso of zzso and zzso was observed in the presence of zzso zzso a zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso cell lines with zzso zzso exhibited greater resistance to zzso and Clo, supporting a role for the zzso protein in these zzso zzso Our results provide a rationale for clinical trials incorporating zzso combinations as part of conditioning therapy for high-risk patients with zzso undergoing zzso
