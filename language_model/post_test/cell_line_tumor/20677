zzso zzso of pancreatic cancer is a predictor of poor zzso However, the molecular mechanisms are largely unknown, thus, making the development of appropriate cell lines and experimental models critically important for future zzso The purpose of the present study was to establish a zzso cancer cell and mouse model with high zzso zzso zzso for in-depth study of the underlying zzso The zzso zzso derived from the zzso human pancreatic cancer cell line, was established through serial passages in nude mice via zzso zzso The zzso was able to develop notable zzso zzso in zzso of the recipient mice 8 weeks after tumor cell zzso Compared with the parental zzso cells, zzso cells were more aggressive, displaying invasive zzso increased migration and invasion ability, and zzso zzso gene zzso including zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso were also observed in zzso cells by zzso zzso Thus, the newly selected zzso zzso can serve as a unique model for further study of zzso zzso of pancreatic zzso
