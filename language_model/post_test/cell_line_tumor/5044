zzso zzso zzso is the founding member of a family of zzso that catalyze the addition of zzso units to proteins that mediate DNA repair zzso zzso radiation zzso DNA strand breaks, suggesting that zzso zzso may sensitize tumor cells to zzso 

We investigated the combination of zzso zzso with radiation in lung cancer zzso zzso a novel potent zzso zzso was used to explore the effects of zzso zzso on zzso tumors and tumor zzso 

zzso reduced zzso survival in zzso lung cancer cells, and inhibited DNA repair as shown by enhanced expression of DNA strand break marker zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso contributed to the mechanism of increased cell zzso Additionally, zzso increased tumor growth delay at zzso doses in zzso zzso For a zzso increase in tumor volume, tumor growth delay was 1 day for zzso alone, 7 days for radiation alone, and zzso days for combination zzso zzso zzso of tumor sections revealed an increase in terminal zzso zzso zzso labeling zzso zzso and a decrease in zzso zzso zzso after combination zzso zzso zzso showed a decrease in in zzso zzso zzso formation with zzso combination treatment, and von zzso factor zzso of tumor sections revealed decreased vessel formation in zzso suggesting that this strategy may also target tumor zzso 

We conclude that zzso zzso shows promise as an effective means of enhancing tumor sensitivity to radiation, and future clinical studies are needed to determine the potential of zzso as a radiation zzso
