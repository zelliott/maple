zzso zzso zzso zzso also known as human zzso 8, is associated with several zzso disorders, including zzso zzso primary zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso An early zzso gene of zzso encodes viral zzso zzso a viral zzso of the zzso zzso and an zzso growth factor human zzso In this study, we examined the effects of suppressing zzso expression in zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso that have a modified backbone and enter cells zzso Treatment of zzso cells with a zzso designed against zzso zzso led to a marked reduction in the proportion of zzso cells detected by zzso zzso Analysis by Western zzso confirmed a specific reduction in the zzso protein level and showed that the reduction was dependent on the dose of zzso zzso zzso cells treated with the zzso zzso exhibited reduced levels of cellular growth, zzso expression and zzso DNA, and an elevated level of zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with a combination of two zzso zzso compounds targeting different sequences in the zzso zzso led to an zzso effect that was greater than that achieved with either zzso zzso These results show that zzso targeting zzso zzso can zzso reduce zzso protein translation and indicate that further exploration of these compounds in an animal model for potential clinical application is zzso
