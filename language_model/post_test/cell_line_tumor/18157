zzso is a zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso cassette family of drug zzso zzso is expressed in wide variety of cells and limits zzso of zzso into the body or zzso however, it is also expressed in many cancer cells and can render zzso cells resistant to many zzso zzso zzso is well studied as a zzso resistance zzso but little is known regarding its other role in zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated zzso function in zzso cell zzso We silenced the zzso gene in zzso cells by using an zzso interference method that employed short hairpin zzso The result showed that zzso of zzso gene suppressed zzso cell proliferation in zzso and induced the passage of the cell cycle into the zzso zzso Furthermore, in a mice zzso zzso formation zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells inhibited zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso plays a role in regulation of zzso cells zzso
