zzso oxygen species are known to be involved in several cellular zzso including cell zzso zzso is a key zzso in the conversion of zzso oxygen species and has been implicated in a host of disease states, including zzso Using an zzso zzso approach encompassing zzso zzso and zzso we have defined the role of zzso in multiple zzso We show that the zzso promoter is zzso in several cell lines and there is a zzso decrease in zzso Furthermore, myeloma patient samples have decreased zzso expression compared with healthy zzso zzso of zzso results in decreased proliferation and altered sensitivity to zzso DNA damage and zzso zzso profiling revealed regulation of 65 zzso including genes involved in zzso and zzso analysis identified zzso of the zzso zzso Analysis of nearly 400 activated zzso factors identified 31 zzso factors with altered DNA binding activity, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso zzso of data from our gestalt molecular analysis has defined a role for zzso in cellular zzso zzso zzso and regulation of several zzso zzso
