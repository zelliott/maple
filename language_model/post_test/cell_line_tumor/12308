We found that excessive zzso zzso and/or zzso affected the process of zzso zzso and zzso zzso production by cells of the zzso cell line, zzso Excess zzso induced both zzso zzso and zzso production in the zzso On the other hand, excess zzso reduced this zzso rise in both zzso and zzso production in zzso Next we measured the zzso levels of zzso genes such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso bone zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso factor 2 zzso in zzso zzso Excess zzso increased the zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels, and excess zzso reduced the zzso increase in the zzso zzso level in the zzso The changes in the zzso zzso level paralleled those in the zzso protein zzso These data show that zzso and zzso regulated the zzso zzso positively and zzso respectively, in zzso cells and suggest that excess zzso might inhibit the excess zzso zzso zzso by zzso induction in zzso
