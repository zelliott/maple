Our previous study has demonstrated that the zzso zzso 4 zzso signaling pathways contribute to the induction of tissue factor zzso expression by zzso zzso I zzso in human acute zzso leukemia cell line zzso In this study, we focused on the identification of the downstream targets of the zzso zzso When zzso cells were treated with zzso complex, enhanced zzso expression was observed, along with induced zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso When the activity of zzso was blocked by their corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso was reduced zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was inhibited significantly by zzso a blocker of the signaling zzso zzso by the zzso domain of zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso was also able to partially inhibit the zzso of the zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso and zzso were the crucial downstream targets of the zzso zzso signaling pathways in zzso zzso This essential role of zzso may also promote better understanding of the zzso of zzso syndrome zzso
