Although zzso is known to protect against zzso zzso zzso the mechanisms responsible for this effect are only beginning to be zzso In addition, the effect of zzso on zzso zzso remains zzso Here we investigated whether zzso exhibits similar zzso effects to zzso against zzso zzso and the mechanism of the effects of these agents in zzso cells zzso with the full-length human zzso zzso zzso alpha gene zzso zzso like zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso in zzso cells, but not in a control line of cells zzso with zzso DNA alone zzso Since zzso activity, the level of which is modulated by regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso at both the zzso and zzso levels, is known to be involved in suppressing zzso in zzso we examined the effect of zzso and zzso on zzso zzso Although both zzso and zzso induced zzso activity in zzso cells, but not in zzso cells, treated with zzso they had no effect on the level of zzso zzso These results suggest that neither zzso nor zzso affects the zzso activity at the zzso zzso We therefore studied the mechanism by which zzso and zzso induce the zzso activity at the zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso induced the zzso of zzso and zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso attenuated both zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Moreover, both zzso and zzso induced both the zzso of zzso at a putative zzso zzso site and the association of nuclear factor zzso with zzso Our findings suggest that and zzso exert zzso effects by zzso zzso zzso via a zzso cascade in an experimental model relevant to Alzheimer's zzso
