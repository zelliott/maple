Analysis of zzso followed by sequencing zzso usually zzso sequence reads that do not map within binding positions zzso Using an unbiased approach, we zzso all reads, both that mapped and ones that were not included as part of zzso zzso experiments were performed in human lung zzso and zzso cells for the zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso Surprisingly, we identified sequence reads that uniquely represented human zzso ends in both zzso In zzso presence of zzso at zzso ends was validated using independent methods and as further evidence we found zzso association of zzso and the zzso repeat binding factor zzso Most zzso results demonstrate that zzso associates with zzso and reduces zzso activity in zzso and in zzso and sustained zzso expression resulted in reduced zzso length in aggressive human cancer zzso zzso function of zzso has been demonstrated in human zzso however, mechanisms are poorly zzso Together, findings reported here suggest a novel role for zzso as a zzso binding protein that can alter zzso function and zzso zzso This presents an opportunity to investigate zzso interactions in zzso zzso
