We found that an ongoing application of zzso to normal human zzso not only attenuated expression of the aging zzso but also increased their zzso zzso causing a greater than zzso increase in the number of population zzso Although zzso by itself does not act as an zzso the cells cultured in the presence of zzso exhibited reduced levels of zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso damage products associated with cellular zzso and a zzso zzso zzso rate without a zzso increase in zzso zzso Furthermore, in the treated cells growing beyond the original zzso limit, the levels of zzso zzso and zzso proteins were similar to those in actively zzso zzso The zzso treatment caused a decrease in zzso levels, which was zzso maintained until the delayed zzso zzso zzso cells also maintained high zzso membrane potential but a lower zzso rate and zzso zzso zzso Taken together, in contrast to its demonstrated zzso effect in zzso zzso extends the lifespan of human zzso possibly through reduction in zzso activity and zzso zzso
