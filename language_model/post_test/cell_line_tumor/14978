The discovery of zzso zzso provides a new and powerful tool for studying the zzso diagnosis and treatment of human zzso Currently, the zzso zzso zzso of zzso with tumor zzso features by zzso island zzso is emerging as a common hallmark of different zzso Here we showed that zzso and zzso were significantly zzso in gastric cancer zzso zzso compared with the adjacent normal regions in 86 paired zzso Moreover, the lower level of zzso and zzso was associated with zzso or zzso stage in clinical gastric cancer zzso The restored expression of zzso and zzso in zzso cells upon zzso and zzso treatment suggested the loss of zzso and zzso was at least partly regulated by zzso modification in zzso Furthermore, the zzso expression of zzso and zzso in gastric cancer cell lines zzso zzso cell zzso cell cycle zzso cell migration and invasion by directly interacting with the zzso zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, our results showed that zzso and zzso might act as tumor zzso in zzso and it may provide novel diagnostic and therapeutic options for human zzso clinical operation in the near zzso
