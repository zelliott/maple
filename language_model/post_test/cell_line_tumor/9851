zzso zzso are the unique class of zzso proteins expressed in tumor but not healthy tissue except zzso and might represent ideal targets for the development of novel zzso and therapeutic methods in zzso cancer, which is the most common zzso of the zzso zzso 

Our objective was to investigate the clinical relevance of zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso as early diagnostic and therapeutic target in zzso zzso 

zzso gene and protein expression was determined in zzso cancer cell lines in 138 zzso tumor zzso 60 adjacent zzso zzso zzso 22 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 20 zzso zzso tissue samples by zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso Gene zzso approach was used to examine the effects of suppression of zzso protein on cellular growth and colony zzso zzso immune response against zzso in zzso cancer patients was analyzed using zzso 

zzso zzso and protein expression was detected in zzso of the zzso cancer patients but not multiple zzso and zzso zzso disease zzso It is interesting to note that majority of zzso zzso zzso cancer patients exhibited higher zzso response against zzso Small interfering zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso cancer cell significantly reduced cellular growth and colony zzso 

zzso expression may play a role in cellular growth and zzso zzso These findings support a potential role for zzso as diagnostic zzso as well as a possible therapeutic target in zzso cancer zzso
