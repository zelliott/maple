zzso based chemotherapy cures over zzso of zzso zzso germ cell zzso zzso In contrast, almost all other solid zzso in adults are incurable once they have spread beyond the primary zzso Cell lines derived from zzso are hypersensitive to zzso reflecting the clinical zzso Earlier findings suggested that a reduced repair capacity might contribute to the zzso hypersensitivity of zzso zzso cells zzso but the critical DNA damage has not been zzso This study was aimed at investigating the formation and repair of zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso in zzso and their contribution to zzso zzso 

We observed that repair of zzso zzso is similar in zzso sensitive zzso and resistant zzso cancer cells, whereas repair of zzso was significantly reduced in zzso zzso formation, which serves as a marker of DNA breaks formed in response to zzso persisted in zzso zzso and correlated with sustained zzso of zzso and enhanced zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso repair factor zzso which is implicated in the processing of zzso is reduced in zzso To zzso the zzso role of zzso for zzso repair and zzso sensitivity, we zzso zzso in zzso by transient zzso zzso increased zzso repair and rendered zzso more resistant to zzso which suggests that zzso is zzso for repair of zzso resulting in the observed zzso hypersensitivity of zzso 

Our data indicate for the first time that the exceptional sensitivity of zzso and, therefore, very likely the zzso of zzso rests on their limited zzso repair due to low level of expression of zzso
