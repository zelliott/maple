In the course of our studies on zzso zzso cell regulation, we identified an intimate connection between zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Here, we report on a new class of zzso zzso zzso dubbed zzso designed to act as zzso zzso zzso based on zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso having the zzso salt unit zzso placed internally zzso and zzso zzso or as a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso were prepared by zzso of zzso bases with different zzso acids or zzso zzso acid zzso following capping with respective zzso or zzso zzso zzso with their design, these zzso showed a significantly improved zzso in water, zzso zzso zzso in zzso broadly modified zzso fast cellular zzso and higher zzso activities in cells in comparison to zzso zzso zzso relationship zzso studies in zzso breast zzso cells revealed that the location of the zzso and its overall chain length affected markedly the zzso effects of these zzso All zzso were more potent zzso zzso zzso zzso than their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso zzso zzso were also moderately potent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were rapidly and efficiently oxidized in cells to the corresponding zzso as established by zzso zzso zzso zzso also induced acute changes in the levels and composition of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso These novel zzso illustrate the feasibility of zzso zzso and they should be useful in zzso studies as well as potential novel zzso
