A new zzso zzso platinum complex zzso with zzso rigid linking group was zzso zzso and zzso In this novel zzso the zzso features of two classes of the platinum compounds with proven zzso activity are combined, namely trans oriented zzso zzso platinum complexes with a zzso zzso and zzso platinum zzso zzso mode of this new complex was analyzed by various methods of molecular biology and zzso The complex coordinates DNA in a unique way and zzso and zzso zzso are the zzso zzso formed in DNA in zzso media and in absence of zzso An intriguing aspect of zzso is that, using a zzso zzso zzso zzso is diminished relative to other zzso platinum complexes with flexible linking groups and zzso that span several base pairs, such as zzso and zzso zzso become zzso In addition, in contrast to the inability of zzso to zzso two DNA duplexes, the results of the present work convincingly demonstrate that this zzso platinum complex forms specific DNA zzso which can efficiently zzso proteins to zzso The results substantiate the view that zzso or its zzso could be used as a tool for studies of DNA properties and their interactions or as a potential zzso zzso The latter view is also zzso by the observation that zzso is a more effective zzso agent than zzso against human tumor zzso cell zzso
