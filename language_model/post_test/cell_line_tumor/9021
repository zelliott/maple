zzso is a type I zzso with a single zzso domain and was identified as a specific zzso for zzso Our recent findings demonstrated that zzso binds zzso Ras and recruits Ras to the plasma zzso which is a critical step required for the zzso of Ras signaling in human breast cancer cells and zzso Here, we first use zzso and real-time zzso approaches to examine the expression patterns of zzso and zzso in both normal and breast tumor zzso Then, we examine the relationship between zzso expression and molecular zzso of breast cancer, and the roles of zzso in zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso showed that zzso and zzso protein were detected in both normal and breast tumor zzso However, the expression of zzso and zzso in breast tumor tissue was much stronger than in normal breast zzso The statistical analysis demonstrated that zzso is highly associated with zzso breast zzso We also found that the expression of zzso has a strong correlation with the expression of zzso which is a well-known zzso zzso The correlation between zzso and zzso gene expression was further confirmed by real-time zzso In zzso results also demonstrated that zzso zzso the expression of zzso in zzso zzso breast tumor cells but not in zzso zzso breast tumor zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso cells but not in zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso increases the expression of zzso and cell growth in zzso zzso and zzso cells whereas zzso of zzso with zzso reduces zzso zzso expression and cell zzso In zzso these results indicate that zzso is a new molecular marker for breast zzso The data suggest that the expression of zzso may be essential in promoting zzso tumor cell proliferation via zzso induction in breast zzso
