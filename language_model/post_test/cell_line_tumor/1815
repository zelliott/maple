To examine the effects of combination therapy with zzso and zzso in zzso cancer cell zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso cancer cell lines were zzso Cell proliferation was assessed after exposure to zzso and zzso Cell cycle progression was assessed by flow zzso zzso expression was determined by real-time zzso Western zzso was performed to determine the effect of zzso on the zzso zzso 

zzso inhibited proliferation in a zzso manner in both cell lines with zzso values of zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso cells, zzso zzso exposure of cells to various doses of zzso in combination with zzso zzso resulted in a significant synergistic zzso effect in both cell lines zzso zzso zzso induced zzso arrest in both cell zzso zzso alone or in combination with zzso resulted in predominantly zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso expression while zzso alone had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreased zzso of the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso inhibited zzso zzso in the zzso cell line and induced zzso of zzso in both cell zzso Treatment with zzso and zzso resulted in decreased zzso of zzso in both cell lines but only had an additive effect on zzso zzso in the zzso cell zzso 

zzso zzso the effects of zzso in zzso cancer cells through zzso of cell proliferation and zzso of the zzso zzso This combination may be a promising targeted therapy for zzso zzso
