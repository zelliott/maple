Novel therapies capable of targeting drug resistant zzso zzso cells are required for more effective treatment of multiple zzso This study investigates the zzso of natural killer cell lines against bulk and zzso multiple myeloma and evaluates the tumor burden after zzso cell therapy in a zzso zzso mouse zzso 

The zzso of natural killer cell lines was evaluated against bulk multiple myeloma cell lines using zzso release and flow zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors on natural killer cells were blocked to determine their role in multiple myeloma zzso Growth zzso of zzso multiple myeloma cells was assessed in a zzso zzso zzso in combination with secondary zzso to evaluate the zzso of residual zzso after natural killer cell zzso A zzso mouse model was developed using the human zzso cell line zzso to express green fluorescent protein and zzso zzso to monitor disease progression in zzso and assess bone zzso zzso after intravenous zzso cell zzso 

Three multiple myeloma cell lines were sensitive to zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated zzso to zzso greater zzso of zzso multiple myeloma growth, compared with killing of the bulk tumor zzso In addition, the residual colonies after treatment formed significantly fewer colonies compared to the control in a secondary zzso for a cumulative zzso zzso of zzso at the zzso zzso to target zzso Multiple myeloma tumor burden was reduced by zzso in a zzso mouse model as measured by zzso imaging and reduction in bone zzso zzso of zzso cells by flow zzso 

This study demonstrates that zzso and zzso are capable of killing zzso and bulk multiple myeloma zzso In addition, multiple myeloma tumor burden in a zzso mouse model was reduced by intravenous zzso cell zzso Since multiple myeloma colony frequency zzso with survival, our observations have important clinical implications and suggest that clinical studies of zzso cell lines to treat zzso are zzso
