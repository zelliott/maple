It has been determined that the zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulate several key processes in a wide variety of zzso However, the function and mechanism of the zzso system in the zzso of zzso cancer remain zzso 

zzso was performed to examine zzso the expression of zzso in 40 human samples of zzso cancer and liver zzso The functions of zzso on zzso colon cancer cells were investigated in zzso We zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso cells zzso expressing zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso was tested in zzso and in zzso 

By zzso counting the number of cells, it was shown that there are more zzso cells at the zzso site in the liver compared with the primary zzso We demonstrated the effect of zzso on the invasion and zzso of zzso cells in zzso In mouse experiment of liver zzso zzso administration of zzso blocked the zzso potential of zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso surrounding the liver zzso zzso zzso zzso The subcutaneous zzso of zzso cells with zzso promoted the tumor initiation in nude mice, indicating the importance of the direct interaction between these cells in zzso 

These results suggest that zzso play important role in liver zzso of colon cancer cells by the action of zzso axis and provide zzso evidence that blockade of the axis is a target for zzso zzso
