zzso family zzso zzso zzso play an important role in growth and zzso of many types of human zzso However, their significance in Ewing's zzso remains to be zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of zzso one member of the zzso in Ewing's zzso growth and zzso and to determine whether a zzso inhibitor can induce Ewing's tumor zzso Lyn was expressed and activated in zzso zzso and zzso human Ewing's zzso zzso Lyn expression was seen in 13 of 15 patient tumor samples, 6 of which showed Lyn zzso zzso zzso of Lyn using small interfering zzso significantly decreased primary tumor growth and zzso activity, and also reduced lung zzso in zzso zzso of Lyn resulted in decreased invasive capacity of tumor cells in zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso decreased Lyn zzso activity and suppressed zzso cell growth in zzso in a zzso zzso Furthermore, treatment of mice bearing zzso zzso tumors with zzso or with zzso interfering zzso gene therapy resulted in reduced Lyn zzso activity and significant tumor growth zzso zzso which is zzso fusion protein associated with Ewing's zzso regulated Lyn gene expression and zzso zzso These data suggest that targeting Lyn may be a new therapeutic approach in treatment of Ewing's zzso
