zzso is a zzso zzso class I zzso with zzso properties and restricted tissue zzso The expression of zzso can be induced by tumors thus providing an efficient way to escape the zzso immune zzso Although zzso zzso regulate diverse zzso mechanisms their relationship with zzso remains zzso Our results show that zzso zzso of both the interaction between zzso and tumor cells, and of zzso calcium flux in zzso cells zzso to their target cells were independent of zzso raft zzso In addition, zzso zzso indicated that zzso continued to efficiently inhibit zzso zzso function in several different tumor cells independently of zzso raft zzso zzso zzso with zzso reconstruction combined with zzso analysis showed that zzso was mainly localized outside the zzso zzso of tumor cells after zzso with specific zzso and remained excluded from zzso zzso during interaction with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso This study indicates that the zzso function of zzso is zzso from zzso raft organization, further distinguishing zzso from classical zzso molecules and providing novel information in the understanding of tumor immune escape mechanism zzso through zzso
