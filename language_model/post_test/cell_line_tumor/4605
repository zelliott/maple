zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso coli zzso and zzso and zzso zzso is zzso into the host cell by a zzso type III zzso zzso zzso cell culture has demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso is necessary for attaching zzso zzso zzso formation by zzso and zzso zzso but is not required by zzso zzso Recent in zzso work on zzso zzso has reported that zzso zzso but not its zzso is necessary for colonization of the mouse zzso In this study we investigated the involvement of zzso and its zzso zzso in zzso and zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso recruitment using in zzso organ culture zzso We showed that both zzso and zzso zzso are zzso into human zzso zzso during zzso and that zzso is necessary for ex zzso zzso colonization by both zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso is zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso still colonize zzso zzso While zzso zzso recruits the host zzso protein zzso to initiate zzso zzso zzso zzso derivatives deficient in zzso zzso recruit zzso independently of zzso indicating the presence of a zzso zzso mechanism of zzso zzso formation and zzso recruitment ex zzso by zzso in zzso
