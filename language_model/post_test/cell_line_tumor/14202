Cellular prion protein zzso a zzso membrane zzso was found in our lab to be widely expressed in gastric cancer cell zzso In order to evaluate its biological significance in human gastric cancer, we investigated its expression in a large series of gastric tissue samples zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso Compared with normal zzso gastric zzso showed increased zzso zzso correlated with the zzso differentiation zzso to the WHO and Lauren zzso and tumor progression (as documented by zzso zzso To better understand the underlying zzso we introduced the zzso and two pairs of zzso into the poorly differentiated gastric cancer cell line zzso and found that zzso suppressed zzso and slowed down zzso in zzso zzso Further study proved that the zzso protein zzso was zzso whereas zzso and zzso were zzso in the zzso zzso A reverse effect was observed in zzso zzso zzso These results strongly suggested that zzso might play a role as an effective zzso protein through zzso zzso pathways in gastric cancer zzso Further study into the mechanism of these relationships might enrich the knowledge of zzso better our understanding of the nature of gastric zzso and further develop possible strategies to block or reverse the development of gastric zzso
