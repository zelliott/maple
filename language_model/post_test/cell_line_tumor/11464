zzso protein F zzso a cell zzso zzso zzso has been shown to affect numerous zzso zzso This study aimed to clarify the zzso significance of zzso expression in patients with zzso zzso cell zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso zzso and protein were higher in zzso cell lines than in the normal zzso An zzso analysis of paired tissue specimens showed that the zzso expression was higher in zzso zzso than in the adjacent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, there was a significant correlation between zzso expression and gender zzso zzso zzso clinical stage zzso zzso zzso and T zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients with higher zzso expression had shorter overall survival than those with lower zzso expression zzso zzso zzso zzso Cox analysis indicated that zzso expression is an independent zzso factor for overall survival zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso it was found that zzso acid zzso could significantly enhance the zzso sensitivity of zzso cell lines with high zzso expression to zzso although zzso alone only exhibited a minor zzso effect to zzso zzso In zzso these findings demonstrate that zzso may serve as a valuable molecular marker for predicting the prognosis of zzso zzso In addition, the data indicate a potential benefit of combining zzso with zzso in zzso suggesting that zzso expression may have therapeutic zzso
