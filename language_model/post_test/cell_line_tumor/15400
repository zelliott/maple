The zzso of lung diseases and cancer caused by cigarette smoke is zzso The molecular mechanisms of gene regulation induced by cigarette smoke that ultimately lead to cancer remain zzso This report describes a novel long zzso zzso zzso that is induced by cigarette smoke extract zzso both in zzso and in zzso and is elevated in numerous lung cancer cell zzso We have termed this zzso the smoke and zzso zzso zzso This zzso is located in zzso 5, and initial sequencing analysis reveals a transcript with four zzso and three zzso The expression of zzso is regulated zzso by nuclear factor zzso zzso factor zzso as determined by the small, interfering zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso protein 1 zzso A nuclear factor zzso 2 zzso motif was identified in the promoter region that shows binding to zzso after its zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso in human zzso zzso cells shows a significant zzso of zzso induced by zzso in zzso Altogether, these results identify a novel and intriguing new zzso zzso that may act downstream of zzso to regulate gene expression and mediate zzso stress protection in airway zzso zzso
