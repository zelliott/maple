To provide a possible targeted gene therapy scheme for prostate cancer, and explore the expression efficiency and zzso expression of prostate specific zzso zzso zzso 

Three plasmids with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (including zzso zzso zzso and zzso (including zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and the expression status was observed by zzso into zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

In prostate cancer cell zzso zzso expressed more zzso than zzso and zzso which showed that zzso could notably increase the zzso efficiency of zzso zzso Further, there was no zzso expression in zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso p zzso and zzso 

An expression zzso based on elements of the zzso gene regulatory sequences has been developed and shown to be tightly regulated in a panel of cells from zzso of various zzso With the zzso functional zzso it should provide a solid platform for clinical zzso
