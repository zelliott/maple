zzso binding zzso zzso the most abundant circulating zzso binding zzso zzso cell growth and zzso zzso by both zzso and zzso zzso The ability of zzso to inhibit tumor growth has been demonstrated in many zzso including prostate cancer zzso High zzso of zzso which inhibit the growth of the zzso human zzso cell line, have been shown to have both positive and negative effects on zzso expression by different zzso To further explore the relationship between zzso and zzso we examined zzso expression in zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso expression can be induced by 10 zzso of the synthetic zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso show that the zzso zzso promoter sequence directly responds to zzso zzso In zzso analysis identified a putative zzso response element zzso at zzso in the zzso zzso A single point zzso in this ARE disrupted zzso by zzso Combining the data obtained from zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis, we conclude that a novel functional ARE is present in the zzso promoter that directly mediates zzso induction of zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that the combination of zzso and zzso significantly zzso the zzso promoter activity, suggesting that enhanced induction of the expression of the zzso zzso gene may contribute to the greater zzso of zzso cell growth by combined zzso and zzso Because zzso are well known to stimulate zzso growth and zzso deprivation therapy causes zzso to zzso the stimulation by zzso of this zzso and zzso protein is paradoxical and raises interesting questions about the role of zzso zzso in zzso
