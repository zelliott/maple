The main treatment for zzso is surgical zzso with a wide zzso However, there are certain zzso such as those found in the pelvis and the spine, which cannot be zzso adequately with surgery zzso Unfortunately, most zzso are resistant to radiation and zzso zzso and chemotherapy are thought to kill zzso cells by inducing zzso or programmed cell zzso In this article, we zzso that zzso gene zzso enhances zzso in zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso We knocked down zzso genes in zzso cells using small interfering zzso zzso Two well-established Grade II human zzso cell lines were zzso with zzso that specifically target zzso for zzso zzso or zzso The cells were then treated with zzso Cell death was assessed by flow zzso Cell survival and proliferation were measured by zzso survival zzso zzso cells exhibited zzso and increased the expression of zzso zzso and zzso in response to zzso When one of the zzso zzso or zzso genes was silenced with the corresponding zzso zzso increased up to zzso zzso zzso zzso When two out of the three zzso zzso were knocked down zzso there was an zzso increase in cell death after radiation zzso zzso zzso Our findings support a novel therapeutic concept that gene zzso may be used as a molecular zzso therapy for zzso zzso
