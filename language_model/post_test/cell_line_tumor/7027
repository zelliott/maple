It has been shown that zzso activity and zzso B virus zzso replication are closely associated with cell zzso This study aimed to further investigate the effects of cell cycle on zzso activity and on zzso zzso 

Human zzso cells zzso with zzso DNA zzso zzso cell line) were treated respectively with serum zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso or sodium zzso The cell cycle of zzso zzso cells was analyzed by flow zzso The zzso activities of the cells were detected by zzso zzso DNA in culture medium was zzso by a fluorescent quantitative zzso zzso and a zzso dot zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in culture media were zzso examined by an zzso zzso 

zzso with serum zzso zzso zzso or sodium zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso zzso cells and led to cell arrest in the zzso phase of cell zzso The percentage of the zzso phase in the groups of sodium zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, but in the control group, zzso ( zzso The activities of zzso of the cells were also significantly inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso replication of the zzso zzso cells remarkably increased as shown by the contents of zzso DNA, zzso and zzso in the culture media of the cells treated with sodium zzso zzso zzso or serum deprivation ( zzso The amounts of zzso DNA in the groups of sodium zzso zzso zzso serum deprivation and control were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively ( zzso zzso was expressed mainly in the cells in S zzso zzso replication increased in zzso cells zzso zzso and decreased in zzso phase zzso zzso 

The current data approve that zzso replication is associated with the cellular zzso zzso
