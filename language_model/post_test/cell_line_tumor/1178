zzso use is the most important risk factor for the development of lung zzso One characteristic shared by zzso lung diseases is altered lung zzso tissue content and zzso In particular, tobacco results in increased expression of zzso zzso a zzso zzso implicated in lung development, injury and repair and in tumor cell zzso We hypothesized that excessive deposition of zzso in lung might promote lung zzso cell zzso zzso with this hypothesis, we found that zzso zzso human lung zzso cell proliferation and diminished zzso in zzso and that this effect was zzso through the zzso zzso and associated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on zzso was blocked by the specific zzso inhibitor zzso and by zzso of protein zzso C zzso zzso C, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso revealed that zzso increased the nuclear binding activity of zzso zzso response element binding protein zzso and zzso protein zzso 2 proteins known to play important roles in the regulation of zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso of the human zzso gene promoter revealed that the zzso effect of zzso was prevented when either the zzso or the zzso zzso sites were zzso Taken together, the results indicate that zzso stimulates human lung zzso cell proliferation and diminishes zzso by inducing zzso gene expression and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso interactions at zzso and zzso zzso sites in the zzso gene promoter appear to play key roles in this zzso This work demonstrates that signaling through specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting from exaggerated deposition in lung of the zzso zzso zzso might promote lung zzso cell zzso
