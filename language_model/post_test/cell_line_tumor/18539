The zzso zzso zzso can be used to study zzso acid transport by zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to evaluate the potential contribution of zzso zzso in zzso to overall zzso values measured in zzso zzso in zzso we studied the mechanisms governing the zzso of this zzso by human zzso zzso zzso were isolated from healthy human donors by density zzso zzso using zzso zzso The human zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso was obtained from American Type Culture zzso Using zzso dishes, cells were incubated in zzso zzso saline or an equivalent zzso buffer with 50 zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso was zzso as % injected dose per mass of protein within each culture zzso Several natural and artificial zzso acids were used as potential transport zzso both in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly lower in zzso than in zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso (40 zzso zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso at 30 minutes of zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly increased zzso zzso in zzso by a factor of approximately zzso Transport into zzso zzso was exclusively zzso and zzso by zzso but not by zzso Under zzso stimulation exclusively, there was in addition also a zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso and zzso albeit to a minor zzso zzso zzso in zzso is mainly zzso via an zzso zzso acid transport system and increases on zzso zzso by zzso zzso may induce an additional zzso transport system in zzso The considerably lower zzso zzso in zzso than in zzso suggests that overall zzso values of this zzso measured by zzso in tumors are not significantly affected by zzso zzso in zzso within the zzso zzso
