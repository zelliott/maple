There is evidence that zzso amplification is associated with poor prognosis in zzso A previous comparative zzso zzso analysis identified a critical region in zzso bands zzso Using restriction landmark zzso scanning in combination with a virtual zzso zzso we showed that this region is delineated by sequences within zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso A real-time zzso zzso copy number zzso of 20 zzso revealed gain or amplification in this critical zzso region in eight zzso The expression of four genes and expressed sequence tags zzso within this newly defined region was zzso by real-time reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso in four tumors with and six tumors without gain or zzso The zzso zzso was found to be highly expressed in all but one tumor compared to normal liver zzso Furthermore, quantitative zzso revealed that the expression level of the zzso regulated zzso factor zzso was zzso times greater in zzso tumors and cell lines compared to zzso normal liver and comparable to the expression in fetal liver zzso zzso has been shown be a zzso zzso of zzso in other tumor zzso Using zzso reporter zzso we demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso from the embryonic zzso promoter zzso also in zzso cell zzso Thus, our results provide evidence that zzso zzso may be responsible for the frequently observed zzso of zzso in zzso and therefore may be implicated in the molecular zzso of this childhood zzso
