zzso zzso is a plant used in the treatment of several diseases, including zzso Studies have shown that zzso zzso presents an interesting zzso potential, due to the presence of zzso and some zzso with zzso zzso In this work, we tested the potential zzso of two zzso zzso compounds isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso two zzso models: zzso zzso tumor cells zzso mice and Lewis lung cancer cells zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased the survival of mice zzso with EAT cells and decreased the tumor volume in the zzso model, compared to control zzso Both compounds presented similar and low in zzso zzso against zzso zzso tumor cells and did not present any significant toxicity against Lewis lung cancer zzso Since the direct in zzso activity against zzso tumor and Lewis lung cancer cells was low, we investigated the effects of zzso or zzso treatment on the activity of total natural killer cells from zzso zzso zzso mice, as a possible explanation for the mechanisms of these compounds in zzso zzso and zzso improved zzso cell zzso against zzso zzso zzso As expected, tumor growth in zzso mice markedly suppressed zzso cell zzso while, zzso completely reversed this effect, when mice were treated with zzso zzso zzso of these compounds for 4 zzso The zzso studies showed that zzso remains in the zzso for a long period of time, possibly explaining the higher compound zzso
