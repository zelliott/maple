The zzso function of the tissue zzso of zzso zzso has been attributed to their zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso but not zzso zzso both zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso migration of human zzso zzso cells zzso suggesting that this effect is dependent on direct zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso zzso which is devoid of zzso zzso activity, block zzso migration in response to zzso zzso zzso and zzso also suppress zzso zzso migration via a zzso mechanism zzso by enhanced expression of zzso a zzso zzso zzso which, in turn, zzso cell zzso zzso treatment of zzso increases the association of zzso with zzso resulting in enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso have increased zzso expression and display reduced cell migration compared with those expressing inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fail to demonstrate zzso decrease in cell migration despite zzso of zzso zzso zzso decreases zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increases zzso activity and reverses the zzso reduction in cell zzso The effects of zzso on zzso expression and cell migration were confirmed in zzso melanoma zzso These results suggest that zzso can inhibit cell migration via several distinct zzso First, zzso can inhibit cell migration after zzso stimulation by direct zzso of zzso activity induced in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso can disrupt zzso signaling required for initiation of zzso zzso Third, zzso can enhance expression of zzso via zzso signaling resulting in an zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso
