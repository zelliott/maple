zzso and zzso structures can mechanically align and concentrate fibers in their zzso environment and can sense and respond to mechanical cues by zzso zzso or zzso Here we show that zzso zzso with compromised structural integrity can zzso by forming long collagen zzso These collagen lines then coordinate and accelerate transition to an invasive zzso zzso zzso begin to zzso within zzso zzso zzso h in a zzso coordinated manner, whereas zzso that do not interact mechanically with other zzso zzso more slowly (in zzso zzso zzso zzso and to a lesser extent zzso zzso zzso When the directed mechanical connections between zzso were cut with a laser, the zzso reverted to a slowly zzso zzso When zzso were fully mechanically isolated from other zzso and also from the bulk gel by zzso with a side length zzso zzso transition to an invasive zzso was blocked in 20 of 20 experiments, regardless of waiting zzso Thus, pairs or groups of zzso zzso can interact mechanically over long distances through the collagen zzso and these directed mechanical interactions facilitate transition to an invasive zzso
