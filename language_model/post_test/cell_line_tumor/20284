zzso cancer is a debilitating disease, which needs zzso approach of targeted drug delivery and enhanced efficacy with the use of combination zzso In this study, we have examined the zzso activity of zzso incorporated in surface zzso zzso for targeted delivery to zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was also zzso to augment therapeutic zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso zzso incorporating zzso and zzso were characterized for particle size, surface charge, zzso efficiency and zzso Fluorescence and quantitative zzso studies were conducted in zzso cells to determine zzso zzso Cell viability was assessed using zzso zzso while mechanism of zzso was evaluated using zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso showed 57% decrease in zzso value of zzso following treatment with zzso targeted zzso and zzso decrease following treatment with zzso targeted zzso Combination therapy with zzso and zzso enhanced the zzso of zzso compared to therapy with individual zzso The increase in zzso was attributed to increase in cellular zzso and zzso zzso 

The results of this study showed that the targeted system improved zzso of zzso compared to the zzso zzso Combination therapy with zzso zzso zzso therapeutic zzso
