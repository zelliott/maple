The National Cancer Institute zzso panel consists of 60 human tumor cell lines initially established for screening thousands of molecules for zzso zzso It has been powerful for deciphering the relationships between zzso drug zzso and cell molecular zzso We tested its potential interest for establishing relationships between the zzso of genes involved in drug metabolism and transport or in DNA repair, and drug zzso extracted from zzso zzso 

Using zzso chain zzso zzso length zzso zzso techniques, three frequent single zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso group D zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso group G zzso zzso gene and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso of the zzso were zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso The zzso zzso appeared to be a strong zzso of the in zzso zzso of most zzso agents, with lower half zzso zzso concentration zzso values in zzso zzso lines than in common zzso or zzso cell zzso zzso the zzso of zzso appeared markedly dependent upon the zzso zzso with zzso lower mean zzso values in zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso appeared to be important only for zzso with fourfold higher zzso values in zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso was related to the zzso of several drug classes, especially zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso panel is capable of providing clues and tracks for the establishment of clinically useful relationships between a given zzso and the zzso of an zzso zzso
