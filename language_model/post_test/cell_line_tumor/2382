zzso zzso has been widely used to treat various zzso tumors including human zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso effect of zzso displays not satisfactory in zzso treatment due to the lack of zzso of zzso This study demonstrated that zzso of zzso activity led to significant zzso of zzso cell growth accompanied by decreased expression of zzso and zzso D1 and increased levels of major zzso complex zzso class I and zzso zzso protein 1 zzso which are involved in tumor zzso Combination treatment of zzso and zzso resulted in a synergistic zzso of zzso cell growth both in zzso and in zzso Though zzso alone exerted minimal zzso effect on zzso activity, additional administration of zzso could result in a significant zzso of zzso activity, thus substantially suppressing zzso cell zzso Specifically, zzso could induce specific deposition of zzso zzso in tumors while not in other normal zzso in zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso can enhance zzso sensitivity in zzso both in zzso and in zzso probably through induction of a synergistic zzso effect on zzso zzso This study also suggests a potential alternative of combination of zzso and zzso in clinical therapy against zzso
