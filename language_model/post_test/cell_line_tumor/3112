zzso zzso AT rich interactive domain zzso is a large nuclear protein that is highly expressed in breast zzso and is proposed to function as a zzso of gene zzso In this paper, a zzso display screen using the zzso of zzso as bait identified one of the zzso interacting zzso namely zzso protein zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated that the zzso region, including the zzso box, was required for the interaction with the zzso of zzso In a reporter zzso system, zzso of zzso with zzso significantly enhanced the zzso zzso These results support a role for zzso acting as a zzso zzso
