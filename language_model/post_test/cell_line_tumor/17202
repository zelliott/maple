zzso a member of the zzso gene family, is structurally zzso among a wide range of organisms, although the zzso zzso and zzso truncated zzso zzso producing property seems to zzso Since zzso is thought to play important roles in skin, zzso and zzso development in zzso we examined zzso zzso zzso and adult zzso for expression of zzso zzso analyses indicated enhanced zzso of the zzso form of zzso in zzso phase (at stage zzso zzso cells in the inner layer of zzso skin expanded to the zzso layers during the zzso The zzso of limb buds and the maxillofacial zzso zzso in zzso had a high level expression of zzso The cloned zzso type zzso zzso exhibited a zzso activity against the human zzso zzso in a reporter zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso mechanism and zzso zzso regulator activities of zzso are zzso between zzso and zzso
