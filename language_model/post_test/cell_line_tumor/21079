Recent studies identified zzso of zzso oxygen species zzso as a common zzso causing insulin zzso However, whether and how the reduction of zzso levels improves insulin resistance remains to be zzso The present study was designed to define this zzso 

We investigated the effect of zzso of zzso zzso zzso in liver of obese diabetic model zzso mice by zzso zzso 

zzso mice had high zzso levels in zzso zzso of zzso in liver of zzso mice reduced zzso zzso and blood zzso zzso These changes were accompanied by improvement in insulin resistance and reduction of zzso gene expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso which is the main regulator of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso insulin resistance was accompanied by zzso of zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso which is a main regulator of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso mice enhanced the zzso of zzso box class zzso another regulator of zzso zzso without the changes of zzso zzso zzso in zzso In zzso cell lines, zzso induced zzso of zzso and zzso and the latter, together with zzso zzso was inhibited by a zzso zzso 

Our results indicate that the reduction of zzso is a potential therapeutic target of liver insulin resistance, at least partly by the reduced expression of zzso
