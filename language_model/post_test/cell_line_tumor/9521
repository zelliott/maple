In this study, two zzso zzso zzso isolated from the flower buds of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were assessed with regard to their zzso activity in human zzso zzso zzso Both 1 and 2 were demonstrated to activate the zzso process, including DNA zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In our zzso analysis, treatment with compounds 1 and 2 resulted in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso into active forms, and the expression of zzso proteins was shifted toward zzso the expression of the zzso zzso zzso was increased, and the expression of zzso and zzso both zzso zzso were suppressed in a zzso zzso The administration zzso of the compounds to Lewis lung zzso zzso mice evidenced a significant zzso of tumor growth zzso with reductions of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso at zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso as compared with the control zzso These results indicate that compounds 1 and 2 are potent zzso constituents of zzso zzso and might be potent as zzso zzso
