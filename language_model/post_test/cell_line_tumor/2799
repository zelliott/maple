In low zzso zzso NO zzso zzso functions as a zzso in brain and other zzso whereas zzso NO zzso are associated with toxicity and cell zzso Control of the NO zzso therefore, is critical for proper brain function, but, although its synthesis zzso is zzso the major route of breakdown of NO in brain is zzso Previous observations indicate that brain cells actively consume NO at a high zzso The mechanism of this consumption was pursued in the present zzso NO consumption by a preparation of central zzso cells was abolished by cell zzso and recovered by addition of zzso zzso consumption of NO localized to cell zzso and was inhibited by zzso K, indicating the involvement of a zzso zzso zzso of this activity yielded zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso inhibited NO consumption by brain zzso and the amount of zzso in several cell types correlated with their rate of NO zzso NO was also consumed by zzso zzso but this activity was found to depend on the presence of the vitamin E analogue zzso zzso zzso included in the buffer as a precaution against zzso NO consumption by zzso zzso In contrast, NO consumption by brain zzso was independent of zzso zzso it appears that, during the zzso process, zzso becomes separated from a partner needed for NO zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited NO consumption by brain zzso making these proteins likely zzso
