The zzso zzso zzso zzso has recently been proposed as a zzso zzso but its precise role remains zzso To investigate whether zzso can indeed influence the zzso progress, expression of zzso zzso was knocked down in human zzso gastric zzso cells using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed similar growth rates as their control zzso By contrast, invasive ability in zzso invasion activity and zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso were markedly increased in zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells inhibited the increased invasive zzso Further study, we found the induction of zzso by zzso of zzso was zzso by zzso Altogether, our results imply that zzso could play a key role in the regulation of cellular invasion and zzso which may involve the zzso of zzso zzso
