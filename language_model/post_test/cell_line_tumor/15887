The cell zzso zzso zzso zzso is an important player in the process of tumor zzso and zzso zzso a fully humanized zzso zzso zzso zzso was currently in clinical trials for cancer zzso zzso we labeled zzso with zzso evaluated the in zzso and in zzso zzso and investigated whether the expression of zzso zzso in tumors could be zzso with zzso zzso 

The binding affinity and specificity of zzso was analyzed using zzso zzso zzso zzso was coupled with zzso acid zzso for zzso zzso zzso Imaging of zzso was carried out in nude mice bearing both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and blocking studies of zzso were investigated in zzso zzso nude zzso 

zzso exhibited zzso affinity to human zzso zzso expressed on zzso cells (K zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso retained zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso Imaging showed that the tumor zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso tumors was much higher than that in zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso tumors, zzso was mainly zzso accumulated around the blood vessels, while in the zzso tumors, besides the zzso tumor zzso zzso also specifically bound the human zzso zzso expressed on the tumor zzso zzso and blocking studies exhibited that the zzso tumor zzso of zzso decreased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso percentage of injected dose per gram of tissue after zzso of excess dose of cold zzso which confirmed the in zzso zzso zzso binding specificity of zzso 

zzso showed specific binding to human zzso zzso expressed on the tumor zzso zzso can specifically target the human zzso zzso expression in the nude mouse zzso zzso has a potential for clinical translation as an agent for zzso zzso tumor imaging, evaluating tumor zzso status and monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of zzso cancer zzso
