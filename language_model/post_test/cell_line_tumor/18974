zzso of zzso T zzso zzso is a primary goal of many cancer vaccination zzso We have evaluated two vaccination platforms, zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso zzso for their ability to elicit zzso response and zzso zzso Although zzso was more potent in zzso zzso DC vaccination provided greater protective and therapeutic zzso zzso zzso analyses ruled out the possibility that the two vaccines elicit zzso distinct zzso and demonstrated instead that zzso could better engage natural killer zzso cells as an additional zzso zzso We demonstrated that, although both zzso and zzso can stimulate rapid zzso expansion, only zzso zzso cells are able to produce zzso zzso zzso and mediate zzso zzso Moreover, our data showed that zzso delivered zzso zzso engaged the zzso zzso zzso thereby suggesting that this zzso population plays a zzso role in zzso zzso Interestingly, at least 3 days were required for zzso zzso cells to acquire zzso functions, indicating that a similar zzso process operates between T cells and zzso zzso Our results suggest that the nature of the vaccine platform can determine the relative involvement of zzso and T cells in zzso zzso and that methods to augment zzso function should be included in vaccination strategies in order to complement zzso control of tumor zzso
