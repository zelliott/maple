Active and passive tobacco smoke are associated with the dysfunction of zzso physiology and vascular zzso Studies zzso the effects of smoking and the brain zzso at the zzso barrier zzso level have been largely limited to few selective compounds that are present in the tobacco smoke zzso yet the zzso of smoking has not been zzso For this purpose, we characterized the zzso response of isolated human brain zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso to the exposure of whole soluble zzso zzso With the use of a well established humanized zzso in zzso zzso barrier model zzso we have also investigated the zzso zzso response to zzso under both normal and impaired zzso conditions simulating zzso Our results showed that zzso selectively decreased zzso viability only at very high zzso while not significantly affecting that of zzso and zzso At lower zzso despite the absence of zzso zzso induced a strong vascular zzso zzso This included the zzso of zzso zzso zzso a significant increase of the levels of zzso zzso activated zzso zzso and the differentiation of zzso into zzso When zzso was paired with zzso exposure, the inflammatory response and the loss of zzso viability were significantly increased in comparison to zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso is a strong vascular inflammatory primer that can facilitate the loss of zzso function and viability in pathological settings involving a local transient loss of cerebral blood flow such as during zzso zzso
