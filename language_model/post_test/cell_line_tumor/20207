The discovery of the molecular targets of zzso medicines and their chemical zzso can validate and improve the use of such zzso In the present report, we investigated the effect of zzso C zzso a classical zzso agent on cancer cell zzso induced by zzso We found that zzso not only zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso colon cancer cells but also zzso zzso colon cancer cells zzso to the zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso also zzso the zzso effects of two TRAIL zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso At a zzso level, zzso zzso cell survival zzso including zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso proteins including zzso zzso and the cell surface expression of TRAIL death receptors zzso and zzso Gene zzso of zzso by short hairpin zzso reduced the zzso induced by combination treatment of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was independent of zzso zzso and zzso but was dependent on zzso N terminal zzso zzso as zzso pharmacological zzso and zzso abolished the induction of the TRAIL receptors by zzso
