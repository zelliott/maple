zzso of zzso protein zzso is a key zzso event in Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso a constituent of the Indian spice zzso is structurally similar to zzso Red and has been demonstrated to bind zzso zzso and prevent further zzso of zzso zzso onto growing zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso and mechanism of zzso formation are similar in Parkinson's disease zzso and zzso we investigated the effect of zzso on zzso zzso protein zzso In zzso model of AS zzso was developed by treatment of zzso AS protein zzso with 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso It was observed that the addition of zzso inhibited zzso in a zzso manner and increased AS zzso The zzso effect of zzso was next investigated in cell culture utilizing zzso zzso cell zzso A model system was developed in which the red fluorescent protein zzso was fused with zzso zzso of AS and its zzso examined under different zzso of zzso To estimate zzso in an unbiased manner, a protocol was developed in which the images were captured automatically through a zzso zzso screening zzso The obtained images were processed automatically for zzso within a defined dimension of zzso zzso Greater than zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso was observed within 48 h subsequent to zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso AS zzso into higher molecular weight zzso and therefore should be further explored as a potential therapeutic compound for zzso and related zzso
