The killing by natural killer zzso cells is regulated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso receptors recognize mainly major zzso complex zzso class I zzso while the zzso zzso receptors recognize zzso zzso and viral zzso Thus, changes in the expression of the various zzso and zzso zzso will determine whether target cells will be killed or zzso Here, we demonstrate that after influenza virus infection the binding of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso to the infected cells is specifically zzso The increased binding occurs shortly after the influenza virus infection, prior to the increased recognition of the infected cells by the zzso zzso zzso zzso We also zzso the mechanism responsible for this effect and demonstrate that, after influenza virus infection, zzso class I proteins zzso on the cell surface and accumulate in the zzso raft zzso Such zzso allows better recognition by the zzso zzso receptors and consequently increases resistance to zzso cell zzso In contrast, zzso activity was not influenced by the zzso of zzso class I zzso Thus, we present here a novel zzso developed by the influenza virus, of zzso of zzso cell zzso through the reorganization of zzso class I proteins on the cell zzso
