zzso zzso A zzso zzso are cholesterol-lowering drugs that are widely used to prevent and treat zzso cardiovascular zzso Recent zzso studies suggest that statins reduce serum zzso zzso zzso levels and decrease the risk of prostate zzso In the present study, we determined the molecular mechanisms related to the regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell proliferation in prostate cancer cell lines by zzso 

Western zzso quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction, zzso analysis and a cell proliferation zzso were used to resolve the regulatory role of statins zzso and zzso in three prostate cancer cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso 

Western zzso revealed that both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, these statins did not zzso zzso zzso zzso while they decreased zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso protein which suggested that statins decreased zzso protein levels by increasing zzso zzso Furthermore, statins reduced cell proliferation in zzso positive cells but not in zzso negative cells, suggesting that statins regulate cell proliferation via zzso zzso In addition, cell proliferation zzso at various zzso of zzso zzso showed that statins decreased zzso sensitivity in zzso zzso 

zzso decreased zzso protein by zzso but not zzso zzso The drop in zzso levels resulted in a reduction in zzso sensitivity and a decrease in cell proliferation in zzso positive prostate cancer zzso
