We previously isolated several clones that were zzso genetically from a human zzso tumor zzso cell zzso These clones displayed significantly different zzso response zzso In this paper, we investigated how a single dose of zzso modulated the zzso profiles of either the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso clone when each was compared to a reference zzso zzso The latter represented a control clone that displayed a similar zzso response as the parental zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained from zzso zzso or zzso cells either before or at 10 zzso 6 or 24 h after treatment with zzso zzso zzso profiles were assessed by zzso zzso At least three independent experiments were carried out for each time point and statistical analysis was performed by paired zzso ( zzso From zzso zzso zzso we identified only 120 zzso that were zzso expressed at any one of these four time zzso Interestingly, different patterns of gene zzso were observed between the zzso and zzso zzso However, the fold changes of gene zzso were generally small zzso zzso Surprisingly, only zzso of 79 genes involved in DNA damage zzso and cell cycle and between zzso and zzso of 76 genes involved in zzso were significantly modulated in these early time points following zzso By comparison, up to zzso of 40 known zzso genes were zzso zzso Thus in our experimental model, we were able to detect the zzso or zzso of mostly novel genes and/or pathways in the acute period (up to 24 zzso following a single dose of zzso zzso
