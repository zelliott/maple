Human serum zzso 1 zzso an zzso is associated with zzso zzso zzso and can inhibit the zzso modification of zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso may prevent zzso zzso a zzso zzso lowers the cholesterol level in serum and is thought to display zzso zzso However, the effect of zzso on zzso gene expression remains zzso Thus, we evaluated how zzso regulates zzso gene zzso In human zzso zzso and zzso cells, the zzso protein levels were increased by zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso Data from real time zzso analysis indicated that zzso could zzso zzso expression at the zzso zzso Additionally, treating zzso cells with zzso increased the levels of zzso zzso and its downstream target zzso The zzso upstream region contained a consensus binding site for zzso and the zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso factors, especially zzso bind to the upstream sequence of the zzso promoter upon zzso zzso Moreover, zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso markedly attenuated the zzso zzso promoter activity and protein zzso This is the first study to suggest that zzso zzso zzso plays a crucial role in zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso The induction of zzso by zzso zzso a potential mechanism through which zzso may protect against zzso
