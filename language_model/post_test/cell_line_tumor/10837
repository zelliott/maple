We zzso report on the activity of the zzso small zzso inhibitor zzso on mouse zzso cells carrying either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso human acute zzso leukemia cells carrying zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and human acute zzso leukemia carrying zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited more zzso the proliferation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso zzso than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso This activity was accompanied by zzso of the zzso of zzso and downstream signaling proteins zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell growth zzso of zzso zzso cells was coupled with induction of zzso as evidenced by heightened zzso membrane potential and zzso activity, as well as zzso zzso increased turnover of the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso protein zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was more effective at zzso the proliferation of peripheral blood zzso zzso obtained from patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso than at zzso zzso zzso from normal individuals zzso zzso zzso The effect on primary expanded zzso zzso was paralleled by a decrease in zzso zzso zzso burden in single zzso zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, our data supports the clinical testing of zzso in patients with zzso zzso driven by zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso
