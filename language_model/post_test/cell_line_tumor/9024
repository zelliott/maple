The use of zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso in zzso cell lung cancer zzso has been shown to be effective in increasing patient progression free survival zzso but their efficacy is limited due to the development of resistance and tumor zzso zzso understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying development of drug resistance in zzso is necessary for developing novel and effective therapeutic approaches to improve patient zzso This study aims to understand the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso resistance in zzso zzso and zzso cell lines were made resistant to zzso a zzso zzso and zzso an zzso zzso through zzso increases in zzso zzso The zzso zzso of resistant lines exhibited a 4-5 and zzso increase for zzso and zzso respectively, when compared to parental zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso signaling was studied in both cell lines to determine their roles in zzso zzso zzso We observed a zzso zzso of zzso signaling proteins and a zzso to zzso zzso of zzso signaling proteins in zzso zzso and zzso resistant zzso zzso and zzso cells were further treated with the zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso resistant cells were inhibited by zzso by a triple combination of zzso zzso and zzso in comparison to zzso by a double combination of these zzso zzso zzso cells displayed no sensitivity to zzso while resistant cells were significantly inhibited zzso by zzso as a single agent, as well as in combination with zzso and zzso Similar results were obtained with zzso resistant zzso This study suggests a novel molecular mechanism of drug resistance in lung zzso
