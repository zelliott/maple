A series of zzso or zzso derivatives of lead compound zzso zzso were prepared and evaluated for zzso activity against a panel of zzso and human cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso groups investigated included zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso groups investigated included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso values ranged from zzso to zzso with no improvement relative to lead compound zzso zzso zzso was approximately zzso to zzso while compounds zzso were from three to fivefold less zzso and all other compounds were significantly much less zzso A zzso zzso zzso 5) and several representative derivatives from each zzso zzso zzso were screened for binding affinity for bone zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Only compound 5 showed appreciable affinity zzso consistent with the zzso that zzso may act as a zzso depot form of the biologically active zzso zzso zzso studies zzso Dock, zzso X zzso for compounds zzso and 5 support this zzso
