One of the zzso zzso factors that contribute to zzso of solid tumors is zzso zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso zzso leads to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso B on the tumor cell membrane and its zzso The objective of the present study was to determine if an zzso zzso pH such as that observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso affects the activity of zzso zzso zzso B, that contribute to degradation of collagen IV by tumor cells when grown in biologically relevant three-dimensional zzso zzso For these studies, we used 1) zzso zzso basement membrane overlay cultures of human zzso 2) live cell imaging zzso to assess zzso and 3) in zzso imaging of active tumor zzso At zzso zzso there were increases in zzso active zzso zzso and in degradation of zzso collagen IV, which was partially blocked by a zzso B zzso Imaging zzso for active zzso zzso localized to tumors in zzso The amount of bound probe decreased in tumors in zzso mice, a treatment previously shown to increase zzso zzso and reduce local invasion of the zzso Our results are consistent with the zzso invasion hypothesis and with a role for zzso B in promoting degradation of a basement membrane protein zzso zzso type IV zzso in an zzso zzso zzso
