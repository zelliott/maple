The zzso inhibitor zzso exhibits zzso activity in many zzso including mantle cell zzso zzso Unfortunately, many patients fail to respond to treatment or become zzso zzso is an effective zzso that in combination with some zzso agents has shown clinical activity in phase II and III zzso The aim of this study was to use zzso cell lines to investigate the potential benefit of combining clinically relevant doses of zzso with two different zzso doses zzso degrees zzso zzso and 44 degrees zzso zzso that mimic the zzso of the temperature zzso achieved within tumors during zzso zzso tumor cells were assessed for proliferation using the zzso zzso and for zzso by zzso V zzso while heat shock protein zzso levels were determined following western zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso cell lines that are sensitive to zzso are also zzso and have low zzso expression of zzso whereas the zzso zzso cell line strongly expresses zzso and is zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso cell lines with heat at the two different zzso doses, and the transient zzso of zzso and zzso do not impair their primary sensitivity to zzso Finally, we show that the concurrent treatment of heat and zzso results in additive killing in zzso cell zzso conclusion, these results suggest that the application of zzso under zzso conditions, in mantle cell zzso cells may be beneficial and warrants further zzso
