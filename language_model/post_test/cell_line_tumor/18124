zzso 95 is a fully human zzso zzso that recognizes zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso 95 exhibits both zzso and zzso activities zzso M et zzso zzso J Cancer zzso zzso In this study we investigated the biological activities of zzso 95 on breast tumor cells both in zzso and in zzso In zzso treatment with zzso 95 decreased the viability of breast tumor cells adhering to zzso zzso 95 inhibited tumor cell zzso migration, and invasion in zzso zzso 95 treatment also induced zzso zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso that recruits both structural and signaling molecules to focal zzso (Turner zzso zzso J zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso Trends Cell zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso 95 zzso breast tumor cell growth, migration and invasion by interruption of zzso zzso zzso focal zzso and cell zzso zzso In zzso studies of zzso 95 were conducted in an zzso breast tumor zzso zzso Treatment with zzso 95 resulted in significant zzso of both tumor growth and spontaneous zzso of zzso cells to the zzso zzso 95 also inhibited lung zzso in a separate experimental zzso vein zzso model of zzso The results presented here demonstrate the zzso and zzso activities of zzso 95 in breast cancer models and provide insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms zzso its zzso effects on zzso
