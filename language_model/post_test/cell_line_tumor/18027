zzso cancer continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in men around the zzso The field of prostate cancer research continues to be hindered by the lack of relevant zzso models to study zzso and to further development of effective prevention and therapeutic zzso The zzso Cancer Foundation held a zzso Cancer Models Working Group zzso Summit on August 6th and 7th, 2007 to address these zzso The zzso reviewed the state of prostate cancer zzso models and identified the current limitations of cell line, zzso and genetically engineered mouse models that have hampered the transition of scientific findings from these models to human clinical zzso In addition the zzso identified administrative issues that inhibit the exchange of models and impede greater interactions between academic centers and these centers with zzso The zzso identified potential solutions for discovery bottlenecks that include: zzso insufficient number of models with insufficient molecular and zzso diversity to reflect human cancer, zzso a lack of understanding of the molecular events that define zzso zzso a lack of tools for studying zzso zzso zzso difficulty in zzso model systems across institutions, and zzso addressing why zzso studies appear not to be zzso of human clinical zzso It should be possible to apply the knowledge gained molecular and zzso studies to develop new cell lines and models that mimic progressive and fatal prostate cancer and ultimately improve zzso
