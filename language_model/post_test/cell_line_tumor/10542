zzso and zzso are frequently observed after zzso for zzso zzso zzso although zzso of zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso induced by radiation has been claimed to be involved, the mechanism is not clarified zzso In the present study, by using zzso a human zzso cell line with zzso potential, and its zzso in nude mice, we found that radiation induced a zzso to zzso temporary increase in the expression of zzso and zzso both in zzso and in zzso but only the in zzso zzso of zzso cells was zzso while the in zzso zzso potential of tumors was zzso zzso 30 days after radiation, when the expression of zzso and zzso decreased to zzso control levels, the in zzso dissemination and zzso potential of residual tumors have just begun to increase with zzso of zzso which induced loss of zzso through induction of zzso zzso 1 zzso an zzso zzso zzso and led to zzso transition zzso This process was blocked by treatment of zzso In conclusion, our study revealed novel findings regarding the zzso effect of radiation on the zzso potential of residual zzso zzso of zzso has a critical role in zzso long-term dissemination and zzso of residual zzso by zzso zzso These findings may provide new clues to suppress the zzso dissemination and zzso thereby improve the prognosis of zzso zzso
