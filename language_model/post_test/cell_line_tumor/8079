The DNA zzso inhibitor zzso zzso has therapeutic value for the treatment of zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso activity is an important unresolved zzso In this study, we found that zzso at limited zzso induced zzso of zzso cancer zzso cell proliferation as well as increased zzso caused by DNA damage, which was independent of the zzso zzso Regarding the mechanisms, for the first time, we examined that zzso against zzso cells was regulated via zzso of DNA zzso zzso zzso and then zzso the expression of zzso We therefore conclude that zzso is a relevant target for zzso dependent effects of zzso on zzso cancer zzso zzso
