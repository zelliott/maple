The mechanism involved in generating zzso zzso zzso remains zzso as DNA is poorly zzso zzso mimicry between DNA and zzso substances has been implicated as a possible zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso zzso protein zzso which is induced by zzso zzso stress, is recognized by zzso DNA zzso zzso from patients with systemic lupus zzso and that zzso with zzso elicits zzso zzso in zzso zzso In this study, we observed that zzso DNA zzso zzso were also generated in zzso zzso mice and established an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which specifically zzso with zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso on zzso zzso was identified by screening a synthetic zzso zzso The binding of the zzso zzso to the zzso was competitively inhibited by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso exists in a human zzso mimics zzso and shows zzso for zzso zzso in normal zzso zzso zzso are often found in patients with drug-induced lupus zzso Treatment with representative drugs that cause drug-induced lupus zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso expression and zzso in zzso zzso These findings suggest that molecular mimicry between zzso and zzso is involved in zzso zzso production in drug-induced zzso
