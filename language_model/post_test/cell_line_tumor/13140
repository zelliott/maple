zzso are zzso junctions that zzso strong zzso zzso thus zzso resistance against mechanical stress on zzso zzso A body of evidence indicates that decreased expression of zzso proteins is associated with poor prognosis in various zzso As a key component of zzso plaque zzso the functional role of zzso zzso in cancer is not yet zzso Here, we reported the zzso activity of zzso in zzso cell lung cancer zzso We found by zzso DNA zzso that zzso expression was zzso in 8 out of 11 lung cancer cell lines and in 34 out of 56 primary lung tumors zzso zzso expression of zzso in the zzso cell line zzso significantly inhibited cell zzso zzso growth, migration and invasion and also increased the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso induced by an zzso drug, zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso enhanced expression of zzso zzso resulting in decreased zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso activity and reduced expression of the zzso target genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso suppression by small interfering zzso resulted in zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso is zzso in lung cancer by an zzso zzso increases the sensitivity to zzso drug-induced zzso and has zzso function, possibly through zzso of the zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso The zzso regulation of zzso and its ability to increase the sensitivity to zzso drug-induced zzso has potential implications for clinical zzso
