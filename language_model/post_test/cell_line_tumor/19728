zzso class II is expressed in restricted lineages and is modulated in response to pathogens and inflammatory zzso This expression is controlled by zzso zzso which is transcribed from multiple zzso Although factors required for induction of zzso are well zzso less is known about the mechanisms leading to repression of this zzso During plasma cell zzso B zzso maturation zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso of zzso responsible for zzso expression in B zzso zzso is zzso by zzso in zzso zzso and B zzso An zzso regulatory zzso zzso in zzso which is bound by zzso and zzso is necessary for this zzso This site matches the zzso consensus binding site, and zzso is expressed in cell lineages in which this promoter is zzso zzso therefore, investigated whether zzso regulates zzso and found that zzso bound to zzso in zzso and the zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso induction of a zzso zzso reporter in a fashion dependent on an intact consensus sequence and competes with zzso for binding to the zzso and promoter zzso In human myeloma cell lines that express zzso zzso occupancy of zzso was associated with resistance to zzso zzso while short interfering zzso zzso of zzso led to zzso of zzso Our data indicate that zzso is a zzso of zzso identifying a target of particular relevance to zzso and zzso These findings support a model in which zzso can zzso the cellular response to zzso by competing with zzso dependent zzso of target zzso
