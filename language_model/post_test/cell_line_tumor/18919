Early tumor detection and intervention are important zzso of survival in patients with zzso We have recently reported that the zzso zzso zzso may be used to detect microscopic tumors in zzso We now present evidence that changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso detect zzso growth across a spectrum of human zzso in zzso A zzso expression of an zzso protein was observed by zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso comparison of zzso from normal and zzso zzso The zzso expressed protein was identified as zzso by tandem mass zzso and zzso zzso using zzso zzso The zzso zzso appeared to be zzso in early growth of human zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso follow-up study of zzso revealed a sustained zzso or higher increase of zzso zzso at 19, 30, and 120 zzso In contrast, only an insignificant change of zzso was observed in the plasma of mice bearing the different human tumor zzso and throughout the 120 days of the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso but not its plasma counterpart, may represent a potential zzso of early tumor zzso
