zzso zzso has been demonstrated to alter the expression of genes associated with zzso zzso in zzso involved in the zzso of type 2 zzso however, the underlying molecular mechanism has not been fully zzso zzso In this study, we report that the sodium zzso gene expression of the small zzso partner zzso zzso an zzso orphan nuclear zzso regulates the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in an zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activated zzso and was shown to zzso cellular zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso level was blocked by zzso zzso of dominant negative zzso zzso or by the zzso inhibitor compound C in zzso cell zzso We demonstrated the zzso induction of zzso zzso levels by sodium zzso and zzso the zzso gene expression of the key zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso blocked the repressive effects of zzso zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibited the promoter activity of zzso and zzso and this repression was abolished by small interfering zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso expression by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso released the sodium zzso repression of zzso zzso and zzso gene expression in a variety of zzso cell zzso zzso from our study suggest that sodium zzso zzso zzso via zzso to inhibit the expression of zzso zzso genes and also provide us with a novel molecular mechanism of zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso
