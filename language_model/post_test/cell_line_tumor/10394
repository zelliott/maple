zzso a zzso factor from the zzso bell zzso zzso zzso can stimulate cell migration and inhibit cell zzso To study the zzso relationship of zzso we constructed zzso and zzso zzso plasmids and expressed zzso proteins in zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene zzso mature zzso was obtained by zzso while the zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso clones were constructed, and zzso into zzso expression zzso The fusion proteins were induced by zzso at 37 Degrees zzso The zzso zzso fusion proteins expressed mainly in the inclusion zzso The zzso zzso could be zzso by using zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the inclusion body zzso The fusion proteins were analyzed by zzso and Western zzso The yield of zzso zzso fusion proteins of above zzso purity was about 20 zzso All three zzso zzso proteins can promote the migration of zzso cells in a zzso manner with no obvious activity zzso
