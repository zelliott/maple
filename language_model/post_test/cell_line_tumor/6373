The zzso zzso zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso their natural zzso zzso as well as the related orphan zzso zzso are widely distributed, and frequently zzso by zzso There is increased interest in zzso for this zzso family to explore their roles in zzso zzso and for zzso in zzso However, there is minimal data on human pharmacology of zzso zzso zzso and most results are based on nonhuman zzso studies, particular zzso which with other receptors frequently differ from zzso To address this issue we compared zzso affinities and zzso of cell zzso zzso zzso C zzso for 24 putative zzso (12 natural, 12 zzso in four different cells with these zzso containing native receptors or receptors expressed at zzso zzso and compared the results to native rat zzso containing cells zzso or rat zzso zzso cells zzso zzso There were close correlations zzso zzso between their zzso for the two zzso or zzso zzso Twelve zzso had high affinities zzso 1 zzso for zzso zzso with 15 selective for it zzso zzso eight had high zzso for zzso receptors and four were selective for zzso Only synthetic zzso zzso containing zzso had high affinity for zzso but also had high zzso for all zzso zzso There was no correlation between affinities for human zzso receptors and rat zzso receptors zzso zzso but zzso zzso results correlated with rat zzso zzso zzso zzso These results zzso the human and rat zzso zzso for zzso differs zzso whereas they do not for zzso zzso therefore potential zzso zzso for human studies (such as zzso zzso must be assessed on human zzso zzso The current study provides zzso on a large number of potential zzso that might be useful for human zzso
