zzso microscopic study of changes in cultured cells caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed significant structural changes, most pronounced in zzso and zzso cells not forming a compact zzso with tight junctions between the zzso formation of numerous zzso on the cell surface and zzso zzso of the zzso swelling of zzso clarification of their zzso and zzso zzso and increase in the number of zzso zzso zzso predominated in zzso culture, while zzso was less zzso zzso of zzso to zzso cells forming a differentiated polarized zzso led to extension of zzso spaces not zzso tight zzso swelling of zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso zzso These changes virtually completely coincided with those caused by the so-called zzso factor zzso zzso described as new zzso zzso zzso These findings confirm our previous hypothesis about the identity of these zzso
