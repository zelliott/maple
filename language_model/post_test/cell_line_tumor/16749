zzso derivatives are used as the zzso treatment of zzso cancer, despite their severe side effects and development of zzso We developed a novel combination therapy by combining zzso with zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cancer cell lines with combination therapy acted zzso to induce cell death, thus required a lower dose of zzso to achieve the same therapeutic zzso zzso and zzso combination induced cell death through the generation of zzso oxygen species zzso for zzso while DNA damage for zzso suggesting that zzso binds directly to DNA to form zzso while zzso indirectly damages DNA through zzso zzso Our results for the first time suggest that combining low dose of zzso with zzso dose of zzso can serve as a potential combination therapy for the treatment of zzso cancer with the potential to zzso the side effects associated with high doses of zzso
