We evaluated the efficacy of a combination strategy, zzso a modified zzso human zzso plus zzso against zzso and zzso zzso By colony formation zzso synergistic effects of the combination of zzso and zzso were observed on the zzso of human zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso inhibited zzso events in zzso Examined with zzso zzso zzso invasion was more efficiently suppressed by combination of zzso and zzso than by the respective single zzso But the combination treatment of zzso and zzso to zzso cells did not alter the migration of zzso The migration of zzso tended to zzso with zzso zzso as determined by zzso zzso formation zzso rat zzso ring zzso and chick zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso indicated that the zzso effects of zzso were significantly enhanced by zzso In mouse zzso zzso and human zzso zzso subcutaneous zzso zzso plus zzso presented more potent efficacy in tumor growth suppression than the single drug zzso The above confirms the zzso of zzso and zzso on zzso and suppression of zzso zzso The zzso effects of the combination indicate that zzso plus zzso might be a positive strategy for cancer zzso
