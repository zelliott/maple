Cold atmospheric plasma zzso an ambient temperature zzso gas, is gaining extensive interest as a promising addition to zzso therapy primarily due to the ability to generate and control delivery of zzso zzso excited zzso zzso zzso and zzso species such as zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso nitrogen species zzso to a specific zzso The zzso composition of zzso offers the opportunity to mediate several signaling pathways that regulate tumor zzso zzso the array of zzso generated products has limited the identification of the mechanisms of action on tumor zzso The aim of this work is to assess the cell death response of human zzso leukemia cells by remote exposure to zzso generated zzso by utilizing a novel zzso barrier discharge system that primarily produces zzso The effect of variable treatments of zzso generated zzso was tested in zzso cell zzso zzso leukemia cell zzso a model for zzso zzso The number of viable cells was evaluated with zzso zzso while zzso and necrosis was assessed by zzso zzso observed by zzso gel zzso and detection of cells with the zzso dye zzso zzso and zzso labeled zzso by flow zzso and fluorescent zzso Our observations indicate that treatment dosage levels of 45 s of exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso cell death and for higher dosage conditions of zzso s of exposure to zzso induced zzso zzso the results suggest that zzso zzso zzso play a significant role in the zzso potential of zzso
