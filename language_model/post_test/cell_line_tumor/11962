The aim of this work was to characterize the zzso zzso of zzso acid from the maternal zzso Using 2 human zzso cell lines zzso and zzso we verified that zzso of zzso acid was zzso increasing significantly with decreasing zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso of zzso acid at pH zzso was zzso zzso zzso inhibited by zzso acid, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibited by the zzso transport zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso zzso inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso cyanide zzso zzso zzso not inhibited by zzso of zzso zzso zzso D and zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso and zzso not affected by an zzso folate zzso zzso zzso At pH zzso zzso of zzso acid was zzso zzso zzso inhibited by zzso acid and zzso but not by zzso zzso inhibited by zzso but not by zzso zzso not affected by zzso zzso inhibited by zzso (but not by zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso acid (but not by zzso and zzso inhibited by an zzso zzso In conclusion, in zzso cells, both zzso and zzso zzso seem to be involved in zzso acid zzso at pH zzso whereas at pH zzso zzso and zzso a low zzso zzso distinct from zzso are zzso
