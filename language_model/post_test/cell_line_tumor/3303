The main objective of this study was to develop an optimal zzso zzso prepared by zzso drug delivery system zzso which is a mixture of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 1944 and a zzso zzso containing zzso zzso in order to offer controlled release of zzso To achieve this goal, zzso and zzso were dissolved by zzso like zzso There was not observed any change in molecular weight of zzso after being zzso by zzso The zzso size for all of the zzso of zzso was found in the range of zzso by dynamic light scattering zzso It was observed that the zzso size of zzso without zzso was smaller than that of zzso containing zzso by transmission electron zzso zzso The zzso of zzso containing zzso was almost of zzso shape with smooth surface and there was no zzso or zzso among zzso of zzso by atomic force zzso zzso The release zzso of zzso from zzso containing zzso having various molecular weights zzso zzso and zzso exhibited a zzso pattern characterized by a fast initial release during the first zzso followed by a slower and continuous release for zzso in contrast that the release of zzso from zzso without zzso was finished during zzso This result was identical with the result of zzso activity in zzso of zzso from zzso containing zzso against human breast cancer cell line zzso and this zzso enhanced zzso activity in zzso compared with zzso without zzso against zzso human zzso cancer cells bearing nude mice zzso
