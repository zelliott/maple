The zzso gene maps within a linkage zzso block containing the zzso zzso associated with prognosis and survival in lung cancer zzso Survival discrepancies between Asians and Caucasians point to ethnic differences in zzso zzso of the functional genetic zzso 

Analysis of three zzso zzso zzso mapping in the zzso zzso region using a zzso reporter system showed that zzso zzso in linkage zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso in Asians but not in zzso modulated zzso activity of the zzso promoter in cell lines expressing zzso and zzso zzso factors, which potentially bind to the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter activity and thus might affect zzso levels in normal lung and in lung tumors, representing a candidate ethnically specific genetic factor underlying the association between the zzso locus and lung cancer patients' zzso
