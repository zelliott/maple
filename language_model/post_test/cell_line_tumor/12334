zzso zzso zzso is an important cancer in Malaysia and is one of the major causes of cancer mortality in this zzso This study evaluates the diagnostic and zzso values in the quantitative relationship between the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso acid zzso load and the zzso zzso 

Blood plasma from 18 zzso zzso patients, 20 zzso patients who had been treated with zzso and 12 healthy individuals were zzso zzso copy number was determined following DNA extraction using real-time quantitative zzso chain zzso 

The zzso zzso DNA load was shown to be zzso related to the presence of zzso zzso While the zzso copy number in zzso zzso patients had a median of zzso zzso viral load in plasma of healthy controls was significantly lower zzso of 0 zzso A significant decrease in zzso load was observed in patients who had undergone zzso while a high viral load indicated in one patient correlated to zzso zzso and presence of distant zzso upon clinical zzso 

The blood plasma zzso DNA load was shown to be zzso related to the presence of zzso zzso This preliminary study underscores the zzso value of zzso zzso DNA zzso
