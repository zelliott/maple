zzso plays an important role in the progression of prostate cancer and is an attractive target for the development of novel zzso tumor zzso We previously reported the design and synthesis of a novel, zzso and relatively selective zzso inhibitor known as a zzso zzso zzso In the present work, we examined the zzso zzso through detailed zzso relationship zzso A variety of zzso zzso modified at the zzso positions with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso at the zzso position with zzso zzso were tested for their zzso activity, zzso stability, and zzso zzso By incorporating d zzso at the zzso position or a zzso zzso zzso we obtained zzso with an improved stability profile and excellent zzso zzso The zzso or zzso zzso also has improved specificity toward zzso whereas specificity was reduced for a zzso modified with the zzso zzso such as zzso
