Loss or reduction in function of tumor zzso genes contributes to zzso Here, by zzso DNA copy number analysis using zzso zzso zzso array and mass zzso we report zzso deletion in zzso zzso at zzso zzso where zzso gene is zzso We found decreased cell proliferation of a series of zzso cell lines by forced expression of zzso We then generated zzso zzso cells, where zzso expression could be activated by exposure of the cells to zzso Both ex zzso cellular proliferation and in zzso growth of zzso transplanted tumors in mice are reduced in zzso cells with zzso expression zzso compared with zzso zzso cells zzso zzso cells form zzso with zzso and zzso expression in zzso medium but zzso cells do zzso Compared with zzso zzso cells, adherent zzso cells display lower zzso indicating zzso decreases the number of zzso zzso Gene expression analysis and zzso zzso zzso reveal that zzso growth factor 2 zzso is zzso zzso by zzso especially in cells cultured in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso of the zzso cells, suggesting that loss of zzso increases the number of zzso cells through zzso zzso of zzso These results illustrate that zzso is a distinctive tumor zzso which does not only suppress growth of tumor cells but also regulates zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso
