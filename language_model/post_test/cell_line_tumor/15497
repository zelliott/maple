zzso in cell states are controlled by zzso actions of zzso zzso zzso the key regulator of primordial germ cell zzso zzso apparently acts together with zzso and zzso To investigate their individual and zzso functions, we first sought an in zzso system for zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequencing zzso We then integrated this data with information from zzso zzso analysis of normal and zzso zzso Here we show that zzso binds directly to repress zzso and cell proliferation zzso It also directly zzso zzso which together with zzso zzso the zzso zzso We determined the occupancy of critical genes by zzso when zzso altogether with those of zzso and zzso (both individually and zzso reveals a zzso mutually zzso zzso network for zzso We also demonstrate that, in principle, zzso zzso and zzso are sufficient for zzso zzso and the unprecedented zzso of the zzso towards a zzso zzso
