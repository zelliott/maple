Breast cells drive bone zzso during zzso and zzso zzso A shared mechanism among these zzso and pathological states is zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso which acts through zzso to stimulate zzso bone zzso The regulation of zzso has not been accounted for fully by any conventional zzso stimuli or tumor growth zzso zzso zzso synthesis within breast zzso cells is induced during zzso and in advancing breast zzso Here we report that zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso results in a reduction of zzso zzso expression during zzso which is rescued by restoring zzso zzso zzso induced zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso cells from either mouse or zzso In human breast cancer cells zzso induced both zzso and the zzso zzso factor zzso Based on zzso expression and pharmacological evidence, the zzso zzso type was implicated as being critical for induction of zzso and zzso These results connect zzso synthesis to the induction of zzso factors in the normal zzso zzso and in breast cancer zzso
