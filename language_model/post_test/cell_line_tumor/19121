zzso as a zzso can elicit severe Parkinson's zzso syndrome by zzso zzso zzso oxygen species levels and zzso zzso In this study, we examined the effect of zzso which was extracted from zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso and the underlying mechanism in human zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that the protective effects of zzso zzso 1 and 10 zzso on zzso zzso may be ascribed to its zzso properties by reducing zzso oxygen species levels, and its zzso effect via protecting zzso membrane potential zzso zzso zzso enhancing zzso zzso zzso activity and reduced zzso zzso levels, and regulating zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso inhibited the release of zzso c and zzso factor zzso and the protein expression of activated zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso may provide a useful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of progressive neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's zzso
