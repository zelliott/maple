The zzso system zzso and zzso zzso zzso are two major zzso pathways for protein zzso Recent studies suggest that zzso zzso may reduce tumor growth and activate zzso Due to the dual roles of zzso in tumor cell survival and death, the effect of zzso on the destiny of zzso cells remains zzso In this study, we sought to investigate whether zzso of the zzso can induce zzso and the effects of zzso on the fate of human zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso inhibitor zzso was used to induce zzso in zzso zzso cells, and the effect of zzso on the survival of zzso zzso cells was investigated using an zzso inhibitor zzso Cell viability was measured by zzso zzso zzso and cell cycle were detected by flow zzso The expression of zzso related proteins was determined by Western zzso 

zzso inhibited cell zzso induced cell death and cell cycle arrest at zzso phase, and activated zzso in zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso was significantly zzso and part of zzso was converted into zzso However, when zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso and zzso the cells became less viable, but cell death and cell numbers at zzso phase zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso the expression of zzso and zzso was significantly zzso and the conversion of zzso from zzso was also zzso 

zzso of the zzso can induce zzso in human zzso zzso cells, and zzso of zzso increases cell zzso This discovery may shed new light on the effect of zzso on modulating the fate of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
