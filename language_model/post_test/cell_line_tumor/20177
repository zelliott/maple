Agents with selective toxicity to hypoxic cells have shown promise as zzso to zzso Our previous studies showed that the zzso zzso agent zzso had an extremely large differential toxicity to severely hypoxic and zzso cells in cell culture, and was effective in killing the hypoxic cells of zzso mouse zzso tumors in zzso However, the limited zzso of that compound precluded its development as an zzso zzso Here we report our initial studies with zzso a zzso analog of zzso The zzso of zzso to zzso cells in zzso was similar to that of zzso with both agents producing only minimal zzso to zzso cells even after intensive treatments, while producing pronounced zzso to zzso zzso This resulted in large differentials in the zzso to hypoxic and zzso cells zzso at 10 zzso Low pH had only minimal effects on the zzso of zzso Under hypoxic conditions, zzso cells zzso to express high levels of either human or mouse versions of the repair protein zzso zzso which is also known as zzso zzso were much more resistant to zzso than parental zzso cells lacking zzso zzso confirming the importance of DNA zzso to the zzso of this zzso Studies with zzso tumors in zzso zzso mice using both tumor cell survival and tumor growth delay zzso showed that zzso was effective as an adjunct to zzso for the treatment of solid tumors in zzso producing additive or zzso effects in most combination regimens for which the interactions could be zzso Our findings encourage additional zzso studies to examine further the zzso effects of zzso alone and in combination with radiation, and to examine the pharmacology and zzso of this new zzso zzso agent so that its potential for clinical use as an zzso to zzso can be zzso
