The individual zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and their structures were determined by X-ray zzso zzso and zzso inhibit cell growth because they are strong zzso zzso of DNA zzso II, whereas zzso acts through the formation of DNA zzso It was hypothesized that zzso complexes of zzso and zzso would retain both activities and yield drugs with a dual mode of zzso Both zzso and zzso inhibited Chinese zzso zzso cell growth, but more zzso than zzso and zzso zzso Based on their weak zzso II zzso activity, it was concluded that these compounds did not inhibit cell growth by targeting zzso zzso A comparison of the zzso of zzso to that of zzso bound to the zzso interface of zzso II showed that the highly constrained zzso was in a highly zzso zzso for zzso Neither of the platinum complexes were able to zzso zzso Thus the cell growth zzso activity of these complexes was also not likely due to any zzso zzso zzso
