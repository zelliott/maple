zzso zzso pH zzso is a common feature of the tumor zzso and has been implicated in tumor invasion through the induction of zzso zzso zzso constitute the major storehouse of cellular zzso the trafficking of zzso to the cell periphery may be required in order to zzso zzso We demonstrate that a zzso of zzso induced the trafficking of zzso to membrane zzso in the cell zzso This trafficking event depended upon the zzso pathway, the zzso zzso and zzso exchange activity, resulting in zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a zzso zzso (although zzso zzso was not sufficient for zzso zzso zzso trafficking and zzso and zzso of zzso activity with the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso agent zzso prevented zzso trafficking to the cell zzso Interestingly, using the more specific zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, we show that multiple zzso zzso are involved in zzso zzso zzso trafficking and zzso Moreover, in cells expressing zzso zzso although zzso zzso activity was zzso zzso still underwent zzso zzso zzso compensation by other zzso family zzso these data zzso zzso zzso especially zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso trafficking and zzso
