The ability of zzso to form DNA zzso was investigated in a series of human tumor cell lines consisting of human cervical cancer zzso human breast cancer zzso and human zzso zzso zzso The zzso human zzso leukemia cell line zzso was also compared to the parental cell line zzso in terms of zzso formation in cellular DNA, zzso and zzso DNA zzso formation detected using zzso as a single agent occurred at very low levels but addition of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso formation considerably in all cell lines zzso zzso formation increased when increasing ratios of zzso were used, and were observed at zzso levels when zzso addition was 4 h after the addition of zzso However, low levels of zzso were observed when zzso addition was 16 h prior to zzso The ability of zzso to form zzso with DNA, zzso and protein was assessed in zzso cells, and DNA was found to be the major zzso for zzso zzso zzso was also shown to be a good zzso while protein zzso levels were consistently very zzso In zzso zzso cells, DNA zzso levels were approximately fourfold zzso To establish the influence of DNA zzso on the ability of zzso to form zzso in cells, zzso was used to reduce DNA zzso levels in cells prior to zzso zzso This was clearly shown to influence zzso formation, with increasing zzso levels leading to a decrease in the level of zzso observed in both zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso these results suggest that two major factors that influence the extent of zzso zzso formation in cells are the availability of zzso and the extent of zzso DNA zzso
