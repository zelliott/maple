zzso compounds represent promising zzso therapeutic zzso In this study, the mechanism of action of a novel zzso drug, a zzso zzso complex zzso zzso and zzso was zzso The tested compound induced zzso in nine different human cancer cell lines that originated from various zzso suggesting a broad spectrum of zzso The zzso values were significantly higher for zzso cells when compared with cancer zzso We found that cells treated with the zzso complex exhibited increased zzso zzso activities and zzso zzso as demonstrated by nuclear zzso and DNA zzso zzso features, such as cellular shrinkage and zzso were also observed, indicating that zzso was the primary mechanism of cell zzso zzso treatment induced DNA zzso breaks both in zzso and in zzso potentially accounting for the source of stress in these zzso Although zzso zzso activities were elevated after zzso treatment, zzso or using zzso of zzso 3 did not block zzso Other molecules that could potentially play a role in zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso were also tested using zzso zzso However, none of these proteins were essential for cell death, indicating either that these molecules do not participate in zzso zzso or that other pathways were activated in their zzso zzso this new zzso might represent a promising zzso agent that exhibits zzso in zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso cancer zzso
