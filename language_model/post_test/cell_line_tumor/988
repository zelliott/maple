zzso zzso protein zzso is a zzso break sensor involved in DNA repair and signal zzso In the present study, we constructed zzso zzso zzso to explore the range of DNA zzso that are recognized by zzso zzso zzso zzso A comparison between different zzso zzso showed that zzso associates zzso with the crossover region of synthetic Holliday zzso This interaction with zzso junctions was preserved when zzso complexes were assembled at the zzso to exclude the binding of zzso zzso The association of zzso with Holliday junctions was zzso even in the presence of zzso zzso but this interaction could be stabilized when the DNA zzso were incubated with the zzso zzso in nuclear extracts of human zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in cellular extracts also demonstrated that zzso binds to DNA ends and zzso junctions with similar affinities in the context of a nuclear protein zzso zzso zzso using zzso proteins as a zzso showed that, in association with zzso structures, zzso adopts an active zzso different from that in the complex with linear zzso Our results are consistent with a zzso but zzso and DNA zzso recruitment of zzso to Holliday junction zzso This observation suggests an unexpected functional link between the two main pathways that are responsible for the repair of DNA zzso breaks in zzso zzso
