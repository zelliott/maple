The E6 proteins from zzso zzso types of human zzso zzso are characterized by the presence of a zzso zzso binding motif in their extreme zzso zzso through which they interact with a number of cellular zzso zzso zzso In order to ascertain how many of these are zzso by E6 in zzso we performed an extensive analysis of the effects of E6 zzso on the expression levels of a number of previously reported E6 zzso zzso Using zzso type 16 zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso cells, we have found that zzso is a major degradation target of both zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all exhibit various degrees of zzso to zzso degradation, and a high degree of zzso type specificity is observed for certain zzso We also show that E6 zzso targets zzso within the nucleus and at membrane zzso One of the direct consequences of zzso degradation is a loss of zzso integrity, as determined by zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso of E6 expression restores tight zzso and this restoration is dependent on the presence of zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso E6 proteins disrupt cellular tight junctions through the degradation of zzso and they provide further evidence of how the zzso binding potential of E6 can contribute to zzso zzso
