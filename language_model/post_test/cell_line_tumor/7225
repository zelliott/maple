We have isolated from the plant zzso zzso three novel zzso with binding affinity for the zzso zzso In this study, we evaluated these zzso namely zzso I, zzso II and zzso III for their potential selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We examined their ability, zzso to induce the insulin growth factor binding zzso zzso in zzso breast cancer cells, zzso to stimulate differentiation and zzso of zzso cell culture by zzso zzso for alkaline zzso zzso zzso zzso and calcium levels in the zzso and zzso to inhibit cell proliferation of cervical zzso zzso cells by use of the zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso effect was investigated by carrying out zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on transient zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso were included to serve as control samples of the zzso and zzso effect zzso Our data reveal that zzso II is a highly potent zzso exhibiting zzso activity in breast cancer cells via the zzso zzso zzso effect on zzso and no zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, our study is the first to demonstrate that plant derived zzso show a zzso profile and may be considered for the prevention and treatment of diseases such as breast cancer, cervical cancer and zzso
