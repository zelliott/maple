With the use of zzso rabbit zzso protein and mouse zzso zzso we have analyzed the spatial relationship of the zzso defined zzso zzso and the major surface zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso to those zzso recognized by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso The ability of zzso zzso or rabbit zzso protein to inhibit specifically the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso indicates that the G protein and the zzso molecules are in close proximity to the viral and zzso zzso recognized by the zzso zzso By the method of sequential zzso we also demonstrated that only zzso percent of the zzso defined G and zzso molecules are in the zzso zzso
