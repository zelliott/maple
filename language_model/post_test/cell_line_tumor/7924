zzso growth factor zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that has been shown to promote tumor progression in solid zzso Clinical results for zzso targeting with specific zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso are zzso however, most studies indicate that only a zzso of patients receiving the zzso benefit from the zzso independent of zzso expression zzso To understand the in zzso zzso of zzso delivery and zzso we performed zzso PET studies with zzso zzso in zzso derived from 3 cell lines of human head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso 

zzso mice bearing zzso tumors with different levels of zzso expression were zzso with zzso PET using zzso acid zzso zzso distribution in the tumors was confirmed by ex zzso zzso using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Evans blue zzso were also performed to assess the tumor vascular density and zzso 

Among these 3 tumor models, zzso tumors with the lowest zzso protein expression showed the highest zzso zzso whereas zzso tumors with the highest zzso expression showed the lowest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso cells still had extremely high zzso expression after forming tumors in nude mice, indicating that the low zzso of zzso in zzso tumors was not due to the loss of zzso zzso The results from zzso zzso and Evans blue zzso zzso suggest that the low vessel density, poor vascular zzso and binding site barrier are likely responsible for the overall low tumor zzso of the highly zzso zzso zzso 

The results from this study provide a possible explanation for the lack of an observed correlation between therapeutic efficacy of zzso and zzso and zzso expression level as determined by zzso or fluorescent in zzso zzso and may shed new light on the complications of zzso zzso therapy for zzso and other zzso
