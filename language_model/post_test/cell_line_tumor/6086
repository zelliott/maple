zzso zzso zzso zzso is an aggressive tumor with a dismal zzso Unlike other zzso zzso zzso are rare in zzso Recent studies have showed that altered expression of zzso zzso is observed in human zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso of zzso a direct zzso target of zzso and the role of zzso on the zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso and expression of zzso were examined in zzso cell lines and zzso zzso was zzso to zzso cells to estimate the protein zzso cell zzso invasion, and cell zzso 

zzso zzso was present in 2 zzso of 6 zzso cell lines and 13 zzso of 47 tumors in zzso and in all 6 zzso cell lines zzso and 40 zzso of 47 tumors in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in all zzso cell lines was reduced and restored with zzso zzso Because zzso zzso was the major event in zzso we investigated the functional role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso expression exhibited zzso with zzso cell cycle arrest and suppression of migration, invasion, and zzso The forced zzso of zzso but not zzso showed a significant zzso effect with the induction of zzso in zzso zzso 

We show that the zzso zzso of zzso by zzso is a crucial zzso and plays an important role in the zzso of zzso suggesting potential therapeutic options for zzso
