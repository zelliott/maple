zzso is a childhood cancer that exhibits either a favorable or an zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso that play crucial roles in determining the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso complex assists in the folding and function of a variety of zzso client zzso zzso of zzso by small zzso zzso leads to the zzso of these zzso proteins and consequently suppresses tumor zzso Nonetheless, little is known about the effect of zzso zzso on the stability of zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of zzso zzso on the zzso of zzso zzso cells including its effect on zzso and zzso zzso Two zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso and two zzso cell lines zzso and zzso were used to address the effect of zzso zzso on the zzso zzso of zzso It was found that zzso zzso in zzso cell lines resulted in significant growth suppression, a decrease in zzso and zzso zzso and an increase in the expression of zzso In the zzso zzso cell line, zzso zzso enhanced the expression of the favorable zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso reduced zzso expression and enhanced zzso zzso Together our data suggest that zzso zzso suppresses the growth of zzso through multiple cellular pathways and that zzso zzso is among the important consequences of zzso zzso
