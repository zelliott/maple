zzso zzso is a zzso of the zzso zzso and both compounds exhibit a broad spectrum of zzso zzso We have developed a series of synthetic symmetrical zzso zzso zzso including zzso which are more potent than zzso as zzso of cancer cell and tumor zzso In colon cancer cells, zzso decreased cell proliferation and inhibited zzso to zzso zzso and this was accompanied by induction of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso in zzso and zzso colon cancer zzso zzso studies showed that induction of zzso in both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells by zzso was zzso factor 4 zzso dependent, and induction of zzso in zzso cells was also zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso promoter in zzso zzso cells showed that zzso activated zzso gene expression through the zzso zzso sites 1 and 2, and zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso and zzso bound to this region of the promoter, whereas in zzso cells unidentified upstream zzso were required for induction of zzso zzso (30 zzso also inhibited tumor growth and induced zzso in zzso nude mice bearing zzso cells as zzso showing that zzso zzso such as zzso represent a novel class of zzso drugs for clinical treatment of colon zzso
