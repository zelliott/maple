zzso zzso capture therapy zzso has been used clinically as a single zzso treatment for high-grade zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso The purpose of the present study was to determine whether its efficacy could be enhanced by an X-ray boost administered after zzso Two brain tumor models were used, the zzso zzso as a model for primary brain tumors and the zzso 27 human melanoma as a model for zzso brain zzso 

For zzso studies, either zzso zzso zzso cells were implanted zzso into the brains of zzso Fischer rats or zzso zzso 27 melanoma cells were implanted zzso into National Institutes of Health zzso nude zzso zzso studies were performed zzso days after zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso days after zzso of the zzso 27 zzso Animals bearing the zzso zzso received a combination of two zzso drugs, sodium zzso at a dose of 30 zzso and zzso zzso zzso at a dose of 250 zzso zzso 27 zzso rats received zzso zzso zzso containing an equivalent amount of zzso (27 zzso zzso The drugs were administered by either zzso or zzso zzso 

The tumor zzso concentration after zzso injection was approximately 50% greater in the zzso zzso and zzso 27 melanoma after zzso injection zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso injection zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was carried out at the Brookhaven National Laboratory Medical Research zzso approximately 14 days after tumor zzso of either the zzso zzso or the zzso 27 zzso zzso zzso days after zzso zzso of animals were zzso with zzso zzso produced by a linear accelerator at a total dose of 15 zzso delivered in zzso daily zzso zzso zzso rats that received zzso or zzso sodium zzso plus zzso followed zzso h later by zzso and zzso days later by X-rays, had similar mean survival times zzso days and 53 days, respectively, p zzso zzso and the non zzso zzso animals had a mean survival time of 52 and 40 days, respectively, for zzso zzso zzso zzso the latter was equivalent to that of the zzso zzso The corresponding survival time for zzso 27 zzso rats that received zzso or zzso zzso followed by zzso and then zzso was 75 and 82 days, respectively zzso zzso zzso 54 days without zzso zzso zzso zzso 37 days for zzso alone, and 24 days for zzso zzso In contrast to the data obtained with the zzso zzso zzso 27 zzso rats that received zzso zzso followed by zzso had a highly significant difference in mean survival time compared with the zzso controls (54 zzso 37 days, p zzso zzso 

Our data are the first to suggest that a significant therapeutic gain may be obtained when zzso is combined with an X-ray zzso Additional experimental studies are required to determine the optimal combination of zzso and zzso doses and whether it is more advantageous to administer the zzso boost before or after zzso
