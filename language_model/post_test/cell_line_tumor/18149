zzso are oral zzso agents that activate zzso zzso zzso zzso and exert potent zzso and zzso zzso It has also been shown that zzso zzso induce zzso arrest and zzso of zzso zzso Some of these effects have been suggested to result from zzso of zzso activity in target zzso The aim of our studies was to critically evaluate the zzso effects of one of zzso zzso and its influence on zzso zzso zzso exerted zzso zzso effects in zzso zzso zzso zzso of tumor cells with zzso resulted in increased levels of zzso and zzso and decreased levels of zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins within cells incubated with zzso suggested dysfunction of zzso zzso However, we did not observe any influence of zzso on the activity of isolated zzso and on the zzso activity in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Further, treatment with zzso did not cause an zzso of fluorescent zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells expressing unstable zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso does not act as a direct or indirect zzso zzso
