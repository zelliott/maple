zzso zzso zzso a steroid hormone zzso is critical for prostate cancer zzso However, zzso of zzso by zzso can also lead to growth suppression and zzso zzso zzso play an important role in this switch between zzso and zzso zzso target gene zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso a core component of the nuclear zzso zzso complex, shows both zzso and zzso activities on nuclear zzso but little is known about its effects on zzso and prostate zzso We characterized zzso as a zzso of zzso in prostate cancer cells and determined that the zzso is dependent on both zzso and zzso zzso We showed that zzso physically interacts with zzso and directly occupies the zzso elements of the affected zzso target genes in an zzso zzso zzso is primarily localized in the nucleus in benign prostate cells and nuclear expression is significantly reduced in prostate cancer cells in zzso Similarly, in human tumor samples, the expression of zzso in the nucleus is significantly reduced in the zzso zzso compared with the surrounding benign zzso zzso ( zzso zzso zzso expression of nuclear zzso leads to zzso growth suppression of prostate cancer cells in zzso and in zzso by selective zzso of zzso genes associated with differentiation zzso zzso and growth suppression zzso zzso but not cell proliferation of the prostate zzso zzso the molecular switches involved in the transition from zzso growth promotion to zzso growth suppression will lead to more successful treatments for prostate zzso
