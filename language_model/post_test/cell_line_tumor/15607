We have previously investigated the possibility of using zzso as a diagnostic tool for the zzso detection of flat zzso zzso In these clinical studies, it was shown that following zzso application in humans, zzso becomes selectively localized in transitional zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso In the present study, we characterized the zzso of zzso in rat zzso tumor and normal zzso layers after zzso zzso The zzso was evaluated using zzso zzso with computerized image analysis to image and zzso the zzso of zzso across the zzso tumor and normal zzso zzso The results show that the zzso zzso administration route provides selective zzso of both the tumor and normal zzso A zzso dose and zzso zzso increase in the zzso zzso intensity in both the tumor and zzso was observed, without significant zzso zzso in the zzso and muscle zzso The highest zzso ratios in zzso zzso in the tumor and normal zzso to the muscle layer were achieved at 4 h with 30 zzso M zzso zzso for the zzso to muscle layer and zzso for the tumor to muscle zzso The difference in zzso intensity in tumor tissue to the muscle layer following zzso of 8 zzso M zzso was zzso zzso and zzso at 1, 2 and 4 zzso zzso The difference in zzso intensity in tumor tissue to the muscle layer using 30 zzso M zzso was zzso zzso and zzso at 1, 2 and 4 zzso zzso The highest absolute zzso levels were observed in the tumor at 4 h with 30 zzso M zzso zzso The results suggest that under these conditions, zzso with zzso is likely to produce uniform zzso tumor zzso without causing damage to the underlying muscle zzso
