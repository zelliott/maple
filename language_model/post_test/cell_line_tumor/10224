zzso zzso was first described as an zzso zzso With the progress in research, zzso has come to be known as a versatile zzso that is involved in various aspects of immune regulations, and the entire picture of the function still remains zzso To uncover zzso unknown activity of zzso we have been examining the effect of the protein in various disease animal zzso Here we show that zzso attenuated zzso reaction in guinea pigs and suppressed zzso zzso in zzso These results indicate the mast cell stabilizing effect of zzso In zzso studies of mast cell zzso involving zzso cells demonstrated that zzso suppressed zzso from the cells zzso by zzso plus zzso and that the zzso effect was completely zzso in the presence of zzso indicating zzso activity of zzso is zzso We found that zzso strongly and specifically bound zzso which is a heavily zzso zzso and that the interaction prevented zzso complex formation, clarifying the mode of action of the zzso zzso zzso is expressed by several mast cells including mouse mast cell line zzso The fact that zzso stimuli of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso from the cells implies that zzso is an zzso regulator of mast cell function to suppress excessive zzso zzso these findings shed light on a novel function of zzso in mast cells and suggest a beneficial utility of zzso for the treatment of allergic disorders including zzso
