zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with zzso zzso The study was to compare the therapeutic effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Lewis lung zzso zzso cell line which could zzso express zzso gene in zzso 

The zzso zzso was zzso into LLC cells with zzso to obtain zzso cells which zzso express zzso zzso zzso were established on the right hind leg of zzso zzso mice by the subcutaneous injection of 2 zzso 106 LLC zzso Then all mice were divided into 4 groups zzso randomly when the tumors reached zzso zzso in zzso zzso the mice were treated by zzso injection of zzso zzso or zzso vaccine on the first, fourth, and seventh zzso zzso size was measured before and after zzso zzso growth curve, zzso and zzso activity of zzso cells, and tumor zzso zzso were observed after all mice were killed on the zzso zzso 

zzso growth were inhibited in mice treated with zzso zzso or zzso zzso the zzso and zzso cell activity was zzso by zzso Overall, the effects were more satisfactory in vaccine group than in zzso zzso There was abundant zzso and zzso T zzso zzso observed in both zzso 

zzso in LLC cell line can increase zzso cells and zzso zzso immune response could be induced both by zzso zzso and by zzso zzso the latter one could induce stronger zzso
