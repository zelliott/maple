zzso lupus zzso zzso is characterized by the production of zzso that are frequently directed against zzso zzso zzso To better understand how B cells zzso with such zzso are zzso we generated a model system in which heavy and light chain genes zzso zzso zzso have been targeted to the heavy and light chain zzso of the zzso zzso mouse zzso This zzso recognizes zzso zzso DNA, and zzso We show that B cells expressing this zzso were zzso producing zzso zzso in zzso despite the apparently normal induction of zzso This zzso production was largely dependent on zzso zzso 7 zzso We further show that production of these zzso was sufficient to cause kidney pathology in these zzso These results demonstrate that the particular threat of zzso zzso zzso lies in their ability to bind both zzso zzso and zzso
