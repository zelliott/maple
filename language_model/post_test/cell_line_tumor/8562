Reporters zzso into the zzso medium of cells in culture or into blood in zzso have shown to be useful tools for simple and zzso monitoring of biological processes in zzso Here, we characterize the naturally zzso zzso zzso as a zzso blood reporter and show that this reporter can be zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and alkaline zzso for simultaneous monitoring of three different cellular processes in the same biological zzso We applied this system to monitor the response of three different zzso of zzso cells to a clinically relevant zzso agent in the same well in culture or animal in zzso This system could be extended to any field to detect multiple processes in the same biological system and is amenable for zzso screening to find drugs that affect multiple cellular zzso zzso
