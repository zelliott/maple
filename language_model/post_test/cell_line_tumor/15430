We have previously shown that zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso increase proliferation of zzso tumor zzso zzso can also bind to G zzso zzso zzso and zzso of this zzso can either increase or decrease cell proliferation of several tumor zzso The aim of this study was to investigate zzso expression in zzso rat tumor zzso cells, evaluate effects of its zzso on zzso tumor cell proliferation and define the molecular mechanisms triggered in response to its zzso zzso cells express zzso and its zzso using the specific zzso zzso is associated with decreased cell proliferation and initiation of zzso zzso after zzso treatment was asserted by appearance of DNA zzso and zzso decrease in zzso and increase in zzso zzso zzso c release, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These effects were dependent on zzso zzso because after zzso of the zzso using a specific small interfering zzso zzso c release, zzso zzso and decrease in cell proliferation were zzso These events required a zzso however, sustained zzso regulated zzso 1/2 zzso zzso was able to decrease the growth of zzso zzso tumors in zzso nude mice while increasing the number of zzso zzso In addition, in zzso administration of zzso to male zzso mice did not cause any zzso in zzso zzso while zzso the zzso drug currently used for the therapy of zzso tumors, severely damaged zzso structure, an event associated with zzso in zzso zzso These observations indicate that zzso targeting for the therapy of zzso cell tumor may represent a good alternative to zzso to preserve fertility in zzso tumor zzso
