An zzso model based on thermodynamics lays bare that the cell size zzso of zzso zzso and zzso are zzso and belong to the same universal zzso Yet, when a cell absorbs mass or signals are zzso these conditions are zzso zzso zzso ideal growth conditions via an exponential process with a rate that slows down with the cell zzso In a growing ensemble, a distribution of relaxation modes comes in existence, exactly defined by the universal cell size zzso The discovery of zzso acoustic activities in cells led us to assume that in a growing ensemble acoustic signals may contribute significantly to the transmission of essential information about zzso disturbances to all cells, initiating that way coordinated zzso The frequency increases with the cell number zzso the period between successive zzso The completion of zzso occurring at a constant rate is thus progressively impaired, until cellular growth stops, zzso Due to this phenomenon, the so-called zzso cell colonies should exhibit a maximum cell zzso In populations with large cell numbers, zzso behaving zzso zzso should form zzso zzso Based on these ideas, we formulate equations that describe the growth zzso of all cell types, zzso that way the general nature of the growth zzso
