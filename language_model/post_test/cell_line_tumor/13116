A series of zzso patterns for chemically modified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso locked zzso acid zzso and zzso within zzso zzso is studied in zzso and in zzso in the context of the zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso no zzso zzso in zzso zzso is seen to be dependent on the chemical zzso with the in zzso results corresponding to the zzso zzso in zzso While in zzso zzso zzso zzso are typically reasonable zzso of in zzso results, zzso modified zzso zzso have poor in zzso zzso zzso as compared to zzso cell based zzso For zzso zzso zzso is seen to be highly sensitive to the length of the zzso and number of zzso zzso with longer zzso compounds giving less activity than zzso zzso Additionally, the degree of zzso for zzso zzso with identical sequences was seen to vary widely with only subtle changes in the chemical modification zzso While the zzso of zzso and zzso effects remains a sequence specific exercise, general trends emerge around preferred physical properties and modification zzso
