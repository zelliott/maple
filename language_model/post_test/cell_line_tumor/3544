To seek a novel therapeutic approach to zzso zzso we used three zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso to examine the underlining molecular mechanisms of cellular reactions and sensitivity to zzso acid zzso zzso cells expressed relatively high levels of zzso acid zzso alpha zzso and underwent zzso cell death that was blocked by an zzso zzso By contrast, zzso expression gradually decreased in zzso and zzso cells, which did not experience increased cell death in response to zzso We report here the zzso zzso of zzso expression during zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso cells have a zzso in zzso zzso resulting in sustained high expression of zzso that zzso high sensitivity to zzso zzso treatment with a zzso inhibitor dramatically increased zzso cell death in zzso and zzso cell zzso Our results reveal the crucial involvement of the zzso signaling zzso in zzso cell death and show that three zzso cell lines are zzso sensitive to zzso These data suggest a potential novel therapy for zzso involving zzso acid treatment combined with the zzso of zzso zzso
