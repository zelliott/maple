zzso breast zzso zzso or zzso differ from external radiation of whole breast in terms of zzso volumes, zzso radiation energy and dose zzso all factors influencing the treatment outcome in a complex zzso zzso obtained zzso values comparing effects of radiation used in zzso and external therapy are published, but experimental studies are required to confirm these zzso The aim of this study is to establish such zzso values for two breast cancer cell zzso 

Colony formation of breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso were studied after zzso zzso with qualities and dose rates used in zzso zzso and external zzso zzso values from survival data were used to compare zzso 

zzso the zzso energy zzso rate zzso zzso from 50 zzso zzso to 380 zzso zzso zzso and 6 zzso zzso zzso yielded an increase in the cell survival, whereas increasing the dose rate to 6 zzso had minor zzso Average zzso values for 50 zzso with 6 zzso as reference radiation varied from about zzso (for doses zzso 5 zzso to zzso zzso (for doses zzso zzso zzso for zzso cells and from about zzso to zzso zzso for zzso cells for the same dose zzso zzso zzso values for 380 zzso radiation were about zzso for zzso cells and zzso for zzso zzso 

zzso data for breast cancer cells exposed to radiation used in zzso zzso or external radiation differ among the cell lines zzso The values are in agreement with published theoretical and experimental zzso
