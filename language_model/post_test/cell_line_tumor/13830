To assess the influence of zzso in modulating the migration and invasion of human zzso zzso 

To profile the genes associated with zzso zzso cell zzso differential zzso chain reaction was performed and the findings were validated by Northern zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso human zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso into zzso zzso To follow zzso changes after zzso simple scratch test and zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso changes were documented by light and zzso zzso In addition, doubling times of the zzso and zzso zzso levels were determined in various zzso cell lines with different zzso 

zzso was highly expressed in zzso zzso zzso cells became small and flat, and zzso was zzso Furthermore, zzso cell zzso was inhibited markedly versus parental zzso zzso The doubling times of zzso and parent cells were 32 and 37 hours, zzso zzso zzso expression in the human zzso cell lines was zzso to their migratory and invasive zzso 

zzso zzso the migration and invasion in zzso cells, which may be useful in developing therapeutic approaches for the treatment of zzso
