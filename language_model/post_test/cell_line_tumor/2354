The zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso a zzso member of the basic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to regulate the toxicity of zzso zzso hydrocarbon environmental zzso most notably zzso However, the zzso has also been implicated in multiple stages of zzso zzso zzso a primary zzso brain tumor arising in infants and children, is thought to originate from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso precursors zzso zzso express high levels of the zzso in the external zzso layer of the developing zzso Moreover, our laboratory has previously reported that either abnormal zzso or deletion of the zzso leads to zzso of zzso cell cycle activity and zzso These observations led to the hypothesis that the zzso promotes the growth of zzso zzso this study evaluated whether the zzso serves a zzso role in an immortalized zzso tumor cell line zzso We produced a stable zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso short hairpin zzso zzso which exhibited a zzso reduction in zzso protein zzso Compared with zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso cells displayed an impaired zzso cell cycle transition, decreased DNA zzso and reduced zzso Furthermore, these cell cycle zzso were correlated with decreased levels of the zzso gene zzso and increased levels of the cell cycle inhibitor zzso zzso experiments with human zzso restored the zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our data show that the zzso promotes proliferation of zzso cells, suggesting that this zzso should be considered as a potential therapeutic target for zzso zzso
