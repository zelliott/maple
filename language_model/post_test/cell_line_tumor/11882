To study the induction of sensitivity to zzso zzso or zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso cell line transferred by an zzso virus zzso zzso expression zzso carrying the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso including killing and zzso effect, and also the gene delivery procedure and route of gene therapy in zzso for zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was transferred into zzso cells, and then different zzso of zzso or zzso were zzso The transferred cells were mixed with zzso zzso cells in different proportion and 200 zzso zzso was then added into each zzso After 72 hours, all samples were measured by zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso expression zzso carrying zzso zzso was zzso Three models of gene direct injection in the local liver, injection through the portal zzso and injection through the zzso zzso artery were established in closed zzso zzso For each model, two subgroups, injected either naked zzso DNA or zzso complex were zzso The expression of the zzso gene was regularly examined zzso 

zzso or zzso could apparently kill the transferred zzso cells at a concentration of zzso zzso The zzso rate was changed with different drug zzso The zzso effect was obviously induced at a transferred to zzso zzso cells ratio of zzso zzso gene expression was observed in liver cells of all animals on day 3, which reached peak within zzso days, and declined after day zzso zzso of naked zzso DNA through the zzso artery plus zzso obtained a best zzso 

zzso zzso is suitable for carrying suicide gene therapy for zzso zzso Gene direct delivery in zzso combined with zzso surgery can be used to treat zzso zzso
