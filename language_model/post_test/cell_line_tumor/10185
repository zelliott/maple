The zzso zzso human acute zzso zzso cell line zzso was used to generate immature zzso cells zzso zzso and their zzso as an alternative to primary zzso zzso DC zzso for testing zzso zzso was zzso zzso levels of the DC maturation markers zzso zzso zzso and zzso were studied using flow zzso after 24 and 48 h exposure to the model compound zzso zzso zzso and 300 zzso No maturation of zzso DC was observed, whereas significantly zzso expression levels of zzso and zzso were noticed in zzso after zzso treatment with 300 zzso zzso zzso compared to control zzso zzso expression of the zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was analyzed using real-time zzso after 6, 10 and zzso of zzso zzso zzso In response to 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso DC revealed slightly zzso zzso levels after zzso whereas 300 zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso and zzso significantly after 6 or zzso These zzso data zzso to the previously observed effects of 100 zzso zzso zzso in zzso Our findings underline the zzso capacity of zzso zzso in zzso DC with regard to zzso zzso zzso but not surface marker zzso Compared to zzso however, the studied zzso markers seemed to be less zzso making the zzso DC model in its presented form less suitable for in zzso testing of zzso Further assessment of zzso DC using other differentiation protocols and an extended set of chemicals will be required to reveal whether this cell line may be a valid alternative model system to primary zzso
