zzso is a zzso small zzso zzso known to zzso zzso zzso migration, proliferation and zzso zzso zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso interacts with the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso a potential key zzso in multiple myeloma zzso 

zzso levels in paired peripheral blood and bone zzso plasma samples from healthy volunteers zzso zzso and patients with zzso zzso of zzso significance zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined by zzso Further, the ability of zzso to inhibit zzso effects on zzso cell lines were zzso in zzso using cell viability and zzso migration zzso 

We found that zzso zzso were significantly higher zzso in bone zzso zzso plasma from zzso zzso zzso range, zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso range, zzso and patients with zzso zzso zzso range, zzso zzso levels were higher in zzso plasma than in peripheral blood in all groups, with a zzso ratio of zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso A positive correlation zzso zzso zzso was found between simultaneously measured levels of zzso and zzso in zzso plasma in zzso but not in zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso migration and viability of zzso and zzso zzso cell lines, independent of zzso zzso 

Our results show that zzso is zzso in zzso and zzso bone zzso plasma and that it zzso zzso viability and migration of myeloma cell lines in zzso
