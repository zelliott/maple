The zzso system has a crucial role in maintaining and regulating cellular zzso including zzso zzso also designated zzso is one of the zzso zzso zzso and it has been reported that zzso of zzso is highly expressed in human head and neck zzso cell zzso particularly zzso zzso However, the involvement of zzso in zzso has not been fully zzso Most cases of head and neck zzso are treated with zzso zzso zzso or zzso which are the most effective zzso agents against zzso cell zzso Nevertheless, some head and neck zzso develop resistance to these drugs, although the causes and mechanisms remain zzso In this study, we found high expression levels of zzso in human head and neck zzso cell lines and cancer zzso by using an zzso zzso at the protein zzso We also found that the expression level of zzso is decreased in cell lines and cancer zzso that have resistance to zzso or zzso and in cancer zzso treated with zzso or zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso of zzso affects cell proliferation and zzso cell zzso These findings suggest that zzso is a novel zzso that zzso tumor growth and is related to the resistance to zzso agents and that zzso likely functions as a novel diagnostic tool and a potentially therapeutic target for head and neck zzso cell zzso
