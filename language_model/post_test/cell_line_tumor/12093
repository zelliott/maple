The study of zzso zzso precursor protein zzso metabolism and zzso beta protein zzso production has been a major focus of Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso is a commonly employed method for assessing the effects of various genes on zzso processing and zzso zzso Certain cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that could potentially affect zzso processing and zzso zzso Thus, we set out to assess the effects of cell zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso processing and zzso level in zzso human zzso cells zzso human zzso We found both zzso and zzso increase the protein levels of zzso fragments zzso and zzso levels, while zzso increases the protein levels of zzso without altering zzso zzso In contrast, zzso cell zzso does not affect zzso processing and zzso production in our zzso These results suggest for the first time that zzso cell zzso zzso may zzso affect zzso processing and zzso production, thereby zzso studies aimed at assessing the effects of zzso genes on zzso zzso
