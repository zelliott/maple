Although it is possible to identify new proteins from crude cell extracts using zzso technology, it is often difficult to zzso zzso zzso in the presence of a large amount of zzso proteins in zzso We have developed a simple and rapid method using an affinity spin tube filter to remove zzso common proteins and enrich the zzso zzso The affinity spin tube filter contains protein G, coupled with zzso against either zzso proteins or specific proteins of zzso After zzso with serum, the zzso or the zzso was collected and analyzed by two-dimensional gel zzso By using this affinity spin tube zzso the possibilities of identifying new zzso are zzso This technique could be used for large-scale sample preparation for zzso zzso zzso
