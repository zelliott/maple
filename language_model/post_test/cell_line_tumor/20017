A loss of balance between cell zzso zzso and their zzso may zzso cancer invasion and zzso We zzso the roles of a zzso associated zzso zzso zzso zzso in oral zzso cell zzso zzso While zzso zzso was widely observed in cancer cells of human zzso zzso this was significantly reduced at the zzso invasion zzso In zzso zzso was detected in all eight zzso cell lines zzso in which its zzso membrane zzso zzso was also zzso zzso expression zzso zzso in zzso lines, zzso and zzso reduced the growth of both lines in zzso but significantly enhanced zzso zzso in zzso which was accompanied by zzso changes suggestive of the zzso zzso Both zzso lines also exhibited significantly enhanced migratory zzso and zzso but not truncated zzso was required to rescue this zzso Other zzso lines zzso zzso zzso also showed enhanced migration in response to zzso zzso The enhanced migration is partly attributed to zzso of zzso as simultaneous zzso zzso alleviated the migration of zzso zzso zzso zzso also altered the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso all of which are involved in zzso zzso While zzso was involved in the increased zzso expression associated with zzso zzso the zzso appeared to be not responsible for the altered expression of other zzso zzso a zzso mechanism for the zzso associated with zzso zzso is also zzso Together, these observations suggest that zzso has a crucial zzso role in zzso cell zzso
