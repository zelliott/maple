zzso is important in tumor initiation and cellular zzso Given the striking correlations between zzso activity and proliferation capacity in tumor cells, zzso had been considered as a potentially important molecular target in cancer zzso A series of zzso were designed and zzso They were evaluated for their effects on zzso activity, zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso In the series, compounds zzso 10, 13, 16, 18, 19, zzso and 24) showed potent zzso zzso activity, while compounds 19, 21, and 22 activated zzso expression in normal human zzso The results indicated that zzso represent an important class of compounds for zzso drug zzso zzso 8, 16, 18, 26, and 32 were also selected by the zzso for zzso Program and demonstrated high zzso activity against 60 human cancer cell zzso zzso relationships zzso study revealed that the test compounds with side chains two carbon zzso between zzso and zzso are important structural zzso for zzso zzso Although the exact mechanism of how this zzso group contributes to its activity is still zzso however, the zzso group in the extended arm of the zzso zzso might contribute to proper binding to the zzso within the grove of zzso zzso Our results indicated that the zzso zzso are potent zzso zzso that have the potential to be further developed into novel zzso zzso zzso
