zzso and zzso zzso are characterized by high-level zzso of zzso 12 regions including the zzso and zzso zzso These zzso are either zzso in zzso zzso zzso on zzso structures zzso or rod zzso or integrated into zzso arms in zzso zzso Our results reveal that zzso zzso are zzso and frequently lost by zzso This loss zzso with zzso of eliminated sequences and changes of their replication zzso Treatment of cells with zzso agents during early zzso significantly decreases the rate of zzso positive for zzso We also demonstrate that, in our model, zzso are generated during zzso as a consequence of zzso abnormalities zzso lagging and zzso zzso Finally, a dramatic increase of zzso differentiation was noted in cells that have eliminated copies of zzso gene in zzso These findings provide evidence that, in zzso zzso differentiation could be the consequence of zzso loss, an event occurring rarely in zzso tumors in which the amplified sequences are integrated into zzso zzso
