Novel zzso zzso were prepared, structurally characterized and evaluated for zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso and triple negative zzso and zzso breast cancer cell lines which exhibited superior zzso activity than parent zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that zzso groups on zzso and zzso side chain favor additional hydrogen bonding interactions with zzso acid zzso in zzso of zzso protein and these compounds inhibited zzso expression which may be responsible for the enhanced zzso zzso These compounds were found to be more effective against triple negative breast cancer cells and might serve as a starting point for building future strategies against triple negative breast zzso which are known for their increased drug resistance and poor prognosis of breast cancer zzso
