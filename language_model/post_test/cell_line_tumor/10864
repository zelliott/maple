zzso zzso extracted from the traditional Chinese herb zzso zzso zzso has been found to have zzso zzso In this study, the effects of zzso on the zzso of zzso mice were zzso Using flow zzso peripheral blood zzso were characterized based on the expression of surface markers for T helper cells zzso and T zzso cells zzso zzso levels of tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and transforming growth factor zzso zzso and a cell proliferation zzso were determined with an zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso on the zzso was determined by Western zzso Our results showed that zzso inhibited tumor growth and significantly increased the zzso weight compared with the zzso Also, zzso elevated serum levels of zzso and significantly reduced levels of zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso study and terminal zzso zzso end labeling zzso results showed that zzso protected zzso tissue against the onslaught of tumor growth by zzso zzso zzso zzso The cell proliferation zzso revealed that zzso might promote more zzso zzso towards zzso Furthermore, the ratio of zzso T zzso was significantly increased from zzso to zzso by treatment with zzso zzso analyses revealed that the expression of zzso and zzso on the zzso was lower in mice in the zzso treatment group than in the control zzso In conclusion, zzso can inhibit tumor growth and protect zzso zzso of the zzso and the mechanism is closely associated with reduced cell death in the zzso and a zzso zzso
