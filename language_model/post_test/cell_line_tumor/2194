zzso of nutrients triggers an exit from the cell division cycle, the induction of zzso and eventually the zzso of cell death zzso The zzso if any, among these events is not well zzso We found that starved mouse embryonic zzso lacking the essential zzso gene product zzso failed to undergo cell cycle zzso Independent of its zzso zzso activity, zzso could bind to the tumor zzso zzso to regulate the zzso of the gene zzso the cell cycle inhibitor zzso With prolonged zzso stress, the absence of zzso resulted in zzso DNA damage with increased zzso zzso zzso of the DNA damage response by deletion of the protein zzso zzso partially rescued zzso zzso in zzso zzso Thus, when nutrients are zzso zzso regulates zzso cell cycle and cell death zzso
