zzso changes in pediatric zzso may contribute to the aggressive zzso of this disease, but little is known about the basis for such zzso In this study, we examined a role for the DNA zzso zzso in particular, the truncated zzso zzso which is generated frequently in zzso To investigate if zzso zzso transcripts alter DNA zzso gene zzso and zzso character in zzso we measured zzso expression in primary zzso Higher levels of zzso were detected in differentiated zzso compared to zzso zzso suggesting that expression of zzso may induce a less aggressive clinical zzso To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of enforced zzso expression in zzso cells, finding a significant zzso of cell proliferation in zzso and zzso and tumor growth in zzso zzso cells had higher levels of total zzso zzso and a dramatic decrease in expression of the zzso and zzso family members that comprise zzso zzso zzso zzso with an established zzso relationship between zzso expression and zzso acid zzso activity, increased differentiation was seen in the zzso zzso cells following treatment with zzso zzso acid zzso compared to zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso the zzso in zzso cells to induce changes in gene zzso inhibit tumor growth, and increase sensitivity to zzso
