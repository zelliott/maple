zzso chemical programming of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been accomplished with zzso equipped zzso and zzso targeting zzso including a zzso zzso linked to either the zzso zzso or another zzso zzso unit and a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso to zzso We also prepared zzso targeting zzso containing either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of the chemically programmed zzso to zzso receptors zzso and zzso and to the zzso hormone releasing hormone zzso were zzso The zzso and zzso zzso and zzso the zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso chemically programmed zzso bound specifically to the isolated zzso zzso proteins as well as to zzso expressed on human melanoma zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso chemically programmed zzso bound specifically to the zzso receptors expressed on human zzso cancer zzso This approach provides an efficient, zzso and economically viable route to zzso therapeutic zzso that target defined combinations of specific zzso Additionally, this approach should be zzso to chemically programmed zzso
