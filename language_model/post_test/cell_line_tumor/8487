A new series of zzso hybrids zzso had been zzso zzso and evaluated as zzso zzso zzso zzso against Alzheimer's disease zzso In zzso studies showed that most of the molecules exhibited a significant ability to inhibit zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and molecular modeling studies also indicated compounds were zzso zzso binding simultaneously to active, peripheral and zzso sites of zzso zzso compound zzso was found to be highly potent and showed a balanced zzso profile against zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, it also showed excellent metal zzso property and low cell zzso These results suggested that zzso might be an excellent zzso agent for zzso zzso
