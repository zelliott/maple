zzso zzso is extremely aggressive and essentially zzso Its zzso is characterized by vigorous zzso zzso Recent evidence has shown that tumor cells display the ability to drive zzso zzso mimicry zzso an alternative zzso circulation independent of zzso cell zzso However, molecular mechanisms underlying this vascular zzso are poorly zzso Here, we found that vascular channels of zzso in zzso were composed of zzso tumor cells that strongly express zzso zzso 2 zzso To explore a potential role of zzso in the zzso we investigated two zzso cell lines zzso and zzso both of which express zzso and exhibit a vascular zzso on zzso Treatment of both cell lines with either zzso gene zzso or zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso activity and impaired vascular zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso activity suppressed zzso signaling zzso including focal zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso In contrast, blockade of zzso activity by the zzso zzso zzso failed to zzso the impact of zzso suggesting that zzso zzso is independent of zzso zzso of zzso mice with zzso cells and zzso gave rise to tumors harboring robust mural zzso vascular zzso zzso zzso restrained zzso in tumors and subsequently inhibited tumor zzso zzso all the data demonstrate a central role of zzso in the formation of zzso in zzso This study has shed light on molecular mechanisms zzso tumor aggressiveness and also provided a therapeutic target for patient zzso
