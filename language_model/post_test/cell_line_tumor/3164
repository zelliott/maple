zzso ingredients of an zzso carob extract are well characterized and consist of mainly zzso acid zzso In order to assess possible zzso mechanisms of zzso which can be used as a cacao substitute, effects on expression of genes related to stress response and drug metabolism were studied using human colon cell lines of different transformation state zzso and zzso zzso zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were induced by carob extract and zzso in zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso Although corresponding protein products and zzso activities were not zzso zzso with carob extract and zzso for 24 h reduced DNA damage in cells challenged with hydrogen zzso zzso In conclusion, carob extract and its major zzso ingredient zzso zzso gene expression and protect colon zzso cells from zzso impact of zzso zzso of zzso genes could not be related to functional zzso
