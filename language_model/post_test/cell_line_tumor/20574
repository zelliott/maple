The spread of cancer cells from a primary tumor to form zzso at distant sites is a complex process that remains poorly zzso Certain tumor cells are more aggressive and thus lead to rapid development of multiple distant zzso Here, we identify proteins associated with these aggressive zzso 

To identify proteins associated with cancer cell zzso we used zzso quantitative liquid zzso mass zzso zzso zzso analysis of a unique zzso model comprised of three zzso human breast cancer cell lines that are equally zzso in mice, but display different zzso zzso ranging from zzso zzso and zzso The altered expression of selected proteins was subsequently confirmed by zzso and zzso 

The difference in zzso capabilities was initially confirmed using live animal zzso zzso quantitative zzso identified zzso zzso out of which 44 exhibited altered expression between the zzso and zzso cell zzso The proteins zzso with the aggressiveness of zzso included zzso repeat containing 59 zzso while zzso and zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso exhibited an inverse correlation with zzso zzso The altered expression levels of these proteins were zzso confirmed, as well as demonstrated in zzso generated from these cell zzso This analysis further demonstrated that the three proteins were associated with the aggressiveness of zzso rather than zzso colonization per zzso 

Our study provides novel insights into key proteins associated with the zzso potential of breast cancer cells and identified zzso zzso and zzso as candidates that merit further zzso
