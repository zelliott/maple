zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso that is rapidly induced in response to cellular zzso and is an important cell survival zzso Previous studies have suggested that an increase in zzso zzso concentration zzso is required for increased zzso zzso but the zzso source of zzso regulating zzso zzso remains zzso zzso of zzso zzso stress zzso with zzso zzso increased zzso zzso and protein expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging revealed that zzso zzso entry played a prominent role in zzso induction by zzso Neither zzso nor release of zzso from the zzso was sufficient to activate zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso levels, however, triggered cell death with a much greater proportion of the cells undergoing necrosis rather than zzso A relative increase in the percentage of cells undergoing necrosis was observed in cells expressing a short hairpin zzso targeted to the zzso zzso zzso cell death evoked by zzso zzso overloading was associated with persistent zzso of the inner zzso membrane and a modest increase in zzso zzso but did not involve zzso zzso 3 or zzso 7 zzso The effects of zzso zzso overloading on zzso membrane potential were significantly reduced in cells expressing zzso compared with zzso zzso Our findings indicate that zzso zzso entry regulates zzso expression in zzso cells and suggest that zzso zzso signaling involves effects on maintaining zzso zzso
