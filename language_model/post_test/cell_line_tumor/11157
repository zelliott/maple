To investigate the effect of cell proliferation in human breast cancer cells zzso zzso which has zzso of zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso 435 cells were treated with different zzso zzso zzso 50, 100 and 200 zzso with a negative zzso 

Such as curve of cell growth, cellular zzso the clone zzso DNA zzso and western zzso for protein of zzso and zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso inhibited the cell zzso cellular zzso clone zzso and DNA synthesis and reduced expression of zzso protein in zzso 435 zzso The zzso frequency zzso showed a zzso responses as the zzso of zzso zzso Seven days after treatment with various zzso of zzso as mentioned above, the zzso rates were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Its zzso value was zzso zzso for zzso 435 zzso The IF from cellular zzso of zzso 435 cells treated by zzso were - zzso at 24 h and - zzso at 48 zzso from the clone zzso zzso - zzso at 24 h and zzso at 48 zzso from DNA zzso zzso at zzso and zzso at 48 zzso The further study was found that zzso inhibited the expression of zzso which to be related to cell cycle and reduced zzso zzso proteins expression and promoted the expression of zzso and zzso proteins related to zzso zzso in zzso 435 zzso 

zzso could inhibit zzso 435 cells proliferation by regulating zzso zzso It may be one of the effects of zzso in zzso
