zzso exposure to high level of zzso is a known risk factor for breast zzso In cells, zzso in particular zzso zzso and 17 zzso zzso can be converted to zzso zzso which may be oxidized to form zzso and zzso that are capable of binding to DNA to induce zzso followed by zzso Whether the body is equipped with protective mechanisms against potentially harmful zzso therefore, is an important zzso The present study was designed to examine the role of zzso in the metabolism of zzso zzso breast cancer cells and zzso zzso human zzso zzso cells were metabolically labeled with zzso in the presence of individual zzso Analysis of the labeling media showed the generation and release of exclusively zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso by cells labeled in the presence of zzso or zzso or zzso Whereas both zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected in the labeling media of cells labeled in the presence of zzso These results indicated a concerted action of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the metabolism of zzso zzso zzso revealed that, five zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso known human zzso tested could use zzso and zzso zzso as zzso with zzso displaying the strongest zzso zzso
