zzso is one of the most zzso cancer zzso known to date, zzso spontaneous immune responses in approximately 50% of patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso T cell responses were found in patients with zzso zzso serum zzso indicating an integrated type of immune response induced by zzso zzso A close association between spontaneous zzso immunity and the zzso zzso was suggested in a recent zzso To address these results, we assessed the zzso zzso and zzso status of 102 patients with zzso zzso However, no correlation between zzso and zzso immunity was zzso To explore the role of zzso zzso T cells in cancer zzso we established zzso restricted zzso zzso T cell clones by limiting dilution and repeated stimulation with zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso A subset of zzso T cell clones was zzso with naturally processed zzso presented by zzso zzso that were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso tumor cell lines, or zzso with zzso zzso viral zzso in zzso zzso Three different zzso T cell clones were used to mediate the specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso B cells zzso zzso with zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso functions of the zzso T cell clones described here provide an important rationale for the zzso of zzso zzso T cells along with zzso T cells in cancer vaccination zzso
