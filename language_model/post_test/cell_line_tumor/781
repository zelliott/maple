In human zzso expression of a novel member of the zzso zzso family was zzso Based on its zzso zzso we termed this protein human zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition to four major zzso the existence of multiple alternatively spliced products of zzso was detected using zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso was a zzso of mouse liver zzso zzso with close similarity in their zzso zzso zzso the longest zzso was expressed as a zzso native zzso It exhibited a limited activity toward zzso while no activity toward the steroids or zzso was zzso Using the laser capture zzso technique and zzso expression of zzso was detected in zzso germ cells as well as in zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso in the zzso obtained from zzso were much lower than those in normal zzso A significant decline in the zzso expression was observed when zzso a cell line originated from a human zzso germ cell zzso was exposed to zzso zzso zzso or zzso These results indicate that the expression of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso is possibly controlled by zzso and hormonal zzso
