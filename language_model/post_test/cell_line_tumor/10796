The zzso zzso zzso a type of zzso junction zzso plays a major role in zzso zzso zzso It remains unknown how the zzso is remodeled during zzso zzso Here we found that the zzso was converted to another type of zzso with zzso zzso zzso at the margins of zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso protein lost in zzso which functions to maintain the zzso via its association with zzso was lost in the zzso zzso a fusion of zzso and zzso contributed to the formation of zzso but not zzso We show that zzso tension was important for retaining zzso at zzso and another force derived from zzso fibers zzso attached to the zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso was required for general zzso formation, and it cooperated with zzso to maintain the zzso These findings suggest that zzso cells zzso their zzso architecture by responding to mechanical forces, and the zzso zzso acts as a zzso regulator for this zzso
