zzso precursor acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso is characterized by a high rate of tissue zzso The mechanism of zzso cell zzso is not fully zzso In the present study, we have investigated the major carrier of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cell line zzso and its possible role in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso ALL cell lines and clinical samples from patients with zzso essentially exhibited positive flow zzso zzso with zzso and the zzso was significantly diminished by zzso zzso treatment in zzso zzso zzso ALL cell lines zzso well to zzso but only very zzso to zzso with zzso cell zzso zzso Although zzso cell lines did not express the well-known core protein zzso zzso zzso zzso a major proportion of the zzso zzso zzso was carried by a zzso zzso in zzso zzso Most clinical samples from patients with zzso exhibited a zzso zzso zzso cells rolled well on zzso but zzso of zzso on zzso cells resulted in reduced rolling activity on zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso cells showed decreased tissue zzso compared with the control cells when introduced into zzso zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso but not zzso plays an important role in the zzso zzso of zzso cells and that the degree of tissue zzso of zzso ALL cells may be controlled by manipulating zzso zzso
