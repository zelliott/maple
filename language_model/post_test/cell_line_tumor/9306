The objective of this study was to investigate the fermented culture broth of zzso zzso zzso zzso to induce zzso and inhibit zzso zzso in zzso zzso human breast cancer zzso Treatment of the highly invasive zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in dose and zzso sequences of events marked by zzso as evidenced by loss of cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso DNA zzso zzso in the zzso cells was accompanied by release of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and specific zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso was associated with a reduction in zzso protein levels, negligible zzso increase was zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso treatment inhibited zzso protein expression and zzso zzso zzso production in zzso zzso Analysis of the study data suggests that zzso zzso exerts growth zzso on zzso zzso zzso human breast cancer cells through zzso induction associated with zzso zzso and that it may possess zzso properties potentially valuable for application in drug zzso
