The wild type zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in modulating not only stress responses by various environmental zzso but when zzso it also zzso the intrinsic tumor surveillance networks that are frequently found in a number of zzso including skin zzso As a result, using a pharmacological inhibitor of zzso has been suggested to be a novel zzso approach to recover the innate tumor surveillance in a variety of zzso 

We studied the effect of a pharmacological inhibitor of zzso in skin zzso under a zzso zzso stress zzso 

A human zzso cell line or human zzso zzso were exposed to zzso with or without the sole commercially available chemical inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso we determined the diverse stress responses, including zzso and the zzso of stress zzso 

We demonstrate that the zzso inhibitor unexpectedly attenuated the zzso zzso response in skin zzso as a consequence of attenuated zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso in both, skin zzso and a zzso cell zzso On the other hand, the loss of zzso zzso either by knockout or zzso in mice or human zzso respectively, promoted zzso and zzso zzso zzso following zzso zzso Of note, zzso treatment appeared to promote zzso in breast cancer cells and skin transformed zzso that zzso expressed zzso demonstrating that the effect of zzso differs based on the level of zzso zzso 

Thus, our studies suggest that the development of a more potent and specific zzso inhibitor is necessary to achieve the desired zzso potential and to avoid zzso zzso
