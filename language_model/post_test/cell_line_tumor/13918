In this study, we examined the expression and functions of related to zzso zzso and zzso protein 1 zzso in zzso zzso zzso was expressed in high levels in zzso whereas its expression in zzso zzso and normal brains was very zzso zzso of zzso cells with small interfering zzso targeting zzso decreased cell proliferation in all the cell lines examined and induced cell zzso in some of zzso zzso of zzso increased zzso and zzso cell proliferation and the zzso growth of the zzso In addition, zzso of zzso rendered zzso cells more resistant to the zzso effect of tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso and serum zzso To delineate the molecular mechanisms involved in the survival effects of zzso we examined the expression and zzso of various zzso zzso We found that zzso of zzso decreased the zzso of zzso and increased the expression of zzso and that the protective effect of zzso was partially zzso by zzso Finally, we found that zzso regulated the invasion of zzso cells as was evident by their enhanced migration through zzso and by their increased invasion in a zzso confrontation zzso The increased invasive potential of the zzso zzso was also shown by the increased activity of zzso zzso 2 in these zzso Our results suggest that the expression of zzso is correlated with the degree of zzso of zzso tumors and that zzso is involved in the regulation of the growth, survival, and invasion of zzso zzso zzso these findings suggest that zzso is a potential therapeutic target in zzso
