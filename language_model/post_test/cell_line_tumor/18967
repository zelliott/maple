In zzso zzso zzso zzso production is necessary for maintenance of zzso We examined the role of protein zzso A zzso in regulating zzso expression through the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso Although zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso or the addition of zzso had little ability to zzso zzso reporter zzso on their own, zzso with zzso led to a large increase in gene zzso Progressive zzso of reporter zzso indicated that the site of zzso responsiveness lay in a region of the promoter between zzso and zzso which lacks a zzso response element but contains the functional zzso site and an zzso protein 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso of the former reduced the zzso effects by more than zzso whereas zzso of an zzso site adjacent to the zzso site or pharmacological zzso of zzso zzso 2 led to a doubling of the combined zzso effects, suggesting there is antagonism between the zzso zzso and the zzso signal zzso zzso Although zzso is not a zzso for zzso lowering the effective zzso of the zzso zzso response zzso zzso protein zzso known zzso targets, reduced the ability of zzso to zzso with zzso suggesting that zzso effects on zzso regulation might be zzso through zzso zzso particularly as zzso and zzso occupy the zzso promoter region of zzso in bovine zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in the zzso bovine zzso is likely due to the zzso effects of zzso zzso and zzso and triggered via growth factors released from maternal zzso
