To explore zzso and possible mechanisms of zzso magnetic fields zzso in zzso zzso of zzso lung zzso 

Human zzso lung zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso and combined zzso zzso efficiency was zzso cell cycle and zzso were measured, and changes in cell zzso and zzso gene expression were measured by zzso 

A zzso zzso stationary zzso showed a zzso zzso effect lasting for zzso zzso The zzso groups had significantly greater cell zzso than did controls zzso zzso zzso Surviving zzso and growth zzso derived from zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso and zzso groups had inhibited cell zzso the zzso group showed a zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells exposed for 1 hour to zzso showed that 19 cell zzso and zzso genes had zzso zzso and 40 genes had zzso zzso zzso significantly arrested cells in zzso and M zzso apparently zzso the cells to zzso 

zzso may inhibit zzso cells and can increase their sensitivity to zzso possibly by affecting cell zzso and zzso signaling zzso
