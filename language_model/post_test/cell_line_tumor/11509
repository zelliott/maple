zzso the zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso following zzso cell attachment to an zzso zzso zzso zzso with cell attachment to zzso a population of zzso becomes associated with a peripheral zzso compartment that includes focal complexes and zzso zzso zzso of zzso both zzso its maturation to the zzso form and can promote cell zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso protein zzso promotes zzso recruitment to the peripheral spreading edge of cells, and that the zzso domain of zzso directly interacts with the zzso domain of zzso We show that the interaction is abolished by zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and by zzso zzso of the zzso The results provide insight into how zzso zzso may act to coordinate the suppression zzso zzso zzso while promoting cell zzso
