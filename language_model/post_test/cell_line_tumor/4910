We have previously shown that zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso plays an important role in gastric zzso In this study, we assessed DNA zzso status in the promoter region of zzso gene in gastric cancer cell lines, and indicated that this region was highly zzso compared with zzso gastric cancer cell zzso Moreover, the restoration of zzso expression by treating zzso cells with the DNA zzso inhibitor zzso strongly suggests that the loss of zzso expression may be due to the zzso zzso in the promoter region of the zzso zzso Thus, our results suggest that the zzso zzso of zzso through DNA zzso in gastric cancer may contribute to tumor zzso
