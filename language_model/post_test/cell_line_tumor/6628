zzso zzso zzso is the most important zzso donor used for synthesis of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and for zzso of many zzso zzso The zzso response of the lung to zzso stress of zzso requires increased zzso and protein synthesis for energy zzso growth arrest, and zzso zzso We studied the production of SAM and other aspects of zzso metabolism in lung zzso cells exposed to zzso Human lung zzso zzso and primary small airway zzso zzso cells were exposed to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso and zzso content increased in response to zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Because zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso of the pathway, we examined the expression of a lung zzso zzso of zzso 2A in zzso Western blots revealed a novel zzso 2A zzso expressed in both cell types, with a lower molecular mass than that described in zzso zzso Cloning and sequencing of the zzso 2A zzso revealed one silent zzso substitution compared to that expressed in zzso The lower mass of zzso 2A in both lung zzso cells indicated that the absence of the major zzso modification of zzso 2A found in zzso zzso 2A protein progressively increased during zzso exposure in both transformed and primary lung zzso Increased flux of zzso zzso to zzso zzso in zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso group was zzso and increased formation of zzso indicated that at least part of SAM generated was directed toward zzso in the zzso zzso These results indicate zzso of zzso 2A and the zzso zzso in the zzso response to zzso in lung zzso
