We zzso and tested three series of zzso for their activity in zzso the growth of three human tumor cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The first series of compounds consisted of 49 zzso zzso the most active species being a zzso zzso zzso having an zzso zzso of zzso zzso The second series of compounds consisted of nine zzso the most active species also being a zzso zzso having an zzso of zzso zzso The third series of compounds consisted of seven zzso or zzso the most active species again being a zzso zzso having an zzso of 500 zzso Taken together, these results are of interest because they show that zzso zzso can have potent activity against a variety of tumor cell lines, with the most active zzso and zzso species having zzso values approximately zzso lower than the most potent commercially available zzso
