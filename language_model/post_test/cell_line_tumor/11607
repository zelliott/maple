Alzheimer's disease zzso is characterized by zzso deposition in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso loss, and cognitive zzso zzso display zzso and zzso effects and affect memory zzso Here, we studied the impact of zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso on the development of zzso pathology by breeding zzso precursor protein zzso Swedish zzso mice zzso an zzso animal model, with zzso zzso In addition to the lower body weight of zzso mice, most of these mice died at an age before typical zzso changes become zzso The surviving mice showed a reduced amount of zzso and its fragments suggesting a regulatory influence of zzso on zzso processing, which was confirmed by modulating zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso levels were accompanied by a reduced plaque load and less inflammation in zzso zzso Nevertheless, compared to zzso mice with an intact zzso zzso mice showed impaired learning and memory zzso These data argue against a direct correlation of zzso plaque load with cognitive abilities in this zzso mouse model lacking zzso Furthermore, the findings indicate that zzso zzso can zzso zzso cognitive deficits and support a potential role of zzso as a zzso zzso
