zzso zzso is an orally administered zzso inhibitor for the treatment of pancreatic zzso but its oral zzso and zzso are zzso The main objective of this study was to develop optimal zzso zzso zzso prepared by zzso drug delivery system zzso Two zzso zzso of zzso prepared from a mixture of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso were formed as zzso under dilution with zzso zzso The resulting zzso were evaluated in zzso and in zzso including the zzso and zzso effects in zzso human zzso cancer zzso in nude zzso Following 1:10 zzso dilution of optimal zzso zzso the zzso sizes of resulting zzso were zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and the zzso potential values were zzso and zzso zzso In zzso cells, the growth zzso zzso of various zzso zzso was greatest with zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso solution zzso zzso and zzso suspension zzso zzso ( zzso It was indicated that the area under the plasma zzso curve zzso values of various zzso of zzso after oral administration ranked as the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso solution zzso zzso suspension zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso also produced significantly more tumor shrinkage ( zzso when compared to zzso suspension in nude mice bearing human zzso cancer zzso The results suggest that zzso is a promising drug delivery system to increase the oral zzso and zzso effects of zzso and may be applied to other zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a novel zzso therapy for cancer zzso
