We have previously shown that zzso of zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso To investigate another mechanism of zzso resistance, we investigated the expression of zzso cassette zzso in zzso lung cancer cell lines and found that the gene and protein expression of zzso zzso was higher in zzso cells than in the parental zzso The zzso resistant cells showed zzso to zzso zzso which is a zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was lower than in the parental zzso We then tested the effect of decreasing the expression of zzso by zzso and found that decreased expression of zzso enhanced zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso These findings suggested that zzso directly zzso resistance to zzso by enhancing zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Next, we analyzed the relationship between zzso gene expression and zzso sensitivity of 13 zzso cells, but there was no zzso The zzso gene has been shown to have a functional zzso zzso zzso zzso We then classified 13 lung zzso cell lines into three groups based on the zzso of this zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso group showed a significant reduction in the zzso of zzso compared with the combined zzso and zzso groups, indicating that the zzso zzso in the zzso gene is an important zzso of zzso zzso These results showed that zzso may be one of the zzso for zzso treatment in zzso
