zzso species zzso bacteria which cause a zzso disease, known as zzso by invading and destroying the zzso zzso and inducing a robust inflammatory zzso With no vaccine available, zzso annually kills over 600,000 children in developing zzso This study demonstrates the utility of combining zzso zzso methods with in zzso and in zzso zzso to provide new insights into zzso Comparisons of in zzso and in zzso gene expression identified genes associated with zzso zzso Additional zzso analyses identified genes that are present in zzso zzso zzso but not in the three other zzso zzso zzso of these two analyses revealed nine genes that are zzso expressed during invasion and that are specific to zzso zzso One zzso a zzso family zzso regulator with decreased expression during invasion, was further characterized and is now designated zzso for zzso growth zzso zzso of zzso caused no difference in growth in zzso but resulted in increased zzso replication in zzso zzso Further in zzso and in zzso studies using zzso sequencing of zzso transcripts zzso of an zzso zzso zzso identified 34 genes that were zzso under both growth zzso This combined zzso and functional approach has allowed the characterization of a gene and zzso previously unknown in zzso zzso and provides a framework for further identification of novel zzso factors and regulatory zzso
