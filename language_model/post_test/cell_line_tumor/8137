zzso growth factor zzso 3 zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso whose function has been implicated in diverse biological zzso including cell zzso zzso survival, and zzso zzso of zzso signaling has been implicated with human zzso including zzso zzso zzso in zzso gene are frequently detected in zzso cancer, multiple zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso while the zzso of the zzso is observed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The main aim of this study was to generate zzso clones producing zzso that could specifically recognize zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso To achieve this, we used for zzso zzso expressed zzso of zzso corresponding to zzso zzso of the zzso domain zzso which possesses zzso zzso at zzso detected in at least 50% of zzso zzso zzso zzso screening allowed us to isolate several zzso clones that showed specificity towards zzso but not zzso zzso Unfortunately, these clones were not stable during zzso cloning and expansion and lost the ability to recognize specifically zzso However, this study allowed us to generate several zzso zzso specific towards both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Produced zzso zzso zzso that were specific in Western zzso towards zzso expressed zzso and zzso as well as the full-length receptors zzso expressed in zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso expressed zzso and zzso forms of zzso were efficiently zzso with selected zzso from the zzso of infected zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso generated zzso should be useful as tools for examining the expression pattern and biological functions of zzso in normal and pathological cells and zzso
