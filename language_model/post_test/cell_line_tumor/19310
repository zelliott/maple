To study expression of the zinc finger zzso factor Snail in zzso zzso and its zzso 

Expressions of Snail in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were zzso by zzso and zzso zzso The zzso specimens from 68 cases of zzso zzso and its corresponding adjacent zzso 33 cases of zzso and 35 cases of zzso zzso zzso were also examined for Snail expressions using zzso 

Snail protein was located mainly in the cell nucleus of zzso and zzso zzso The expressions of zzso protein in the specimens of zzso zzso normal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were significantly different zzso zzso In the zzso zzso the expression was significantly higher than that in normal zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso had significantly higher expressions than the primary zzso zzso zzso zzso which, in turn, showed significantly higher expression than the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlation of Snail expression was found to the progression and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The expression of Snail is significantly correlated to zzso progression and zzso of zzso zzso
