zzso zzso zzso of the zzso precursor protein zzso represents the initial step in the formation of the Alzheimer's disease associated zzso zzso zzso zzso evidence indicates that zzso processing by zzso is dependent on zzso sorting of this zzso Nonetheless, knowledge of the zzso trafficking zzso of zzso zzso remains in zzso Here we show that cell surface zzso is rapidly zzso by the zzso dependent zzso in zzso cells and zzso to early zzso and zzso zzso recycling zzso with very little transported to the zzso as has been previously zzso Moreover, zzso is predominantly zzso to the early and recycling zzso compartments in different cell types, including zzso zzso In contrast, the majority of zzso zzso zzso zzso to late zzso To explore the relevance of the itinerary of zzso on zzso processing, we generated a zzso zzso containing the zzso tail of zzso zzso which cycles between the cell surface and zzso in an zzso zzso zzso zzso is less efficient in zzso production than the zzso zzso highlighting the relevance of the itinerary of zzso on zzso zzso zzso the data suggests that zzso zzso and zzso diverge at early zzso and that zzso zzso is regulated in part by the recycling itinerary of zzso
