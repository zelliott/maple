zzso cells migrate on zzso zzso zzso by repeated spreading and contraction of the cell zzso zzso zzso zzso play a major role in the adherence of cells to the zzso and in the generation of the cellular forces that maintain zzso and allow cells to zzso zzso also mediate zzso zzso signals in conjunction with growth factor receptors and signaling zzso Although the mechanisms that regulate cell migration are not yet fully zzso the regulation of the formation and turnover of zzso is a key factor determining the rate and direction of cell zzso We recently identified a component of zzso termed zzso which is a member of a family of proteins characterized by the presence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso of zzso at zzso ( zzso upon zzso extension to zzso and thereby regulates the zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso To obtain further insight into the regulation of cell zzso by zzso we analyzed proteins zzso with zzso by zzso zzso We identified 45 proteins including zzso proteins and multiple zzso binding proteins that have been shown recently to be components of the spreading initiation center zzso zzso are cell adherent structures that can be observed only in the early stages of cell spreading and have been implicated in regulating the rate of cell zzso In this article, we report new zzso proteins identified by zzso analysis and discuss the potential functions of zzso in regulating zzso of zzso
