zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso replicate efficiently in zzso zzso cells but are restricted in other cell zzso We previously showed that the restrictive zzso is dominant in a transient cell fusion zzso suggesting that zzso cells lack an zzso mechanism present in other zzso Recent data indicate that unscheduled membrane fusion events can activate the expression of zzso genes zzso in zzso raising the possibility that our earlier results were due to a zzso zzso zzso However, we show here that the zzso zzso is also extinguished following fusion with zzso cells in the absence of zzso zzso
