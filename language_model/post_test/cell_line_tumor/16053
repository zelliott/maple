A series of zzso zzso and Z zzso related to zzso were investigated for their effects on zzso induction in zzso zzso cells and growth zzso effects on human cancer cell zzso Both activities were enhanced in compounds with zzso groups on rings A and B of zzso but zzso of the zzso zzso zzso groups on ring A of zzso was found to be more critical for improving zzso zzso different zzso trends were observed, namely the association of E zzso with potent zzso induction activity and Z zzso with growth zzso zzso The introduction of zzso groups on ring A greatly benefited zzso induction activity while zzso zzso groups on ring A were preferred for potent growth zzso zzso These results serve to highlight the contrasting effects on different activities brought about by zzso which is widely employed as a structural modification approach to improve potency and zzso of zzso It serves as a timely reminder that in the course of structural zzso a balance between zzso desired outcomes against unwanted effects is necessary and the most potent analog need not always be the most zzso
