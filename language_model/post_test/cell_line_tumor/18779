We zzso that zzso zzso gene expression and its regulation by zzso can characterize zzso types of primary human zzso zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, zzso cancer cell lines and 54 zzso cancer tissue samples were analyzed for expression and zzso of zzso zzso gene using zzso specific zzso The results of our experiments demonstrate that zzso zzso gene was zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cell line, which was derived from clear cell zzso Treatment of this cell line with zzso agent zzso restored the expression of zzso zzso zzso In human zzso cancer zzso the expression of zzso zzso protein was zzso in most of the zzso clear cell zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso protein expression was positive in significantly higher percentages of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso clear cell zzso samples with zzso zzso zzso protein were highly zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso zzso gene is through DNA zzso Using direct DNA sequencing, zzso zzso gene zzso on all the 17 zzso sites was significantly higher in zzso clear cell zzso as compared to other zzso types of zzso cancer zzso zzso and zzso This is the first report suggesting that zzso zzso gene expression and zzso status can characterize zzso features of different types of zzso zzso
