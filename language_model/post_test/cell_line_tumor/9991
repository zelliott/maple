zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso factor, is important in DNA repair and zzso zzso may be associated with zzso In this study, we first investigated zzso expression and its correlation with zzso resistance and prognosis in zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso Then, we investigated the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying human zzso zzso zzso zzso on the sensitivity of zzso in zzso human lung zzso zzso 

zzso specimens from 103 patients with zzso zzso were obtained from 1999 to zzso Among these patients, 72 patients have been treated with at least three cycles of zzso zzso zzso protein expression was examined by zzso and Western zzso on the tumor samples and a cultured zzso cell line, zzso Cell survival and zzso were determined by zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso tumors showed high zzso expression levels, while zzso zzso zzso tumors showed high zzso expression levels ( zzso zzso analysis indicated that overall survival and zzso survival were significantly better in zzso patients with low vs those with high zzso expression levels ( zzso Treatment with zzso resulted in a zzso increase in zzso protein expression in zzso cells, and zzso zzso effectively inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly enhanced sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso associated with increased cell zzso 

Our results indicate that zzso is a new promising target for the combination of zzso chemotherapy in zzso zzso
