zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in human tumor cells through its zzso death receptors zzso or zzso thereby being investigated as a potential agent for cancer zzso Here, we applied fully human zzso TRAIL zzso zzso zzso zzso to specifically target one of death receptors for TRAIL in human zzso cells, which could also reduce potential zzso toxicity in zzso Twelve human zzso cell lines treated with several fully human zzso TRAIL zzso zzso were sensitive to only zzso zzso whereas they were totally insensitive to zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso exerted rapid zzso and lead to zzso zzso The cellular sensitivity was closely associated with zzso expression of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso D1 significantly correlated with sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso cultures of zzso cells were also relatively resistant to zzso zzso exhibiting both lower zzso and higher zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression resulted in the zzso of human zzso cells to zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso Treatment of zzso nude mice with the direct zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly suppressed growth of subcutaneous zzso zzso leading to complete zzso Similarly, treatment of nude mice bearing zzso zzso zzso with zzso significantly zzso lifespan without tumor zzso These results suggest that zzso is the zzso TRAIL zzso zzso zzso signals in human zzso cells, and sensitivity to zzso zzso was determined at least in part by the expression level of zzso and zzso zzso targeting of death zzso zzso through zzso using fully human zzso might provide a novel therapeutic strategy for intractable zzso zzso
