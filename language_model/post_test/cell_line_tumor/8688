zzso zzso in zzso zzso 1 zzso are frequent in low grade and progressive zzso and are characterized by the production of zzso zzso from zzso by the zzso zzso zzso is an zzso that competitively zzso zzso dependent zzso resulting in various widespread cellular changes including abnormal zzso of zzso DNA and suppression of cellular zzso Despite the growing understanding of zzso zzso zzso the development of effective therapies has proved challenging in part due to the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Here we report the generation of an zzso zzso zzso zzso model which rapidly grows in zzso produces zzso and exhibits DNA zzso Using this model, we have demonstrated the zzso efficacy and mechanism of action of the zzso approved zzso drug zzso in zzso Long term administration of zzso resulted in reduction of DNA zzso of promoter zzso induction of zzso zzso reduction of cell proliferation and a significant reduction in tumor zzso zzso zzso was observed at 14 weeks and subsequently showed no signs of zzso at 7 weeks despite zzso of zzso These results have implications for clinical trials of zzso agents for patients with zzso zzso zzso
