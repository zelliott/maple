Once a protein adopts the zzso zzso zzso a seeding reaction becomes operative in which zzso zzso function as seeds for soluble protein molecules to be zzso Such a seeding reaction zzso the protein zzso in zzso however, more investigation is required to test the seeded zzso inside zzso Here, we show that in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso into cells and function as seeds to trigger the zzso of zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso will thus play roles in a molecular zzso of zzso zzso lateral zzso
