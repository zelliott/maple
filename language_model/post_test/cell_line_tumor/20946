zzso and zzso have been shown to function as key regulators in response to DNA zzso However, their roles in zzso regulation haven't been zzso In this study, we demonstrated the novel functions of these two molecules in regulating zzso zzso and zzso We found that zzso and zzso were integral components of the zzso that zzso with zzso zzso of either protein led to zzso zzso However, the mechanisms that allow them to maintain zzso integrity are zzso zzso cells exhibited zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso depletion led to zzso zzso and/or lagging zzso with defective zzso checkpoint zzso that resulted in defective zzso and zzso We further illustrated that both zzso and zzso were negative regulators of Aurora A and zzso two zzso zzso involved in zzso maturation and zzso zzso Moreover, the levels of zzso and zzso zzso correlated with zzso amplification, defective zzso and cancer zzso in human breast zzso Together, zzso and zzso may function as zzso zzso at least in part by orchestrating proper zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
