zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso are zzso in a variety of zzso and have therefore been identified as ideal candidates for zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is associated with a good prognosis in cancer zzso However, generation of an efficient zzso immune response has been hampered by the low zzso of carbohydrates due to zzso Here, we describe a method by which zzso zzso directed against carbohydrates can be zzso in two different melanoma mouse zzso Thus, using the zzso melanoma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we have generated zzso against cancer zzso zzso expressed by the zzso zzso passive transfer of zzso resulted in rejection of melanoma in zzso Their protective effect in zzso was dependent on zzso and in zzso zzso cellular zzso They were also able to delay zzso growth when injected after the zzso was zzso zzso zzso as an zzso are a novel way to generate zzso zzso able to reject zzso in zzso
