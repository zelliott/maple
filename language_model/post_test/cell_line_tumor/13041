zzso is a common compound in several foods, plants and zzso Numerous studies have demonstrated its zzso zzso and zzso zzso however, the exact mechanism has not been fully zzso zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso is a zzso factor regulating the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we examined the ability of zzso to induce zzso signal zzso in human and rat zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso significantly induced zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso Similarly, zzso significantly induced zzso at protein and activity levels in a zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso inhibited the increase in zzso activity by zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso D, completely abolished the zzso zzso induction by zzso indicating a zzso zzso The role of zzso in zzso induction by zzso was confirmed by using zzso specific for human zzso The ability of zzso to induce zzso was strongly correlated with its ability to stimulate zzso zzso activity and zzso mobility shift zzso At zzso and zzso levels, zzso did not affect the stability of zzso at the zzso and the protein levels, excluding other mechanisms participating in the obtained zzso We concluded that zzso can directly induce zzso gene expression in an zzso manner and may represent a novel mechanism by which zzso promotes zzso zzso and zzso
