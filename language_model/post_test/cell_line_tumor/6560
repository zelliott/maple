zzso was identified previously as both a protein zzso that binds to zzso DNA repeats and as a protein zzso that associates with the zzso zzso and suppresses its zzso inducing zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso length and also plays a critical role in cell cycle checkpoint zzso zzso is zzso in many human zzso and may be zzso by the zzso pathway, but components of the zzso involved in zzso turnover have not been zzso By using the zzso system, we recently identified zzso zzso zzso and we demonstrated that zzso is a zzso zzso inhibitor and a putative tumor zzso Here we report the characterization of zzso zzso was later found to be identical to zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso which function as zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with both zzso and zzso zzso and promotes their zzso in zzso and in zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso reduces zzso zzso protein levels and causes progressive zzso zzso in human zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso by zzso interference zzso zzso and promotes zzso zzso thereby zzso cell zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is a central regulator of zzso protein abundance and that zzso in the stability of zzso can have a dramatic impact on zzso zzso Thus, zzso may play a critical role in zzso zzso
