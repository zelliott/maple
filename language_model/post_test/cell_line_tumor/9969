The zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is currently recognized as a plausible zzso drug zzso Here we analyzed the effects of zzso targeting in the human zzso lung zzso cell line, having a very high zzso zzso zzso We determined the total cellular zzso activity to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso of total zzso which by far exceeded the total zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso of total zzso zzso down zzso by zzso zzso using zzso gave only a slight effect on cell growth, irrespective of concurrent zzso depletion zzso or zzso zzso zzso and no increase in cell death or distorted cell cycle phase zzso This apparent lack of zzso could probably be explained by zzso functions being maintained by the remaining zzso zzso zzso zzso nonetheless yielded zzso zzso of zzso efficacy in response to various zzso zzso No changes in response upon exposure to zzso or zzso were seen after zzso zzso whereas sensitivity to zzso or zzso became markedly zzso In contrast, a virtually complete resistance to zzso using zzso up to 20 zzso appeared upon zzso zzso The results suggest that high zzso of zzso has an impact not necessarily linked to zzso function that nonetheless zzso zzso zzso zzso
