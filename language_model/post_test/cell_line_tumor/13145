Currently, zzso melanoma is zzso and there is no routine zzso chemotherapy for zzso We investigated whether zzso zzso factor zzso and its triple zzso zzso could more efficiently suppress melanoma tumor growth and zzso as well as how the triple zzso zzso act as zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso were constructed by site zzso zzso carrying wild type zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were produced in zzso zzso highly zzso zzso cells and used to zzso human zzso melanoma cell line zzso The growth, migration, invasion and zzso abilities of zzso cells expressing zzso zzso or zzso were investigated in zzso and in zzso while the underlying mechanism of zzso zzso zzso were investigated via Western zzso 

zzso cells infected with zzso carrying zzso zzso and zzso displayed reduced zzso migration and invasion abilities, and were more prone to zzso Cell media containing zzso zzso or zzso protein inhibited the tube forming capacity of human zzso vein zzso cells zzso in zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso or zzso displayed significantly reduced tumor growth and zzso in the melanoma zzso of nude mice models, with the zzso zzso displaying much stronger effects than the wild zzso The zzso effects of zzso are associated with the zzso of zzso and nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso as well as further zzso of zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso of zzso showed enhanced zzso activity by directly affecting tumor cells and indirectly affecting zzso These findings encourage the development of zzso zzso as innovative zzso zzso
