zzso is a mode of cell death that plays an important role in both pathological and zzso zzso Research during the last decade has delineated the entire machinery needed for cell death, and its constituents were found to zzso in zzso The zzso cascade is triggered when cells are exposed to an zzso zzso It has been known for several years that zzso of protein synthesis can zzso zzso that is induced by zzso and other zzso Until 1996, it was not understood why protein synthesis zzso zzso zzso Then three reports appeared that suggested the role of the zzso factor zzso zzso in protecting the cells from zzso zzso Since then several proteins have been identified that are regulated by zzso and are involved in cell survival, zzso and protection from zzso It now seems that when a cell is attacked by an zzso zzso the cell responds first by zzso zzso mechanisms, which may or may not be followed by zzso Whether or not a cell zzso zzso the survival, or zzso appears to involve a balance between the two zzso zzso of protein synthesis seem to suppress the appearance of protein that are involved in zzso The present review discusses how zzso controls zzso
