To study how the choices of the quick vs slow protein transfer, the zzso zzso and the zzso methods influence the performance of Western zzso 

The cellular proteins were zzso from human breast cell line zzso for analysis with Western zzso using quick (2 zzso and slow zzso protein transfer, different zzso zzso zzso zzso and nylon zzso and different zzso methods zzso and zzso 

In Western zzso with slow and quick protein transfer, the zzso marker presented more distinct bands on zzso membrane than on the nylon and zzso zzso and the latter also showed clear bands on the back of the membrane to very likely cause confusion, which did not occur with zzso zzso zzso membrane allowed slightly clearer zzso of the proteins with zzso method as compared with zzso and nylon zzso and on the latter two zzso quick protein transfer was likely to result in somehow irregular bands in comparison with slow protein zzso With slow protein transfer and zzso for zzso all the 3 zzso showed clear background, while with quick protein transfer, nylon membrane gave rise to obvious background noise but the other two zzso did zzso 

Different zzso should be selected for zzso according to the actual needs of the zzso Slow transfer of the proteins onto the zzso often has better effect than quick transfer, and enhanced zzso is superior to zzso for protein zzso and allows highly specific and sensitive analysis of the protein zzso
