zzso zzso zzso zzso the repair of DNA strand zzso zzso zzso increases the zzso of zzso chemotherapy and radiation therapy in zzso Because classical zzso zzso have limited clinical utility, we investigated whether zzso a novel potent zzso inhibitor zzso constant zzso zzso enhances the effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy in human cancer cell cultures and zzso 

The effect of zzso on the zzso activity of the DNA zzso agent zzso zzso I poisons zzso or zzso or zzso or zzso was investigated in human cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso by proliferation and survival zzso and in zzso in mice by tumor volume zzso The specificity of zzso for zzso was investigated by zzso analysis and by zzso and acute toxicity zzso in zzso and zzso cells and zzso After zzso administration, the concentration of zzso was determined in mouse plasma and zzso and its effect on zzso activity was determined in tumor zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

zzso at zzso zzso M did not affect cancer cell gene expression or growth, but it did increase the zzso activity of zzso zzso in zzso cells by zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso and inhibited recovery from potentially lethal zzso damage in zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso In zzso nontoxic doses of zzso increased the delay of zzso zzso growth induced by zzso zzso or zzso by two- to zzso The combination of zzso and zzso caused complete zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was retained in zzso in which zzso activity was inhibited by more than zzso for at least 4 zzso 

zzso is, to our knowledge, the first zzso zzso inhibitor with the specificity and in zzso activity to enhance chemotherapy and radiation therapy of human zzso
