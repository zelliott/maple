Head and neck cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the world and most of them are zzso cell zzso High frequency of zzso resistance in head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso leads to tumor zzso and zzso to zzso zzso However, the mechanisms underlying zzso resistance is still largely zzso In this study, we found that zzso was zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso Based on the result, zzso expression was zzso in the zzso cell line and we observed that the sensitivity to zzso increased, as showed in the results of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Meanwhile, zzso of zzso expression zzso promoted the occurrence of zzso resistance in the zzso cell zzso zzso blocking of zzso with zzso zzso would significantly prevent the occurrence of zzso resistance induced by zzso zzso In conclusion, our study finds that zzso is also involved in zzso zzso resistance in zzso and zzso serves as a possible candidate that collaborates with zzso in this zzso
