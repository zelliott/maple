zzso vaccine strains of zzso zzso contain major zzso zzso in the internal zzso entry site zzso an area that directs viral protein zzso To examine the effect of reduced viral protein synthesis on zzso zzso zzso zzso consisting of short open reading frames of different zzso were introduced between the zzso and the initiation zzso of viral zzso resulting in zzso zzso with reduced viral protein zzso These zzso zzso had a viral protein synthesis activity zzso % of that of the parental zzso strain as measured in zzso zzso zzso Only viruses with more than 28 % of the zzso activity had intact zzso sequences following plaque zzso zzso with 17 % or 21 % of the zzso activity were unstable and a zzso with zzso % was zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was evaluated in transgenic mice carrying the human zzso zzso zzso In this test, zzso with more than 28 % of the zzso activity remained zzso while a zzso with 17 % of zzso activity exhibited a partially attenuated zzso This zzso zzso zzso in the spinal zzso however, the stability was severely affected during the course of virus infection from the zzso to the spinal zzso These results suggest that reduced viral protein synthesis activity as measured in cultured cells zzso % of the zzso zzso is not the main zzso of zzso zzso
