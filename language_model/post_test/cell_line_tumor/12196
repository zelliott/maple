zzso zzso zzso is a highly effective agent in the treatment of acute zzso leukemia zzso whereas other zzso tumors are less responsive to this agent and mechanisms underlying zzso are poorly zzso To better understand the complex network of zzso pathways in zzso sensitivity, we investigated the role of zzso and zzso zzso in an zzso cell line sensitive to zzso zzso and in a resistant zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso and zzso were investigated in zzso cells before and after treatment with 1 zzso zzso and in zzso zzso In these experimental cell models, zzso zzso and zzso proteins were analyzed by zzso and a zzso zzso for zzso was zzso zzso levels as well as the activities of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso cells treated with zzso showed a high level of zzso stress and an increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso after 24 h and were followed by an increase of the zzso rate starting at 72 zzso Neither zzso zzso nor zzso zzso was found in zzso cells that showed a very low zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso sensitivity to zzso might be, at least in part, zzso by the balance between association and zzso of zzso from zzso depending on the zzso status of the zzso Further investigation is warranted to find a way to interfere with this balance, whenever it might represent a mechanism of drug zzso
