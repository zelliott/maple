Cancer zzso therapy zzso requires zzso that efficiently and selectively destroy tumor zzso We investigated zzso zzso zzso as a potential cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso was localized in the zzso whereas zzso acid zzso zzso IX zzso was localized zzso in the zzso of human leukemia zzso zzso In zzso cells under UVA zzso zzso effectively induced zzso Moreover, zzso an zzso product of zzso was accumulated in the DNA of cells treated with zzso zzso whereas only small amounts were observed in zzso cells in the presence of UVA zzso zzso and UVA caused extensive damage at every zzso zzso in DNA fragments obtained from the human zzso tumor zzso gene and the zzso zzso whereas zzso induced little DNA damage under these zzso zzso spin resonance zzso using a zzso oxygen zzso probe and zzso showed that zzso zzso generated zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso with oxygen to generate zzso which in turn, zzso zzso zzso Taken together, the results demonstrated that zzso was localized in the nucleus where it was zzso to induce DNA damage, suggesting that zzso may have clinical utility as a zzso zzso
