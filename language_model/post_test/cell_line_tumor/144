The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of zzso zzso distribution on tumor cell death after zzso therapy zzso 

The zzso accumulates in tumor tissue during zzso and generates zzso zzso oxygen species zzso resulting in tumor cell zzso 

This study was carried out to zzso the effects of zzso in a zzso oral cancer cell line using zzso with zzso at zzso zzso and 5 zzso After zzso the zzso reduction method, zzso gel zzso flow zzso and zzso zzso were zzso The zzso zzso level was measured by zzso zzso zzso was monitored with a zzso zzso and Western zzso and zzso activity zzso were zzso 

In our study, cell survival was reduced by about 50% after 3 h of zzso incubation zzso In DNA zzso flow zzso and zzso zzso necrosis was identified within 12 h and zzso soon zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso was localized in the cell zzso zzso and nucleus as time zzso The quantities of zzso zzso correlated with the time of zzso zzso Additionally, Western zzso analysis of zzso the release of zzso C, and activity of zzso and zzso showed that zzso followed the zzso zzso 

zzso with zzso in the zzso cell line showed zzso changes of cell necrosis and zzso which were associated with the time of distribution and zzso of zzso Also, the zzso evoked followed the zzso zzso
