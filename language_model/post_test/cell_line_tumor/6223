The gene zzso the zzso zzso is a zzso target of the zzso tumor zzso protein and subject to zzso zzso in zzso cancer and numerous other tumor zzso Here, we combined zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses to identify zzso changes in protein and zzso zzso zzso allowed to zzso the de zzso protein synthesis of zzso proteins after zzso of a conditional zzso zzso in a zzso cancer cell zzso zzso of the detected proteins were zzso zzso with 113 proteins being zzso and 115 zzso The proteins with a zzso zzso in the zzso region zzso of the corresponding zzso showed a clear bias toward zzso zzso zzso involved in DNA zzso zzso the zzso zzso and cell zzso were zzso among indirectly zzso proteins lacking a zzso zzso The decrease in de zzso protein synthesis of direct zzso targets correlated with reduced levels of the corresponding zzso in most cases, indicating an zzso of both types of zzso In addition, 43 zzso zzso proteins not detected by zzso were zzso after zzso expression and contained zzso zzso The direct regulation of selected zzso zzso was confirmed using reporter zzso Via zzso of the proteins zzso by these zzso zzso presumably zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso metabolism zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso may activate zzso by zzso its zzso zzso zzso and degradation zzso In zzso zzso presumably zzso in multiple tumor zzso pathways by directly and indirectly suppressing the expression of numerous, critical zzso
