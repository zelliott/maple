zzso is the major component of the spice zzso extracted from the zzso of the plant zzso zzso It exerts a number of therapeutic effects, including the zzso of cancer cell zzso However, the zzso mechanism of zzso has not been fully zzso zzso breast cancer zzso which lacks expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso is an aggressive breast cancer zzso with a poor zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso on zzso breast cancer cells and the possible molecular zzso The zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso the growth zzso ratio of the cells was measured by zzso zzso zzso was detected by flow zzso and the expression levels of zzso regulated protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected by western zzso After treatment with different zzso of zzso the growth zzso rates of the zzso breast cancer cells of the 30 zzso zzso group were significantly different from those of the other zzso The level of zzso of the zzso group zzso was significantly different from that of the control group zzso The expression levels of zzso and zzso in the zzso group were significantly decreased compared with those of the control zzso These results indicate that zzso is able to inhibit the proliferation of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso is the likely underlying molecular zzso
