In zzso breast cancer models, the two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso impair tumor growth and zzso formation through recruitment of natural killer zzso cells and zzso T zzso In human breast cancer, zzso zzso zzso zzso with the number of tumor zzso zzso and predicts response to different zzso zzso Raising the zzso zzso zzso concentration is therefore a possible way to enhance immune intervention in breast zzso Little is known, however, about expression levels and regulation of these zzso in human breast zzso Since the zzso of zzso zzso has been shown to reduce tumor growth and zzso of zzso in a zzso and zzso dependent manner, we argued that zzso zzso are a zzso target to increase zzso zzso zzso concentration in human breast zzso 

zzso was zzso in breast cancer specimens by zzso expression levels of zzso and zzso were determined by zzso and western zzso zzso For regulation studies, Michigan Cancer zzso zzso and zzso Anderson - zzso Breast 231 zzso zzso breast cancer cells were zzso with zzso with or without zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso release from cells was measured by zzso 

Within the tumor zzso cancer cells are the major source of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso release from zzso and zzso 231 cells, and zzso of zzso zzso by zzso or zzso zzso increases this zzso Otherwise, high zzso of the zzso zzso specific zzso zzso have opposite effects and impair zzso and zzso zzso In human breast cancer tissue specimens there is an inverse correlation between zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that the observed in zzso effects are of importance in zzso as zzso 

zzso zzso zzso synthesis by zzso zzso increases zzso and zzso release from breast cancer cells and is therefore a zzso candidate to enhance zzso immune zzso Yet, to this end the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso seem preferable to zzso that at higher zzso reduces zzso zzso release most probably due to zzso independent zzso
