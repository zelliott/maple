zzso of zzso extracted from zzso zzso bacteria are shown to be highly efficient for cancer therapy when they are exposed to an alternative magnetic zzso When a suspension containing zzso breast cancer cells was incubated in the presence of various amounts of extracted chains of zzso the viability of these cells remained high in the absence of an alternative magnetic zzso By contrast, when this suspension was exposed to an alternative magnetic field of frequency 183 zzso and field strengths of 20, 40, or 60 zzso up to zzso of these cells were zzso The zzso activity of the extracted chains of zzso is demonstrated further by showing that they can be used to fully eradicate a tumor zzso under the skin of a zzso For that, a suspension containing zzso zzso of extracted chains of zzso was administered within the tumor and the mouse was exposed to three heat cycles of 20 zzso during which the tumor temperature was raised to zzso zzso We also demonstrate the higher efficiency of the extracted chains of zzso compared with various other materials, zzso whole inactive zzso bacteria, individual zzso not organized in zzso and two different types of chemically zzso zzso iron oxide zzso currently tested for alternative magnetic field cancer zzso The higher efficiency of the extracted chains of zzso compared with that of the other zzso is attributed to three factors: zzso a specific zzso rate higher for the zzso than for the chemically zzso zzso iron oxide zzso zzso a more uniform heating for the chains of zzso than for the individual zzso and zzso the ability of the chains of zzso to penetrate within the cancer cells or bind at the cell membrane following the application of the alternative magnetic field, which enables efficient cell zzso zzso studies revealed that extracted chains of zzso administered directly within zzso breast tumors progressively left the tumors during the 14 days following their administration and were then eliminated in large proportion in the zzso
