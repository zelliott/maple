zzso of zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso tumor cells induce zzso responses against zzso tumors in animal models and human clinical zzso These fusion cells require zzso tumor cells, which are not, however, always zzso Here we fused zzso zzso from patients with zzso zzso zzso to an zzso zzso cell line zzso These fusion cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso T cells were activated by the fusion zzso zzso T zzso zzso induced by the fusion cells were able to kill zzso zzso by zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso activity against shared zzso indicates that the presence of zzso does not prevent the development of zzso with activity against zzso zzso zzso These fusion cells may have applications in zzso zzso through zzso against shared tumor zzso and may provide a platform for adoptive zzso
