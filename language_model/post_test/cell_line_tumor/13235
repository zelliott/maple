zzso vessels were observed inside the zzso vessels near the zzso zzso zzso of a rabbit and a rat and in the zzso zzso duct of a zzso In the current work we found a primo vessel inside the zzso vessel that came out from the tumor tissue of a zzso A cancer model of a nude mouse was made with human lung cancer cell line zzso We injected fluorescent zzso into the zzso tumor tissue and studied their flow in blood, zzso and primo zzso Fluorescent zzso flowed through the blood vessels quickly in few minutes, and but slowly in the zzso zzso The bright fluorescent signals of zzso disappeared within one hour in the blood vessels but remained much longer up to several hours in the case of zzso zzso We found an exceptional case of zzso vessels that remained bright with zzso up to 24 zzso After detailed examination we found that the bright zzso was due to a putative primo vessel inside the zzso zzso This rare observation is consistent with zzso Kim's claim on the presence of a primo vascular system in zzso zzso It provides a significant suggestion on the cancer zzso through primo vessels and zzso zzso
