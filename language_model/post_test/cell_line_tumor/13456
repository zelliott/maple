It has been reported that the tumor zzso zzso zzso which is zzso in many zzso tumors, plays an important role in zzso cell cycle arrest, cell migration, and cell zzso For cancer gene therapy, one of the most important problems is low gene zzso zzso 

In the present study, to take full advantage of zzso in gene zzso we prepared zzso zzso zzso using the zzso gene zzso and investigated the effect of zzso combined with zzso zzso on tumor growth in a zzso model of zzso zzso 

zzso effectively suppressed tumor growth and induced significant zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso levels in zzso mice treated with zzso were significantly higher than those in zzso mice treated with naked zzso zzso or zzso zzso Treatment with zzso resulted in a significant zzso effect in this tumor zzso Compared with the controls treated with zzso solution, the tumor zzso rate with naked zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

These results suggest that combined treatment with zzso and other zzso agents may be a potent zzso therapeutic approach for the treatment of zzso zzso
