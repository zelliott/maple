To investigate zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 299 cells and its zzso 

Clinical zzso and zzso protein expressions of 25 cases of zzso were reviewed zzso the median duration of survival was analyzed for patients with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were applied to other 25 cases of zzso and zzso tissue from human zzso zzso zzso zzso 299 cells to detect the protein of zzso and zzso 

Of former 25 cases of zzso median duration of survival for zzso patients was 59 months, whereas 20 months for zzso zzso The prognosis of zzso group was better than that of zzso group, survival zzso of these two groups showed statistically significant zzso zzso zzso zzso was positive in 18 cases zzso while negative in 7 cases zzso of the latter 25 zzso zzso was positive in 19 cases zzso while negative in 6 cases zzso Of 19 zzso zzso 16 zzso cases zzso zzso and in 6 zzso zzso zzso were zzso double negative, the expression of zzso protein strongly correlated with that of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein expressed in zzso 299 cells with diffuse zzso 

zzso highly expressed in zzso and showed high rate of zzso with zzso zzso protein expression could be considered as a helpful diagnostic and zzso factor of zzso especially for zzso zzso
