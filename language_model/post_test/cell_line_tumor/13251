Treatment of zzso cells with the zzso zzso results in reduction of the growth rate by zzso of the S phase of the cell zzso zzso is formed in the gut by zzso from zzso and the zzso zzso acids are found within zzso Our hypothesis is that the reduction of the rate of S phase progression may result in increased DNA zzso To test this hypothesis, zzso cells were subjected to zzso light that caused DNA zzso and then the cells were grown in the absence or presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso of DNA strand breaks using the comet zzso showed that zzso treatment indeed resulted in a reduction of zzso showing damaged zzso In the search for a zzso we have investigated the levels of several proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA zzso and zzso using Western zzso zzso treatment resulted in an increased expression of zzso zzso pointing to increased DNA synthesis zzso zzso treatment decreased the expression of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso X protein (or zzso indicating decreased cell zzso As we have found zzso zzso treatment reduced the expression of zzso E involved in the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that a lower zzso expression in zzso cells, pointing to more efficient DNA zzso Thus, altogether our data show that zzso treatment has beneficial zzso
