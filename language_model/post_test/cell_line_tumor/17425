zzso zzso is a zzso hormone and plays a major role both in the regulation of pancreatic zzso zzso and growth of the gastrointestinal zzso The pancreatic zzso receptors are highly zzso membrane proteins that are able to bind plant zzso such as wheat germ zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In preceding papers, we demonstrated an zzso of zzso induced zzso signaling and zzso of rat pancreatic zzso and zzso cells by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here we studied the influence of zzso zzso and 22 other zzso on zzso binding on zzso zzso A binding zzso was used with zzso and zzso zzso cells, bearing zzso as well as zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso binding in a zzso zzso The binding is affected at zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso for zzso is 8 zzso At a concentration of 25 zzso zzso zzso the hormone binding zzso This zzso can be abolished by the specific zzso for zzso zzso and zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso diminished hormone binding but without significance, although zzso binds to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso All other 22 zzso tested here were zzso 

The zzso of zzso receptors by zzso explains the zzso of zzso induced zzso signaling and the zzso of pancreatic zzso cells and zzso zzso Although the zzso effect of zzso is in agreement with the findings of zzso et zzso the results with zzso are in contrast to those of zzso et al zzso who described a strong increase in zzso binding to isolated crude rat pancreatic cell zzso in the presence of zzso
