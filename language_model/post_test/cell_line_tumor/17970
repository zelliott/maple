The zzso zzso fatty acid, zzso acid zzso has been found to process zzso zzso However, the exact cellular mechanisms are not well zzso zzso zzso factor zzso is one of zzso which is involved in zzso zzso survival, and zzso 

In this study, the potential zzso effects of zzso and its possible effects on zzso and zzso zzso expression were investigated in zzso zzso 

Both zzso and zzso acid zzso differentiated zzso cells were treated with zzso and/or zzso The cell viability was determined by zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso and zzso were tested by zzso and Western zzso 

In zzso zzso cells, either zzso or zzso or both did not affect the cell zzso In zzso differentiated zzso cells, treatment with different doses of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (1 zzso for 24 hours significantly increased the cell zzso while zzso or zzso alone showed no zzso More importantly, zzso and Western zzso results revealed that 24 hours treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly increased the full-length zzso zzso but not truncated zzso zzso expression in these zzso An increase in zzso expression was also observed with zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso with either 100 zzso zzso a protein zzso zzso or 500 zzso zzso a zzso zzso inhibitor completely abolished the zzso increase in cell zzso 

Our results indicate that zzso exerts beneficial effects on cell survival through modulating zzso zzso zzso
