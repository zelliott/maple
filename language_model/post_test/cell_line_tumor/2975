zzso is a naturally occurring zzso abundant in zzso zzso and has showed zzso and zzso effects in a wide range of human cancer zzso However, the molecular mechanisms on the zzso activity in cancer cells have been poorly zzso In this study, we evaluated the growth zzso activity of zzso in cultured zzso zzso zzso zzso human breast cancer zzso zzso exerted zzso activity with the cell cycle arrest at the zzso phase and sequential induction of zzso cell death in a zzso zzso The zzso cell cycle arrest was well correlated with the zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso at zzso zzso caused by zzso was also zzso with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and Bid along with the zzso expression of zzso but it was independent on the expression of zzso and zzso In addition, zzso cells exhibited the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso In the analysis of signal zzso pathway, zzso zzso the expression and zzso of zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso and consequently led to the zzso of zzso and its downstream signal molecules including zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso activity of cancer cell growth might be related with the cell cycle arrest and induction of zzso via modulating signal zzso zzso
