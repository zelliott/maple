Many human cancer cells are sensitive to killing by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is under study for cancer treatment in clinical zzso The TRAIL zzso zzso also known as death zzso 4) is a zzso zzso that mediates zzso zzso in cancer zzso In this study, we show that zzso sensitize cancer cells to zzso zzso by zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso expression in human cancer cells at the zzso zzso The ability of zzso to activate zzso expression was inhibited by zzso acid zzso zzso zzso or zzso but zzso by several zzso zzso In analyzing how zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso we identified 2 putative zzso acid response elements termed zzso (a zzso separated by 17 zzso and zzso (a direct repeat separated by 11 zzso in the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso the ability of zzso to stimulate zzso promoter zzso zzso with this zzso zzso binding to zzso but not to zzso was detected by zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, arguing that zzso was responsible for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of cancer cells, and this activity was attenuated by a blockade to zzso of zzso zzso Taken together, our findings establish that zzso zzso zzso zzso reveal a novel mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso and suggest a novel strategy to augment the zzso activity of zzso
