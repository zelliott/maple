To develop a zzso reporter system that allows for zzso monitoring of zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso in a quantitative and sensitive zzso 

Fusion proteins of the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso and of its downstream binding partner zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso have been engineered zzso to the rationale that on zzso and binding of the zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso function will be zzso Thus, the resulting zzso signals can serve as a surrogate measure of zzso zzso 

We have shown that our reporter systems functions well in zzso in breast cancer cells and in zzso in zzso zzso In particular, the activities of zzso in zzso tumors could be monitored serially for an extended period after zzso 

We believe that the novel zzso reporter we have presented is a powerful tool to study the biology of the zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso It should also facilitate the development and rapid evaluation of new zzso therapeutic zzso
