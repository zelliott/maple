zzso and zzso expression was determined by real-time zzso in 138 zzso cancer samples and 30 healthy zzso zzso and was correlated with the expression of other relevant zzso parameters and common zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was evaluated by zzso treatment of various zzso cancer cell lines, human zzso zzso cells and zzso surface zzso zzso but not zzso was zzso zzso in 5 of 7 zzso cancer cell zzso Both zzso were zzso with zzso and to a lesser extent with zzso or zzso but not with zzso zzso growth factor zzso treatment zzso both zzso In zzso cancer samples only zzso but not zzso zzso was zzso when compared with healthy zzso zzso zzso but not zzso expression was significantly associated with zzso zzso and zzso box zzso zzso In zzso survival analysis, strong expression of zzso and zzso predicted improved zzso survival zzso and overall survival zzso In Cox zzso zzso zzso retained independent zzso significance for zzso and zzso and zzso for zzso In contrast to other solid tumors, zzso expression cannot be regarded as a classic zzso associated with poor prognosis in zzso zzso Of the zzso parameters investigated, zzso zzso expression is the most powerful independent predictor of a favorable clinical zzso
