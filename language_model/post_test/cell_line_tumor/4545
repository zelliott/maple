This study was designed to identify the cell surface protein markers that can differentiate between chronic zzso leukemia zzso and acute zzso leukemia cells zzso The zzso expressed plasma membrane proteins were analyzed between zzso cell line zzso and zzso cell line zzso using the comparative zzso zzso The cell membrane proteins were enriched by labeling with a zzso zzso zzso zzso and subjected to liquid zzso tandem mass zzso zzso By comparative zzso analysis of zzso and zzso cells, we identified 25 membrane and 14 zzso zzso The result of zzso combined with chemical tagging method was validated by confirming the expression and zzso of one of the zzso expressed plasma membrane zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso could be a potential candidate for zzso zzso from zzso
