To assess the role of zzso mismatch repair zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso and progression of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of 38 cases of zzso along with their corresponding zzso zzso 2 samples of donated normal tissue and 6 cell lines were collected and subject to the zzso zzso zzso to examine promoter zzso status of zzso zzso and zzso Six tumor cell lines were analyzed before and after zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso expression of zzso were investigated by quantitative reverse zzso 

zzso island zzso of zzso and zzso was observed in zzso (5 of 38 zzso and zzso zzso of 38 zzso respectively in zzso zzso (1 of 38 zzso and zzso (21 of zzso respectively in corresponding zzso zzso but not in normal control zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was present in zzso of cell lines tested zzso but none were observed for the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was not identified in any tissue samples or cell zzso After zzso treatment, zzso zzso was induced or completely zzso and its zzso expression was increased in most cell zzso 

Our results suggest that promoter zzso of zzso and zzso genes is common in zzso zzso there is a high frequency of zzso of zzso in both cancer and zzso zzso but not in normal control zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso especially zzso may be involved in the zzso of zzso and may serve as an early diagnostic marker for zzso The close correlation between zzso zzso and low expression of its zzso suggests that zzso zzso is an important zzso in the regulation of gene zzso
