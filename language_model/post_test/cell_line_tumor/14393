The present data showed that zzso zzso a family of zzso zzso possessed high zzso activity in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso was a potential and highly efficient zzso compound with zzso values of zzso to 500 zzso in nine tumor cell zzso The high zzso potency of zzso was paralleled with its ability to increase the cellular zzso of DNA zzso DNA relaxation zzso also showed that zzso exerted high potency as a zzso I zzso Moreover, administration of zzso zzso zzso for 15 to 17 days significantly inhibited tumor growth in human zzso prostate tumor zzso and human zzso cell lung tumor zzso zzso the zzso rates ranged from zzso to zzso The zzso effect of 1,000 zzso of zzso in zzso cells was associated with causing an arrest in zzso phase, whereas that of 10 and 100 zzso zzso was relative to a persistent block in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso D1 was observed in zzso cells treated with 1,000 zzso of zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso and zzso B1 was seen in zzso cells treated with 10 and 100 zzso of zzso These results suggested that cell cycle regulation might contribute to the zzso properties of zzso and strongly support the further zzso development of zzso
