zzso of zzso T cells with zzso zzso zzso B zzso and use of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to tumor protective zzso We zzso that zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso is crucial for tumor protective immunity in this zzso 

Adolescent zzso mice were zzso injected with zzso zzso melanoma to establish pulmonary zzso Three days after establishing pulmonary zzso predominantly zzso T cells are activated with 50 mug of zzso zzso zzso T cells were depleted at different time points in relation to zzso administration to assess the effect on protective immunity against a second tumor zzso 

zzso immunity is significantly zzso zzso zzso decreased when zzso depletion occurs 6 h after zzso injection, as growth of zzso zzso melanoma occurred in zzso zzso immunity is present at all other time points when mice survive zzso zzso zzso Survival of animals treated with zzso zzso is significantly better zzso zzso zzso than with zzso alone zzso or zzso control zzso Survival when zzso zzso depletion occurred at 6 h and 48 h zzso is zzso and zzso zzso and is statistically indistinguishable zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso If zzso depletion was conducted before zzso administration, however, the combination of zzso and zzso did not result in significant protective zzso zzso depletion before the use of zzso alone, without zzso failed to result in significant protective zzso
