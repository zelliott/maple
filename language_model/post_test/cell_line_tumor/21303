Cellular stress and DNA damage zzso and activate zzso fundamental for cell cycle control, zzso DNA repair and zzso The specific zzso that determine whether zzso cell cycle arrest or zzso zzso prevails in response to specific DNA damage are poorly zzso In this study, we investigated two types of DNA damage, zzso treatment and gamma zzso zzso that induced similar levels of zzso but that zzso two distinct zzso cell zzso zzso exposure induced a robust zzso protein zzso zzso zzso response that was accompanied by the rapid loss of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso cell cycle arrests that was supported by the rapid induction of zzso zzso of zzso effectively blocked zzso but not zzso zzso stabilization and zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso and zzso by caffeine had the inverse effect of blocking zzso but not zzso zzso stabilization and zzso zzso exposure zzso zzso zzso but zzso and zzso zzso was significantly enhanced compared to zzso zzso In contrast, zzso treatment triggered significant zzso zzso synthesis in addition to zzso and zzso zzso zzso While zzso treatment enhanced the binding of zzso and zzso zzso II zzso Pol zzso to both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Pol II zzso was only observed along the zzso gene and not the zzso zzso In contrast, following zzso treatment, zzso Pol II zzso was observed on both zzso and zzso zzso zzso therefore involves zzso zzso zzso followed by preferential zzso of zzso zzso over zzso zzso zzso
