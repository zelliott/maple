Given that zzso zzso zzso are zzso of the zzso zzso zzso can induce zzso zzso and are used in combination with zzso for zzso zzso zzso treatment, the role that zzso plays in zzso zzso resistance zzso in a fully transformed zzso cell line zzso was zzso 

The zzso cells were exposed to both acute and chronic treatments of zzso zzso of different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso alone or together with zzso The zzso zzso and protein expression levels were then assessed by zzso and western zzso flow zzso and zzso 

zzso treatment of zzso cells with one of the five zzso alone or together resulted in increased resistance to zzso zzso with one of the zzso in combination with zzso resulted in a synergistic increase in resistance to zzso and the degree of resistance was found to correlate with the expression of zzso The zzso cells were also revealed to be zzso to the structurally unrelated drug zzso 

These studies suggest that zzso is primarily responsible for zzso zzso in zzso cells selected with either zzso alone or in combination with zzso zzso the roles that zzso and drug cocktails play in zzso zzso in zzso in zzso should be zzso
