The role of zzso 1 zzso 1) in zzso is zzso This study was to explore the association between the zzso expression and the clinical zzso the responsiveness to chemotherapy and prognosis in zzso cell lung cancer zzso 

We enrolled 295 patients with zzso advanced stage of zzso zzso stage III zzso and IV zzso All patients had received zzso chemotherapy after diagnosis and the chemotherapy response were zzso All patients were followed up for overall survival zzso and progression free survival zzso In zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso small interfering zzso zzso The cell biological behaviors and zzso to zzso treatment were zzso The in zzso zzso and zzso zzso were performed in nude zzso 

We found that the zzso expressions were significantly associated with the tumor stage, tumor size and differentiation zzso Patients with high zzso 1 expressions had a significantly higher chance to be resistant to chemotherapy than those with low zzso 1 zzso Patients with high expression of zzso had significantly shorter zzso and zzso than those with low zzso Cox analyses confirmed that the zzso 1 expression was a strong predictor for a poor zzso and zzso in zzso patients underwent zzso zzso In zzso studies revealed that the reduced expression zzso 1 by zzso technique significantly inhibited cell zzso migration and zzso More importantly, zzso zzso significantly enhanced the zzso of zzso cells to zzso zzso The in zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso dramatically reduced the tumor volume and the zzso ability in nude zzso 

zzso our data suggest that the zzso expression may be a molecular marker associated with the zzso clinical features, treatment responsiveness and prognosis of advanced zzso
