zzso protein zzso is a zzso for all members of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso into cells via zzso zzso trafficking, making it an attractive mechanism for efficient gene zzso In this study, we have developed a gene delivery system using zzso as a targeting zzso A zzso zzso lacking a zzso zzso domain was amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso from a human liver zzso library and was zzso by using a primer containing a zzso zzso at its zzso end to facilitate its zzso to zzso zzso zzso was zzso using a bacterial expression system and coupled to zzso zzso or zzso zzso of average zzso 50 zzso via the zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso cellular zzso of the zzso complexes into zzso cells was shown to be highly efficient and more specific to zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso DNA containing a zzso reporter gene was condensed with either zzso or zzso In zzso zzso into zzso cells with zzso zzso resulted in significantly higher zzso expression levels in comparison to either zzso zzso or zzso or zzso complexes in the presence of zzso fetal bovine zzso zzso expression was inhibited by the addition of excess zzso Treatment of the cells with zzso which zzso zzso zzso and increases expression of LDL zzso stimulates zzso zzso suggesting that the gene delivery is specifically zzso by LDL zzso Thus, zzso zzso have the potential to be used as a new zzso gene delivery zzso
