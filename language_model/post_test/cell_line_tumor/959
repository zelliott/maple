An original model of closed continuous zzso zzso zzso zzso in mice is presented and was found to support the efficacy of zzso zzso Closed zzso was performed after zzso zzso of zzso colon 26 cells into a zzso zzso 26 cells (5 zzso zzso were injected into 18 zzso The mice were then allocated to six groups of three each and subjected to zzso zzso over zzso zzso zzso from each mouse were sampled and counted by the zzso zzso On day 10 after zzso colonies of the zzso zzso were seen on the zzso by zzso with zzso zzso blue for 5 zzso The number of zzso zzso on the zzso was zzso The number of zzso zzso cells decreased the most at 24 h after zzso and zzso of the zzso cells did not wash out during the zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed after 24 h when colon 26 cells were injected into the zzso cavity because this status may represent zzso The total number of zzso on the zzso in the zzso group was significantly smaller than that in the control zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, because this treatment model is similar to the clinical zzso the zzso model might be useful for the evaluation of zzso dissemination and it was unique and valuable in demonstrating an effective treatment for the prevention of zzso zzso
