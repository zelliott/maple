We reported in a recent publication that zzso zzso a zzso zzso reduces cell proliferation in zzso cells and at the same time zzso the zzso of zzso zzso via zzso by acting upon zzso zzso zzso We describe here the results of our study into the influence of zzso on other zzso pathways of zzso zzso clearly decreased the incorporation of the zzso precursor zzso into PC and zzso zzso whilst increasing that of the neutral lipids zzso zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso of zzso into zzso and other zzso remained unchanged by zzso and neither was the activity of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso altered, demonstrating that the zzso of zzso is unaffected by zzso We also analyzed the zzso zzso and final product of the zzso zzso and found that zzso caused an increase in the incorporation of zzso into zzso and zzso zzso and a decrease in zzso zzso which might be interpreted in terms of a stimulation of zzso zzso zzso Since zzso can be zzso to give PC, we studied this process further and observed that zzso decreased the synthesis of PC from zzso by zzso the zzso zzso zzso These results constitute the first experimental evidence that the zzso of the synthesis of PC via zzso by zzso is not zzso by any increase in its formation via zzso On the contrary, in the presence of zzso both pathways seem to contribute jointly to a decrease in the overall synthesis of PC in zzso zzso
