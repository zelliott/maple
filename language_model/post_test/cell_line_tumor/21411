zzso zzso of zzso have demonstrated efficacy for PET imaging of cellular zzso We have zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and performed preliminary PET imaging studies in zzso zzso 

zzso was converted to its zzso zzso which was then converted to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of these zzso precursors with zzso or zzso followed by acid zzso and zzso zzso yielded zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso human zzso cell lung cancer were established in two groups of mice (each zzso zzso images of the zzso animals were acquired after intravenous injection of zzso or zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso yields were zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso purity was zzso and calculated specific activity was zzso zzso at the end of zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso in the tumor tissue at 2 h zzso was zzso and zzso percent injected dose per gram zzso zzso zzso ratios were zzso and zzso zzso the zzso influx rates zzso were zzso and zzso zzso per minute, zzso 

Two novel zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso in good yields, high purity and high specific zzso zzso in zzso studies demonstrated the efficacy of these zzso zzso zzso zzso for PET imaging of zzso
