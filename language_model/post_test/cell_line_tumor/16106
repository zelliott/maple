zzso a well-known zzso regulator, controls a wide spectrum of biological zzso The zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso via zzso nuclear exclusion and zzso A loss or gain of zzso activity has been correlated with efficiency of zzso in various zzso including oral zzso cell zzso zzso zzso in the current study, we have investigated the zzso activity modulating and zzso effects of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso inhibited proliferation and induced zzso in a zzso way in zzso zzso zzso zzso alone had no effect on cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso associated zzso zzso and increased the zzso protein stability but induced the zzso of feedback zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased the zzso of zzso via zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso as its feedback zzso zzso inhibitor revealed the most dramatic zzso nuclear zzso and zzso with the prevention of its feedback loop and exposed significant synergistic effects of decreased cell proliferation and increased zzso in zzso and decreased tumor size in zzso Furthermore, the downstream effects of zzso zzso were found to be zzso of zzso and zzso In conclusion, zzso combination therapy boosts synergistic zzso effects through the significant zzso zzso in zzso zzso These results may represent a novel mechanism by which zzso combination therapy proves to be a potent zzso strategy for zzso
