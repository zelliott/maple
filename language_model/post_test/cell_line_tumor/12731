zzso zzso zzso zzso and its receptors zzso are involved in zzso survival, and differentiation in human breast cancer zzso Its mechanism of action is traditionally thought to be through specific plasma membrane zzso There is compelling evidence for a novel zzso mode of zzso regulation by zzso receptors zzso that implies both zzso and nuclear zzso of peripheral zzso and/or the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso Regarding to zzso zzso which are zzso there is only a report suggesting them as a dynamic system for signaling from plasma membrane and nuclear membrane zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso is localized in cell nuclear fraction whereas zzso zzso presents an zzso zzso and its protein expression is lower than that of zzso zzso in human breast tissue zzso Both receptors as well as zzso are zzso in breast cancer as compared to zzso zzso Moreover, we report the markedly nuclear zzso of zzso receptors in zzso zzso and independent zzso human breast cancer cell zzso zzso receptors are functional in plasma membrane and nucleus as shown by zzso stimulation of zzso production in both cell zzso In addition, zzso increases its own zzso and zzso levels, and could be involved in the regulation of zzso traffic from the plasma membrane to the zzso These results support new concepts on function and regulation of nuclear zzso which could have an impact on development of new therapeutic zzso
