zzso diseases are not zzso and may result from zzso in both nuclear and zzso DNA zzso At present, only zzso therapies are available for these disorders, and interest in the development of efficient treatment protocols is zzso Here, we demonstrate that in cells zzso for the zzso zzso which is a cause for the zzso and zzso zzso infection with an zzso which encodes the zzso targeted zzso restriction zzso leads to selective destruction of zzso zzso This destruction proceeds in a zzso and zzso manner and results in cells with significantly increased rates of oxygen consumption and zzso zzso The delivery of zzso to zzso is accompanied by improvement in the ability to zzso zzso as the sole carbon source, which is a surrogate indicator of the proficiency of zzso zzso zzso the rate of zzso acid production by these cells, which is a marker of zzso dysfunction, zzso We further demonstrate that levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso markers of nuclear DNA damage, do not change in response to infection with zzso zzso indicating the absence of nuclear DNA damage and the relative safety of the zzso Finally, some advantages and limitations of the proposed approach are zzso
