Worldwide, zzso cancer is the third most common type of cancer affecting both zzso It has been proposed that a small subset of cancer cells zzso stem zzso within each tumor is able to initiate tumor zzso In 2007, two research groups simultaneously identified a colon cancer stem cell population in human tumors by the use of zzso zzso In the present study, we used a human colon cancer cell line, zzso to analyze the cancer stem zzso characteristics of zzso cells in zzso and in zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells had a higher zzso capacity, were more zzso and zzso and had a higher expression of zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso cells into the skin or zzso zzso of zzso mice led to zzso however, injection of zzso cells resulted in the formation of larger zzso zzso derived from injections of zzso cells did not contain any zzso cells, whereas tumors derived from injections of zzso cells did contain zzso cells, suggesting zzso zzso However, the proportion of zzso cells in the newly formed tumors in zzso was lower than the proportion of zzso cells in zzso In conclusion, the human colon cancer cell line, zzso contains both zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso has characteristics consistent with those of cancer stem zzso
