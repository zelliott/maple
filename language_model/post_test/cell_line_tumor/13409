zzso contributes to both zzso and pathological processes and its effects are mainly zzso through the zzso factors zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso and zzso The purpose of this study was to examine the role of these proteins in zzso zzso 

We developed a method to isolate primary human zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso expression were then compared in zzso and zzso cell lines under zzso oxygen zzso and zzso oxygen zzso We also used zzso element zzso reporter zzso in conjunction with zzso specific to zzso or zzso to determine the contribution of each protein to zzso zzso Finally, we measured zzso expression in primary zzso tumors by zzso 

We found that mainly zzso transcript was significantly higher in zzso cell lines compared to normal zzso under both zzso and zzso At the protein level, zzso was zzso stabilized in zzso cell lines under both zzso zzso expression was required for the observed increases in zzso zzso Finally, nuclear or zzso zzso zzso in zzso cases was associated with high-grade zzso 

These findings point to a role for zzso in zzso progression and suggest that the observed differences in zzso oxygen dependent degradation may play an important zzso role in this zzso zzso Blood Cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso 2012 zzso zzso zzso
