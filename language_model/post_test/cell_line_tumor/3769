zzso cells express zzso a zzso zzso but its role in zzso remains to be zzso Here we show that zzso of zzso in mouse zzso zzso cells by zzso specific small interference zzso zzso zzso markedly suppressed zzso tube formation in zzso in early stage after the treatment, along with zzso and zzso of some of the zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso Of particular note is that zzso administration of the zzso zzso in a human prostate cancer zzso significantly reduced tumor zzso and resulted in the zzso of tumor zzso These findings show that zzso in zzso cells is involved in tube formation, and suggest its potential as a molecular target for zzso tumor zzso which warrants further development of zzso zzso strategies for cancer zzso
