The invasive and zzso zzso of zzso zzso are positively correlated with the expression level of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso including zzso In this study, we investigated changes in the adhesive and invasive behaviors of human zzso zzso cells after zzso with zzso for zzso zzso in order to zzso the direct involvement of this zzso in these cellular zzso We introduced zzso for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso into the cells, and selected two zzso clones zzso and zzso which express the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso cells zzso almost equally to zzso plates in an zzso zzso manner, indicating that zzso zzso and zzso zzso were functionally active in these zzso The migratory and invasive zzso of the zzso cells were assessed by scratch wound zzso and in zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrated that the migration of zzso and zzso cells but not of mock zzso zzso cells was zzso on the plates coated with zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso cells were found to be more invasive into zzso zzso than were zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that enhanced expression of zzso zzso on zzso cells is directly involved in their zzso zzso such as invasion and zzso
