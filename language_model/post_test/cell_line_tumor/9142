Bone is the key zzso site for prostate zzso zzso 1 zzso produced abundantly by prostate cancer cells binds to its zzso present on bone zzso zzso cells and favors zzso response during bone zzso of prostate zzso This suggests that interrupting zzso interaction with its zzso A zzso zzso could be useful for zzso prostate cancer bone zzso and, as such, may enhance the therapeutic activity of zzso zzso the most commonly used drug for the treatment of zzso prostate zzso zzso the goal of our study was to obtain zzso data supporting our hypothesis that the combined use of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso will be superior in inducing zzso in zzso and zzso tumor growth in zzso in a zzso model of experimental bone zzso induced by zzso prostate cancer zzso In zzso studies were done on a panel of prostate cancer cell lines to understand the molecular basis of combination therapy, and we found that the combination was more effective in the zzso of cell viability and induction of zzso in zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso These results were correlated with zzso of zzso zzso and its target zzso For in zzso studies, the therapeutic regimen was initiated when the tumor began showing signs of growth and treatment was continued for 5 zzso zzso volume and serum zzso zzso were used as terminal index to evaluate the therapeutic advantage of combination therapy relative to a single regimen and zzso zzso At zzso we found a zzso reduction in tumor volume by combination treatment relative to the zzso control zzso Most importantly, the zzso activity was associated with the zzso of molecular markers in tumor zzso that were similar to those observed in zzso
