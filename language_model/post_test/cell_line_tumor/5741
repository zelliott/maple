This report describes the synthesis of zzso of zzso acid zzso commonly known as zzso and their analysis in acting as zzso X zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 has zzso approval to treat zzso zzso zzso zzso however, its use can cause side effects such as zzso and increased zzso zzso presumably by disruption of zzso zzso with other nuclear zzso The novel zzso in the present study have been evaluated for zzso zzso in an zzso zzso zzso as well as an zzso zzso zzso and for their ability to induce zzso as well as for their zzso and zzso Analysis of 11 novel compounds revealed the discovery of three zzso that best induce zzso zzso activity, stimulate zzso have comparable zzso and zzso values to 1, and are selective zzso zzso Our experimental approach suggests that rational drug design can develop new zzso with improved biological zzso
