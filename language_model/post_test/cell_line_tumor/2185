zzso a zzso of the zzso passenger complex zzso binds the zzso tail of zzso zzso which is zzso on zzso by zzso zzso and zzso the complex to the inner zzso We used zzso zzso to determine the zzso of zzso that are important in binding zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso acids that interact with the zzso zzso lowered in zzso tail binding affinity and reduced zzso recruitment to the inner zzso in cells, zzso our solved zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso zzso have two zzso zzso which we name class A and zzso A distinguishing feature of these zzso is an zzso change in an zzso acid that interacts with the zzso zzso zzso The binding to zzso tails of the human class A zzso which has a zzso at this position, is sensitive to changes around zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso class B is less zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso zzso have different characteristics of zzso binding to zzso of zzso zzso providing new insight into the biology of the inner zzso
