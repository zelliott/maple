Four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from transformed roots of zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed relatively high zzso against zzso and zzso leukemia cells zzso range zzso zzso zzso which is equal to zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso were less active in this zzso Moreover, we have found that all four zzso of zzso zzso had equal zzso activity against parental zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells, what indicates that they are poor zzso for transport by zzso zzso protein zzso zzso activity zzso showed that zzso and zzso were able to induce zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso The results obtained in this study show that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso may be useful in the treatment of human zzso especially in the case of drug zzso
