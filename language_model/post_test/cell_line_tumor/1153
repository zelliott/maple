zzso zzso zzso is the most frequent zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso primarily involves the skin initially with patches and zzso In later zzso zzso tumors develop and tumor cells may spread to zzso zzso and finally to visceral zzso Here, we describe an animal model for zzso in zzso nude mice, using the zzso cell line zzso zzso transplantation of zzso cells leads to the formation of zzso tumors in zzso of the mice zzso zzso zzso of tumor cells to visceral sites was detected by zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso detection of specific zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were found circulating in the blood, zzso zzso and in blood vessels of heart, zzso zzso and zzso In lung and liver zzso tumor cells presented zzso invasion, but no large secondary tumors zzso The nude mouse model described here will be a valuable test system for new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of zzso and opens the unique opportunity to study the disease in zzso
