zzso is a novel zzso acid metabolism blocking agent discovered in our zzso The purpose of the study was to zzso the molecular mechanism of zzso activity of zzso in breast cancer cell lines and in tumor zzso We investigated the effects of zzso on induction of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, we also examined the impact of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso on zzso activity of zzso Finally, the zzso activity of zzso was evaluated as a single agent and in combination with zzso inhibitor zzso in an zzso mouse zzso zzso Short exposure of low dose zzso zzso of zzso induced zzso zzso stress, zzso and inhibited zzso phase transition and caused a protective zzso However, a higher dose of zzso initiated zzso in zzso zzso of zzso using either zzso zzso or zzso interference of zzso enhanced zzso activity induced by zzso in zzso cells by triggering zzso zzso zzso (5 zzso twice zzso and the combination of zzso (5 zzso twice zzso + zzso zzso zzso twice zzso significantly suppressed established zzso tumor growth by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our novel findings suggest that zzso may be useful as a single agent or in combination with zzso zzso for treating human breast zzso Our data provides a strong rationale for clinical evaluation of zzso as single agent or in combination with zzso zzso
