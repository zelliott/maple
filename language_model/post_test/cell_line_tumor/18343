In the present study the zzso of zzso zzso complexes was investigated regarding the maintenance of zzso properties and influence on biological zzso To achieve this, we used zzso of different molecular zzso in the range of zzso zzso as zzso agents for unmodified zzso and zzso The zzso diameter was measured by zzso correlation zzso zzso and the zzso potential was determined using laser zzso zzso zzso of zzso complexes with zzso derivatives of different molecular weights both before and after zzso Atomic force zzso zzso was used to zzso freshly prepared, stored and zzso complexes in zzso The biological activity of the zzso as well as of zzso DNA, in zzso zzso complexes was examined and compared to freshly prepared complexes using standard zzso zzso All zzso derivatives formed very small complexes with zzso displaying zzso diameters ranging from 15 to 30 zzso Marginal changes in size after zzso were observed for zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso with zzso was found to zzso In either cases minimal or no influence of the added amount of zzso was zzso The shape of the very small and highly condensed zzso complexes was not altered by zzso as seen in the zzso zzso The zzso efficiency of zzso zzso complexes relative to freshly prepared complexes was approximately zzso whereas a decrease was seen for zzso zzso zzso An additive of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso preserved biological zzso This study demonstrates the particular suitability of zzso complexes to be formulated as zzso systems with no loss in physical stability or biological zzso
