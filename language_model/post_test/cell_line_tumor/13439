Current cancer therapies including zzso chemotherapy, radiation and zzso therapy induce acute zzso stress in zzso zzso A major challenge to cancer therapeutic efficacy is the recurrence of zzso zzso and how to overcome their zzso The current study examines the concept that zzso cell exposure to acute zzso stress results in the acquisition of a more advanced and aggressive cancer cell zzso Specifically, we determined whether heat stress resulted in an zzso transition zzso and/or the enhancement of cell migration, components of an advanced and zzso resistant cancer zzso We identified that heat stress enhanced cell migration in both the lung zzso and breast zzso human zzso cell lines, with zzso cells also undergoing a partial zzso Moreover, in an in zzso model of zzso zzso liver zzso of the mouse zzso zzso cell line, zzso analysis of classical zzso markers demonstrated a shift to a more zzso zzso in the surviving zzso zzso further demonstrating that zzso stress can induce zzso zzso To identify a mechanism by which zzso stress zzso zzso zzso we examined whether the major zzso regulator of the heat shock response, heat shock factor 1 zzso was a required zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso model did not prevent the associated zzso changes or enhanced migratory profile of heat stressed zzso zzso this study provides evidence that heat stress significantly impacts upon cancer cell zzso plasticity and the migratory zzso independent of zzso These findings further our understanding of novel biological downstream effects of heat stress and their potential independence from the classical heat shock zzso
