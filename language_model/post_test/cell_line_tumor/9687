zzso zzso is a therapeutic option for women with zzso sexual desire zzso T may have an impact on the zzso zzso by altering local zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to measure the effect of T on zzso zzso zzso zzso and activity using zzso BC cells with high and low aggressive potential zzso zzso and zzso as a breast cell line of zzso zzso 

zzso were incubated in zzso zzso medium containing zzso zzso fetal calf serum for zzso and subsequently incubated in absence or presence of T alone, and combined with zzso zzso at zzso and zzso at 37 degrees C for either zzso or directly in cell extracts zzso zzso protein expression was measured by zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels by quantitative zzso zzso activity was evaluated by zzso zzso breast cells with zzso and separating the products zzso and zzso by thin layer zzso 

zzso zzso zzso expression did not reveal group zzso However, zzso zzso was decreased by zzso in zzso zzso zzso expression was decreased by zzso in zzso cells, and zzso expression was decreased by A and zzso treatment in zzso zzso zzso and T treated zzso protein expression was significantly higher in zzso compared to zzso breast zzso However, T did not induce significant zzso line zzso Similarly, zzso and T treated zzso activity was significantly higher in highly zzso compared to zzso breast zzso Regardless of cell lines, T slightly decreased zzso activity after zzso zzso but led to an increase of local zzso formation after zzso which was zzso and partly reversed by A, zzso 

The more aggressive the breast cell line, the higher the local zzso zzso The transition from normal to zzso seems to be accompanied by an altered zzso The given local zzso milieu seems to be essential for response to zzso
