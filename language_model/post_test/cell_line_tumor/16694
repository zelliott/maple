zzso is widely used for the treatment of zzso Given the high resistance of brain zzso zzso to chemotherapy, it is important to find new methods to improve the effects of zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso resistance to chemotherapy are largely zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso a cell cycle regulator, is significantly zzso in zzso cells, and the increasing expression of zzso zzso well with the grades of zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we found that the proliferation and survival of tumor cells were dramatically zzso Moreover, zzso zzso in the zzso zzso cell line caused significant increase in the zzso of zzso cells treated with zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso reduced the expression level of drug resistance genes such as zzso and zzso These data indicate that zzso is an important zzso of zzso resistance to zzso Our findings provide a new strategy for the development of chemotherapy zzso
