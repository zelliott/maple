zzso zzso protein zzso increases the growth and zzso potential of prostate cancer cells, making it important to control zzso expression in these zzso We show that zzso D3 zzso and its zzso zzso zzso decrease zzso zzso and cellular protein levels in the zzso human prostate cancer cell line zzso and its zzso zzso the zzso cell zzso This effect is zzso via a negative Vitamin D response element zzso within the human zzso gene and involves an interaction between zzso and the Vitamin D zzso zzso The zzso X zzso zzso is a frequent zzso partner of the zzso We show that zzso forms part of the nuclear protein complex that interacts with zzso along with the zzso in zzso and zzso zzso We also show that the zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso zzso this decrease is more pronounced in zzso than in zzso zzso In addition, zzso acid enhances the zzso zzso of zzso expression in both cell zzso this effect also is more pronounced in zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso cells is decreased by zzso zzso zzso activity driven by zzso cloned upstream of the zzso promoter and zzso zzso into zzso and zzso cells is zzso in response to zzso and zzso in both cell zzso zzso with these compounds and zzso acid further decreases zzso activity in zzso but not zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso gene expression is regulated by zzso in a cell zzso manner in prostate cancer zzso
