zzso zzso zzso zzso are a group of small chemical molecules that inhibit zzso zzso At cell level, zzso zzso have multiple biological effects such as cell cycle arrest, zzso cell differentiation and zzso At molecular level, zzso zzso cause zzso and zzso zzso and induce gene zzso zzso zzso are widely used in cancer therapy because of its function of inducing zzso However, the mechanisms of zzso effect are not fully zzso zzso is a classical zzso inhibitor and widely used in zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we selected zzso A zzso to investigate the mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso effect on cancer zzso 

zzso cancer cell lines such as zzso zzso and normal human zzso line zzso were treated with various zzso of zzso Crystal violent zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed to determine cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso were performed to determine zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined by regular zzso zzso and Western zzso Small interfering zzso zzso was used to knock down zzso 

zzso zzso only induce cervical cancer cell zzso At 1 zzso of zzso zzso of zzso cell and zzso of zzso went zzso For normal cells, zzso zzso have no zzso effect at therapeutic zzso zzso zzso zzso of normal cell survive after treated with 1 zzso of zzso We compared 1 zzso group with zzso control with zzso There was no significance between 1 zzso group and zzso control for normal cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso in cancer cell but not in normal zzso zzso zzso of zzso induced zzso and zzso cell zzso More than zzso of zzso and zzso cell went zzso after deprived of zzso 

zzso was essential to cervical cancer cell zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso may play an important role in the toxicity of zzso zzso on cervical cancer zzso
