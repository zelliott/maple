When zzso attaching zzso to surfaces such as zzso zzso zzso are commonly used as zzso to produce surface zzso zzso However, these primed surfaces are rarely uniform in structure due to networking of the zzso zzso zzso may result in more uniform structures, although their long-term stability and effect on zzso cell responses are possible issues for orthopedic zzso This study examines for the first time the zzso of zzso zzso to titanium using zzso zzso reaction zzso The zzso surface topography, chemistry, and thicknesses were characterized showing improved surface uniformity compared with zzso zzso zzso The stability of the zzso was examined over a period of 8 days in environments of varying zzso temperature, and zzso In addition, human zzso zzso cell zzso and spreading on the samples was zzso zzso was minimal on zzso surfaces, but after zzso with zzso the cell density was greater than the titanium control and showed no overall zzso effect on initial cell zzso
