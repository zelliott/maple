Cancer zzso is a dynamic process characterized by a negative energy balance induced by anorexia and zzso The mechanisms leading to zzso are not totally zzso This study examines the efficiency of zzso zzso and energy wasting in liver zzso isolated from rats with cancer zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso 

PC was generated by an zzso injection of cancer cells zzso in zzso zzso The efficiency of zzso zzso and energy wasting as well as the role played by zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso zzso inner membrane zzso in these processes were assessed in liver zzso of PC and zzso control zzso 

The efficiency of zzso zzso decreased zzso while energy wasting increased zzso in liver zzso from PC compared to control zzso The increased energy wasting was associated with a higher zzso content zzso zzso zzso zzso and with a lower zzso zzso fatty acid ratio in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in PC zzso zzso production was increased by zzso in liver zzso from PC zzso 

The efficiency of zzso synthesis was reduced and energy wasting processes were increased in liver zzso of PC zzso This suggests that liver zzso from PC rats request more nutrients than liver zzso from control rats to maintain the same zzso zzso These zzso were associated to the content and fatty acid composition of zzso
