To construct a zzso zzso containing the zzso germ suicide gene CD and explore the killing effect of CD gene on zzso cells in combination with zzso in zzso 

A zzso containing full-length coding region of CD was zzso into expression zzso zzso zzso zzso to construct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso CD identified by zzso zzso of zzso then the zzso zzso was conducted into the zzso cell line by zzso zzso cells zzso expressing CD was obtained by zzso positive select with 300 approximately 600 zzso zzso and negative select with 10 zzso zzso Total zzso was extracted and the expression of the CD gene in zzso zzso cells was identified by zzso zzso zzso was used to observe the killing effect of zzso of different concentration on zzso cells zzso expressing CD and the controlled group was zzso cells zzso by zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso of zzso and inserted zzso of zzso zzso were got by cutting positive zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso CD with zzso Automatic DNA sequence analysis demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso CD contained integral coding region of CD of zzso that was totally the same with that published in zzso The expression of CD gene was detected by zzso The relative survival rate of zzso cells zzso expressing CD were separately lower than those in the control group zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso CD was successfully constructed and zzso zzso cells can be killed by zzso so the zzso zzso may be a candidate zzso for zzso cancer zzso
