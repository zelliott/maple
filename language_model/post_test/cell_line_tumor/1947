Although there are numerous studies regarding Alzheimer's disease zzso the cause and progression of zzso are still not well zzso The researches in the past decade implicated zzso zzso overproduction as a zzso event in disease zzso but still failed to clarify the mechanism of pathology from zzso production to central neural system defects in zzso The present review raises the hypothesis that the onset of zzso pathology is closely related with zzso dysfunction induced by zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso zzso transport zzso It is well-known that zzso transport zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso signal are fatal to zzso function and zzso We hypothesized that abnormal zzso precursor protein zzso processing and zzso production in zzso disturb the zzso transport by zzso zzso function and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 signal zzso For this hypothesis, the factors related with the initiation of zzso pathology are not only limited to the zzso per zzso but also expanded to the zzso around zzso such as the zzso of zzso from zzso The modification of the origin in this zzso may contribute to slow down the disease progression of zzso
