Recently, zzso of zzso zzso rich in zzso and cholesterol (called zzso zzso have been considered to act as a scaffold for the zzso C virus zzso replication zzso Using the zzso cell culture system, we investigated the effect of zzso a zzso synthesis zzso on zzso zzso We also investigated the combined effect of zzso with zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso suppressed replication of both a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso infectious zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner (for zzso zzso maximum of zzso at 1000 zzso for zzso zzso maximum of zzso at 1000 zzso Combination treatment with zzso and zzso or zzso and zzso attenuated zzso zzso replication zzso in zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that the zzso synthesis inhibitor strongly suppresses replication of both the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso strain of zzso zzso infectious zzso indicating that zzso metabolism could be a novel target for zzso zzso
