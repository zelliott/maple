zzso zzso data indicate that zzso zzso is associated with several types of human zzso Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms are poorly zzso Among its mode of action are the zzso on DNA zzso which provoke zzso gene zzso However, beyond DNA zzso little is known about zzso effects on zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of sodium zzso zzso on global zzso modifications and zzso zzso Our findings revealed that zzso exposure significantly increases global zzso zzso This effect was related to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity because zzso was able to inhibit zzso comparable to the well-known zzso inhibitor zzso A zzso Furthermore, analyses of the dynamic properties of the zzso high mobility group N proteins demonstrate that zzso zzso their zzso Thus, our data suggest that zzso zzso zzso opening by zzso zzso due to zzso zzso and increase of the mobility of zzso zzso As the zzso zzso is crucial for the regulation of gene expression as well as for zzso stability, we propose that zzso opening by zzso may play a significant role to impart its zzso zzso
