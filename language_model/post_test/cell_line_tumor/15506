We sought to identify zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso zzso domain zzso that zzso resistance to the zzso zzso zzso and explore the mechanism of action of the drug-resistant zzso We cultured zzso cells zzso zzso in high zzso of zzso and identified 14 zzso zzso including the zzso zzso observed in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso together with zzso proliferation zzso showed that the resistance zzso elevate the intrinsic zzso activity of zzso zzso lines were used to assess the ability of each zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso Unlike zzso zzso effectively inhibited all the zzso zzso zzso except the zzso gatekeeper zzso suggesting zzso but not zzso targets the active zzso of zzso zzso zzso cell lines expressing zzso zzso were relatively resistant to all zzso whereas zzso cell lines expressing zzso zzso showed differential zzso Within the zzso cell lines, three of seven showed marked resistance to zzso and relative resistance to zzso and zzso This suggests that alternative mechanisms distinct from zzso domain zzso are responsible for intrinsic resistance in these three zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso resistance (about zzso to zzso providing independent data that zzso can be associated with drug zzso zzso in zzso zzso analyses also show that zzso is more effective than zzso at zzso zzso We propose that tumors harboring zzso activated zzso should be treated with zzso zzso that specifically bind the active zzso
