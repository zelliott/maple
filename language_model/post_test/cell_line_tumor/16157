G zzso receptors constitute one of the most important families of membrane receptors through which cells respond to zzso zzso zzso of this zzso likely function as signal zzso zzso The identification and analysis of their components provide new insights into a better understanding of these zzso function and zzso We used zzso zzso and mass zzso as a systematic approach to characterize zzso complexes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso To overcome the limitations associated with membrane protein zzso zzso with detergents, we developed a strategy in which receptors are zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso the third zzso loop and the zzso tail zzso to the zzso of each zzso zzso Numerous protein complexes were identified, including many new interactions in various zzso zzso zzso identification data set together with protein interactions reported in the literature revealed a high degree of zzso These allow the proposal, for the first time, of an outline of the zzso zzso as a network of protein complexes and a context for a more reasoned and informed approach to drug discovery and zzso zzso zzso zzso
