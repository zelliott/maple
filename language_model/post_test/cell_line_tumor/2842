Two zzso zzso complexes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso and characterized by zzso analysis, zzso zzso and zzso mass zzso The structure of complex 2 was also determined by X-ray zzso which revealed a zzso coordination in an zzso geometry with two zzso acting as equatorial zzso The circular zzso data showed that complex 1 exhibited an zzso signal at around 300 zzso and induced more evident disturbances on DNA base stacking than complex 2, reflecting the impact of the zzso zzso on DNA binding zzso Complex 1 exhibited higher zzso activity to zzso zzso 19 DNA than complex 2 under zzso conditions, suggesting a promotional effect of zzso zzso in DNA zzso zzso Interestingly, both complexes demonstrated potent in zzso zzso against a series human tumor cell lines such as human zzso zzso cell line zzso human liver zzso cell line zzso human zzso zzso cell line zzso and human prostate zzso cell line zzso The zzso is zzso 10 times more active than the zzso drug zzso
