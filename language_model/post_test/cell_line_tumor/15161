zzso zzso cells zzso are known to be capable of continuous zzso throughout lifetime and are a source of multiple zzso factors important in central nervous system zzso zzso zzso cells are recognized to induce differentiation of neural stem cells into zzso precursor zzso zzso the aim of this study was to verify if zzso medium zzso obtained from zzso or zzso cells was capable of inducing differentiation of zzso zzso zzso stem cells zzso to a zzso zzso In order to this goal, zzso procedures and flow zzso analysis were used and some neural zzso as zzso protein gene product zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso cell surface zzso zzso were examined zzso and 7 days after the zzso The results showed that both zzso or zzso treated zzso express markers of zzso and mature zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso manner, display zzso features resembling zzso cells, and result negative for zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This study demonstrated that zzso can be influenced by the environment, indicating that these cells can respond to environmental cues also versus a zzso zzso
