zzso bovine zzso zzso has been used as a gene delivery zzso for vaccination of zzso However, its usefulness as a zzso for zzso species is limited due to poor zzso zzso To develop zzso based zzso for zzso species, we determined the feasibility of making targeted zzso zzso by zzso its natural zzso We constructed a zzso virus, zzso in which the zzso region of the zzso fiber protein was replaced with that from human zzso type 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to zzso and direct the expression of green fluorescent protein zzso in zzso cells, with low zzso In contrast, the zzso efficiency of zzso in these cells was increased by zzso zzso expression of early and late genes was detected in zzso cells, no progeny virus zzso was detected in these zzso Our results suggest that it is possible to develop zzso zzso with zzso for zzso zzso
