The risk of port site zzso in zzso surgery for cancer patients is a problem that has yet to be zzso We examined the protective effect of a sodium zzso zzso membrane zzso on tumor cell zzso at zzso zzso zzso 

Four zzso zzso sites were created in nude mice, and the zzso wounds were covered with zzso pieces of zzso The protective effect of zzso on the zzso of zzso (a human gallbladder cancer cell line) at the zzso sites was assessed after 7 zzso In addition, the effects of sodium zzso and zzso on the growth and zzso of zzso were examined in zzso 

zzso significantly decreased the zzso of zzso compared with the control zzso zzso zzso was observed on days 1 and 3, as a sheet of gel that covered the injured zzso and muscle zzso In an invasion zzso using zzso no cells were found to zzso through the gel zzso 

zzso protects zzso wounds by physically covering the injured zzso zzso if zzso were attached to the injured zzso after zzso surgery for cancer patients, it might reduce port site zzso
