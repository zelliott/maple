Our previous studies identified important molecules involved in lung zzso through a comprehensive search for the downstream targets of zzso zzso and these findings suggested that an investigation into the downstream targets of zzso zzso might represent a useful strategy for zzso the common molecular bases of lung zzso Among the downstream targets of zzso zzso a focus was placed on zzso a member of the zzso zzso family, in the present study because zzso modification of DNA or the zzso proteins is known to play an important role in zzso The zzso expression of zzso was examined in surgically zzso primary lung zzso zzso zzso 49 zzso cell zzso one large cell zzso and 6 small cell zzso and potential associations between its expression level and zzso factors were zzso The results showed that zzso expression levels were lower in lung cancer cells than in zzso zzso cells, and were also significantly lower in zzso among the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso expression levels were significantly lower in zzso with zzso canal zzso The restoration of zzso in lung cancer cells losing its expression severely attenuated their growth activity in zzso These results suggest that zzso may be a zzso and its zzso might promote the progression process, especially in lung zzso
