zzso tumor vaccines, consisting of zzso class zzso tumor cells engineered to express zzso class II zzso stimulate zzso zzso T cells to mediate rejection of established, poorly zzso zzso Previous experiments have demonstrated that these vaccines induce immunity by functioning as zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso of the zzso class II accessory zzso zzso chain zzso or deletion of the zzso class II zzso domain abrogates vaccine zzso Recent reports have highlighted the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso To determine whether zzso expression and/or zzso of zzso class II molecules impact vaccine efficacy by altering zzso class II zzso to zzso zzso we examined the zzso raft affinity of zzso class II molecules in mouse zzso B cell zzso and zzso zzso vaccine zzso zzso zzso class II zzso were detected in zzso zzso of both cell zzso Interestingly, expression of zzso in zzso cells or zzso cells blocked the zzso class II interactions with cell surface zzso zzso In both cell types, zzso of either the zzso or zzso decreased the affinity of class II molecules for zzso zzso zzso deletion of both zzso zzso further reduced zzso of class II molecules to zzso zzso zzso these data suggest that zzso of zzso or deletion of the zzso zzso of zzso class II molecules may reduce vaccine efficacy by blocking the zzso association of zzso class II molecules with plasma membrane zzso zzso
