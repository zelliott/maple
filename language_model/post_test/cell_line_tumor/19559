The development of novel mechanical and chemical surface modification treatments to improve the zzso properties of zzso dental implants is nowadays a topic of great zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to zzso the role of surface topography and chemistry of four different surface treatments on titanium by an in zzso human zzso zzso cell line model zzso The surface treatments considered were zzso zzso zzso zzso chemical etched on zzso zzso zzso zzso titanium and zzso chemical zzso on zzso zzso Chemical and physical surface properties were investigated by zzso zzso zzso Thin zzso ray zzso and by zzso zzso The in zzso biological response was zzso using the zzso cell line by zzso zzso tests, cell zzso zzso proliferation activity, alkaline zzso activity and total DNA content in order to show a relationship between zzso response and surface zzso Chemical and physical zzso showed that the considered treatments differently modify the surface zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso Although some differences in alkaline zzso activity were observed in the biological zzso depending on the specific zzso surface zzso the results showed that cells were well responsive on all the tested materials and grew and differentiated with similar proliferation zzso
