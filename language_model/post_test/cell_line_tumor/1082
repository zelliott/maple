To investigate the damages of zzso zzso to zzso and zzso cell zzso 

Use zzso singe cell gel zzso and flow zzso was applied to detect the effects of zzso on cell zzso DNA impairment and cell zzso level in two cell zzso 

zzso had cell toxicity on both cell zzso It caused DNA damages, cell zzso and cell cycle zzso Furthermore, the damage level was zzso to the concentration of zzso The damages were more serious in zzso in every concentration level than that in zzso but no statistic difference between two cell zzso 

zzso could cause DNA damage, zzso and changed cell cycles in both normal and zzso cell lines through no statistical significant difference among them was zzso
