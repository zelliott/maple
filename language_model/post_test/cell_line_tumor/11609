Nuclear factor zzso zzso has been shown to participate in a number of neurological processes by regulating the expression of certain zzso We have previously demonstrated the zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso expression and zzso oxide zzso production may be regulated by zzso zzso via an zzso responsive element within the zzso promoter in zzso zzso zzso is a ubiquitous zzso zzso with intrinsic zzso zzso zzso activity, which is important in the nervous zzso In the present study, we aimed at probing if zzso participated in regulating the zzso expression through the zzso zzso As a result, we found zzso enhanced the zzso protein and zzso levels in human zzso zzso cells by enhancing the binding of zzso to the zzso promoter and zzso zzso zzso Meanwhile, zzso was shown to directly zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso interact with zzso and bind to the zzso responsive element region within the zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate zzso acts as both an zzso and a zzso in regulating zzso zzso zzso which provide some correlations between zzso and zzso in zzso cell, and suggest that some zzso neurological disorders may be partially based on its effect on the zzso zzso
