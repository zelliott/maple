To study the impact of the zzso zzso on the nuclear transport zzso zzso zzso with nuclear location zzso was constructed, zzso cells zzso by the zzso zzso were zzso with the zzso or zzso by zzso zzso The results showed that zzso protein with zzso was expressed in the zzso due to the zzso of nuclear zzso In order to further study the mechanism of the zzso to prevent nuclear zzso was detected by Western zzso after zzso cells were infected with zzso or zzso by zzso zzso The results showed that decreased expression of zzso could be detected after infection with zzso and zzso by zzso zzso This study demonstrates that the zzso of zzso by zzso 2A zzso may be the mechanism of nuclear transport zzso
