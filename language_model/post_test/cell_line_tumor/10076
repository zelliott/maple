Evidence suggests that multiple tumors, including pancreatic zzso display zzso in parameters that are critical for tumor formation, progression and zzso zzso zzso in solid tumors is increasingly providing a plethora of new diagnostic and therapeutic zzso In this study, a particular focus was put on identifying a zzso of stem zzso slow cycling tumor cells in a zzso zzso cell zzso Using a label retention technique a zzso of slow cycling cells zzso was identified and further evaluated in the zzso and zzso cell zzso These slowly cycling cells managed to retain the zzso labeling dye zzso while the bulk of the cells zzso did zzso The zzso population, showed only a partial overlap with the zzso markers zzso zzso and zzso but they survived zzso treatment, and were able to recreate the initial zzso tumor cell zzso zzso exhibited an increased invasive potential as compared with their zzso zzso faster cycling cells zzso They also had increased zzso potential and zzso changes resembling cells that have undergone an zzso to zzso transition zzso Analysis of zzso cells by real time zzso revealed a selective zzso of tell tale components of the zzso zzso as well as a zzso of zzso combined with a shift in crucial components implied in zzso The presented findings offer an expanded zzso understanding that associates tumor initiating potential with cycling speed and zzso in pancreatic cancer cell zzso
