Recent zzso analyses revealed that expression of zzso is zzso in pancreatic zzso The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association of zzso with pancreatic zzso 

We measured zzso zzso expression in various clinical samples related to pancreatic cancer and its precursor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso zzso by quantitative reverse zzso 

zzso of zzso were significantly higher in pancreatic cancer zzso and zzso zzso bulk zzso than in zzso bulk zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso of zzso did not differ between pancreatic cancer and zzso bulk zzso In zzso zzso however, zzso cells zzso expressed significantly higher levels of zzso than did cancer cells zzso zzso The median level of zzso expression was higher in pancreatic zzso zzso cells zzso than in cancer zzso In pancreatic juice zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso juice expressed significantly higher levels of zzso than did chronic zzso juice zzso 

The present data suggest that expression of zzso a putative tumor zzso zzso is increased in the early stage of pancreatic zzso and decreased during subsequent progression to zzso Analysis of the zzso level in pancreatic juice may be an effective tool for screening of patients with high-risk zzso that could progress to pancreatic cancer or detecting zzso pancreatic zzso
