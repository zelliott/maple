Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death zzso zzso of radiation therapy on lung cancer is hindered by many zzso Among these, both cancer zzso side population zzso and main population zzso cells may contribute to zzso and resistance to radiation zzso However, the detailed mechanism responsible for this effect remains zzso 

The SP and zzso cells were obtained from zzso lung zzso cells and analyzed the DNA dye zzso zzso method and flow zzso The levels of zzso and zzso markers were examined by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction, Western zzso and zzso The effects of zzso radiation zzso on the growth and zzso of SP and zzso cells were determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso colony formation, and zzso zzso zzso membrane potential and zzso zzso oxygen species production were measured by flow zzso Finally, the expression of zzso zzso zzso activated zzso and zzso proteins were examined by Western zzso 

zzso decreased zzso increased zzso and zzso damage in zzso but not in SP zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso were zzso while zzso expression was increased in zzso cells following zzso zzso In addition, increased zzso of zzso and zzso were detected after zzso exposure in zzso cells, but not in SP zzso 

Our results show that zzso decreases zzso increases zzso and zzso zzso damage in zzso cells, but not in SP cells, through increased zzso and decreased zzso and zzso protein zzso This protein expression pattern zzso zzso of zzso and zzso This study suggests that zzso exposure targets zzso cells through a zzso zzso zzso However, more work is required to further confirm these results using in zzso zzso zzso More importantly, further studies are warranted to zzso the zzso mechanisms of SP zzso
