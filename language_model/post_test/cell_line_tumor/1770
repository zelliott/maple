zzso zzso zzso zzso is a pivotal zzso regulator of breast cancer physiology and is targeted by zzso zzso Loss of zzso activity or expression is an indication of zzso resistance and is associated with increased risk of tumor recurrence and worse zzso In this study, we sought to investigate whether elements of the tumor zzso namely zzso would impact on zzso and we found that zzso factors caused loss of zzso expression in breast cancer zzso zzso media from zzso caused zzso of several zzso pathways in breast cancer cells of which zzso protein zzso c and zzso protein zzso zzso were essential for loss of zzso zzso Moreover, a prolonged zzso of zzso was zzso The zzso of this zzso cascade resulted in recruitment of zzso signal regulated zzso 2 zzso directly to zzso at the zzso gene locus in a process that was dependent upon zzso and recruitment of the zzso zzso zzso Thus, we identify a novel mechanism for loss of zzso expression in breast cancer cells via zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the cancer cells causing zzso repression of the zzso gene by a direct zzso action of a zzso zzso The findings in this study support an alternative zzso not intrinsic to the tumor cell but derived from the zzso with the tumor zzso that could lead to zzso resistance and might be targeted zzso to prevent loss of zzso expression in breast zzso
