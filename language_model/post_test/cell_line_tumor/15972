zzso zzso leukemia zzso acute zzso leukemia with zzso has a favorable outcome compared with other zzso zzso The zzso background for this difference remains zzso zzso we compared gene expression profiles zzso zzso zzso + zzso of 26 zzso patients with 42 other zzso zzso patients to identify zzso expressed zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was found to be highly expressed in zzso patients, which was confirmed by real-time quantitative zzso chain reaction and Western zzso zzso expression within zzso patients was zzso times greater in zzso zzso zzso zzso versus other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso status investigation showed that high zzso zzso patients with zzso have no promoter zzso whereas all other cases zzso zzso incubation with zzso agent zzso resulted in promoter zzso and increased expression of zzso zzso of zzso by zzso did not affect proliferation or drug zzso In a cohort of 79 zzso zzso cases, we show significant better overall survival for cases with high zzso expression zzso overall survival zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso In conclusion, we identified zzso zzso to be zzso for zzso patients with zzso regulated partially by promoter zzso and resulting in survival zzso
