The requirement for sufficient quantities of starting zzso has limited the ability to evaluate multiple transcripts using reverse zzso chain reaction zzso In this study, we demonstrate the utility of linear zzso amplification for zzso analysis of multiple gene transcripts including a zzso zzso using the zzso as a zzso zzso from the zzso cell line, zzso and the zzso cell line, zzso was extracted and exposed to two rounds of linear zzso zzso using zzso from the zzso amplified zzso zzso and total zzso resulted in the 177 zzso zzso fusion gene product from the zzso cell line, but not from zzso or total zzso from the zzso cell zzso DNA sequencing of the zzso products from total and zzso of zzso cells demonstrated identical sequences corresponding to the zzso fusion zzso zzso of 25 zzso tissue samples, including eight zzso zzso demonstrated zzso zzso of zzso detection between zzso from total zzso and that from zzso Our results show that linear amplification of zzso can enhance starting zzso greater than zzso and can be used for rapid and specific detection of multiplex gene expression from a variety of zzso This method can generate a renewable archive of representative zzso which can be used for retrospective screening of stored samples as well as positive controls for the clinical molecular diagnostic zzso
