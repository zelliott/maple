It is well established that zzso is a potent zzso in cells expressing zzso receptors zzso However, a large body of evidence has demonstrated that the effects of zzso zzso signaling exhibit a zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso at low zzso elicits a zzso signaling zzso to stimulate cell zzso while at high zzso zzso zzso cell zzso The molecular mechanism underlying this paradoxical effect of zzso on cell proliferation remains largely zzso Recently, we reported that zzso a zzso of zzso mediates zzso zzso signaling in zzso breast cancer zzso Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso zzso signaling in zzso and zzso zzso breast cancer zzso We found that zzso zzso at zzso zzso induced the zzso of zzso an event that activates zzso while at 5 zzso failed to induce zzso zzso but induced zzso zzso an event that zzso zzso zzso at 1 zzso but not at 5 zzso also induced zzso of zzso and activated zzso D1 promoter activity through the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso signaling in these zzso Our results thus indicate that in zzso breast cancer cells zzso functions as a switch in zzso zzso zzso signaling through the zzso zzso
