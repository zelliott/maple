The capture of circulating tumor cells zzso from cancer patient blood enables early clinical assessment as well as genetic and pharmacological evaluation of cancer and zzso Although there have been many zzso zzso and zzso techniques developed for zzso rare cancer cells, these techniques are often limited by a capture performance zzso between high efficiency and high zzso We present the characterization of zzso cancer cell capture in a novel hybrid zzso system consisting of zzso zzso zzso in a zzso flow cell that was zzso with a zzso zzso zzso which is highly specific to zzso membrane zzso expressing prostate cancer zzso We measured the positive and negative zzso response of a prostate cancer cell line, zzso as a function of applied electric field frequency, and showed that zzso can control capture performance by promoting or preventing cell interactions with zzso surfaces, depending on the sign and magnitude of the applied zzso force, as well as on the local zzso stress experienced by cells flowing in the zzso This work demonstrates that zzso and zzso techniques can work zzso to improve cell capture performance, and it will aid in the design of future hybrid zzso systems for zzso zzso capture with enhanced zzso
