The presence of increased numbers of zzso zzso is associated with poorer outcome in patients with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We evaluated the role of inflammatory environment on zzso zzso tumor zzso 

zzso zzso from 31 consecutive patients with zzso of the zzso zzso as well as tumor and normal pulmonary tissue zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso blood zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Elisa zzso and zzso studies of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso isolation, reverse transcription, and zzso amplification of zzso and zzso 

zzso peptides were expressed by tumor cells of all the tumor specimens zzso zzso and zzso were also expressed by zzso To better understand the regulation of the zzso production, zzso cell line was cultured alone or with inflammatory zzso zzso zzso both tumor zzso and zzso zzso expression and protein release whereas AM only zzso zzso zzso expression and protein zzso zzso had no zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso and zzso production zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso production zzso by zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso by inflammatory cells, although zzso was also expressed by tumor zzso 

This work emphasizes the role of the host inflammatory response in promoting tumor growth in zzso
