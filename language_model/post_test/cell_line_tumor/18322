Selective zzso zzso zzso have been found to induce zzso and zzso activity in many cancer zzso However, interaction between zzso zzso and other zzso agents remains to be zzso We investigated the interactive effects of a selective zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso on colon cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso in simultaneous and sequential administration zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso in combination with zzso or zzso according to a simultaneous schedule resulted in only an additive zzso however, zzso was achieved in a sequential zzso zzso induction in both cell lines was also significantly increased after sequential treatment with zzso followed by either zzso or zzso compared to that after simultaneous treatment with zzso and either zzso or zzso Our study suggests zzso zzso resulted from administration of zzso and either zzso or zzso zzso but not zzso
