zzso immunity is the first line defense against invading zzso During zzso bacterial infection, the zzso zzso 4 and zzso complex recognize zzso present in the bacterial cell zzso This recognition can be enhanced zzso by zzso However, the beneficial role provided by zzso becomes zzso in the context of zzso and septic zzso An understanding of how zzso functions will therefore benefit treatments targeted at both immune suppression and immune zzso In the present study, we use zzso zzso to address the role of zzso bonds and zzso zzso on zzso A differential impact is observed for the five zzso bonds on zzso zzso with the first two zzso and zzso being zzso the third and fourth zzso and zzso being important, and the last zzso being zzso A functional role is observed for the first zzso bond because the zzso substitution severely reduces the ability of zzso to zzso zzso responsiveness to zzso zzso Two of the four predicted zzso sites, zzso 132 and zzso are actually involved in zzso zzso resulting in zzso in zzso molecular zzso Furthermore, zzso at zzso plays a role in zzso trafficking and upstream and/or downstream zzso zzso When mapped onto the crystal structure of mouse zzso the first two zzso bonds and zzso are in close proximity to the initial beta strands of the zzso rich repeat zzso Thus, zzso bonds and zzso zzso in the initial beta sheets of the inner zzso surface of zzso are crucial for structure and zzso
