We previously reported that sequential injection of zzso zzso and zzso DNA leads to notably reduced inflammatory toxicity and improved zzso in the lung zzso Tan et zzso 2001, zzso zzso 3, zzso The purpose of the current study was to explore the mechanism involved in sequential zzso It was observed that sequential injection resulted in dramatically lower DNA zzso by the liver and higher DNA levels in the lung than the zzso zzso In zzso experiments with zzso cells further showed that sequential addition of zzso and DNA could diminish the cellular zzso of DNA by these zzso The contributions of serum to the enhanced zzso and decreased toxicity were examined by injecting mice with samples of zzso zzso with serum and then DNA zzso zzso and the resulting activities were compared to those obtained with injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso yielded zzso lower zzso levels and over zzso higher zzso than zzso which is consistent with the reported findings with sequential zzso In contrast, zzso resulted in the same zzso levels and comparable zzso with zzso Thus, the results suggest that the primary interaction of serum with zzso is a critical factor contributing to the superior activity and reduced toxicity of sequential zzso Studies on the interaction between mouse serum, zzso and DNA showed that DNA could bind zzso charged zzso complex to form a zzso complex, which has a density similar to that of the zzso complex formed between zzso with zzso Further in zzso tests showed that zzso and zzso were similar in particle size and protein content, but different in protein composition as observed by zzso gel zzso In addition, DNA in zzso was more readily displaced by zzso zzso an zzso zzso than in zzso The above findings suggest that the zzso of zzso protein binding on the particle surface with the sequential injection may contribute to the reduced zzso zzso and zzso induction and that the high ability of DNA release from the particles formed after sequential injection may contribute to the improved lung gene zzso
