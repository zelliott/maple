zzso tissue cells survive and zzso only while anchored to solid zzso zzso transformed cells both survive and zzso following zzso having lost attachment context through unclear zzso zzso is a focal zzso protein that reports cell attachment through a zzso zzso zzso We find that human small cell lung cancer zzso cells and mouse Lewis lung zzso zzso which display aggressive zzso behavior, lack both zzso and zzso zzso and bypass zzso zzso of zzso in these cells restores zzso and provides striking protection from zzso by LLC cells in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in normal zzso cells leads to unrestrained Ras zzso preventing zzso through downstream suppression of zzso but blocking proliferation in a zzso manner, thus mimicking zzso zzso zzso LLC and zzso cells display zzso Ras zzso necessary to bypass zzso which is reversed by zzso of zzso zzso therefore coordinates zzso control of proliferation and zzso sensation, which can be defeated in the evolution of highly zzso tumors by combined loss of both zzso and zzso
