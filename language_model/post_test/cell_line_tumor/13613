zzso resistance poses a serious challenge in cancer zzso To address this problem, we designed and zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso 

zzso activity was evaluated in a variety of zzso including zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso and drug-resistant cancer cell lines, zzso stability in human liver zzso and zzso properties in zzso 

zzso exhibited zzso human zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso growth zzso activity in several zzso and two zzso cancer cell zzso In the zzso cell lines, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso lung zzso zzso was significantly more potent than zzso The zzso stability of zzso in human liver zzso and its zzso properties in rats were better than those of zzso 

Our studies have identified zzso as a novel zzso II inhibitor with superior zzso activity against zzso human cancer cells and more desirable zzso properties than zzso
