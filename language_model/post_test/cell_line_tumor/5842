Patients taking the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso develop skin cancer at a very high zzso Their DNA contains zzso which absorbs ultraviolet A zzso radiation, and their skin is UVA zzso consistent with the formation of DNA zzso Here we demonstrate that UVA zzso of zzso DNA causes DNA zzso zzso In synthetic duplex zzso the zzso zzso zzso can form between closely opposed zzso bases and, in a less zzso reaction, between zzso and normal bases on the opposite zzso In zzso UVA zzso of cultured cells containing zzso DNA also causes zzso formation and zzso the zzso aberrations that are characteristically associated with this type of DNA zzso zzso activates the zzso anemia zzso zzso via zzso of the zzso zzso zzso defective in the zzso zzso or other factors involved in zzso processing, such as zzso and DNA zzso are all hypersensitive to killing by zzso with a significant contribution of zzso zzso to the zzso of this zzso Our findings suggest that zzso skin of zzso treated patients may experience chronic zzso DNA damage that requires constant intervention of the zzso zzso
