Over the last years zzso cell interactions were investigated in numerous zzso zzso strategies for evasion of innate immune response, zzso of cellular protein synthesis and permission of viral zzso and protein production were zzso With quantitative zzso technology, comprehensive studies concerning the impact of viruses on the cellular machinery of their host cells at protein level are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis were used to zzso and zzso determine the dynamic cellular zzso responses of two zzso cell lines to human influenza A virus zzso A cell line used for vaccine production zzso was compared with a human lung zzso cell line zzso as a reference zzso zzso zzso gels of the zzso of zzso and zzso host cells, 16 zzso altered protein spots (at least zzso change in relative zzso zzso were identified for both cell zzso Most significant changes were found for zzso major components of the zzso system, and for zzso zzso zzso key components of the host cell zzso Time series analysis of infection processes allowed the identification of further proteins that are described to be involved in protein zzso signal zzso and zzso zzso Most zzso these proteins are required for supporting functions during influenza viral life cycle or host cell stress zzso zzso zzso profiling of virus infection can provide insights into complexity and dynamics of zzso cell interactions and may accelerate zzso research and support zzso of vaccine manufacturing zzso
