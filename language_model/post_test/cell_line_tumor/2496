zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso zzso zzso are characterized by extensive zzso zzso in zzso this results in poor zzso and impaired drug delivery to the cancer zzso zzso the combined targeting of pancreatic tumor zzso and chemotherapy should enhance response rates, but the negative outcome of a recent phase III clinical trial for the combination of chemotherapy and zzso zzso zzso suggests that other means also need to be zzso Emerging data indicate that elimination of cancer stem cells as the root of the cancer is of pivotal importance for efficient treatment of pancreatic zzso Recently, we demonstrated in a highly relevant zzso mouse model for primary pancreatic zzso that the combination of cancer stem zzso strategies in combination with a zzso agent, such as a zzso zzso inhibitor and chemotherapy, results in significantly enhanced long-term and zzso zzso In the present study, we demonstrate mechanistically that zzso pancreatic zzso cells are an important component of the tumor zzso for creating a zzso niche for pancreatic cancer stem zzso zzso of the embryonic zzso zzso by pancreatic zzso cells promoted in zzso sphere formation and zzso of pancreatic cancer stem cells in an zzso zzso These data imply that the pancreatic cancer stem cell zzso is promoted by zzso zzso signaling at the zzso zzso zzso targeting the tumor zzso is not only able to improve drug delivery but, even more importantly, destroys the cancer stem cell niche and, therefore, should be an integral part of cancer stem zzso treatment zzso
