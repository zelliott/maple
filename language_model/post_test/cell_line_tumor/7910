It is increasingly clear that zzso zzso zzso has a distinct zzso zzso expression profile that is involved in zzso however, little is known about how functional zzso zzso the zzso of zzso B virus zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that the levels of zzso zzso are dramatically increased in zzso zzso of both zzso transgenic mice and zzso zzso Moreover, we show that zzso of this zzso is transcribed by nuclear factor zzso B zzso and favors liver tumor cell invasive and zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso shows that high levels of zzso can significantly promote zzso zzso in an zzso nude mouse zzso An in zzso study that used zzso transgenic mice also showed that local liver zzso and distant lung zzso are significantly inhibited by blocking zzso Additionally, zzso type III domain containing zzso zzso which regulates cell zzso was identified as the direct and functional target of zzso both in zzso and in zzso 

zzso of zzso expression transcribed by zzso in zzso promotes cancer cell zzso and tumor zzso by repression of zzso zzso The present study provides a better understanding of the specificity of the biological behavior and thus may be helpful in developing an effective treatment against zzso
