We previously reported that a zzso X zzso zzso zzso prevented and overcame acquired drug resistance in advanced breast cancer and zzso cell lung zzso The present study was to evaluate the effect of zzso on the development of zzso resistance in advanced prostate zzso 

Human prostate cancer cells zzso were repeatedly treated in culture with zzso zzso or zzso with or without zzso for 3 zzso zzso cells were isolated and characterized for their drug zzso 

Compared to parental cells, cells treated with a single therapeutic agent was resistant to the therapeutic agent, whereas cells treated with the combination remained zzso zzso with acquired drug resistance showed increased sensitivity to the zzso agent when treated with the zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that treatment with zzso decreased the rate of spontaneous development of drug zzso These in zzso findings were further confirmed in the zzso zzso zzso 

Our results suggest a role of zzso in combination with zzso agents in prevention and overcoming acquired drug resistance in advanced prostate zzso
