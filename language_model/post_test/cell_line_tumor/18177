The zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso mediates the toxicity of zzso and related zzso Other chemicals also bind the zzso to elicit either zzso or zzso zzso Here we used zzso zzso within the zzso binding domain of zzso zzso to probe for specific zzso that might interact zzso with the zzso zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso element zzso zzso and zzso activity were observed for several point zzso One zzso zzso changed the response to zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso is the zzso found in the guinea pig zzso towards which zzso has partial zzso activity in contrast to its strong zzso activity in zzso A similar reversal of response to zzso was observed in zzso zzso in which the zzso region of zzso was replaced with the guinea pig zzso zzso These data demonstrate that different zzso acids can be important in binding of different zzso zzso and can mediate distinct zzso The ultimate response of the zzso also depends on how other portions of the zzso protein are functionally coupled to the initial zzso binding zzso
