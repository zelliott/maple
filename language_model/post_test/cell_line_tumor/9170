zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein that regulates zzso processes that overlap with those regulated by zzso zzso 1 zzso Here we report the possible role of zzso zzso by zzso in zzso signaling and zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso decreased the levels of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso sites on zzso to zzso reduced cell zzso and cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses of human cells revealed that zzso zzso predominantly in the zzso but also resides in the zzso zzso of zzso cells with point zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso altered zzso zzso Selective depletion of zzso dramatically increased the nuclear and focal point zzso of zzso further demonstrating a role for zzso in zzso zzso We also identified functional nuclear zzso sequence and nuclear export sequence motifs in zzso delineated an apparently integral role for zzso in maintaining normal nuclear integrity, and established that zzso interacts with the regulatory region of the zzso gene zzso to zzso zzso its zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso shuttling between the cell nucleus and zzso and interacts with zzso zzso
