We have been investigating the functional display of zzso membrane protein such as zzso or zzso coupled zzso on the zzso zzso zzso We tested the use of a viral envelope protein zzso transgenic mouse for the direct zzso of these membrane proteins displayed on zzso The zzso transgenic mice showed only a weak response to virus compared to wild type zzso zzso zzso zzso transgenic mice with the zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso we obtained 47 zzso zzso zzso These zzso were specific to the zzso on the pancreatic cancer cells zzso by zzso analysis and exhibited zzso cellular zzso or zzso zzso to zzso We also generated 7 zzso by zzso zzso transgenic mice on a zzso background with the zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso together with partially zzso zzso These zzso possessed specific binding to zzso in zzso cells on zzso analysis, and exhibited zzso activities for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso This method provides a powerful tool for the generation of zzso zzso against membrane zzso
