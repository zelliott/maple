zzso extend zzso from the cell body before formation of the polarized processes of an zzso and zzso zzso outgrowth involves zzso of the zzso zzso which are initially regulated by small zzso of the zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso which is controlled by zzso zzso zzso and zzso is activated following zzso extension in mouse zzso zzso cells as a zzso The extension is inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and the small zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso B, the inhibitor for zzso zzso Additionally, zzso the zzso focal zzso zzso is zzso at zzso 178 by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso construct harboring the zzso zzso zzso into cells zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest the novel role of the zzso signaling cascade in zzso extension and indicate that the downstream target zzso may be one of the zzso points of various signaling pathways underlying zzso zzso
