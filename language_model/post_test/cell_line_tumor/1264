Recent reports that bone zzso zzso is increased in multiple myeloma prompted us to examine plasma zzso of zzso growth factors and to zzso their clinical and biological zzso In 45 cases including 36 cases of multiple myeloma and 9 cases of zzso zzso of zzso significance zzso plasma zzso of basic zzso growth factor zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso were zzso zzso was significantly elevated in 25 out of 45 zzso of the patients with multiple myeloma compared with control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The 25 cases were all active multiple zzso and none of the zzso myeloma and zzso patients showed a high zzso zzso zzso level was also elevated in 26 out of 45 patients zzso compared with control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso for zzso zzso concentration was high in 20 active zzso but also in one zzso myeloma and five zzso zzso of zzso level was associated with zzso level, anemia and bone zzso plasma cell percentage, which represent disease zzso Interestingly, none of five zzso type zzso including four clinically active cases, revealed a high plasma zzso level, while all of them showed a high zzso zzso In all five responders, the plasma zzso levels were significantly decreased after zzso zzso was zzso detected in the bone zzso myeloma cells of the patients with high plasma zzso zzso We conclude that plasma concentration of zzso can be a useful indicator of disease zzso
