In this study, indirect zzso labeling was used to examine the cellular dynamic distribution of zzso zzso zzso at zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso was observed beginning at zzso at zzso Upon progression of zzso zzso signal was enhanced in the central region of the zzso plate and maintained till zzso at zzso During zzso the fluorescent signal of zzso zzso zzso disappears from zzso but the signal appears again at the zzso during zzso which suggests that the modified zzso may take part in the formation of the zzso and play a crucial role in zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to confirm that zzso zzso zzso is specifically associated with zzso DNA at zzso to zzso which is zzso with the results observed by zzso In conclusion, there was a precise spatial and zzso correlation between zzso zzso of zzso and stages of zzso zzso The timing of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso were similar to that reported for zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso zzso localized at zzso during zzso which was different from the zzso zzso zzso localized at zzso regions and zzso zzso zzso localized along the zzso zzso The results suggest that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso may play a specific role which was different from zzso and zzso zzso in zzso
