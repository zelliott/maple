We report on the potential DNA binding modes and spectral characteristics of the zzso far red fluorescent DNA zzso zzso in solution and bound within intact zzso Our aim was to determine the constraints for its use in flow zzso and zzso 

zzso characteristics and quantum yields were determined by zzso zzso binding to nuclear DNA was analyzed using zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso profiling by flow zzso and spectral zzso laser scanning zzso of the complex zzso zzso zzso Cell cycle profiling zzso an zzso B1 reporter as an independent marker of cell zzso zzso modeling was used to explore the modes of DNA zzso 

zzso showed a low quantum yield in solution and a spectral shift upon DNA zzso but no significant zzso zzso zzso caused a reduction in the zzso intensity of zzso zzso in live cells zzso with the zzso excitable zzso consistent with molecular modeling that suggests AT preference and an engagement of the minor zzso In zzso spectral analysis of zzso demonstrated shifts to longer zzso upon binding with zzso Analysis of spectral windows of the dual zzso zzso at zzso and zzso zzso in cells showed that cell cycle compartment recognition was independent of the far zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The study provides new clues to modes of DNA binding of the modified zzso zzso in zzso and its AT zzso zzso The combination of low quantum yield but high DNA affinity explains the favorable zzso profile of zzso zzso The robust nature of cell cycle reporting using zzso even when restricted spectral windows are selected, zzso the analysis of encroaching spectral emissions from other fluorescent reporters, including zzso zzso
