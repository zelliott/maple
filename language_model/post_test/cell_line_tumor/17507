zzso tumor zzso 2 zzso expression is associated with increased zzso tumor invasion and promotion of tumor cell resistance to zzso The zzso by which zzso exerts its zzso effects are not completely understood but may be due to an imbalance of zzso and zzso gene zzso To analyze zzso gene expression and zzso we created cell lines zzso expressing zzso zzso in sense and zzso zzso Whereas zzso sense cells have significantly heightened resistance to radiation and drug-induced zzso zzso zzso cells are highly sensitive to zzso zzso We found that the expression of the zzso protein zzso correlated positively with zzso zzso A zzso zzso of zzso zzso led to its stabilization in zzso zzso cells, and this effect was zzso by zzso zzso treatment of parental tumor zzso In contrast to previous studies in other cell types, in zzso cell lung cancer cells zzso was expressed in a cell zzso zzso When established in zzso mice in zzso zzso zzso tumors had significantly decreased zzso levels while zzso zzso tumors demonstrated elevated levels compared with zzso In zzso with these findings, zzso and zzso were frequently zzso and zzso in human lung zzso in zzso
