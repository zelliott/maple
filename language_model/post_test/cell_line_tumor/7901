A facile method for the construction of an zzso which displays targeting zzso such as zzso fragments, with a high density is zzso For this purpose, we zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso By the use of this zzso zzso targeting the specific cell can be displayed on the surface of the drug carrier with a high zzso In this study, we display zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso on zzso zzso zzso which can form zzso with zzso zzso zzso analysis of the binding to the zzso domain of zzso show the zzso displaying a high density of zzso binds to the target more strongly compared to the zzso displaying zzso at a low zzso The increased density of zzso zzso displayed on the gene carrier contributes to the improved zzso zzso This approach can be applied to other drug delivery systems, including zzso zzso and so zzso
