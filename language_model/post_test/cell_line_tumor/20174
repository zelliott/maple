Currently, there is a serious absence of zzso attractive small molecules that mitigate the lethal effects of an accidental or intentional public exposure to toxic doses of zzso zzso Moreover, cellular systems that emulate the zzso relevant cell populations and that are suitable for zzso screening have not been zzso zzso we examined two human zzso zzso zzso cell lines for use in an unbiased zzso small interfering zzso zzso zzso to identify proteins with the potential of being drug targets for the protection of human cell populations against clinically relevant zzso radiation doses that cause acute radiation zzso Of the two human cell lines tested, zzso cells had optimal growth characteristics in a zzso well format, exhibited radiation sensitivity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso comparable to the zzso of stem cell populations associated with human death within 30 days after zzso zzso Moreover, they zzso zzso after 4 zzso zzso enabling zzso library zzso zzso we used the human zzso cell line for the radiation zzso study with a zzso library that silenced zzso genes known or hypothesized to be potential therapeutic zzso zzso zzso zzso we identified 113 zzso with potential zzso properties, which were further refined to 29 zzso with zzso regulatory zzso 1 zzso being among the highest confidence candidate gene zzso Colony formation zzso revealed radiation zzso when the zzso inhibitor zzso was given after zzso of zzso zzso 3 cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the vehicle control treated cells compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso treated cells, P zzso zzso zzso and two other zzso zzso zzso 828 and zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Treatment of mice with a single zzso zzso dose of 30 zzso at 10 zzso 4, or 24 h after zzso zzso dose of zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso This study documents that an unbiased zzso zzso can identify new zzso signaling zzso and zzso as radiation zzso and zzso the zzso zzso in the human radiation zzso
