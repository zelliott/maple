zzso are key zzso for zzso and zzso DNA zzso content can regulate cancer zzso zzso in zzso zzso and deletions have been reported in zzso however, a detailed investigation of zzso content in cancer cells has not yet been zzso 

zzso real-time zzso and improved extraction method were established to investigate the zzso content in a single prostate zzso 

The zzso of zzso content was demonstrated between the clones of prostate cancer cell line zzso and individual cells in each zzso To investigate whether large zzso zzso of zzso content is associated with cancer initiation and/or zzso we first compared zzso an zzso normal prostate zzso cell line, with zzso transformed from prostate cancer cells derived from the same zzso We found an enhanced zzso zzso of zzso content in zzso Then, we investigated zzso content in individual cells in laser zzso cancer and adjacent normal cells from prostate cancer tissue specimens using quantitative real-time zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso content per cell follows a higher skewed distribution in cancer cells as compared in normal zzso We also observed that zzso content was increased in seven of nine zzso of prostate zzso compared to normal prostate zzso 

These results indicate that prostate zzso may involve zzso of zzso zzso
