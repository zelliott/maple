Acute stimulation of the zzso for the zzso growth zzso factor Met leads to zzso zzso and zzso through the zzso degradation zzso We have determined that the Met zzso zzso multiple zzso as opposed to the zzso of zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso of zzso in zzso cells enhances the rate of Met zzso degradation, in contrast to a point zzso of zzso zzso that cannot form zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, an enhancement of Met degradation is also seen under conditions where the zzso is inhibited by zzso We propose that this reflects zzso sorting of Met, as the zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso also restores zzso growth zzso zzso of the zzso coat protein zzso from zzso by zzso Our data indicate a requirement for zzso zzso for Met zzso trafficking independent of its zzso function of targeting for zzso zzso
