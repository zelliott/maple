zzso zzso acid zzso the only clinically available zzso agent, has potential for the zzso of breast zzso Given the zzso nature of this zzso a rational use of zzso and derivatives zzso in the clinic requires the identification of patients that would benefit from zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso of the human zzso breast zzso show zzso of zzso acid zzso alpha zzso zzso the zzso acid zzso zzso This represents a novel zzso of breast cancer characterized by remarkable sensitivity to zzso and zzso zzso regardless of zzso to the zzso zzso a known zzso of zzso zzso In zzso cellular models showing zzso of zzso and zzso simultaneous targeting of the corresponding gene products with combinations of zzso and zzso causes synergistic growth zzso zzso and zzso This provides zzso that zzso of zzso and zzso can be exploited for the zzso and targeted therapy of a novel zzso of breast cancer patients, with an approach characterized by tumor cell selectivity and low predicted zzso The available cellular models were exploited to define the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso activity of combinations between zzso and zzso Global gene expression and functional approaches provide evidence for three components of the zzso responses triggered by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein by zzso zzso the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso signals, controlling the levels of zzso proteins like the zzso factor, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso mediates other components of the zzso process set in motion by simultaneous targeting of zzso and zzso
