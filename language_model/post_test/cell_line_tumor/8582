zzso is an effective zzso agent in cancer zzso however, one of its most common zzso is hypersensitivity due to zzso used for water zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso that consists only of zzso drug in zzso Our objective was to examine the effect of zzso zzso on prostate cancer cells derived from zzso prostate cancer in men and dogs, as companion dogs represent a unique naturally occurring model of zzso prostate zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso would be effective in affecting cell zzso colony forming ability, zzso and induction of structural changes to the zzso of prostate cancer zzso 

Human zzso and canine zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso and colony forming zzso were analyzed and compared in the presence of both zzso zzso structure was examined by zzso zzso following incubation with zzso 

zzso zzso was as effective as standard zzso in decreasing cell zzso decreasing colony forming ability, and inducing zzso in human and canine prostate cancer cells in a zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso confirmed the zzso target of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is as effective as zzso in decreasing cell zzso initiating zzso decreasing cell survival, and causing rigidity of zzso in both human and canine zzso prostate zzso This represents an attractive area for further study, using the companion dog as a model for disease in zzso
