zzso melanoma is an increasing disease in China, and its molecular mechanisms of development and progression are zzso The objective of this study was to investigate the expression of Ras zzso 1 zzso protein and its clinical significance in human zzso zzso was performed to detect the expression of zzso in 81 melanoma patients with a zzso zzso The prognosis of the patients, classified by the zzso features and zzso zzso was assessed by zzso zzso zzso levels were then analyzed with overall survival zzso zzso survival zzso and recurrence-free survival zzso in the zzso The biological function was determined by proliferation zzso flow zzso analysis through knocking down of zzso in melanoma cells zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected by western zzso or zzso zzso Data showed that zzso was zzso in melanoma zzso zzso zzso expression was observed in zzso % (40 of 81 zzso associated with thickness grade zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Two distinguished zzso were zzso by zzso levels within this set comparing zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso level was revealed as the significant independent zzso factor for death and progression but a weak contribution for zzso Moreover, knock down of zzso expression in zzso cells, suppressed cell proliferation and induced zzso through zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression could be a potential zzso predictor for the melanoma patients and provide a potential target therapy for melanoma zzso
