The vitamin D zzso zzso is a nuclear zzso for the active form of vitamin zzso and mediates regulation of calcium zzso zzso zzso such as zzso acid, have been identified as additional zzso zzso zzso The in zzso role of zzso in zzso acid metabolism has not been zzso We investigated potential effects of in zzso zzso zzso on zzso acid metabolism by feeding mice zzso zzso zzso and then treating them with zzso zzso zzso We administered zzso via zzso to mice fed zzso supplemented with zzso zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso or zzso acid zzso and examined liver and plasma zzso acid composition with gas zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment reduced zzso zzso acids in mice fed zzso and zzso zzso but was less effective in mice fed zzso supplemented with zzso or zzso zzso administration also decreased plasma zzso acids in mice fed zzso zzso such as zzso The effect of zzso administration in decreasing liver zzso acid composition was observed in mice under zzso conditions and was associated with increased urinary zzso and increased expression of zzso acid zzso such as zzso zzso zzso protein zzso These findings indicate that pharmacological zzso of zzso enhances metabolism of zzso zzso especially urinary zzso The results confirm that zzso acts a regulator of zzso acid metabolism in zzso
