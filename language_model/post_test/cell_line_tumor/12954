A series of six lung cancer cell lines of different cell origin (including small cell and zzso were characterized zzso and the role of a series of protein candidates previously implicated in drug resistance were zzso 

These include zzso and cell growth zzso zzso zzso zzso real-time zzso and western zzso 

No correlation was found with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels and zzso nor zzso zzso but an association was observed with levels of the zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso previously implicated in the development of platinum zzso The relationship appeared to hold true for those cell lines derived from lung zzso primary tumors but not for the zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso were prepared with the cell line exhibiting the greatest resistance to zzso zzso resulting in marked decreases in the zzso zzso as assessed by real-time zzso western zzso and zzso zzso The zzso knockout was far more sensitive to zzso than the zzso zzso 

Thus, sensitivity to zzso appeared to be associated with zzso levels in zzso lung cancer cell lines with the zzso zzso producing the greatest zzso zzso in keeping with zzso experiments with zzso and other cell zzso
