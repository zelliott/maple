zzso zzso zzso is a rare zzso disorder characterized by zzso and limb zzso Over 35 separate zzso in human zzso zzso causing zzso have been zzso Several zzso are also associated with central nervous system involvement, including zzso changes detected by magnetic resonance zzso As zzso is abundantly expressed in zzso we hypothesized that the zzso zzso proteins that produce neurological dysfunction have abnormal functional characteristics in zzso To understand how zzso zzso affect zzso signaling in cells of zzso origin, we conducted studies in rat zzso zzso cells, a zzso zzso cell line that expresses low levels of zzso We generated stable cell lines expressing enhanced yellow fluorescent protein zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso and six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Of these, zzso zzso and zzso are associated with neurological zzso We found that all zzso could be detected on the cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso formed zzso plaques representing gap zzso although the relative ability to form plaques was decreased in these zzso compared with the wild zzso zzso formed dramatically reduced numbers of zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that all zzso were associated with reduced zzso zzso function compared with wild zzso zzso experiments performed on the same stable cell lines showed reduced gap zzso dye transfer in all zzso compared with the wild zzso These studies demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso result in zzso zzso zzso and gap junction functions in a zzso cell line regardless of whether the particular zzso is associated with neurological zzso
