To explore whether zzso zzso can enhance drug sensitivity of resistant zzso leukemia cell lines through zzso of zzso and zzso 

zzso and zzso cells were subjected to different treatments and thereafter an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso flow zzso western zzso and real-time zzso were used to determine zzso zzso status and expression of zzso zzso and their target zzso 

zzso or zzso zzso was enhanced when zzso agents were used in combination with zzso When combined with zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression at protein and zzso zzso Genes downstream of zzso for example, zzso zzso and zzso as well as target genes of zzso for example, zzso zzso and zzso are also zzso at the zzso zzso 

zzso is able to enhance drug sensitivity of resistant zzso leukemia cell lines through zzso of zzso and zzso
