The zzso zzso factor is crucial for regulating the cellular defense against various zzso However, relationship between host zzso and cancer zzso remains zzso To address this issue, we examined zzso of zzso mice to pulmonary cancer zzso following zzso of the mouse Lewis lung zzso zzso cell zzso zzso mice zzso exhibited a higher number of pulmonary zzso zzso than zzso mice zzso The lung and bone zzso zzso of zzso zzso mice contained increased numbers of inflammatory cells, including zzso zzso cells zzso a potent population of zzso zzso zzso can zzso zzso zzso immunity through modification of the zzso zzso complex exploiting zzso oxygen species zzso zzso of zzso mice retained elevated levels of zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso transplantation experiments revealed functional zzso in the zzso and immune systems of zzso zzso zzso recipient mice with zzso zzso cells showed increased levels of lung zzso after cancer cell zzso These mice exhibited high-level zzso of zzso in zzso which showed very good coincidence to the decrease of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso mice harboring high-level zzso expression displayed increased resistance against the cancer cell zzso to the zzso accompanied by a decrease in zzso in the zzso zzso Our results thus reveal a novel function for zzso in the prevention of cancer zzso presumably by its ability to preserve the zzso balance in the zzso and immune zzso
