zzso acid zzso is highly expressed in many human zzso including zzso zzso and is critical for cellular zzso zzso migration and tumor zzso The key zzso responsible for zzso synthesis is zzso zzso zzso Using quantitative zzso we zzso studied zzso expression in 39 zzso tumors and 8 cell lines and zzso examined its potential clinical utility as an early response marker in the bone zzso of the entire cohort of 136 high-risk zzso patients treated with an zzso protocol utilizing zzso zzso zzso and zzso Based on the zzso of 24 normal zzso and peripheral blood samples, a zzso zzso transcript value below the mean + zzso was defined as zzso zzso of this zzso was 1 zzso cell in zzso normal zzso zzso zzso expression was high among zzso tumors of all zzso as well as zzso cell lines of different zzso zzso for early zzso months from protocol zzso zzso response by zzso Cox model indicated that zzso marker status zzso versus zzso was strongly associated with both zzso and overall survival zzso zzso zzso for zzso Similarly, the zzso transcript level of zzso zzso was also highly zzso of outcome zzso p zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso has potential clinical utility as a molecular marker of zzso zzso
