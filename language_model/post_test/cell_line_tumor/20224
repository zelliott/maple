zzso zzso have been identified as zzso of zzso zzso zzso and as orally active, zzso and safe zzso zzso In this article, we focus on the direct zzso activity of the zzso We discovered that zzso also inhibit zzso zzso zzso especially the IX and zzso zzso identified as cancer promoting zzso Thus, zzso can be regarded as novel nontoxic drug candidates for tumor zzso targeted chemotherapy acting by two synergistic mechanisms, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have also demonstrated that the zzso zzso acid is unable to cross the cell membrane and thus limited to interact with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso Finally, applying zzso against cancer cells in hypoxic conditions resulted in the dose dependent release of zzso zzso confirming the direct interaction of the zzso with the cancer related zzso zzso and zzso and thereby promoting cellular zzso
