zzso are embryonic territories arising from the transient zzso of the zzso Their identity is specified by zzso genes from zzso groups zzso zzso is the only zzso gene to be expressed in the second zzso and the regulatory cues leading to this zzso expression have been poorly zzso A zzso DNA zzso overlapping with the 3' end of zzso was previously shown to specifically direct the expression of a reporter gene in the second zzso and the zzso zzso of mouse zzso Here, we report that this zzso region is activated in zzso by zzso and that this zzso is strictly dependent on a short zzso sequence matching the consensus for zzso recognition zzso
