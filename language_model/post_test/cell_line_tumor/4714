The family of statins includes zzso zzso of the zzso zzso that are potent regulators of cholesterol zzso In addition to their cholesterol-lowering effects, statins inhibit cell proliferation and promote zzso of zzso cells in zzso but their potential therapeutic roles in the treatment of zzso remain to be zzso We examined the effects of statins on the growth and differentiation of acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be potent zzso of cell differentiation and zzso of the zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso cell zzso Such effects correlated with zzso of the small zzso zzso and downstream engagement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, whose function was found to be essential for the generation of zzso zzso zzso different statins were found to enhance zzso acid zzso differentiation of zzso blasts and reverse resistance to the zzso effects of zzso In addition, zzso exhibited zzso properties on primary bone zzso zzso zzso from patients with zzso and enhanced the zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso colony zzso Altogether, these studies establish that statins exhibit potent zzso properties in zzso and raise the possibility that combinations of statins with zzso may be an effective approach to overcome the development of zzso resistance by the zzso zzso
