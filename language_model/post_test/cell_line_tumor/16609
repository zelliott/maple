zzso zzso is one of the ingredients of zzso zzso which have been used in Chinese medicine for a long zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso human zzso cancer cells in zzso and the mechanisms through which it exerts its zzso zzso Cell zzso analysis was performed using a zzso zzso The percentage of viable cells, cell cycle distribution, zzso phase zzso zzso oxygen species zzso production and the levels of zzso membrane potential zzso were analyzed by flow zzso DNA zzso and damage were determined by zzso zzso and comet zzso zzso protein level changes in zzso zzso cells following exposure to zzso were zzso measured and determined by western zzso Analysis of protein zzso was conducted by zzso and zzso laser zzso The results indicated that zzso promoted zzso effects, including the induction of cell zzso changes and the decrease in the percentage of zzso the induction of zzso arrest as well as zzso phase zzso in zzso zzso zzso The activities of zzso and -9 were zzso following zzso zzso Western zzso indicated that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Bid, zzso zzso zzso zzso and -9 that led to the induction of zzso through the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso induced zzso and zzso G that were released from zzso to induce zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso triggers zzso in zzso zzso human zzso cancer cells via the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso -9 and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso may be useful for developing new therapeutic regimens for the treatment of zzso zzso
