zzso is the most advanced zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor in phase III studies and has demonstrated a great deal of promise in decreasing zzso C virus zzso zzso in infected zzso In an attempt to further zzso the mechanism of action of zzso zzso zzso resistant to the drug were zzso Interestingly, zzso constantly arose in domain II of zzso To demonstrate that these zzso are responsible for drug resistance, they were reintroduced into the parental zzso zzso and the resulting zzso viruses were tested for replication in the presence of zzso or in the absence of the zzso target, zzso We also examined the effect of the zzso on zzso binding to itself zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso did not affect any of these zzso Moreover, the zzso did not preserve zzso interactions from zzso zzso zzso zzso alone render zzso only slightly resistant to zzso In sharp contrast, when multiple zzso zzso are combined, significant resistance was zzso The introduction of multiple zzso in zzso significantly restored viral replication in zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the combination of zzso zzso renders zzso resistant to all classes of zzso zzso This study suggests that a combination of multiple zzso in domain II of zzso rather than a single zzso is required to render zzso significantly and universally resistant to zzso zzso This in accordance with in zzso data that suggest that zzso is associated with a low potential for development of viral zzso
