The ability to isolate and accurately position single cells in three dimensions is becoming increasingly important in many areas of biological zzso The authors describe the design, theoretical zzso and testing of a novel zzso zzso zzso for picking out and zzso single target zzso The device is constructed using facilities available in most zzso laboratories, without the requirement of sophisticated and expensive zzso technology, and offers improved practical features over previously reported zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso has been tested using zzso zzso human zzso cells, with visual identification of the target cells being aided by zzso the incorporated gene product with a green fluorescent zzso
