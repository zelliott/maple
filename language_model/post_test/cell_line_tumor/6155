The aim of this work was to investigate the zzso zzso effects of natural compound zzso E on the human skin cancer melanoma zzso zzso zzso E was isolated from zzso zzso and demonstrated zzso in the zzso zzso at concentration ranges from 0 to 100 zzso at 24 zzso zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso analyses were used to evaluate zzso distribution and found that zzso E caused DNA damage in the zzso phase with a zzso manner after 24 h of zzso According to the western zzso result, zzso cells with the increase of zzso zzso proteins induced related zzso zzso zzso E also showed zzso activities of zzso cells on the zzso zzso Finally, zzso E demonstrated minor zzso to normal human skin cells zzso zzso and zzso therefore, it is a potential zzso agent against skin zzso
