The fluorinated zzso analogue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits selective and potent zzso activity, and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recently entered Phase I clinical trials in the United zzso Only cancer cells sensitive to the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso this drug candidate from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell cycle arrest, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso and is zzso into zzso zzso species that can zzso bind to DNA and form zzso in sensitive zzso zzso but not in resistant zzso zzso breast cancer zzso 

In this present study, we investigated additional zzso effects of zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, we sought to determine if cells deficient in the zzso zzso D zzso a gene critical in DNA repair, would show greater sensitivity to the zzso effects of zzso zzso than those zzso with zzso 

zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso induced zzso breaks and zzso zzso in sensitive zzso zzso In contrast, we detected no zzso breaks or zzso strand breaks typically associated with zzso I zzso or zzso II zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso was unable to trap zzso or zzso zzso complexes in zzso zzso zzso zzso induced cell cycle arrest in zzso cells following DNA damage after brief zzso zzso deficient in the zzso zzso repair zzso zzso group D zzso gene displayed sensitivity to zzso zzso while cells zzso with zzso displayed resistance to zzso zzso 

These data suggest that the zzso activity of zzso zzso depends upon targets other than zzso or zzso and on the ability of this zzso to form zzso breaks and zzso zzso in cancer zzso
