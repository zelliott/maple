In this work, we developed zzso zzso sized zzso zzso loaded zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso chemistry approach to investigate and determine its zzso and zzso activity against zzso zzso The zzso zzso were prepared by zzso zzso The prepared zzso zzso were well characterized by zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the in zzso zzso was tested on zzso and zzso cells which showed that they are completely zzso zzso zzso showed better toxicity to the bacterial strains when compared to previous study with other zzso using serial dilution zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed cellular zzso on both zzso and zzso cells without zzso their cellular zzso These studies showed that the zzso zzso could be used for various applications in biomedical zzso
