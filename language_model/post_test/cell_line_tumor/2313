We have recently proposed a new zzso model for understanding the Warburg effect in tumor zzso In this model, zzso zzso cells produce zzso fuels zzso and zzso zzso that are then transferred to zzso zzso cancer cells, driving zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso fuels anabolic tumor growth via energy zzso We have termed this new cancer paradigm the zzso Warburg zzso because zzso cells undergo zzso zzso rather than tumor zzso To assess whether this mechanism also applies during cancer cell zzso we analyzed the zzso status of breast cancer zzso zzso zzso by employing a series of zzso protein zzso For this purpose, we used zzso to identify zzso zzso Similarly, we used TO zzso and zzso zzso as markers of zzso mass and zzso activity, zzso zzso with the zzso Warburg zzso our results indicate that zzso breast cancer cells amplify zzso zzso metabolism zzso and that adjacent zzso cells are zzso and lack zzso zzso zzso zzso cells included zzso zzso zzso and inflammatory zzso Double labeling experiments with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso markers directly shows that at least two different zzso compartments zzso zzso within primary tumors and their zzso Since zzso immune cells appeared zzso this observation may also explain how inflammation literally zzso tumor progression and zzso zzso by zzso zzso metabolism in cancer zzso Finally, zzso and TO zzso zzso cancer cells were rarely observed, indicating that the conventional zzso zzso does not frequently occur in zzso zzso zzso zzso
