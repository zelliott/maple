zzso are zzso zzso zzso that simultaneously zzso the expression of multiple genes zzso by binding to the zzso of target zzso Here we used zzso methods to predict zzso relevant in breast cancer zzso Specifically, we applied different zzso target prediction zzso to various groups of zzso expressed zzso genes obtained from four breast cancer zzso Six potential candidates were identified, among them zzso previously described to be highly expressed in the tumor zzso and known to be actively transferred into breast cancer zzso To investigate the function of zzso in zzso and to define its molecular zzso we zzso zzso in breast cancer cells in a transient or stable zzso zzso we zzso zzso in mouse embryonic zzso or zzso cells and used their zzso medium to treat tumor zzso With both approaches, we obtained elevated levels of zzso in tumor cells and observed decreased migration, increased cell death in zzso conditions and zzso sensitivity to chemotherapy but no effect on zzso and zzso The analysis of zzso predicted targets revealed enrichment in cell death and zzso genes and in pathways frequently altered in breast zzso Among these zzso we showed that protein levels for zzso zzso and zzso were modulated by zzso In addition, we proved that zzso is a direct zzso target and highlighted a possible correlation between zzso and zzso in migration and chemotherapy zzso Our investigation revealed that a zzso analysis of cancer gene expression zzso can be a relevant tool to identify zzso involved in cancer progression and that zzso has a prominent role in breast zzso that could potentially be exploited zzso
