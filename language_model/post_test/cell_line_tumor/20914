zzso of zzso signaling is implicated in zzso breast zzso However, the mechanisms that cause zzso zzso signaling and promote breast zzso cell invasion remain poorly zzso One zzso leading to zzso zzso that remains unexplored in breast zzso cell invasion involves zzso by zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso activated by zzso zzso is zzso in invasive breast zzso zzso is also proposed to function in breast cancer invasion and zzso but how zzso contributes to these processes is not zzso In this study, we report that zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso persistent zzso of zzso and zzso in invasive breast zzso but not in normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso leads to prolonged zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling and promotes breast zzso cell zzso We also show that zzso signaling through zzso and zzso activity is critical for zzso zzso and cellular zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso expression in invasive breast zzso is essential for tumor growth in zzso assessed by zzso fat pad zzso These studies reveal a critical role for zzso a zzso activated by zzso zzso in zzso of zzso signaling that promotes breast zzso cell zzso
