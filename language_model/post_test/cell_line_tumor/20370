The common genes responsible for the characteristics of primary cultured invasive zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso cultured zzso cells from three patients were separated by zzso invasion into parent and invasive zzso Whole human zzso zzso zzso was applied to detect the zzso expressed genes in invasive zzso A purchased zzso cell line zzso zzso was studied for zzso Forty genes were consistently zzso and 14 genes were consistently zzso among primary cultured invasive zzso Among these zzso only three zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and one zzso tumor zzso gene zzso had same expressions in invasive cells originated from purchased cell zzso For primary cultured invasive cells, differential expressions of several groups of common genes are known to have capacities to promote proliferation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso migration zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso immune escape zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Two genes related to signal zzso zzso zzso and one related to metabolism zzso also showed consistent zzso zzso expressions of these genes are capable for tumor zzso In conclusion, the characteristics of invasive zzso zzso cells are originated from differential expressions of several groups of genes rather than few target zzso This information may give us a new insight to design new stratagems in zzso zzso Analysis of the results from a purchased cell line may have bias due to long-term repeated in zzso zzso
