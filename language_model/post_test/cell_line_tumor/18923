Our recent study demonstrated that a novel zzso inhibitor zzso triggers zzso in multiple myeloma zzso cells, and importantly, that is distinct from zzso zzso in its chemical structure, effects on zzso activities, and mechanisms of zzso Here, we demonstrate that combining zzso and zzso zzso synergistic zzso activity both in zzso using zzso cell lines or patient zzso zzso cells and in zzso in a human zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso plus zzso synergistic zzso is associated with: zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso stress response and zzso zzso zzso of migration of zzso cells and zzso zzso suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activities; and zzso blockade of zzso zzso Studies in a zzso model show that low dose combination of zzso and zzso is well tolerated and triggers synergistic zzso of tumor growth and zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities in tumor zzso zzso of zzso tumors from zzso plus zzso mice showed growth zzso zzso and a decrease in associated zzso Taken together, our study provides the zzso rationale for clinical protocols evaluating zzso together with zzso to improve patient outcome in zzso
