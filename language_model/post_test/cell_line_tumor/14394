The zzso zzso factor zzso signal is a common trigger inducing expressions of various zzso genes and is activated in various types of human zzso The aim of this study was to create an effective zzso DNA decoy that would interfere with zzso zzso zzso in tumor zzso We first established the zzso model using zzso human embryonic kidney zzso zzso cells by introducing a zzso zzso Based on a consensus zzso sequence in the zzso D1 and zzso zzso several zzso zzso were designed and tested for their ability to inhibit zzso activity in the zzso zzso Among them, the zzso zzso zzso formed zzso DNA and efficiently inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso was efficiently incorporated into the nucleus at 6 hours and remained within cells for up to 72 to 96 zzso When compared with scrambled zzso we found that the zzso zzso decoy significantly inhibited zzso activity and promoter activities of the downstream target zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 7 in zzso colon cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso expression of these genes decreased with treatment of the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso decoy significantly inhibited growth of zzso tumor cells, but not of zzso zzso zzso Our data provide evidence that the zzso decoy reduced both zzso activity and zzso zzso of downstream target zzso Thus, this zzso decoy is potentially an efficient and nontoxic molecular targeting therapy for controlling zzso properties of cancer zzso
