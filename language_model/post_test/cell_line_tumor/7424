To identify critical events associated with zzso cell killing, we examined zzso formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso in heat-treated zzso This zzso is known to be quite sensitive and a specific indicator for the presence of zzso zzso We found that the number of zzso zzso increased rapidly and reached a maximum 30 minutes after heat treatment, as well as after X-ray zzso When cells were heated at zzso degrees C to zzso degrees C, we observed a linear increase with time in the number of zzso zzso An inflection point at zzso degrees C and the zzso zzso energies above and below the inflection point were almost the same for cell killing and zzso formation according to zzso plot zzso From these results, it is suggested that the number of zzso zzso is correlated with the temperature dependence of cell zzso During periods when cells were exposed to heat, the cell zzso pattern of cell killing was the same as the cell cycle pattern of zzso zzso zzso We also found that zzso was due to a depression in the number of zzso zzso formed after heating when the cells were zzso by zzso These findings suggest that cell killing might be associated with zzso break formation via protein zzso
