The influence of noise on zzso motion is a subject of permanent interest, both for fundamental and practical zzso zzso respond properly to external stimuli by using noisy zzso We have clarified the effect of intrinsic noise on the dynamics in the human cancer cells following gamma zzso It is shown that the large amplification and increasing mutual information with delay are due to zzso zzso Furthermore, frequency domain analysis is used to study the zzso
