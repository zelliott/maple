We previously isolated zzso zzso cells from a human zzso cancer cell line, zzso and determined that zzso cells have cancer zzso cell zzso In this study, we isolated SP cells and zzso zzso cells derived from a rat zzso cell line expressing human zzso zzso zzso zzso and determined the SP zzso zzso cells showed zzso capacity, the potential to develop into zzso cells, reduced expression levels of differentiation zzso long-term zzso capacity in cultures, and enhanced zzso indicating that zzso cells have cancer zzso cell zzso zzso cells also display higher resistance to conventional zzso zzso In contrast, treatment with a zzso zzso zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso reduced zzso capacity and completely suppressed colony formation of zzso cells in a soft zzso The levels of zzso zzso oxygen species zzso and the number of zzso zzso were increased by zzso treatment of both zzso cells and zzso zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso were enhanced in zzso cells compared with zzso zzso These results imply that treatment with zzso induced production of zzso zzso and DNA damage in both zzso and zzso zzso Following zzso treatment, DNA damage response signals were enhanced more in zzso cells than in zzso zzso This is the first article on an zzso effect of zzso on proliferation of zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso may represent an attractive zzso therapy based upon their zzso effects on cancer zzso zzso
