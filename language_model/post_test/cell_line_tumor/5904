zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that is involved in tissue injury and repair zzso We analyzed zzso expression in normal and zzso zzso human cartilage, and evaluated its capacity to induce inflammatory and zzso zzso in zzso in zzso The effect of zzso on zzso loss from zzso cartilage in culture was also zzso 

zzso in culture media, cartilage zzso and zzso fluid of human and animal zzso was zzso using a sandwich zzso and/or analyzed by Western zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso Human and bovine primary zzso and/or zzso culture systems were zzso to study zzso induced inflammatory or zzso zzso and zzso zzso Total zzso and zzso zzso zzso fragments were zzso in human and rat zzso zzso by zzso 

zzso protein and zzso expression were significantly zzso in zzso cartilage with a zzso zzso of zzso levels in the zzso fluid of zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso of zzso induced zzso zzso and nitrate release and zzso zzso zzso in cultured primary human and bovine zzso zzso treatment resulted in an increased loss of zzso from cartilage zzso in zzso A correlation was observed between zzso and zzso generated zzso zzso levels in the zzso fluid of human zzso zzso and in the zzso of rat zzso that underwent surgical induction of zzso 

zzso expression in the knee cartilage and zzso levels measured in the zzso fluid are significantly enhanced in zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the elevated levels of zzso could induce inflammatory zzso and promote zzso degradation in zzso zzso
