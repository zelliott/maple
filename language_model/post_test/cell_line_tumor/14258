As part of our search for new zzso agents from natural resources, 22 zzso zzso zzso and 6 zzso zzso isolated from several zzso plants were tested for their zzso activity against the opportunistic pathogens zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso activity of the zzso zzso was associated with their zzso zzso and the number and structure of zzso units in their sugar zzso Within the 10 active zzso four zzso zzso zzso 1 to 4) with a sugar zzso of four or five zzso units exhibited significant activity against zzso zzso and zzso zzso comparable to the positive control zzso zzso The zzso potency of these compounds was not associated with zzso to zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso zzso may be considered potential zzso leads for further zzso zzso
