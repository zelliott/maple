zzso of the protein zzso zzso zzso family are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, zzso and zzso zzso (also known as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso a putative tumor zzso is frequently zzso in lung zzso through the loss of either zzso or protein zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its zzso have not been fully zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is viewed as crucial for multiple tumor growth and zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso is a direct zzso target of zzso in the zzso cell lung zzso Our data show that zzso administration or zzso of a zzso activated zzso in zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso reporter and zzso zzso we show that zzso binds to the promoter region of zzso and promotes its activity through recruiting zzso Thus, our results suggest a previously unknown zzso molecular network controlling zzso cell lung zzso zzso
