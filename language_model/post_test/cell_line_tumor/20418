zzso L mediates critical cellular functions including zzso zzso zzso and tumor zzso zzso In this study, the expression and function of zzso L in lung cancer cells were zzso Interestingly we have found that the expression of zzso L in lung cancer cells was 3- and zzso higher in its zzso and protein levels, but a significant decrease of its zzso activity when compared to that in corresponding normal lung zzso Further investigation revealed that zzso zzso of the zzso L zzso a necessary prerequisite for zzso of zzso zzso was zzso as a result of that zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso was remarkably zzso in the cancer zzso Our findings provide new insight into how cancer cells escape normal zzso mechanisms to form a tumor and the information may be useful for the design of novel strategies for treating lung cancer through regulating zzso L zzso
