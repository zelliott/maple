Type 5 zzso zzso zzso is the major zzso in the prostate that reduces zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in prostate cancer zzso and zzso resistant prostate cancer zzso that develops after zzso deprivation zzso zzso and zzso often depend on zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso could contribute to zzso synthesis of zzso zzso and stimulation of proliferation through zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, we developed an zzso prostate cancer cell line zzso zzso zzso and compared its zzso and zzso responses to zzso treatment with that of the zzso zzso negative zzso zzso In zzso and zzso cells, metabolism proceeded via zzso to form zzso and then zzso zzso cells made significantly higher amounts of zzso When zzso was inhibited by zzso the production of zzso was further elevated in zzso zzso When zzso activity was inhibited with zzso the production of zzso was significantly zzso zzso treatment zzso cell proliferation in both cell zzso zzso inhibited zzso cell zzso consistent with zzso acting as the major zzso that stimulates growth by binding to the zzso zzso However, zzso cells were resistant to the growth zzso properties of zzso consistent with the diversion of zzso metabolism from zzso zzso to increased formation of zzso zzso did not result in differences in zzso induced proliferation since this treatment led to the same zzso profile in zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso zzso metabolism to testosterone that results in proliferation in zzso sensitive prostate zzso This effect is seen despite high levels of zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso activity can zzso the effects of this elimination zzso Treatment options in prostate cancer that target zzso where zzso zzso may be less effective due to the diversion of zzso to zzso
