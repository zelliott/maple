An zzso zzso sequence is recognized by both zzso factors zzso and zzso binding protein zzso In the process of examining the effect of nuclear zzso on an zzso zzso promoter of zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso and suppresses the promoter activity both in zzso and in zzso tumor zzso Analysis using a designed zzso which was structurally unrelated to zzso zzso revealed that zzso binding by zzso is not specific and that the protein is not involved in the zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that in the nucleus of zzso cells, DNA binding by zzso and zzso activity of the promoter were inhibited without either a decrease of zzso or an increase of the zzso tumor zzso which is known to inhibit DNA binding by zzso In these cells, zzso zzso was specifically increased and associated with zzso and treatment with zzso A eliminated the zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso has a novel function as a zzso regulator to control zzso
