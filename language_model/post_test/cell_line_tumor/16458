The zzso inhibitor zzso is the first oral agent to show activity against human zzso zzso zzso Although the clinical application of zzso has shown good zzso in the studied zzso it also causes multiple human zzso zzso Thus, there is a strong need to reduce the overall dose of zzso We have reported that the zzso growth factor zzso zzso III zzso expression can decrease the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso we sought to explore whether zzso can affect the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso In this study, we observed that zzso expression significantly decreased the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso To enhance the zzso effect and reduce the overall dose of zzso we evaluated the combined effects of zzso a zzso zzso against zzso and zzso on the growth of zzso cells expressing zzso in zzso and in zzso The results showed that, when zzso was combined with zzso the tumor growth suppression effect was significantly increased, and the concentration of zzso required for growth zzso was substantially zzso zzso the combination could more noticeably zzso the zzso of zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso than zzso zzso zzso these findings demonstrate that zzso interacts zzso with zzso to strongly inhibit the tumor growth of zzso zzso expressing zzso by enhancing the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
