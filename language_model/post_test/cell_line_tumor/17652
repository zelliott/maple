zzso and zzso zzso stimulate a rapid zzso and zzso of the zzso receptors zzso Although the expectation was that a common zzso would be involved in the trafficking of the zzso in response to either hormone, studies reported zzso show the existence of unique zzso requirements for zzso of zzso zzso such as the zzso Treatment of human zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso which binds zzso zzso in zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso effectively blocks zzso zzso but not zzso zzso of zzso Treatment with zzso an agent that sequesters zzso zzso and leads to loss of zzso zzso had no effect on the ability of zzso zzso to stimulate zzso of zzso but blocked the ability of insulin to stimulate zzso of zzso via zzso Although zzso had no effect on zzso zzso of zzso the recycling of the zzso receptors to the cell membrane was sensitive to zzso of zzso by this zzso zzso by contrast, blocks the recycling of zzso zzso in response to zzso while attenuating recycling of receptors zzso in response to insulin zzso These data show the existence of unique zzso requirements for zzso trafficking in response to zzso compared with a zzso hormone, and for zzso versus recycling of the receptors to the cell zzso
