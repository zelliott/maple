zzso virus zzso zzso in zzso from vaccinated subjects are mainly directed against the zzso zzso zzso It has been shown previously that depletion of zzso zzso zzso by zzso of zzso with cells expressing the zzso zzso strain H zzso resulted in almost complete elimination of zzso zzso In the present study, zzso H and/or fusion zzso zzso zzso were depleted from zzso of naturally immune zzso Early zzso samples were collected zzso years after a zzso zzso outbreak in zzso caused by a zzso C2 virus, whilst late zzso samples were collected from healthy Dutch subjects born between 1960 and zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso completely eliminated zzso zzso activity against zzso zzso However, in the early zzso samples, residual zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso C2 was zzso This demonstrated that, although the majority of zzso zzso zzso recognized zzso zzso between different zzso zzso zzso zzso were also zzso In zzso depleted of zzso zzso only, zzso activity against zzso zzso was not completely zzso demonstrating the presence of zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, this study demonstrated that a fraction of zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso C2 does not neutralize zzso strain zzso In addition, it was shown that, in zzso from naturally immune donors, the majority of zzso zzso are specific for zzso H zzso but up to 10 % of zzso zzso are specific for zzso F zzso
