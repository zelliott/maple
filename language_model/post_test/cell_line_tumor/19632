The zzso attachment factor B1 zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso that has been proposed to inhibit breast zzso To obtain insight into the functions of zzso we zzso a zzso zzso screen and identified the zzso finger protein zzso as interacting with the zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso family of zzso which we found widely expressed in a series of breast cancer cell zzso We confirmed the interaction between zzso and zzso through in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso functions as a scaffolding protein to recruit proteins such as zzso into proximity with zzso zzso we asked whether zzso would zzso zzso activity and we discovered that zzso was important for the zzso expression of zzso D1 zzso and the zzso zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso Although zzso did not interact with zzso directly, it does zzso with zzso demonstrating that zzso is found within the same protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso located zzso to the zzso promoter, a known zzso zzso Taken together, our study provides further evidence that zzso and zzso are zzso linked processes and that zzso is a component of an zzso regulatory zzso
