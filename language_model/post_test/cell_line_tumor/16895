A subset of zzso the most common brain tumor in children, is hypothesized to originate from zzso zzso precursors zzso in which the sonic zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso a basic zzso zzso zzso factor of the MAD family, has been reported to be zzso during zzso zzso development and to promote zzso proliferation and zzso zzso zzso is zzso in mouse models of zzso as well as in human zzso zzso we zzso that zzso plays a role in the cellular events that lead to zzso zzso In agreement with its zzso role in zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells resulted in decreased zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in decreased cell numbers due to increased zzso and cell cycle zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso interacting domain, the basic domain, and binding to zzso are essential for this zzso zzso expression analysis indicated zzso of 84 genes and zzso of 47 zzso Potential direct zzso target genes were identified by zzso Our results suggest that zzso is necessary for zzso zzso cell zzso However, increased level and/or duration of zzso expression ultimately reduces cell numbers via increased cell death and cell cycle zzso
