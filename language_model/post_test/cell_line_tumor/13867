zzso zzso transport activity of zzso protein zzso in zzso cell lung cancer zzso is approximately twice that of in small cell lung cancer zzso Since zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso causes doubling of the specific activity of zzso and zzso cells are known to have greater zzso activity, we examined the contribution of zzso zzso zzso of zzso towards intrinsic zzso in human zzso zzso of a deletion zzso zzso followed by depletion of the zzso zzso using a zzso targeted at one of the deleted regions resulted in generation of cells expressing only the zzso zzso which could not be zzso by zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso was similar and comparable to that of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso However, this activity was significantly lower than that of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso After zzso zzso depletion of zzso zzso activities of zzso zzso from zzso and zzso were zzso zzso of zzso inhibited the growth of zzso more than zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lowered the zzso of zzso cell lines for zzso to the same level as that observed for zzso zzso mouse embryonic zzso zzso were significantly more sensitive to zzso as compared with zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso zzso However, zzso did not affect zzso towards zzso zzso as opposed to zzso zzso which were zzso by zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is a primary zzso of zzso and that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso is primarily due to differential zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso
