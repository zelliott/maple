zzso zzso are an important tool for gene delivery in zzso and in zzso The success of gene transfer approaches relies on high and stable levels of gene zzso To this end, several molecular strategies have been employed to manipulate these zzso towards improving gene expression in the targeted animal zzso Low gene expression can be accepted due to the weak zzso from the majority of available zzso zzso however, this obstacle can be in part overcome by the zzso of zzso elements that enhance gene expression in various expression zzso In this work, we created different zzso zzso in which several zzso regulatory zzso namely the zzso zzso zzso regulatory element zzso and different specialized zzso termination sequences zzso and zzso were used to develop zzso leading to improved zzso zzso These zzso combine the advantages of restriction zzso cloning eliminating the instability and zzso problems occurring from traditional cloning methods in zzso expression zzso and were tested by expressing zzso and the zzso zzso reporter gene from different cellular promoters in different cell zzso We show that the promoter activity varies between cell lines and is affected by the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we show that the combination of the zzso element with the zzso zzso signal significantly enhances zzso zzso The zzso zzso created can be easily modified and adapted without the need for extensive zzso making them a valuable tool for viral zzso zzso
