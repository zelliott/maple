zzso quantitative detection of zzso zzso proteins with a low sample volume holds great promise to advance cellular zzso techniques for personalized diagnosis and treatment of infectious zzso Here we achieved such an zzso with the zzso human acute zzso leukemia cell line (a model for human zzso using a highly integrated zzso platform incorporating a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our zzso device allowed us to stimulate cells with zzso zzso which is an zzso causing septic shock due to severely pronounced immune response of the human body, under a zzso zzso zzso zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso cells was subsequently measured within the device with no zzso process zzso Our study achieved zzso cellular zzso with zzso fewer cells than current zzso zzso The total zzso time was also 7 times shorter than that of a conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso Our strategy of monitoring immune cell functions in zzso using a zzso platform could impact future medical treatments of acute infectious diseases and immune disorders by enabling a zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso
