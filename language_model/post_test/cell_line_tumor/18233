The Ewing's zzso family of tumors zzso includes Ewing's zzso zzso zzso tumor of the chest wall, and peripheral primitive zzso zzso Basic zzso growth factor zzso suppresses the growth of zzso cells and causes their zzso The underlying mechanism is zzso Using a human peripheral primitive zzso tumor cell line, zzso we demonstrated zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso all of which were primarily retained in the zzso zzso promoted the association between zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso protected cells from zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso of zzso but not zzso decreased zzso association and caused a nuclear zzso of zzso Similarly, expression of a zzso zzso zzso or zzso interfering zzso inhibited zzso zzso association and zzso zzso to the zzso Both zzso zzso and small interfering zzso offered protection against zzso cell zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso and ethanol enhanced zzso zzso zzso association, and zzso retention of zzso As a result, they zzso zzso cell zzso Taken together, our results suggested that zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso is toxic for zzso zzso The formation of an zzso complex retained zzso in the zzso In contrast, disruption of the zzso complex resulted in nuclear zzso of zzso and offered zzso
