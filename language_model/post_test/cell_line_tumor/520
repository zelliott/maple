zzso zzso in small cell lung cancer zzso occur regularly in patients but seldom if any in conventional zzso mouse zzso To overcome this problem, zzso cells were grafted zzso onto pore forming protein and zzso zzso gene 2 double knock out zzso mice and in severe combined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grew well in both mouse zzso while zzso occurred frequently in the zzso mice and infrequently in zzso zzso Hence zzso cells, which are inactive in zzso mice, play an important role in zzso zzso formation in zzso zzso This observation is in agreement with clinical studies, where a high zzso cell number in the blood is correlated with a better prognosis of the zzso
