zzso breast cancer is an aggressive disease for which targeted therapies are zzso Recent studies showed that zzso breast cancer is frequently associated with an increased activity of the zzso zzso zzso pathway, which is critical for cell growth, survival, and zzso To investigate the therapeutic potential of zzso zzso zzso in the treatment of zzso breast cancer, we evaluated the zzso effect of the zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso in zzso and zzso two zzso zzso models of zzso breast zzso Both models showed high levels of zzso zzso and loss of zzso zzso We observed a synergistic effect of zzso and zzso on tumor growth and cell proliferation in zzso In addition, zzso and zzso inhibited zzso as determined by zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that treatment with zzso inhibited zzso zzso induced by zzso To evaluate the effect of loss of zzso on tumor cell sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso we knocked down zzso in zzso a zzso breast cancer cell line with intact zzso Compared with control zzso zzso zzso zzso led to a more dramatic reduction in cell proliferation and tumor growth zzso in response to zzso and zzso both in zzso and in zzso Furthermore, a synergistic effect of these two agents on tumor volume was observed in zzso with zzso zzso Our results provide a zzso rationale for future clinical investigation of this combination in zzso breast cancer with loss of zzso
