DNA zzso and zzso zzso are two zzso mechanisms involved in the lack of zzso zzso zzso zzso Our previous studies demonstrated that zzso zzso along with repression complex proteins including zzso zzso and zzso is associated with zzso promoter in zzso zzso To zzso the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso 1 zzso gene zzso in these cells, we zzso zzso and zzso expression using zzso and studied the ability of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in binding to zzso promoter zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso or zzso zzso zzso the repression complex proteins and zzso zzso from zzso zzso The partial zzso of zzso promoter and zzso zzso in zzso cells supports these zzso In zzso binding studies demonstrated that zzso of zzso protein in this cell line did not affect its binding capacity to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our observations suggest that not only zzso zzso activity of zzso contributes to zzso of zzso zzso gene but also zzso presence on zzso promoter is important for assembly of zzso in repression zzso In addition, our data revealed that zzso zzso protein binds to the promoter of zzso through direct interaction with zzso and indirect interaction with zzso zzso proteins in the zzso zzso zzso
