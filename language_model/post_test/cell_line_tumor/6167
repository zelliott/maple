PET with zzso zzso acid zzso peptides can zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression in patients, but zzso is complex and image contrast is limited in some tumor zzso The development of zzso peptides would be of great utility given the convenience of zzso production and zzso and zzso peptides allow for delayed imaging with potentially improved zzso zzso 

We used the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso to zzso the zzso zzso zzso with zzso or zzso zzso was labeled at room temperature with both zzso within 10 zzso zzso at zzso for up to 30 zzso was used for the other zzso The affinity profile of the zzso was evaluated by a zzso zzso zzso zzso PET studies and zzso studies were performed in nude mice bearing subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso were labeled with a zzso purity greater than zzso and specific activities of zzso zzso The affinity profile was similar for all zzso and comparable to the reference standard zzso In the zzso studies, all compounds demonstrated a relatively similar tumor and normal organ zzso at 1 h after injection that was comparable to published data on zzso zzso zzso At 18 h after injection, however, zzso and zzso showed up to a zzso increase in zzso zzso PET studies demonstrated zzso images of the zzso tumors at 18 zzso confirming the zzso zzso 

The ease of zzso makes zzso an attractive alternative to zzso zzso zzso The high zzso ratios of zzso and zzso at 18 h warrant testing of zzso zzso peptides in zzso
