The zzso gene is a member of the rapidly expanding zzso family of genes that regulate zzso zzso has been shown to repress cell death triggered by a diverse array of zzso including chemotherapy and gamma zzso 

The purpose of this study was to determine zzso zzso expression level in zzso zzso cells using an zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

About zzso base pairs containing the coding sequence of the zzso zzso gene were transformed into zzso zzso The zzso zzso was used as a positive control for an zzso zzso using mouse zzso zzso against human and canine zzso An zzso zzso using the zzso zzso was carried out to determine the level of zzso zzso expression in zzso and zzso leukemia cell zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso protein produced in zzso coli had a molecular weight of about 26 zzso and was detected by zzso zzso by using zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was high in zzso cell lines zzso and zzso and low in the cell line from peripheral blood zzso cells from a healthy cat zzso but not low in freshly isolated peripheral blood zzso cells from a healthy zzso The zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso was found to zzso with zzso zzso 

These results confirm the expression of zzso in zzso zzso cell lines and indicate that it is suitable to detect zzso zzso using an zzso zzso zzso further zzso zzso expression might be useful in the differential diagnosis of zzso zzso
