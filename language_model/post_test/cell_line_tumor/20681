The zzso zzso of zzso zzso versus zzso zzso following zzso therapy is a subject of intense controversy in the field of experimental zzso In addition, accurately evaluating changes of the tumor zzso after zzso therapy is important for zzso treatment zzso zzso has considerable zzso effects that lead to tumor zzso and induce tumor zzso in the highly zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a proven zzso imaging zzso Thus, to clarify early changes in the tumor zzso following zzso therapy and whether zzso imaging can detect those changes, we evaluated early changes in the tumor zzso after zzso treatment in an zzso zzso by sequential zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso A human zzso zzso zzso was established in nude mice, for zzso studies and zzso and further assigned to the control and zzso groups zzso zzso zzso Mice were sacrificed on Days 1, 2, 3 and 7 in the zzso study, and on Days 3 and 7 in zzso after zzso zzso zzso volume was measured every zzso zzso and zzso were injected zzso 4 and zzso before zzso zzso zzso sections were stained with zzso and zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso distribution was zzso in zzso zzso volume did not significantly change on Day 7 after zzso zzso In the zzso study, hypoxic fraction significantly increased on Day 2, mean vessel density significantly decreased on Day 1 and necrosis area significantly increased on Day 2 after zzso zzso zzso zzso distribution significantly increased on Days 3 zzso zzso and 7 zzso zzso after zzso zzso The sequential zzso evaluation of the tumor zzso clarified tumor zzso in zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso imaging confirmed the tumor zzso zzso PET may contribute to determine an optimum treatment protocol after zzso zzso
