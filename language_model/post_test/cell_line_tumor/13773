Evidence is emerging that the closely related zzso and zzso zzso zzso support the invasive and zzso growth of a spectrum of human cancer zzso zzso zzso of ROCK are under zzso zzso However, a key step in their development involves the identification of genetic zzso that will predict ROCK inhibitor zzso zzso One identified mechanism for ROCK zzso in cancer involves the loss of function of the zzso tumor zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso protein zzso for the zzso and zzso small zzso zzso loss may lead to zzso of zzso and its downstream zzso the ROCK zzso We therefore determined whether loss of zzso protein expression identifies zzso cell lung zzso zzso cell lines whose growth and invasion zzso are sensitive to ROCK zzso We identified and characterized a novel small zzso zzso inhibitor of ROCK and additionally applied genetic approaches to impair zzso and/or zzso activity, and we determined that although zzso zzso growth was zzso both zzso growth and zzso invasion were zzso However, loss of zzso expression did not correlate with ROCK zzso or with zzso zzso zzso suppression of zzso or zzso expression alone was sufficient to impair zzso growth, supporting their zzso roles in zzso zzso the block in zzso growth was associated with zzso of cells in the zzso phase of the cell cycle, but not increased zzso We conclude that ROCK may be a useful therapeutic target for zzso
