The tumor zzso protein zzso activates growth arrest and zzso genes in response to DNA zzso It is known that negative feedback by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso The current study investigates zzso feedback on zzso during zzso stress from zzso and the subsequent effects on cell survival zzso through zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso colon zzso cells increased levels of zzso and zzso resulting in a larger zzso population during zzso zzso increase in zzso levels protected zzso cells against zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso were both able to promote zzso cell zzso zzso protection against zzso death was lost in cells lacking zzso not zzso suggesting that zzso acts to inhibit zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso exerts a negative feedback on zzso and zzso leading to zzso growth zzso and survival zzso zzso survival was associated with increased zzso to block zzso activated cell death during zzso zzso
