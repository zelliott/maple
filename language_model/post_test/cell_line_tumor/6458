zzso transition zzso is a series of molecular changes allowing zzso cancer cells to acquire properties of zzso zzso increased zzso invasion, and protection from zzso zzso regulators such as zzso mediate zzso working in part to repress zzso zzso We report a novel, zzso in zzso zzso cancer model to explore the role of zzso in zzso cancer zzso tumor zzso 

For the generation of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso or empty zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used for zzso zzso were evaluated for zzso and zzso zzso and cell migration and zzso For the in zzso study, colon cancer cells zzso zzso zzso zzso empty zzso and zzso were zzso injected into the zzso zzso of nude mice using zzso zzso After 28 zzso tumors were harvested and tissue was zzso 

zzso expression in our panel of colon cancer cell lines was zzso correlated with zzso expression and enhanced zzso zzso zzso cells demonstrated a zzso increased zzso and zzso decreased zzso expression compared with empty zzso Similarly, the zzso zzso cells had significantly enhanced cellular migration and zzso In the zzso zzso cancer model, zzso zzso cells formed zzso tumors in zzso zzso of the mice zzso volume zzso zzso zzso compared with only zzso zzso with empty zzso zzso 

zzso mediates zzso with enhanced in zzso zzso tumor zzso Our zzso in zzso model enables researchers to explore the molecular consequences of altered genes in a clinically relevant zzso cancer in an effort to develop novel therapeutic approaches for patients with zzso zzso
