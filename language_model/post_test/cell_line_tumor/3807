Since pancreatic zzso is largely zzso to conventional therapies, development of novel agents is required for the effective treatment of pancreatic zzso The objective of this paper was to examine the molecular mechanisms by which zzso inhibited human pancreatic cancer growth in mice by modulating tumor immune zzso zzso inhibited zzso tumor growth, zzso and zzso which were associated with suppression of zzso and Sonic zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and induced the expression of zzso in tumor zzso zzso also reversed zzso transition by zzso zzso and zzso the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibited pancreatic cancer growth in zzso mice by modulating tumor immune zzso where zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso immune cells were zzso These data suggest that zzso can inhibit pancreatic cancer growth by modulating tumor immune zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso may offer therapeutic benefits for the treatment and/or prevention of pancreatic zzso
