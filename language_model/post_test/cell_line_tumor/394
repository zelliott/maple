zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso has recently been shown to elicit zzso zzso capable of recognizing and zzso a variety of tumor zzso However, the integration of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso has not been fully zzso This study was designed to investigate the zzso effects of tumor vaccine produced by zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso total zzso through zzso in zzso rats zzso 

The zzso using zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso total zzso induced zzso zzso responses which were statistically significant and the zzso activity was inhibited by the treatment with zzso and zzso I zzso zzso In in zzso experiments, zzso of the rats zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso were typically able to reject tumor challenge and remained zzso zzso survivors developed long zzso memory and were able to reject a subsequent zzso with the same tumor cells but not a zzso unrelated tumor zzso 

In the present study, we zzso zzso rat zzso cells derived total zzso to zzso rat bone zzso zzso through zzso The tumor vaccine was applied to in zzso rats model and the specific zzso effects of the tumor vaccine were zzso Then zzso activity was evaluated one week after the first zzso of zzso rats with zzso zzso and the specificity of the zzso activity was confirmed in cold target zzso zzso and using zzso blocking zzso class I or zzso zzso 

The present study provided valid evidence of integration of rat zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso through zzso and confirmed this novel tumor vaccine have the potential to induced zzso zzso response and reject zzso zzso This technique and its products may thus represent a promising strategy for zzso zzso of patients with zzso
