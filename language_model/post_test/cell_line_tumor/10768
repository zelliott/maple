zzso cell lung cancer zzso patients with zzso or zzso 19 deletion zzso in zzso growth factor zzso zzso have good responses to the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso However, patients with zzso zzso and acquired zzso in zzso zzso are resistant to zzso zzso Here, we showed that zzso can improve the efficiency of zzso in the resistant zzso cells both in zzso and in zzso zzso 

After screening zzso herbal and natural compounds, we found zzso could inhibit cell proliferation in different zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso through promoting zzso degradation in zzso cell lines with zzso zzso or zzso zzso In addition, the zzso activity of zzso was zzso via zzso through blocking zzso zzso and inducing zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso also the combined treatment with zzso and zzso exhibited significant zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso tumor growth in zzso mice through reducing zzso zzso zzso D1 zzso and inducing zzso zzso through zzso 9 and zzso Interestingly, we observed that the combined treatment group represented better survival rate and less zzso zzso damage compare to zzso zzso We showed that zzso attenuated the zzso cell proliferation zzso and zzso through altering zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso in cell lines and zzso mice model of zzso through zzso of zzso zzso zzso and induction zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso gastrointestinal adverse effects via altering zzso zzso These findings provide a novel treatment strategy that zzso as an zzso to increase the spectrum of the usage of zzso and overcome the zzso inefficiency in zzso zzso
