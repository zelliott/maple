zzso derivatives zzso with zzso zzso are successfully used for PET imaging of prostate cancer zzso Since little is known about zzso mechanisms, the aim of this study was to characterize zzso zzso in prostate cancer cells, also following zzso treatment or zzso 

zzso zzso in prostate cancer cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso using different zzso of zzso via liquid zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso an inhibitor of the organic zzso zzso zzso Changes in zzso zzso triggered by zzso and zzso were evaluated and zzso zzso were detected via Western zzso 

zzso zzso yielded a zzso transport with zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso cells, zzso Treatment of cells with zzso and zzso caused an increase in total zzso zzso but had no significant effect on zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso dependent and zzso higher in zzso cells than in zzso zzso zzso zzso was reduced by zzso using zzso and zzso zzso by zzso using zzso and by zzso using zzso The zzso zzso zzso was detected via Western zzso 

zzso zzso in prostate cancer cells is accomplished both by a zzso and a zzso zzso zzso of zzso experiments suggest that zzso is zzso by a selective zzso zzso rather than by the zzso zzso and zzso changes in total zzso zzso could affect PET zzso zzso
