The zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is an integral membrane protein that regulates zzso pH by removing one zzso zzso in exchange for one zzso zzso It has a large zzso membrane domain of 12 zzso segments and an zzso zzso regulatory zzso We characterized the zzso accessibility of zzso acids of the putative zzso segment IX zzso zzso Each zzso was zzso to zzso in a functional zzso zzso zzso Of 25 zzso acids zzso 5 were inactive or nearly so after zzso to zzso Several of these showed zzso targeting to the plasma membrane and reduced expression of the intact zzso whereas others were expressed and targeted correctly but had defective zzso zzso Of the active zzso zzso and zzso were inhibited zzso by positively charged zzso but not by zzso zzso suggesting that they are pore lining and make up part of the zzso zzso zzso Both zzso also had decreased affinity for zzso and decreased zzso by zzso zzso The structure of a zzso representing zzso acids zzso was determined by using high resolution zzso in zzso zzso The structure contained two zzso regions zzso acids zzso and zzso zzso with a large bend angle around a zzso point at zzso acid zzso The results suggest that zzso IX is critical with zzso zzso and a zzso at the functionally important zzso zzso
