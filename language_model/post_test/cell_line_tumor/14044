zzso of zzso c and zzso from zzso occurs during zzso although the relative timing of their release is not well zzso Double zzso was zzso here to study zzso the patterns of release of zzso c and zzso from zzso in single zzso Human zzso cells and zzso embryonic cortical zzso were analyzed during zzso induced by zzso In zzso cells treated with zzso for 24 zzso a substantial proportion of cells zzso released zzso c from the zzso before zzso In contrast, these proteins were released mostly zzso in zzso only a minority of cells zzso or zzso zzso released zzso c without zzso (or vice zzso from zzso zzso of release in either cell type were zzso by addition of the zzso zzso zzso The double zzso procedure facilitated clear definition of the zzso release of zzso c and zzso from zzso in intact zzso cells, enabling us to demonstrate for the first time that their mutual zzso during zzso varies between different cell zzso
