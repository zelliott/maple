zzso zzso of DNA sequence and its organization into zzso is central to zzso function and zzso However, it remains unclear how cells coordinate DNA synthesis with provision of new zzso for zzso assembly to ensure zzso zzso In this paper, we show that replication fork speed is dependent on new zzso supply and efficient zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso impaired replication fork progression and reduced zzso occupancy on newly zzso zzso zzso zzso initially remained stable without zzso of conventional zzso although prolonged zzso zzso generated DNA zzso zzso accumulated on newly zzso DNA in cells lacking new zzso possibly to maintain opportunity for zzso recruitment and zzso zzso zzso with this, in zzso and in zzso analysis showed that zzso unloading is delayed in the absence of zzso zzso We propose that zzso of fork speed and zzso unloading to zzso assembly provides a simple mechanism to adjust DNA replication and maintain zzso integrity during transient zzso zzso
