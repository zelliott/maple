The components of the zzso zzso zzso and their differential expression patterns play important roles in tissue zzso The deposition of zzso zzso binding proteins zzso to the zzso exhibit distinct distribution zzso We have analyzed here the zzso and spatial zzso association of zzso zzso binding protein zzso in cultured human embryonic lung zzso We found that zzso was not assembled to the zzso until by zzso of cultures following the deposition of zzso zzso and zzso In zzso cultures zzso was rapidly zzso from cells and it subsequently associated with the zzso as shown by zzso labeling and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and failed to assemble to the zzso of zzso deficient mouse zzso Analysis of different cultured human cell lines revealed partial zzso of zzso and zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells and human vascular zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso zzso profoundly disrupted the deposition of zzso Current results suggest that zzso is not an element of the provisional zzso of zzso but is more likely a component of more mature zzso and indicate that zzso association of zzso depends on a zzso zzso zzso
