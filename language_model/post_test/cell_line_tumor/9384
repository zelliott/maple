zzso labeling of zzso according to zzso zzso zzso A technique for zzso of cell suspensions and zzso J Cell zzso zzso is an important and widely used method for zzso zzso These sections are cut from material that is chemically fixed at room temperature zzso temperature zzso zzso Lately in many zzso studies fast freezing followed by zzso fixation zzso is used instead of zzso We have explored some new methods for applying zzso labeling on zzso from zzso frozen cells zzso cells, primary zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso As zzso has to be carried out on thawed and stable zzso we explored two ways to achieve this: zzso The section fixation method, as briefly reported before zzso W et zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso and zzso W et zzso J zzso zzso zzso in which zzso from freshly frozen cells were stabilized in zzso of zzso and zzso cellulose and varying zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Only occasionally does this method reveal section areas with excellent cell preservation and zzso stained zzso like zzso sections of zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso The zzso method, a novel approach, in which zzso with zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso was followed by zzso and zzso as in the zzso zzso zzso the addition of zzso and low zzso of water to the zzso medium favored superb membrane zzso zzso labeling was as efficient as with the zzso zzso
