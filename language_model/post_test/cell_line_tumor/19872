We have previously demonstrated that zzso has a zzso effect on zzso gene zzso Because this effect was abolished by the zzso zzso we zzso that this effect is through zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The objective of this study was to explore the molecular mechanisms of this zzso 

The transient zzso of a zzso zzso zzso construct containing a zzso of the zzso gene promoter into the zzso zzso cell line was zzso An zzso mobility shift zzso zzso and a DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were carried out to locate a specific zzso response element zzso in the zzso gene promoter zzso 

zzso treatment of zzso cells zzso with the zzso gene zzso construct resulted in an increase of zzso zzso whereas zzso blocked this zzso zzso A novel zzso site zzso with zzso zzso to that of zzso mouse zzso zzso virus zzso zzso was discovered in this zzso 

The effect of zzso on zzso gene expression is through zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by binding to a novel zzso in the zzso promoter zzso zzso one of the mechanisms of zzso by zzso during pregnancy may be through the regulation of zzso gene expression via this novel zzso
