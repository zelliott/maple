To investigate the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso regulates cell zzso 

zzso cells were infected with zzso zzso and control virus zzso under zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to detect zzso and zzso zzso expressions at different time zzso Western zzso was employed to verify zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed to observe the ratio of zzso zzso zzso 

The expression levels of zzso zzso and protein increased after infection with zzso zzso accompanied by an increase in zzso zzso and protein zzso The zzso ratio was significantly higher in zzso cells infected with zzso zzso zzso than in the control cells zzso zzso 

zzso may induce cell cycle arrest by zzso zzso expressions to promote zzso cell zzso
