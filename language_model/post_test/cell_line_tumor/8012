The effect of zzso and reducing free zzso on the biological properties of zzso zzso were investigated in zzso 

zzso cells were treated with zzso (5 zzso or 40 zzso and/or zzso C zzso zzso zzso For testing a possible zzso and synergistic effect of zzso in relation to zzso a radiation dose of zzso was applied up to 8 zzso In order to produce the desired free zzso the media were saturated with: zzso air zzso OH and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso OH, zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso H and zzso zzso The survival zzso of the cells were determined by zzso zzso 

zzso was found to be able to sensitize zzso cells against the action of reducing zzso zzso zzso as well as of zzso zzso zzso free zzso This ability was enhanced with increasing zzso zzso Moreover, zzso acted zzso with zzso in reducing as well as in zzso zzso
