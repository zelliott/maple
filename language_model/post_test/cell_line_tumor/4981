zzso is a zzso zzso compound extracted from zzso zzso possessing zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso stress are known to induce the expression of certain classes of zzso zzso Since the zzso of detoxifying zzso affects the drug metabolism and cell defense system, it is important to understand the gene regulation by such zzso In this study, we demonstrated that zzso could induce the expression of human zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells treated with zzso zzso the level of zzso zzso was significantly zzso In zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso the promoter activity of a reporter construct carrying zzso upstream of the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that the region including zzso response element zzso which zzso zzso in zzso was essential to the response to zzso While the introduction of a zzso zzso expression construct zzso the promoter activity of the zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso abolished the responsiveness to zzso In addition, zzso activated the expression of the zzso gene from a reporter construct carrying multiple ARE consensus sequences but not one with multiple zzso zzso In a gel mobility shift zzso with an zzso with zzso zzso an increase in the amount of the binding complex was observed in the nuclear extracts of zzso zzso zzso These results suggested that ARE is the primary sequence for the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The induction of zzso may be one of the mechanisms underlying the multiple actions of zzso
