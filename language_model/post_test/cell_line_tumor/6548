zzso Ras zzso has been demonstrated in numerous cell types, particularly of zzso (including melanoma zzso and zzso origin, but the Ras zzso involved has not been zzso In zzso melanoma cells, zzso activates the zzso pathway, leading initially to stimulation but subsequently to long term zzso zzso of zzso zzso extension and zzso zzso Here we identify zzso as the Ras zzso zzso exchange factor zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso is expressed zzso in zzso melanoma cells and that zzso zzso of Ras and zzso in these cells can be zzso by zzso zzso and reduced by its zzso by zzso zzso Moreover, we show that zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso of zzso leads to increased zzso extension and zzso production observed approximately 50 h after zzso treatment, suggesting that zzso zzso zzso in the long zzso zzso we find that zzso of zzso leads to zzso whereas its zzso by zzso enhances cell zzso independent of zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso regulates zzso but that it also has a distinct role in regulating cell zzso
