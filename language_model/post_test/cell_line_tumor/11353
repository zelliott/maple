zzso of zzso growth factor zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso is implicated in the zzso process of multiple zzso making disruption of this interaction a promising therapeutic zzso However, targeting zzso with zzso zzso can mimic zzso zzso via zzso zzso To address this zzso we have developed zzso an zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso generated using the zzso technology that enables the zzso to engage the zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso and signaling and has zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso data and a crystal structure of a zzso complex of zzso zzso zzso bound to a zzso zzso domain fragment, consisting of the zzso zzso domain fused to the adjacent zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso and the zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso acts specifically by blocking zzso zzso (but not zzso binding to zzso These data suggest a likely binding site of the zzso zzso on zzso which when zzso leads to zzso zzso zzso therefore, represents the founding member of a class of therapeutic zzso zzso that overcomes limitations of zzso zzso for targets impacted by zzso zzso
