zzso zzso cells zzso expand in zzso hosts and play a central role in cancer immune evasion by zzso zzso and innate zzso They therefore represent a major obstacle for successful cancer zzso Different strategies have thus been explored to zzso and/or zzso zzso in zzso Using a zzso zzso cancer model, we demonstrated that zzso selectively eliminates zzso in the zzso blood, and tumor zzso Furthermore, residual zzso from zzso mice exhibited impaired zzso zzso zzso the frequency of zzso and zzso T zzso and consequently the zzso zzso or natural killer zzso to zzso zzso ratios were significantly increased following zzso treatment of zzso zzso In addition, the proportion of zzso and zzso T cell zzso expressing zzso and zzso B and of zzso producing zzso was zzso by zzso zzso Of therapeutic zzso this drug efficiently combined with zzso or zzso zzso to suppress tumor development and zzso zzso zzso isolated from patients with different types of cancer were also sensitive to zzso zzso in zzso These results thus indicate that zzso may be used not only as a direct zzso drug against tumor cells, but also as a potent zzso agent that selectively zzso zzso zzso thereby zzso the efficacy of zzso zzso
