zzso recognition complex zzso plays critical roles in the initiation of DNA replication and zzso zzso In zzso zzso associates with origin DNA during zzso and with zzso in zzso zzso However, what regulates the binding of zzso to zzso is not zzso We have identified a highly zzso zzso repeats and zzso repeat zzso protein 1 zzso or zzso zzso in human cells that interacts with zzso and zzso zzso association of zzso zzso zzso with zzso and shows similar zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso efficiently recruits zzso to zzso zzso of zzso in human primary cells and embryonic stem cells results in loss of zzso association to zzso zzso reduction of zzso zzso and a subsequent zzso in zzso zzso Our results suggest zzso association of zzso to zzso is critical to initiate zzso assembly in zzso and zzso organization in zzso zzso
