A major zzso mechanism in classical zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso of zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso controlling zzso cell proliferation and zzso Recently, we demonstrated that zzso zzso activity is a negative regulator of the B cell program in B zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Despite abundant evidence for a complex zzso cross talk between zzso and zzso signaling in zzso cells, it is unknown whether these pathways interact in zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso in zzso cells by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso results in decreased alternative zzso zzso zzso interfering with processing of the zzso gene product zzso into its active form zzso As a result, expression of zzso and zzso target genes is reduced, and survival of zzso cells is zzso zzso of alternative zzso signaling in the zzso cell line zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso rescued zzso loss of cell viability and zzso zzso Our data reveal that zzso is an essential upstream regulator of alternative zzso signaling and indicate cross talk between both the pathways in zzso zzso zzso we suggest that targeting the zzso zzso is a promising therapeutic option in zzso
