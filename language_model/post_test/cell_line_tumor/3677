The study was performed to investigate the potency of zzso zzso to reduce or to overcome tamoxifen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso positive zzso and zzso deficient zzso cells with different sensitivity to tamoxifen were zzso Instead of the parent compound, zzso zzso was used as drug, because this zzso is the most zzso zzso in zzso zzso further contained the zzso zzso zzso zzso Cellular zzso of zzso during zzso h was determined by high performance thin layer zzso technique zzso Free zzso was taken up time independently by the two cell lines at zzso g zzso cellular zzso zzso zzso was taken up at a significantly higher degree than free zzso in both cell lines, but the zzso was delayed in the sensitive zzso cell line with the highest concentration detected after 24 h zzso zzso zzso the highest amount in the zzso line zzso zzso was already measured after 3 h in zzso zzso It successively decreased with incubation zzso The faster zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso cells correlated with a stronger and earlier destruction of resistant zzso cells whereas the sensitive zzso cells were mainly inhibited in their zzso zzso effects were observed in both cell lines after extended incubation zzso The combination of zzso with an zzso further enhanced the zzso of the zzso The zzso in the zzso cells could be significantly reduced by zzso combining both drugs to zzso zzso compared with the zzso of the free drugs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is assumed that the enhanced and accelerated zzso of zzso zzso in the cell line with relative drug resistance can increase the zzso zzso of zzso The results of this study demonstrated that zzso with zzso zzso have a superior zzso effect in resistant breast cancer zzso That coincided with the enhanced therapeutic effect of these zzso observed in zzso
