The insulin zzso zzso zzso proteins are zzso molecules that integrate signals generated by receptors that are implicated in human breast zzso We investigated the specific contribution of zzso to zzso tumor progression using transgenic mice that express the zzso virus middle T zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor initiation and growth were similar in zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the zzso and zzso of zzso were significantly decreased in the absence of zzso zzso The contribution of zzso to zzso is intrinsic to the tumor cells, because zzso zzso tumor cells did not zzso when grown zzso in the zzso fat pads of zzso zzso zzso and zzso tumors contained similar numbers of zzso cells, but zzso tumors had a higher zzso of zzso than did zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso tumor cells were less invasive and more zzso in response to growth factor deprivation than their zzso zzso In contrast, zzso tumor cells, which express only zzso were highly invasive and were resistant to zzso zzso zzso our findings reveal an important contribution of zzso to breast cancer zzso
