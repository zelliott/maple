To establish a human zzso zzso cell line zzso with human zzso zzso 

zzso tissue of a zzso zzso zzso cell zzso was obtained and tested negative for the presence of zzso by zzso chain zzso zzso tissue fragments were then transplanted zzso into nude zzso After two successive passages, the tumor tissue was seeded into culture zzso and incubated in a medium containing zzso fetal bovine serum, insulin and zzso growth zzso zzso cell zzso and molecular features were determined by various zzso 

A stable cell line, designated as zzso was successfully established after 86 culture zzso The cells grew as a zzso with zzso zzso The cell doubling time was approximately zzso zzso The human origin of the tumor cells was confirmed by zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated by the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso presence of zzso and zzso The zzso nature of the cells was documented by their zzso formation in zzso and zzso in nude zzso zzso cells expressed zzso zzso zzso and were negative for zzso zzso 

This newly established zzso zzso zzso cell zzso cell line may be a useful model for investigating zzso zzso unrelated to zzso infection, and the role of zzso in the progression of human zzso zzso
