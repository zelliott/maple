zzso peptides provide a unique platform to create a new generation of cancer zzso with enhanced efficacy and diminished zzso In our study, enhanced expression of zzso zzso 2 zzso was observed in acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso of a zzso display zzso library using zzso and Rapid Analysis of Selective zzso zzso zzso identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso motif targeted and penetrated into leukemia cells in a zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso zzso zzso composed of the zzso motif linked to a programmed cell zzso zzso zzso induced zzso in zzso cells with high zzso expression zzso but not in chronic zzso leukemia zzso cells with low zzso expression zzso The zzso activity of this zzso zzso was confirmed in leukemia patient samples and an animal model of zzso zzso as the development of leukemia was significantly delayed in mice with zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on bone zzso tissue slices revealed that the zzso zzso induced leukemia cell zzso in a zzso zzso Together, our findings indicate that zzso is a potential therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of zzso and the prototype, zzso is a promising drug candidate in this zzso
