Alternative zzso zzso is implicated in diverse disease zzso such as zzso organ fibrosis, and zzso diseases, but the mechanisms underlying zzso programming are not fully zzso zzso is a zzso zzso present on zzso We show that disruption of the zzso gene in zzso mice specifically zzso zzso alternative zzso zzso in bone zzso zzso in zzso and in resident lung and recruited zzso zzso in zzso without affecting zzso classical zzso or zzso zzso zzso alternative zzso zzso is inhibited by zzso deletion of zzso or its membrane zzso zzso and by zzso of zzso Increased zzso expression and zzso is a feature of alternative zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso expression and release in parallel with other zzso markers of alternative zzso zzso By contrast, classical zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso binds to zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso with the zzso zzso stimulates zzso zzso and alternative zzso zzso alternative zzso is blocked by zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that a zzso feedback loop drives alternative zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso function represents a novel therapeutic strategy in zzso associated with alternatively activated zzso
