Evidence is accumulating that zzso acids are involved in colon cancer development, but their molecular mechanisms remain zzso zzso acid has been reported to be associated with induction of the zzso zzso zzso Because the human zzso organic zzso zzso zzso is expressed in gastrointestinal zzso and might transport zzso acids to the zzso space, we studied the molecular mechanisms by which zzso acids induce the zzso of zzso and the role of zzso in zzso cell zzso 

zzso activity of zzso was measured using a human zzso zzso zzso under various zzso of zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha and zzso zzso responsive element zzso were zzso 

The zzso promoter was induced by zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso is the responsive element for zzso An zzso expression system revealed that zzso is responsible for induction of zzso By zzso using zzso of zzso we observed formation of a specific zzso complex, which was inhibited by a specific zzso against zzso and zzso A zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso 

These results indicate that zzso is zzso activated by the addition of zzso zzso and zzso and that zzso plays an important role by transporting zzso acid to the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso gene zzso consists of a zzso complex including zzso and zzso zzso Thus, this induction of zzso may participate in zzso and progression of zzso cancer zzso
