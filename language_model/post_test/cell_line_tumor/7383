Increased zzso zzso growth factor zzso expression has been reported in many types of human cancer and its levels are positively associated with advanced zzso Recently, zzso of zzso zzso of differentiation or DNA zzso protein was found in over zzso of zzso cancer samples and correlated with poor survival of zzso cancer zzso However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the role of zzso in zzso cancer are not zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of zzso on zzso cancer proliferation and its association with the zzso zzso To achieve this, we zzso an zzso expression zzso into three zzso cancer cell lines and examined cell proliferation rate by flow zzso and zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso expression led to increased cell proliferation demonstrated by increased zzso incorporation rate and zzso zzso The zzso cell growth was associated with zzso of zzso at both zzso and protein zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso through zzso of an zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso of zzso Our results indicate that increased zzso in zzso cancer cells may promote cancer cell proliferation through zzso of zzso Our findings also zzso that zzso may be a potential target for the development of novel strategies in the treatment of zzso zzso
