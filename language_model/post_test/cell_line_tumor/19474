zzso interference offers a novel approach for developing zzso for zzso genetic zzso The ability to inhibit expression of the zzso zzso without affecting zzso gene expression could be a powerful new treatment zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso responsible for the rare zzso skin disorder zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that small interfering zzso zzso can zzso and selectively block expression of zzso zzso To test whether lead zzso could discriminate zzso zzso in the presence of both zzso and zzso forms, a zzso PC cell culture model was zzso As predicted for a zzso disease, simultaneous expression of both zzso and zzso zzso resulted in defective zzso filament zzso zzso of zzso zzso allowed normal filament formation, suggesting selective zzso of zzso zzso The effectiveness of our zzso in skin was tested by zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter construct and zzso zzso to mouse zzso zzso zzso of the fluorescent reporter was demonstrated using the zzso zzso in zzso imaging zzso Additionally, wild zzso zzso knocked down the expression of pre-existing zzso zzso in human zzso These results suggest that efficient delivery of these zzso zzso may allow effective treatment of numerous genetic disorders including zzso
