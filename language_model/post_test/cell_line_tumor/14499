zzso embedded with silver zzso zzso zzso using a single step silver plasma immersion zzso zzso zzso demonstrate zzso effects that give rise to both controlled zzso activity and excellent zzso with zzso zzso electron zzso zzso shows that zzso with average sizes of about 5 zzso and 8 zzso are formed zzso on the titanium surface after undergoing zzso for zzso h and 1 zzso zzso zzso electron zzso zzso and X-ray zzso zzso zzso indicate that those zzso are metallic silver produced on and underneath the titanium surface via a local nucleation process from the solid solution of zzso The zzso samples inhibit the growth of both zzso zzso and zzso coli while enhancing proliferation of the zzso cell line zzso zzso polarization and zzso potential zzso demonstrate that the low surface toxicity and good zzso are related to the zzso effect between the zzso zzso and titanium zzso Our results show that the zzso properties of the zzso zzso are important in the control of the zzso and this study opens a new window for the design of zzso surfaces on which the biological actions of the zzso zzso can be accurately zzso
