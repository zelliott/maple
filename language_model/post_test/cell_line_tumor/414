The zzso system is a central mechanism for controlled zzso that regulates numerous cellular processes in zzso As such, defects in this system can contribute to disease zzso In this pathway, zzso zzso zzso provide platforms for binding specific zzso thereby zzso their zzso and subsequent degradation by the zzso Despite the identification of many zzso zzso zzso the identities of their specific zzso are still largely zzso The zzso zzso protein with a zzso of zzso signaling box 2 zzso gene that we initially identified as a zzso zzso gene in acute zzso leukemia cells encodes the specificity zzso of an zzso zzso zzso complex that is involved in zzso cell zzso We have recently identified zzso A and zzso B as the first zzso targets and shown that zzso triggers zzso and zzso degradation of these zzso Here a global quantitative zzso strategy is provided to identify zzso of zzso zzso zzso targeted to zzso zzso zzso we used zzso methods for zzso proteins identified by shotgun zzso in extracts of cells expressing zzso zzso or an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso under the control of an zzso zzso zzso of spectral count and mass zzso signal intensity demonstrated a drastic decrease of zzso A and zzso B in zzso leukemia cells expressing zzso zzso compared with cells expressing an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso we provide an original strategy that enables identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso that have to be zzso
