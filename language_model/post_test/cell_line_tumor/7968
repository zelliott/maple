Generally, zzso such as DNA, zzso and zzso cannot freely zzso into cells from outside the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are peptides containing a large number of basic zzso acids that can deliver zzso into living zzso zzso zzso delivery zzso peptides are more effective than other zzso peptides at carrying large molecules across cellular zzso In the present study, we demonstrated that AID peptides are able to deliver cargo proteins into living cells in both zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Human zzso cells were treated with a fluorescent protein zzso that was zzso zzso with another zzso zzso which zzso a different zzso After the delivery of carrier zzso and cargo zzso into cells, the zzso and merge of zzso were observed and recorded with a zzso zzso while the zzso efficiency was zzso analyzed with a flow zzso The optimal molecular ratio between carrier zzso and cargo zzso for zzso is about zzso Fluorescence resonance energy transfer zzso zzso further confirmed zzso can physically interact with its cargo zzso in zzso in zzso Potential zzso mechanisms of zzso may involve a combination of multiple zzso zzso After delivery, zzso zzso of zzso and zzso may possibly zzso with zzso These results will facilitate the understanding of multiple mechanisms of zzso and provide a powerful tool for simultaneously delivering several proteins or compounds in protein zzso
