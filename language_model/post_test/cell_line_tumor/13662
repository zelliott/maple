A series of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso derivatives was designed in zzso yields and evaluated for their zzso activity in a panel of human cancer cell lines, showing half maximum effective concentration varying from 700 zzso to zzso 100 zzso Interestingly, the replacement of a zzso group by a zzso one impacted very significantly the cap role on this zzso activity and on zzso zzso induced by these drugs in zzso but also in zzso zzso zzso suggesting an important role of the electronic density attached to the oxygen or sulfur zzso
