zzso play a role in the resistance of advanced zzso to zzso and zzso In this study, we show that high expression of the zzso zzso zzso compromises zzso tumor zzso zzso activity in human zzso zzso We found that depletion of the zzso zzso zzso increased zzso activity and zzso zzso However, when cells were treated with the zzso zzso zzso the protective effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso and cell survival was zzso In a functional zzso background, zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso thereby increasing the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was associated with a more aggressive zzso in brain tumors, and high zzso zzso gene expression was associated with decreased survival of patients with high-grade zzso Taken together, our findings indicate that negative zzso between zzso zzso and zzso supports zzso resistance to zzso providing zzso zzso that zzso zzso represents a therapeutic target for high-grade brain zzso zzso zzso of zzso may remain a therapeutic option in the subset of patients with high-grade zzso that express both functional zzso and a high level of zzso zzso
