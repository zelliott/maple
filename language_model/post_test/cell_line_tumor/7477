The zzso zzso domain, zzso family, zzso zzso zzso has recently emerged as a pivotal regulator of chronic zzso The aim of the present study was to determine whether zzso zzso is expressed in patients with zzso zzso artery disease) and whether statins zzso or zzso might affect zzso zzso In an zzso study, human zzso cells treated with statins were zzso for zzso zzso zzso The present study included 60 patients with zzso and 30 subjects without zzso zzso Patients with zzso randomly received either 8 months of treatment with zzso or zzso zzso zzso blood zzso zzso were obtained from peripheral blood at baseline and after 8 months of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured by real-time zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso were higher in the zzso group than in the zzso zzso There was a positive correlation between zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso clinical study has shown that zzso markedly diminished zzso zzso levels, whereas zzso had no impact on these zzso zzso of zzso zzso decreased in zzso cells treated with statins compared with those treated with vehicle, and the fold changes in zzso zzso were higher in zzso cells treated with zzso compared with those treated with zzso The present study suggests that zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso possibly contributing to the zzso effects of zzso on chronic inflammation and zzso progression in this zzso
