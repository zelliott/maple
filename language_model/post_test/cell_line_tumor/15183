zzso a mouse zzso basement membrane protein mixture, is frequently used to facilitate human tumor zzso growth in zzso Despite its known effects on tumor growth and zzso its impact on tumor zzso and zzso evaluation of zzso in tumor zzso has not been reported zzso zzso bilateral zzso tumors were established zzso with zzso or without zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso retention were zzso As compared to zzso tumors, zzso exhibited enhanced vascular zzso and zzso flow, greater blood vessel and zzso growth within the tumor core, and more deformation and collapse of zzso in zzso zzso zzso These changes were accompanied by reduced zzso retention in zzso The results suggest that zzso is not a passive medium for tumor growth, but rather significantly alters long-term tumor zzso These findings have significant implications for the evaluation of therapeutic zzso in zzso mouse zzso 

zzso is zzso in zzso human tumor zzso growth in zzso The authors demonstrate that zzso is not a passive medium for tumor zzso instead it significantly alters long-term tumor architecture, with major implications in the evaluation of therapeutic zzso in zzso mouse zzso
