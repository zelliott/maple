The zzso zzso zzso promotes concentration of zzso in zzso In cancer gene therapy, this zzso has potential as a reporter gene for molecular imaging of viral zzso and as a therapeutic protein promoting zzso zzso Here, we combined the imaging and therapeutic potential of zzso in an zzso zzso targeting zzso cancer zzso 

We generated an zzso zzso zzso zzso and capable of selective replication in zzso zzso zzso The selectivity of this virus was verified in zzso and in zzso Its spread in tumors was monitored in zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging upon zzso injection and confirmed by zzso zzso zzso was done through injection of therapeutic doses of zzso 

We showed in zzso and in zzso the selectivity of zzso and that zzso expression is restricted to the target zzso Imaging and zzso data showed that viral spread is limited and that the point of zzso zzso expression is reached 48 hours after a single zzso zzso Administration of a single therapeutic dose of zzso at this time point led to a dramatic reduction in tumor size not observed in zzso zzso 

This report showed for the first time that the combination of the imaging and therapeutic zzso of zzso can be applied to zzso zzso in experimental models of zzso
