zzso are zzso zzso zzso that rely upon the host cell for different steps in their life zzso The characterization of cellular genes required for virus infection and/or cell killing will be essential for understanding viral life cycles, and may provide cellular targets for new zzso zzso 

zzso genes required for zzso zzso infection were identified by zzso sequence zzso a process that permits rapid identification of genes disrupted by gene zzso One hundred zzso zzso resistant clones were selected from cell libraries containing 2 zzso 105 independently disrupted zzso of which 111 contained zzso in previously characterized genes and functionally anonymous zzso zzso zzso the genes associated with zzso resistance differed from genes targeted by random gene zzso in that known zzso hot spots were under represented, and a number of zzso appeared to cluster around specific cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso trafficking and zzso zzso several of the genes have been directly implicated in the replication of zzso and other viruses at different steps in the viral zzso 

zzso sequence zzso provides a zzso zzso strategy to identify candidate cellular genes required for virus zzso The candidate genes provide a starting point for zzso studies of cellular processes that participate in the virus zzso and may provide targets for novel zzso zzso
