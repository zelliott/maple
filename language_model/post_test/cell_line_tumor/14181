zzso is a key zzso factor in the zzso zzso zzso stress response zzso In a previous study, we suggested a possible link between zzso and bipolar disorder, but its role in zzso cells has not yet been zzso Here we examined the target genes of zzso using DNA zzso analysis in zzso cells zzso with an zzso zzso Among the genes zzso by zzso the most significant zzso was observed for zzso which is an zzso stress zzso zzso zzso the promoter region of zzso we found a zzso sequence zzso that is highly similar to the zzso stress response element zzso A promoter zzso showed that this zzso motif is critical for the regulation of zzso by zzso An zzso mobility shift zzso suggested that zzso does not directly bind to this zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso is one of the target genes of zzso in zzso zzso
