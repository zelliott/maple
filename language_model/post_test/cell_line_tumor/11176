zzso complexes offer potential reduced toxicity compared to current platinum zzso zzso zzso zzso alcohol zzso were zzso zzso and coordinated to an zzso zzso zzso These complexes were evaluated for activity against the cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso as well as for toxicity in the normal cell line zzso They were observed to be moderately active against only the zzso cells with the best zzso value of 34 zzso for the zzso complex zzso They also displayed excellent selectivity by being relatively inactive against the normal zzso cell line with zzso values ranging from zzso to zzso
