The zzso zzso a member of the zzso protein family, is zzso in many tumors including zzso zzso zzso Although recent studies showed that the elevated expression of zzso was associated with the stage and zzso zzso of zzso little is known about whether and how zzso contributes to zzso zzso Here we investigated the zzso expression in zzso zzso and cell lines, and explored the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of zzso in zzso development by examining cell proliferation and migration zzso and zzso in nude zzso The results show that zzso expression was markedly increased in zzso zzso and cell lines compared to normal colon zzso and a normal colon zzso zzso cell line, zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso or treatment with zzso zzso protein in zzso a zzso cell line with relative low zzso zzso resulted in enhanced cell proliferation and migration, and the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor growth zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso a zzso cell line with relative high zzso zzso resulted in reduced cell zzso migration and zzso zzso zzso proliferation was partially attenuated by an zzso inhibitor while migration was suppressed by a zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that the cellular effects of zzso are zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso of these pathways may be employed for zzso prevention and zzso
