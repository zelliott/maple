In this work, the zzso human bone zzso protein 2 zzso gene was cloned from zzso cells by zzso and the protein was expressed in zzso coli expression system, zzso by zzso column under zzso conditions and zzso at zzso by zzso zzso zzso We found that the protein zzso yield was increased with the increase of pH value from pH zzso to pH zzso The yield was zzso and zzso at pH zzso and pH zzso respectively, while that at pH zzso was only zzso The cell culture results showed that the zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso zzso dialysis had higher biological activity for zzso cell proliferation and differentiation than that zzso at pH zzso since pH zzso is closer to the conditions in zzso leading to the formation of zzso through the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the biological activity for zzso was promoted with the increase of zzso concentration in the cell culture zzso This work may be important for the in zzso production and biomedical application of zzso zzso
