To investigate the early diagnosis value of zzso zzso zzso responsible for zzso zzso of pancreatic zzso 

While building the animal models with pancreatic cancer and zzso zzso of pancreatic cancer of rats, we collected zzso from the model animals, and used the zzso chain reaction and restriction zzso zzso zzso to evaluate the point zzso at zzso zzso 12 of zzso gene in zzso Then, the above result was compared with pathological zzso 

The positive rates of zzso point zzso in zzso were zzso zzso for the model with zzso zzso of pancreatic cancer, and zzso zzso for the model with pancreatic cancer without zzso zzso For the model with zzso zzso of pancreatic cancer, the sensitivity, zzso positive prediction or negative prediction value of surveying zzso zzso in zzso was zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

Both the zzso and the specificity of zzso gene zzso at zzso 12 in zzso are zzso Our above work can supply a new zzso filter method for the early diagnosis of zzso zzso of pancreatic zzso
