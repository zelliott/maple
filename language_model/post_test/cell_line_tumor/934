We cloned recently an alternatively spliced zzso of zzso zzso that lacked zzso 7 at the zzso region and showed differences in zzso suppression when compared with the zzso zzso These findings indicated that the zzso region of zzso is critical for its zzso zzso zzso In this study, we isolated a zzso clone of zzso a member of the zzso protein family, which zzso specifically with the zzso zzso domain of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso We renamed it zzso zzso interacting zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso mouse colon cancer cells showed increased zzso and early zzso zzso in zzso as well as increased zzso and zzso to zzso in zzso compared with parental zzso Moreover, increased levels of zzso were observed in a human gastric tumor and its zzso zzso compared with the normal adjacent zzso Our results indicate that zzso promotes zzso and invasion of cancer cells in zzso and in zzso and suggest that zzso zzso in the regulation of the tumor formation and zzso by interacting with zzso a zzso zzso and zzso zzso strategy that can be used to inhibit zzso in various zzso
