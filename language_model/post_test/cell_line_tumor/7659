zzso instability zzso resulting from loss of functional DNA mismatch repair was recently found in various zzso zzso In coding zzso zzso leads to zzso zzso zzso and the production of zzso altered proteins which are foreign to the immune zzso Here, we wondered whether these zzso zzso zzso sequences represent zzso zzso also for zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

A total of 33 coding region zzso were examined in zzso zzso cell lines for the presence of zzso zzso recognition of zzso cells by established zzso zzso T cell lines was zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In each experiment, zzso zzso cell lines and zzso targets zzso loaded with the zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso activity towards zzso cells was zzso by standard zzso release zzso zzso 

zzso profiling of 33 coding zzso zzso in nine zzso zzso cell lines revealed instability in at least nine zzso In each cell line, a distinct zzso profile was zzso Only three of the 33 zzso were zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso T cells specifically zzso zzso zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso 5 zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, specific killing of zzso 5 zzso and zzso zzso expressing zzso cell lines was achieved in functional zzso zzso 

Data presented here expand the importance of zzso as shared and general zzso zzso zzso they open new avenues for specific zzso not only for solid but also for zzso zzso zzso
