zzso zzso drugs zzso such as aspirin have been shown to suppress zzso factor zzso which controls the expression of genes such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso leading to zzso of proliferation of tumor zzso There is no systematic study as to how these drugs differ in their ability to suppress zzso zzso and zzso gene expression or cell zzso In the present study, we investigated the effect of almost a dozen different commonly used zzso on tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene products, and on cell zzso zzso an zzso zzso was included for comparison with zzso As indicated by DNA zzso none of the drugs alone activated zzso All compounds inhibited zzso zzso zzso but with highly variable zzso The 50% zzso concentration required was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All drugs inhibited zzso zzso and suppressed zzso degradation and zzso reporter gene zzso They also suppressed zzso zzso and zzso D1 protein expression in a zzso zzso All compounds inhibited the proliferation of tumor cells, with 50% zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso these results indicate that aspirin and zzso are least zzso while zzso zzso zzso and tamoxifen are the most potent zzso and zzso agents of those we zzso
