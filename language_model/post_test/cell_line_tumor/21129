The aim of this study was to investigate the zzso activity of human urine extract against zzso syndrome zzso zzso cells in zzso and in zzso 

The zzso anemia with excess of blasts zzso zzso cell line was used to examine the effects of a human urine preparation, zzso on the induction of growth arrest and zzso zzso zzso including zzso family, zzso family, the inhibitor of zzso protein zzso family, and the zzso zzso protein zzso as well as cell zzso proteins were zzso The zzso 3 zzso zzso survival signaling zzso and the zzso zzso were also zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso was used to examine the involvement of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso was used to examine the involvement of the zzso signaling zzso in this zzso zzso zzso cell zzso serious combined zzso disease mice were used for the in zzso zzso 

We found that zzso could induce growth arrest and zzso of zzso cells in zzso and in zzso The main mechanisms were related to the zzso of zzso expression at the zzso level, which zzso the zzso of zzso involving the prevention zzso zzso and nuclear zzso the zzso of the zzso family and zzso zzso and the zzso of the Bad zzso which then triggered the zzso of the zzso zzso This phenomenon could be inhibited by the zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso 

Our results demonstrate the presence of active components in the human urine extract that can induce the growth arrest and zzso of zzso zzso cells and may involve the zzso signaling zzso in a zzso zzso This may provide new insights for the treatment of high-risk zzso
