zzso tumor cells maintain their zzso via an alternative lengthening of zzso zzso zzso This process involves the association of zzso with zzso leukemia nuclear bodies zzso Here, the mobility of both zzso and zzso as well as their interactions were studied in human zzso zzso cells, in which the zzso zzso is zzso A zzso cell line was constructed that had zzso operator repeats zzso integrated adjacent to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso By zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso bound to the zzso zzso the zzso mobility during zzso was traced and correlated with the zzso repeat zzso A confined diffusion model was derived that describes zzso dynamics in the nucleus on the time scale from seconds to zzso Two zzso groups were identified that differed with respect to the nuclear space accessible to zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso relative to zzso and their complexes with zzso were zzso Based on these studies, a model is proposed in which the zzso of zzso results in an increased mobility that could facilitate the formation of complexes between zzso and zzso
