zzso cancer is the fourth leading cause of zzso deaths, in which the zzso survival rate is less than zzso Current standard of care therapies offer little selectivity and high zzso zzso zzso approaches are desperately zzso Although prior work suggested that zzso zzso could be used for the treatment of pancreatic zzso the lack of knowledge of the zzso mechanism of action prevented optimal use of this zzso 

We examined the role of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso activity, using a series of zzso zzso pancreatic cancer clones varying in zzso levels by stable zzso zzso The zzso efficacy of zzso was determined using an optimal zzso zzso vehicle zzso in zzso pancreatic cancer zzso 

zzso cell death required zzso zzso units of zzso Essential downstream zzso of zzso were as zzso zzso zzso oxygen species zzso zzso zzso DNA breaks induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dramatic zzso zzso and zzso programmed zzso We showed that 1 regimen of zzso therapy (5 treatments every other day) zzso zzso and reduced human pancreatic tumor burden and dramatically extended the survival of zzso mice, using zzso pancreatic cancer zzso 

Because zzso zzso activities are easily measured and commonly zzso zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso zzso to zzso above normal zzso strategies using zzso to zzso treat pancreatic zzso are zzso On the basis of optimal drug zzso and zzso zzso zzso such a therapy should be extremely safe and not accompanied with normal tissue toxicity or zzso zzso
