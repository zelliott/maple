zzso is a structurally and functionally unique member of the inhibitor of zzso protein zzso zzso It plays an important role, not only in regulating zzso but also in zzso zzso The current literature contains few reports on the zzso regulation of zzso expression in lung zzso 

In this study, we investigated the effect of zzso zzso zzso on the zzso activity of the zzso promoter in zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso zzso was used to detect the expression of zzso and zzso in the lung tissue of 120 patients with zzso cell lung cancer zzso and 40 patients with benign pulmonary zzso We also performed experiments with the lung zzso cell line zzso cells, which were cultured under hypoxic zzso The expression of zzso and zzso was detected by real-time zzso and Western zzso In the zzso promoter the putative zzso for zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso upstream of zzso We performed zzso zzso of this binding site, and used zzso reporter plasmids to determine the relative activity of the zzso promoter in zzso zzso We also studied the effect of zzso on the expression of zzso by zzso targeting of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso were both zzso in zzso and their expressions correlated with one zzso They were also expressed in zzso cells under normal and hypoxic conditions, with a significant increase under hypoxic zzso Site directed zzso of the putative binding site for zzso in the zzso promoter significantly decreased the activity of the zzso promoter in zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso decreased the expression of zzso in zzso cell zzso 

Our results indicate that the binding of zzso to the zzso promoter increases zzso of the zzso zzso Thus, zzso is an important zzso regulator of zzso zzso
