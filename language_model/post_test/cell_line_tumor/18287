The zzso network of zzso regulators controls distinct aspects of cell zzso including cell proliferation and zzso Within the network MAD proteins antagonize the functions of zzso zzso and the latter are zzso in the majority of human zzso While zzso zzso cells to zzso signals, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to a broad range of zzso including zzso The molecular targets of zzso that mediate zzso of zzso are not zzso Here we describe the zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso ten zzso tumor zzso gene as a target of zzso By binding to the zzso promoter region, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso functions as a zzso zzso that regulates the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso repression of zzso led to zzso of zzso and subsequent stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso function affected the control of zzso zzso by zzso In addition, zzso of zzso using small interfering zzso zzso or the lack of zzso rendered cells insensitive to zzso of zzso by zzso These findings identify the zzso gene as a target of the zzso zzso and provide a molecular framework critical for the ability of zzso to inhibit zzso
