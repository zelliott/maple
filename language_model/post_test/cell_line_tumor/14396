We have shown previously that our zzso zzso zzso protein synthesis and zzso zzso in human breast cancer zzso In attempts to further zzso the zzso pathways implicated in its cellular effects, we found that the zzso induced an initial stress response, which rapidly caused an imbalance in the cellular energy status with an increase in zzso oxygen zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso a sensor of increased cellular zzso ratio, was activated by zzso An zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso preceded and overlapped zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso occurred already at a dose level too low to induce any zzso changes in the zzso machinery or protein zzso In contrast, zzso even at a concentration causing a zzso zzso of protein zzso did neither affect the zzso level nor activate zzso and zzso zzso of the cells with the specific zzso inhibitor compound C and zzso inhibitor zzso blocked zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, and subsequently zzso the cells to zzso cell zzso Whereas the zzso zzso blocked the generation of zzso oxygen species and zzso of zzso and zzso it did not block zzso zzso Together, the results show that zzso zzso several parallel signaling events, observed initially as an early zzso of survival zzso protecting the cells against the toxic effects of the zzso followed by subsequent zzso induction and protein synthesis zzso zzso therapeutic manipulation of the signaling zzso zzso and zzso might provide a means to maximize the zzso effects of the zzso zzso
