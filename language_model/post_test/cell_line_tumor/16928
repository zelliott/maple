The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induction of early growth response zzso zzso which is rapidly induced in the zzso following zzso zzso zzso Acute zzso was induced in mice by hourly zzso injection of zzso zzso was administered zzso and pancreatic inflammation was zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso M zzso in presence of different concentration of zzso The expression of zzso zzso and the target genes of zzso were studied by real-time reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso Western zzso and zzso In zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso diminished zzso zzso and protein expression corresponding to zzso In zzso treatment with zzso prior to the zzso injection of zzso induction of zzso and its target genes such as, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inflammatory zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on zzso expression induced by zzso was almost fully restored by zzso zzso of zzso suppressed the zzso of zzso and its inflammatory gene targets and provided potent protection against zzso zzso These data suggest a new mechanism in which zzso zzso may decrease tissue inflammation in response to a zzso zzso
