zzso zzso formerly zzso is a potent zzso zzso inhibitor that has the potential to treat solid zzso The current studies evaluated the potency and zzso activity of zzso as a single agent and in combination with zzso or zzso 

zzso activity was tested in zzso in a panel of 13 zzso cell lines and zzso efficacy was tested in zzso in various breast cancer zzso 

zzso inhibited cellular proliferation in breast zzso cell zzso 50% zzso zzso ranged from 8 zzso in zzso cells to approximately 30 zzso in zzso zzso Single dose and weekly intravenous treatments with zzso 30 and 150 zzso produced significant zzso activity in the zzso human breast zzso zzso model, with no major zzso compared with vehicle zzso zzso Daily administration of zzso 15 zzso for 10 days was not well zzso whereas the total dose of 150 zzso was safe when administered in a single zzso zzso 3 and 30 zzso given after zzso in the nude mouse zzso zzso model produced tumor growth delays that were greater than those observed with either agent alone and with no toxicity as evaluated on the basis of body weight reduction zzso Furthermore, zzso 3 zzso in combination with zzso produced more than additive effects and the combination was well zzso However, zzso at a dose of 30 zzso in combination with zzso was zzso zzso also exhibited potent zzso activity against zzso human zzso cells, zzso zzso mouse breast tumors, and chemically induced rat zzso zzso 

The data suggest that zzso may be useful as a single agent or a component of combination chemotherapy regimens for treating human breast zzso
