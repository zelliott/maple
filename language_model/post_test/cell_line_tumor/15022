zzso zzso of nuclear zzso zzso zzso by the gene zzso is required for zzso and its expression is zzso in zzso bone zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso have been described that zzso a zzso and a putative zzso form of zzso We identify a zzso transcript zzso that extends the originally identified transcript zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that this zzso transcript zzso is expressed by the human zzso cell line, zzso and by both primary human T cells and zzso T zzso Of relevance to the production of zzso in zzso bone loss, expression of this zzso zzso transcript is zzso in zzso T cells and primary human T cells upon zzso Furthermore, this transcript can be translated and zzso in zzso T cells in zzso and is able to support zzso zzso Our data highlight the complexity of the zzso zzso zzso and demonstrate the potential for the expression of alternate zzso transcripts zzso zzso and zzso forms of zzso zzso of alternate zzso transcripts zzso different zzso protein zzso should be carefully considered and specifically examined in future studies, particularly those implicating zzso in zzso bone zzso
