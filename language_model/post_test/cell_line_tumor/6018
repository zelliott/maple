zzso binds to the pointed ends of zzso filaments and zzso zzso zzso The zzso location of zzso is between the zzso and zzso gene clusters on human zzso 6, and the zzso of this protein is predominantly distributed in the zzso zzso and peripheral zzso However, the distribution of zzso in zzso cell populations and the zzso zzso have not yet been zzso In this study, an zzso zzso zzso zzso that recognizes zzso zzso of zzso was prepared and used to examine the zzso zzso and distribution of zzso in white blood cell populations and in zzso zzso It was found that zzso is mainly concentrated at the cell periphery and zzso with zzso zzso In addition, zzso was abundant in helper zzso zzso zzso mature zzso zzso zzso natural killer cells, and zzso as well as in the zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is expressed in the mature zzso of the zzso zzso but not in the immature zzso of the zzso zzso Taken together, zzso is a ubiquitous protein in zzso and it may play an important role in modulating the cellular functions of zzso
