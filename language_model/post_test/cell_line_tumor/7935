The effect of zzso zzso zzso on cell survival was studied by using zzso zzso zzso cell lung zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso showed that zzso significantly increased the viability of zzso zzso cells compared to the control cells, though zzso at high concentration zzso 300 zzso had no protective effect against serum zzso cell zzso Western blots showed increased zzso for zzso and zzso in zzso zzso To determine the mechanism for zzso zzso cells were zzso with various zzso zzso before exposure to zzso Only zzso inhibited zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso proteins were significantly zzso whereas zzso expression was not zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso have no role in the increased cell survival caused by zzso This study has shown that zzso protects zzso cells from zzso induced by serum deprivation via zzso zzso and this protective effect may limit the clinical use of zzso in treating and preventing zzso
