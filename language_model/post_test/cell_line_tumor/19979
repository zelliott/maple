We developed a new zzso treatment, which is a combination of zzso agents and low electric zzso In the present study we investigated its efficacy against prostate zzso transgenic zzso of mice zzso 

Mice with 5, 10, and 13 zzso in diameter zzso tumors received Low Electric Field Cancer zzso zzso zzso with zzso (10 zzso and monitored for survival, and primary and zzso tumors zzso 

The electric field increased the zzso of zzso by zzso cells in zzso In zzso use of zzso reduced tumor size, prolonged survival, and cured zzso of the animals, dependent on treated tumor zzso zzso was more effective than surgery with or without zzso Part of the cured animals developed zzso immunity and zzso significantly decreased the effectiveness of the zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso is an effective method for the destruction of zzso prostate zzso
