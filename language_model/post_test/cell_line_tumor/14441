Recent studies suggest that the ability to form and grow tumors specifically resides in a small cell population called cancer stem cells zzso These studies were conducted mainly on various human zzso however, isolation and characterization of stem cells from zzso have not been zzso The molecular markers zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso are widely used, individually or in zzso to characterize some types of zzso In this study, we used these markers to identify a zzso of cells in zzso zzso zzso with cancer zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso cells zzso were present in human zzso zzso The expression of a zzso zzso zzso zzso was consistent with primary zzso and could be duplicated during serial in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells isolated from 3 zzso zzso showed high zzso potential compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso cells exhibited the stem cell properties of zzso and ability to produce zzso zzso We report the identification of a zzso population in zzso characterized by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our findings could provide new insight into the zzso of zzso and offer a potential target for zzso zzso
