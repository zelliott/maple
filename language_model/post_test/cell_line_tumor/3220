In this experimental study, the influence of zzso zzso zzso on tumor recurrence in the lung was zzso A zzso human in zzso zzso was developed to study the zzso of zzso colon zzso cells to zzso of zzso zzso cells of the lung zzso or human zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso of zzso with zzso active zzso of zzso and zzso but not with zzso resulted in at least zzso zzso compared to control zzso zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso and zzso was zzso and zzso zzso results were found for zzso zzso cell zzso was not increased after zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso and zzso were only expressed on zzso creating more binding possibilities for zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso significantly decreased tumor cell zzso to zzso however, it did not affect tumor cell zzso to zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso zzso did not affect zzso Our results prove zzso and zzso promote tumor cell zzso to zzso in zzso and may therefore account for enhanced tumor recurrence in the lung seen after major surgical zzso The zzso of zzso to zzso is zzso by zzso zzso whereas the zzso to zzso is not zzso by these zzso Probably not one but a complex of zzso molecules is responsible for enhanced zzso to zzso
