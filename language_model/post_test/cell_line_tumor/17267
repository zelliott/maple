zzso disease zzso is characterized by cerebral deposits of zzso zzso zzso which are surrounded by zzso zzso zzso studies have shown that prolonged use of zzso zzso drugs zzso reduces the risk of developing zzso In addition, biological data indicate that certain zzso specifically lower zzso levels in cultures of peripheral cells independently of zzso zzso activity and reduce cerebral zzso levels in zzso transgenic zzso Whether other zzso including zzso compounds, zzso zzso levels in zzso cells remains zzso Here, we investigated the effects of compounds from every chemical class of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso using both zzso cells and rat primary cortical zzso Among zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso not only of zzso but also of zzso Surprisingly, both zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso selective compounds significantly increased zzso zzso and either did not alter zzso zzso or reduced zzso zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso fragments and zzso zzso were not altered by any of the zzso indicating that zzso activity was not overall changed by these zzso The present findings show that only a few zzso zzso possess zzso properties and therefore have a profile potentially relevant to their clinical use in zzso
