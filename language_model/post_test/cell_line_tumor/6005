Nerve growth factor zzso is a zzso factor that plays an important role in zzso cell development and zzso zzso acid zzso a zzso constituent of the herb zzso zzso zzso production in human zzso zzso cells, but the mechanism through which it works remains zzso In the present study, we found a zzso zzso factor, zzso which coordinates the expression of zzso phase 2 zzso also zzso in zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, CA caused zzso gene induction in a zzso and zzso manner without altering zzso zzso zzso zzso CA increased zzso nuclear zzso and activated expression of zzso zzso target genes such as zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso In addition, zzso gene expression was enhanced by zzso of zzso an zzso zzso in the absence of zzso Furthermore, CA induced zzso expression in normal human zzso in an zzso zzso These results highlight a role of zzso in zzso gene expression in zzso zzso
