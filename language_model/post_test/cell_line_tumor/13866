The molecular and pharmacological properties of zzso receptors in the zzso human zzso zzso zzso cell line were assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production and zzso zzso zzso experiments detected the presence of transcripts for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors but not for the zzso A3 zzso Application of specific zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso increases in zzso calcium zzso with the following order of potency and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This rank order of potency is typical of zzso zzso zzso In addition, select zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso blocked the zzso calcium zzso Additionally, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso formation with a rank order of potency characteristic of zzso zzso zzso The select zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to antagonize the zzso response, whereas the potent and highly selective zzso zzso zzso MRS zzso and MRS zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso Lastly, zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by MRS zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso zzso and zzso production as well as zzso zzso is zzso through the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cell zzso
