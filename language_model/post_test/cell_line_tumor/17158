zzso zzso zzso zzso is considered the zzso stage of prostate zzso but little is known of its initiation and zzso The identification of genes associated with these precursors of prostate cancer may zzso the pathways of the early zzso of this zzso Previously, we have reported that zzso a member of the zzso zzso acted as an zzso growth factor in prostate zzso We used laser capture zzso zzso amplification zzso zzso zzso and complementary DNA zzso to examine gene expression profiles in zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that 28 genes were zzso expressed (13 and 15 genes were zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis identified 29 and 56 more genes (4 zzso zzso and zzso respectively, suggesting that DNA zzso is a more effective method in screening gene zzso We have validated the known genes identified by both zzso zzso and zzso technologies, using Northern zzso analysis in the zzso libraries generated from cells zzso from pathological zzso We have successfully showed that at least 13 genes are involved in zzso zzso The evaluation of candidate genes that emerge from these experiments provides a rational approach to investigate those genes significant in evolution from zzso to prostate zzso
