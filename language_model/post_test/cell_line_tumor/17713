zzso signals contribute to either type 1 or type 2 T cell zzso Here, we show that administration of zzso fusion proteins to zzso mice zzso tumor zzso by promoting the differentiation of zzso type 2 zzso zzso T cells along with zzso zzso zzso zzso was not induced in zzso and zzso zzso However, it was zzso in zzso and zzso zzso By contrast, zzso tumor zzso occurred in zzso and zzso mice, but not in zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso treatment was effective in a tumor model not responsive to zzso zzso administration zzso elevated levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso was predominantly zzso by zzso T cells, although the induction of these zzso cells required zzso T zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso T cells alone was inhibited by zzso the zzso produced during zzso zzso Thus, these results indicate that stimulation in zzso of zzso with zzso in zzso mice results in enhanced induction of zzso type 2 zzso T cells zzso leading to zzso tumor zzso
