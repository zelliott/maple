zzso cells zzso are the most potent zzso cells and are the zzso of T cell zzso Many investigators have explored the potential of using zzso as a vaccine for zzso zzso in zzso of B cell zzso and the results have been zzso To search for better zzso zzso to improve the efficacy of zzso zzso in zzso we evaluated and compared the efficacy of the vaccination of zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso myeloma mouse zzso Our results showed that zzso or zzso zzso DC vaccines protected mice efficiently against developing zzso retarded zzso growth, induced zzso zzso against established zzso and protected surviving mice from zzso zzso The therapeutic responses were associated with an induction of strong zzso immune responses, including zzso or zzso zzso and cellular immune responses including zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso type 1 T helper cells and memory T cells in mice receiving zzso or zzso zzso DC zzso In addition, our studies showed that zzso zzso zzso were more potent vaccines than the zzso DC vaccines to promote zzso immunity in the zzso This information will be important for improving the strategies of zzso zzso for patients with myeloma and other B cell zzso
