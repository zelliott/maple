zzso zzso are believed to have fundamental roles in zzso and have great potential for the diagnosis and treatment of zzso However, the roles of zzso in zzso zzso are still not fully zzso We investigated the zzso expressed zzso involved in zzso by comparison of zzso expression profiles in zzso zzso with normal primary human zzso and 37 zzso zzso were screened out by twofold change with a significant difference ( zzso zzso analysis based on 13 zzso with changes over zzso showed that the zzso expression patterns between the zzso and normal zzso were clearly zzso Among the 13 zzso we found that zzso was significantly zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso of zzso in liver cancer cells decreased cell zzso zzso zzso and also induced zzso arrest and zzso To unveil the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso in zzso cells described above, we examined the putative targets using zzso tools and found that zzso elevated zzso zzso was a potential target of zzso Then we demonstrated that zzso bound directly to the zzso region of zzso and inhibited the expression of zzso zzso quantitative reverse zzso and western zzso analysis showed that zzso expression was zzso correlated with zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso in zzso cells, similar to zzso zzso suppressed tumor zzso zzso expression of zzso conversely, could partially reverse the zzso effects of zzso In a mouse model, therapeutic administration of zzso zzso zzso mimics zzso could significantly suppress the growth of zzso zzso in nude zzso In conclusion, our findings indicate that zzso targets zzso in zzso and suppresses liver cancer cell growth in zzso and in zzso and highlight the therapeutic potential of zzso in zzso zzso
