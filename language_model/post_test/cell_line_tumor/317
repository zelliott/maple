Previous studies have shown biological activity of zzso an active compound extracted from zzso zzso in pancreatic cancer zzso however, zzso animal studies are zzso Here, we report, for the first time, the zzso effect of zzso to conventional zzso agents both in zzso and in zzso using an zzso model of pancreatic zzso In zzso studies revealed that zzso of cells with zzso zzso zzso for 48 h followed by zzso or zzso resulted in zzso to zzso growth zzso compared with zzso to zzso when zzso or zzso was used zzso Moreover, we found that zzso could zzso the killing of pancreatic cancer cells induced by zzso agents by zzso of nuclear zzso zzso zzso family, and zzso zzso genes zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso As shown previously by our laboratory, zzso gets activated on exposure of pancreatic cancer cells to conventional zzso zzso interestingly, zzso was able to zzso zzso in zzso resulting in zzso In addition to in zzso results, here we show for the first time, that zzso in combination with zzso and/or zzso is much more effective as an zzso agent compared with either agent zzso Most importantly, our data also showed that a specific target, such as zzso was zzso in animal tumors zzso with zzso followed by zzso and/or zzso These results provide strong in zzso molecular evidence in support of our hypothesis that zzso could abrogate zzso or zzso zzso of zzso resulting in the zzso of pancreatic tumors to conventional zzso
