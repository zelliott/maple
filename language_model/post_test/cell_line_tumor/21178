Two human zzso zzso cell lines, which we designated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were established from the zzso fluid containing zzso zzso cells of a zzso Japanese zzso These cell lines were separated by the colonial techniques from the initiation of the primary cultures and grew well without interruption for 12 zzso They were characterized as producing zzso zzso These cell lines displayed different biological zzso including zzso zzso and zzso using with zzso array zzso The zzso zzso cells were zzso in shape and zzso into the zzso of nude mice, while the cells of the zzso zzso line were zzso and zzso into the zzso of zzso cheek zzso but not into the zzso of nude zzso The zzso are classified into three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mixed zzso The gene copy number losses observed on zzso zzso zzso among others may be a major mechanism of zzso zzso zzso We considered and supported the combination theory for the zzso of zzso zzso
