zzso cultured within a three-dimensional zzso in zzso environment have the ability to acquire zzso and respond to stimuli analogous to in zzso biological zzso This approach has been zzso in tissue engineering and can also be applied to the development of a zzso relevant in zzso tumor zzso In this study, collagen I zzso cultured with zzso human breast cancer cells were zzso as a platform for in zzso solid tumor zzso The zzso and zzso interactions present during in zzso tissue progression were encouraged within the zzso zzso architecture, and the zzso of collagen I supported zzso cellular zzso The development of necrosis beyond a depth of zzso zzso and the expression of zzso factor zzso were demonstrated in the in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso diffusion limitations through the collagen I zzso as well as competition for available nutrients resulted in growing levels of zzso zzso zzso by a statistically significant zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso The zzso tumors also demonstrated promising zzso potential with a statistically significant zzso zzso zzso zzso of vascular zzso growth factor zzso gene zzso In addition, comparable gene expression analysis demonstrated a statistically significant increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso cells cultured in the zzso collagen I zzso compared to cells cultured in a zzso on two-dimensional tissue culture zzso The results presented in this study demonstrate the capacity of collagen I zzso to facilitate the development of zzso in zzso zzso tumors that are representative of the zzso stages of in zzso solid tumor zzso
