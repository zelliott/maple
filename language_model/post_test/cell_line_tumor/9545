To improve tumor control in lung zzso using a novel method: unilateral zzso of the lung by zzso of zzso starch zzso zzso and zzso agents via the zzso zzso 

A zzso model of solitary zzso zzso zzso was zzso The animals were zzso into three groups: the control group receiving zzso zzso zzso zzso an isolated lung zzso zzso group zzso zzso starch solution and zzso (15 zzso and a third group receiving zzso with zzso (15 zzso and zzso (2 zzso The total platinum concentration in serum, lung and lung tumor at defined times zzso 30, 60, 120 zzso was measured using an zzso coupled plasma mass zzso zzso 

The area under concentration zzso versus time zzso showed a zzso to zzso higher concentration in the tumor tissue comparing the zzso and zzso group to the control group zzso zzso zzso In the comparison of the zzso of zzso versus zzso the tumor tissue of the lung showed a zzso higher concentration in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso 

This is the first study to measure the concentration of zzso during zzso of the zzso Compared to intravenous therapy, zzso produced higher tumor tissue zzso Comparing zzso to zzso there was also an increase of zzso in the tumor zzso without zzso damage of the surrounding lung zzso
