zzso are steroid hormones that strongly influence zzso zzso metabolism by increasing the zzso rate of zzso zzso a key zzso of zzso and suppress the immune system through the zzso zzso zzso The liver X receptors zzso on the other hand, bind to cholesterol zzso zzso with the zzso X zzso zzso and regulate the cholesterol zzso the zzso zzso metabolism by decreasing the expression of zzso and repress a set of inflammatory genes in immune zzso Since the actions of these receptors overlap with each other, we evaluated the zzso between the zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso and gene zzso methods using zzso for zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of certain zzso response element zzso promoters in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso attenuated zzso zzso of circulating zzso in zzso It also suppressed zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso in rats, mice and human zzso zzso cells, whereas zzso zzso zzso were required for zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis of rat liver, zzso zzso regulated zzso zzso activity of about zzso of zzso zzso zzso To examine the mechanism through which activated zzso attenuated zzso zzso activity, we examined zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso bound zzso and inhibited zzso binding to these DNA sequences both in in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso while their zzso proteins did so on classic or zzso zzso in gel mobility shift zzso We propose that administration of zzso zzso may be beneficial in zzso zzso or zzso zzso states by directly and zzso attenuating the zzso activity of the zzso on zzso and/or zzso zzso
