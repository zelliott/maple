Studies indicate that the zzso zzso functions in the zzso regulation of zzso We have shown that as in zzso components of the zzso zzso are crucial for regulating zzso zzso zzso events in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso and to zzso zzso zzso and, in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso is dramatically decreased at zzso zzso Research in zzso further indicates that the zzso of zzso zzso is a link between zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso To characterize the role that the zzso zzso plays in regulating additional zzso zzso we examined the zzso and zzso status of zzso at zzso zzso zzso We find that zzso is crucial for regulating zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are dramatically zzso but the loss of zzso has no significant effect on zzso or zzso Our observation that a zzso of zzso interacts with additional zzso zzso zzso zzso but fails to bind the zzso promoter in the absence of zzso strongly implicates zzso in recruiting zzso complexes responsible for initiating zzso zzso
