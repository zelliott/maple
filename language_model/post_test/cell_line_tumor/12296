To investigate the zzso effects and molecular mechanism of zzso B on the human acute zzso leukemia zzso cells compared with other zzso zzso 

The effects of four zzso on the growth of zzso and zzso cells were studied by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected through zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso B on the cell cycle of zzso cells were studied by zzso zzso zzso The change in zzso membrane potential was detected by zzso 123 zzso The zzso c release and zzso 3 activity were checked by zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso family proteins was detected by Western zzso 

Our data revealed that zzso B strongly induced human zzso leukemia cell death in a zzso and zzso manner by zzso zzso but not on normal zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso cell death was considered to be zzso by observing the typical zzso zzso change by zzso zzso zzso The induction of human zzso leukemia cancer cell death was caused by an induction of zzso through zzso membrane potential change, zzso c release, zzso proportion increase, zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso expression and zzso of zzso 3 zzso 

These results clearly demonstrated that zzso B is able to inhibit proliferation by induction of zzso cells and cell zzso Moreover, the zzso effects of zzso B were related to zzso zzso and zzso 3 zzso in human zzso leukemia zzso
