zzso cancer zzso cells expressed zzso protein zzso C zzso activity that under zzso conditions suppressed zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso activity, assessed using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was diminished by zzso zzso and enhanced by zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso inhibited these zzso The cells expressed conventional zzso zzso zzso and novel zzso zzso zzso and the effects of zzso zzso on zzso binding were blocked by zzso zzso The zzso of zzso binding by zzso was enhanced by zzso acid and blocked by zzso zzso However, when some zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were used at higher zzso zzso zzso they had a different effect characterized by a dramatic increase in zzso binding and an zzso of zzso zzso zzso The specificity of the agents implicated novel zzso in this response and indeed, the zzso of zzso zzso formation was reproduced by zzso or zzso zzso The zzso of zzso formation appeared to be specific to zzso since it was not observed in response to zzso zzso analyses indicated that the zzso agents modulated zzso zzso zzso not zzso number or zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso in zzso regulation of zzso zzso function by two zzso zzso conventional zzso inhibit zzso zzso binding and zzso and zzso novel zzso maintain the ability of zzso to stimulate zzso Since zzso can activate zzso upon binding to its zzso it is possible that zzso zzso is also subject to zzso regulation by zzso
