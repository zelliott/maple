zzso zzso zzso are principal participants in tumor zzso In addition to serve as a useful zzso marker, zzso expression may also provide a target for the diagnostic in zzso imaging of tumors, using a zzso zzso This study investigates the use of membrane type 1 zzso as target for in zzso tumor zzso zzso binding of the zzso tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso to zzso has been previously zzso In this study, zzso and imaging experiments were performed on zzso zzso and control zzso zzso mice using zzso human zzso zzso as zzso and zzso as zzso The expression profile was controlled in zzso and on tumor zzso zzso as well as zzso were labeled using the zzso method and zzso zzso of zzso showed a tumor zzso of zzso zzso at 3 hours zzso in zzso zzso values of zzso and zzso evaluated in zzso and zzso respectively, were significantly zzso zzso imaging revealed significant zzso of zzso in zzso compared with zzso background zzso This could not be observed in zzso and with zzso in zzso All tumors were well established zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso holds potential for development of zzso for in zzso imaging in zzso zzso but not in similar tumors that do not express this zzso
