The epidemiology of zzso zzso demonstrates a strong gender bias with a sex ratio of zzso in favor of zzso A potential explanation for this is that zzso might protect against zzso zzso zzso has previously been shown to stimulate zzso in zzso zzso cancer zzso However, the effect of zzso on zzso zzso cells has not been zzso We used zzso analysis to determine the expression of zzso zzso cell zzso marker zzso and proliferation marker zzso in cell lines derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso and Barrett's esophagus zzso zzso zzso zzso and selective zzso zzso zzso zzso effects on cell growth were determined by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso cell labeling and flow zzso We detected that zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso decreased cell growth in zzso zzso zzso In Barrett's esophagus cells zzso zzso decreased growth was also detected in response to zzso The level of zzso zzso expression in the cell lines correlated with the level of zzso effects induced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso treatments were associated with a decrease in the expression of zzso and an increase in zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso This study suggests that zzso zzso and Barrett's esophagus cells respond to treatment with selective zzso zzso zzso resulting in decreased cell growth and zzso Further research to explore potential therapeutic applications is zzso
