zzso M zzso targets the basic zzso acids zzso and zzso present at the zzso of peptides or zzso zzso is thought to be involved in inflammatory zzso This is zzso by zzso trimming and zzso of inflammatory factors, and expression of the zzso in inflammatory zzso Since the function of zzso in and beyond inflammation remains mainly zzso the identification of natural zzso can aid in discovering the zzso role of zzso zzso with its three zzso basic zzso zzso forms a potential natural zzso for zzso zzso plays a role not only in inflammation but also in zzso zzso and tumor zzso zzso processing differently impacts the biological activity of zzso thereby contributing to the complex regulation of the zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate whether zzso zzso is prone to trimming by zzso and zzso the biological activity of zzso is altered after zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as a novel zzso for zzso in zzso using mass zzso zzso clipping of zzso zzso zzso calcium release zzso by zzso but reduced the binding of zzso to zzso In line with the higher zzso calcium release, a pronounced increase of the zzso activity of zzso was observed in the zzso cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso binding and zzso activity were unaffected when zzso was exposed to the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso The results of this study suggest that zzso is a likely candidate for the regulation of biological processes relying on the zzso zzso
