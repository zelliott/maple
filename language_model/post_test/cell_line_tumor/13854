The zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso signaling zzso is known to zzso with other signaling zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso receptors was not fully zzso Here, we report that two structurally distinct zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, breast cancer zzso cells, and prostate cancer zzso zzso Although protein zzso C could act as a zzso between zzso and zzso protein zzso C inhibitor zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso are strictly dependent on Ras zzso however, zzso only inhibited zzso but not zzso Ras zzso These results indicate that zzso plays different roles in the zzso of zzso signaling by insulin and zzso and that zzso but not zzso zzso and zzso zzso diverge at zzso
