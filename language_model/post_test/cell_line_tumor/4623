Most of our knowledge of the zzso repertoire of zzso B zzso in type 1 diabetes zzso comes from studies on the zzso specificity of both circulating zzso zzso and peripheral B zzso zzso generated from human blood or zzso zzso In a recent study, we generated zzso cell lines of zzso B zzso from different mouse strains developing zzso but with different degrees of zzso to zzso to characterize the zzso specificity of zzso B zzso during progression of the zzso We found that many zzso produced zzso restricted to the peripheral nervous system zzso thus indicating an active B zzso response against zzso elements in the pancreatic zzso during disease zzso The aim of this study was to identify the zzso recognized by these zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso is the zzso recognized by all zzso zzso and, therefore, a relevant neuroendocrine zzso targeted by zzso B zzso Moreover, we discovered that the immune dominant zzso of this B zzso immune response is found at the zzso end of zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, our study strongly suggests that zzso is a major zzso targeted during zzso development and poses a new question on why zzso B zzso are mainly attracted to the zzso during zzso
