The aims of this study were twofold: zzso to examine the effects of dual zzso of 2 members of the zzso family, the zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso and zzso on zzso and zzso to explore the molecular mechanism of zzso especially focusing on the survival signal zzso pathways by using zzso human zzso zzso zzso cells expressing zzso and zzso 

The effects of zzso on the zzso zzso of zzso and/or zzso and the zzso proteins that are involved in their downstream zzso were zzso by the Western zzso zzso effects by the zzso of zzso and/or zzso were determined by a zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso was inhibited with zzso and/or zzso zzso also inhibited the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in combination with the zzso family zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso and zzso the downstream survival signaling of the zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso with a zzso factor zzso zzso of zzso and zzso did so with a zzso zzso of zzso zzso blockade of zzso and zzso induced a synergistic zzso effect with a zzso zzso of zzso 

The present data suggest that a dual zzso and zzso targeting may have potential for zzso in tumors in which both of these pathways are zzso
