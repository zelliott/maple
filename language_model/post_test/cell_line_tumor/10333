zzso zzso factor zzso is zzso in response to zzso through the zzso zzso protein zzso and plays a pivotal role in the zzso expression of zzso or zzso proteins zzso for zzso zzso zzso A from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production in zzso melanoma zzso Here, we focused on molecular basis of the zzso zzso zzso A consistently inhibited the zzso elevator zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso production in zzso cells or in zzso zzso by zzso the expression of zzso or zzso zzso Moreover, zzso A suppressed zzso induction through zzso zzso pathway, directly zzso the zzso zzso of zzso However, zzso A did not affect zzso zzso levels in these cells but also other zzso zzso pathways through zzso modifications of zzso This putative molecular mechanism of zzso A in the zzso of zzso production suggests its pharmacological potential in skin zzso
