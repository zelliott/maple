zzso in rosemary have shown a variety of pharmacological activities for cancer zzso and therapy in in zzso and in zzso zzso In order to further explore the zzso properties of crude extracts of rosemary zzso zzso zzso we studied its zzso property on several human cancer cell lines and its zzso and zzso properties in zzso in a mouse zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Our study shows that crude zzso rosemary extract zzso has differential zzso effects on human leukemia and breast zzso zzso The 50% zzso concentration zzso was estimated at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso of zzso at zzso dilution minimally induced zzso cell differentiation into zzso lineage at zzso compared to zzso in the zzso control ( zzso and did not induce zzso cell differentiation into zzso zzso The zzso acid zzso equivalent zzso capacity zzso showed that zzso has substantial zzso activity with zzso at zzso and zzso zzso having zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not affect zzso oxide zzso production by zzso zzso zzso zzso However, at the same zzso zzso significantly reduced NO production by zzso zzso cells in a zzso manner from zzso zzso in the zzso cells to zzso zzso ( zzso and zzso zzso ( zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso zzso cells treated with zzso and zzso zzso for 5 h did not affect zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression in these cells when compared to the zzso controls, nor did the zzso dilution of zzso affect zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso At zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso ( zzso and zzso ( zzso zzso expression and zzso reduced zzso and zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso In view of the zzso zzso further studies are needed to explore other biological properties of this popular spice used by many cultures in the zzso
