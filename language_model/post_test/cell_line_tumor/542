The poor prognosis of zzso zzso and lack of effective therapy have necessitated the identification of new treatment zzso We have previously reported that zzso of zzso stress zzso zzso of zzso zzso Because the zzso inhibitor zzso is known to induce zzso oxygen species zzso generation, we evaluated the effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso induced zzso cell zzso by zzso zzso zzso Treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso zzso indicating the involvement of increased zzso in the zzso activity of zzso This heightened zzso level was accompanied by a concurrent decrease in antioxidants such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protects zzso cells from zzso zzso In addition, small interfering zzso zzso of zzso and zzso expression also increased zzso generation and sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso cell zzso Interestingly, suppressing zzso generation prevented zzso Ras zzso This study reports for the first time that Ras zzso by zzso is due to heightened zzso zzso We also report for the first time that zzso zzso the zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 and zzso activity in a zzso manner, which plays a crucial role in zzso resistance to zzso In addition zzso zzso induced the zzso repair response, zzso affected zzso zzso and zzso impaired the zzso ability of zzso cells in a zzso zzso
