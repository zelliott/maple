zzso of zzso a cell zzso zzso zzso zzso has been reported in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and has been implicated in tumor cell migration and zzso Few reports have investigated both zzso gene expression levels and the protein zzso In this study, quantitative zzso and protein zzso were used to assess zzso expression in primary zzso cell lung zzso zzso zzso and in lung tumor cell zzso At the zzso level, zzso message was significantly elevated in the majority of human zzso cell and zzso compared with normal lung zzso zzso of zzso zzso primary tumor and normal specimens with rabbit zzso zzso zzso confirmed expression at the protein level in both zzso cell and zzso with little or no zzso in normal lung zzso Human lung tumor cell lines expressed varying levels of zzso zzso in zzso Interestingly, tumor cell lines with high levels of zzso zzso failed to show zzso zzso protein by either zzso or flow zzso However, protein levels were increased under hypoxic culture conditions suggesting that zzso within the tumor zzso may zzso zzso protein expression in zzso This was supported by the observation of zzso protein in zzso tumors derived from the cell zzso In addition, zzso of human zzso cell zzso samples for zzso zzso IX zzso a zzso marker, showed zzso positive cells adjacent to zzso positive zzso Overall, these results indicate that the zzso zzso protein is zzso in zzso and may represent a potential therapeutic zzso
