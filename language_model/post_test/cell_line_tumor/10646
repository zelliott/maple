zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso The development of novel zzso therapies is needed to reduce the toxicity of current zzso chemotherapy and to treat successfully the zzso zzso The molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso remain zzso however, and appropriate zzso animal models have not yet been zzso In this study, we established a zzso model by zzso mice with zzso zzso zzso cells, generated from zzso human zzso cells zzso zzso with activated zzso zzso The zzso cells exhibited zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso pathways and developed into lethal tumors in all zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the tumors consisted of two distinct types of cells, reminiscent of zzso and zzso as seen in the human zzso The tumors expressed zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso Comparative analysis of gene expression profiles between zzso cells and parental zzso cells revealed that zzso cells expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at higher levels than parental zzso zzso Administration of zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso expression and attenuated the zzso activity of zzso cells, suggesting that zzso zzso might be critically involved in the zzso of zzso Our zzso model represents a potent new tool for studying the zzso and treatment of zzso
