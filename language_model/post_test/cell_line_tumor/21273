zzso zzso routinely express surface zzso zzso and zzso zzso against both zzso have been zzso and the zzso targeting zzso are more zzso To understand this disparity in zzso and guide the screening of therapeutic targets, we compared two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Six zzso cell lines have zzso to zzso more binding sites per cell for zzso than for zzso but zzso is zzso to zzso more active than zzso although they have a similar cell binding affinity zzso approximately 7 zzso In 1 hour, large amounts of zzso are zzso zzso to zzso more than the number of zzso molecules on the cell zzso whereas only zzso to zzso of zzso zzso is zzso The zzso zzso of zzso decreases greatly after zzso zzso indicating that it contributes to the zzso of zzso Treatment of cells with zzso does not reduce the zzso of zzso Both zzso zzso are located in the same zzso Our results show that the rapid zzso of large amounts of zzso bound to zzso makes zzso a better therapeutic target than zzso for zzso and probably for other zzso that act inside zzso
