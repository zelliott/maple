One pot synthesis of three structurally different zzso zzso complexes 1, 2 and 3 were obtained from the reaction between zzso zzso and zzso The obtained products were characterized by various spectral and zzso zzso From the X-ray zzso analysis, an unexpected zzso on the coordinated zzso was found in complex zzso The comparative biological evolutions such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and cellular zzso studies have been examined for zzso zzso and zzso zzso When comparing the zzso of the complexes, 1 exhibited higher activity than 2 and 3 and by comparing with standard zzso both of them were found to exhibit better activity under identical zzso
