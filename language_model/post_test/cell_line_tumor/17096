We developed a zzso to evaluate the zzso status of a zzso following systemic administration of the protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso of subcutaneous zzso and distant skin were fixed in zzso zzso and stained with several fluorescent zzso against the zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso In mice given different doses of zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso of zzso in zzso zzso paralleled that in zzso growing zzso suggesting that skin zzso can be used as surrogate zzso for distant zzso to determine the zzso status of protein zzso zzso zzso
