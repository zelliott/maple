zzso zzso in zzso commonly result in fusion genes that may zzso either novel fusion proteins or normal, but zzso expressed zzso Here we report the cloning of a novel fusion gene in a common type of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as in benign zzso tumors zzso The fusion, which results from a zzso zzso creates a zzso gene in which zzso 1 of a novel gene of unknown function, designated zzso is linked to zzso zzso of the recently identified zzso zzso zzso zzso In the fusion zzso the zzso basic domain of zzso which is required for binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso is replaced by an unrelated zzso sequence from zzso zzso analysis of the zzso of zzso identified two regions of importance for nuclear zzso zzso acids zzso and for zzso with zzso and zzso zzso in nuclear zzso zzso acids zzso zzso of the zzso target genes zzso and zzso in zzso tumors with and without the zzso fusion revealed zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso in fusion positive zzso compared to normal zzso zzso tissue and zzso lacking the zzso These findings suggest that altered zzso signaling plays an important role in the genesis of benign and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso
