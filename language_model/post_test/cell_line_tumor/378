zzso are zzso zzso viruses with features attractive for zzso zzso To investigate this potential, we redirected the coronavirus zzso zzso virus zzso which is normally unable to zzso human cells, to human tumor cells by using a soluble zzso zzso expression construct fused to an zzso growth factor zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso of this adapter protein to zzso allowed infection of otherwise zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso We introduced the sequence zzso the zzso protein zzso into the zzso zzso to generate a zzso virus capable of zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso was viable and had indeed acquired the ability to zzso all zzso cell lines tested in zzso zzso of zzso human zzso zzso cells gave rise to release of progeny virus and efficient cell killing in zzso To investigate the zzso capacity of the virus in zzso we used an zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso Treatment of mice bearing a lethal zzso zzso tumor by injection with zzso significantly prolonged survival compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and control zzso zzso zzso zzso animals, and no zzso tumor load was zzso However, some adverse effects were seen in normal mouse brain zzso that were likely caused by the natural zzso zzso of zzso This is the first demonstration of zzso activity of a coronavirus in zzso It suggests that nonhuman zzso may be attractive new therapeutic agents against human zzso
