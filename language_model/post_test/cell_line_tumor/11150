To assess the optimal reporter zzso gene combination for monitoring zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso gene zzso we compared the cellular zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso expressing zzso 

For zzso zzso cell studies, zzso rat zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rat Morris zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso For zzso infection studies, zzso rat zzso cells were exposed to serial zzso of zzso zzso or zzso for 24 zzso These cells were incubated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso and cellular zzso of zzso was zzso 

zzso exhibited the highest or second highest zzso and the most selectivity regardless of the mode of gene transfer for both zzso and zzso zzso reporter zzso 

This combination of high zzso and high selectivity for both zzso and zzso makes suitably zzso zzso a promising candidate as a zzso for imaging zzso gene expression in living zzso
