The human zzso promoter contains a direct repeat 1 zzso which was shown to zzso responsiveness to zzso We found that in zzso and zzso cells, this zzso zzso mediates responsiveness to zzso acid zzso or zzso acid zzso but this effect was suppressed by zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso domain zzso cannot suppress zzso zzso of the zzso gene via zzso suggesting that zzso recruitment by zzso is required for the suppression by zzso zzso shift zzso showed that zzso zzso and zzso bind to zzso zzso revealing the zzso of this zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to bind to this zzso only in the presence of zzso Our results established that zzso and zzso are potent zzso of zzso and that the zzso zzso could either serve as zzso or zzso depending on cellular zzso
