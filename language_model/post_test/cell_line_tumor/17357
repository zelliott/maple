zzso zzso from zzso bacterial has been identified as an important zzso involved in the inflammatory process through inducing zzso oxide zzso zzso However, the effect of zzso in zzso is still zzso In the present study, the biological effect of zzso was examined in zzso zzso zzso rat zzso cells zzso zzso of zzso zzso showed that zzso and zzso exhibited no significant zzso in zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, transformation zzso were found in zzso zzso zzso cells, but not in zzso or zzso zzso The transformation zzso induced by zzso were also observed in the absence of zzso It indicates that induction of transformation zzso formation by zzso and zzso is independent on the serum in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene expression and NO production was examined in zzso cells, but not obvious in zzso or zzso zzso NO donor sodium zzso zzso zzso transformation in zzso zzso cells in according with zzso NO zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso activity by gelatin activity zzso in zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso of zzso gene expression and NO production induced by zzso showed the significant zzso on zzso transformation zzso formation, accompanied by zzso zzso gene zzso NO production and zzso zzso zzso of the present study provide scientific zzso to link the inflammatory responses and zzso and suggest that NO derived from inflammation may contribute to the progression of zzso natural products with zzso effects such as zzso and zzso possess the ability to block transformation induced by zzso
