zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso is a hopeful therapeutic strategy for zzso zzso zzso zzso injected zzso zzso drugs are known to be retained in the blood stream for a long time and favorably zzso from vessels into the zzso of tumor zzso In this study, we evaluated the effect of zzso injection of zzso zzso which was prepared by zzso with zzso zzso zzso composed of zzso a zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso dissemination of gastric zzso In a zzso zzso model with transfer of zzso in nude mice, the effect of zzso administration of zzso was compared with conventional zzso dissolved in zzso zzso zzso The drug zzso in zzso zzso was evaluated with zzso zzso concentration and zzso microscopic zzso zzso reduced the number of zzso zzso and tumor volume significantly more than did conventional zzso dissolved in zzso zzso zzso and prolonged the survival time zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration in zzso tumors measured by zzso was higher in the zzso than in the zzso group up to 24 h after zzso zzso Oregon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulated in relatively zzso areas in the peripheral part of zzso zzso which was significantly greater than the zzso of zzso zzso administration of zzso may be a promising strategy for zzso zzso due to its superior characteristics to accumulate in zzso zzso
