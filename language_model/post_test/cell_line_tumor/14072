zzso zzso one of the simplest naturally occurring zzso was isolated from the leaves of the evergreen tree zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we reported that zzso inhibited the cell growth of human zzso zzso cell line zzso and provided molecular understanding of this zzso The zzso zzso results showed that zzso decreased the cell viability of zzso cells in a zzso and zzso manner, and the zzso value was zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso induction by zzso in zzso cells was verified by the appearance of DNA fragmentation and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment was found to result in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Besides, zzso also initiated zzso zzso zzso through regulation of zzso family proteins zzso zzso of zzso membrane potential zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso Taken together, zzso decreased the cell growth and induced zzso in zzso zzso
