To explore the effects of a zzso of zzso 2 upon the growth and migration of zzso zzso 

We employed zzso zzso interference technology to zzso the zzso expression of gene zzso in human zzso cells zzso and analyzed their zzso zzso The effects of zzso zzso on the zzso cell cycle and migration of zzso cells were assessed by zzso blue zzso zzso flow zzso and migration zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso growth factor zzso basic zzso growth factor zzso zzso and protein expression were detected by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and Western zzso 

A decreased expression of zzso in human zzso cells significantly inhibited the growth and decreased the migration ability of zzso zzso Furthermore, it also reduced zzso zzso and zzso zzso and protein zzso 

The zzso signaling zzso may provide a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of human zzso
