zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso are ubiquitous receptors involved in the control of a variety of cellular processes frequently found altered in cancer zzso The zzso has been recently described to play a zzso role of zzso zzso zzso zzso proliferation in highly zzso cells that zzso zzso In the present work, we found for the first time that zzso stimulation with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso devoid of zzso activity zzso the zzso in zzso zzso cells through a mechanism involving zzso and a zzso as indicated by its sensitivity to selected zzso In these cells, which express low levels of zzso and zzso both zzso and zzso stimuli induced an interaction of the zzso with zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso zzso by zzso stimuli zzso cellular invasion rather than zzso while zzso zzso by zzso led to a zzso zzso These results revealed a complex zzso of zzso function toward different cellular responses according to the status of zzso zzso On the other hand, we also found that zzso zzso of zzso can occur in an zzso manner in cells which zzso zzso All this reveals novel regulatory systems operating through zzso zzso involving zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which could mediate fine control of zzso processes as well as contribute to the expression of zzso and invasive zzso of zzso zzso
