During the last few years, the use of type III zzso zzso bacterial zzso for zzso purposes has been assessed in various zzso We showed that a type III zzso zzso zzso zzso delivering the zzso zzso zzso induced an efficient specific zzso zzso immune response against zzso zzso Because of the intrinsic toxicity of the zzso further zzso zzso was zzso zzso we explored the effects of the deletion of zzso genes and the zzso gene toward toxicity and efficiency of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso in our strain zzso the strain zzso for aromatic zzso zzso zzso a zzso reduced zzso with the bacterial lethal dose being more than 100 times higher than that of the parental zzso The zzso gene zzso alone was associated with a slightly reduced zzso In a zzso zzso melanoma mouse model, an zzso zzso zzso was the most efficient at a low dose zzso but dose enhancement was not associated with a greater immune zzso The zzso strain was the most efficient at a mild dose zzso but this dose was close to the toxic zzso Combination of both zzso zzso the highest efficiency at an elevated dose zzso in agreement with the known negative effects of zzso molecules upon zzso zzso In conclusion, we have obtained a promising zzso zzso regarding toxicity and efficiency for further developments in both zzso and zzso zzso
