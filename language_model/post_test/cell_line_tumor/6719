To zzso the direct zzso effects of both zzso and zzso at a variety of zzso on a series of canine cancer cell lines and the mechanism of cell zzso 

The in zzso effects of zzso and zzso at various zzso on canine cell cultures zzso canine kidney cells, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were assessed with respect to proliferation zzso and zzso zzso Western zzso analysis of zzso and zzso expression was performed on all cell zzso 

All cell lines used in this study were zzso and zzso positive apart from zzso canine kidney cells which were negative for both zzso and zzso Both zzso and zzso were able to inhibit proliferation in cell lines in a zzso zzso However, the drug concentration required for a given effect was cell line zzso 

The results suggest that significant zzso of proliferation and induction of zzso would only occur when drug zzso were in excess of those that can be achieved in zzso following maximum recommended dose zzso It is possible, however, that local or topical treatment or altered dosing regimens may offer alternative approaches to the use of these drugs as zzso zzso
