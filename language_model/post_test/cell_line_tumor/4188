It is well established that efficient removal of zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso repair zzso is required for protection against zzso zzso zzso Nonetheless, the extent to which reduced zzso capacity might contribute to individual melanoma zzso in the general population remains zzso Here we show that among a panel of 14 human melanoma zzso 11 exhibit significant zzso of DNA zzso removal during S phase relative to zzso or zzso Evidence is presented that this cell zzso zzso zzso zzso with enhanced zzso and reduced zzso survival following zzso zzso In addition, melanoma strains deficient in S zzso DNA zzso removal manifest significantly lower levels of zzso zzso zzso at 1 h zzso suggesting diminished zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a primary zzso of the cellular response to zzso DNA replication zzso zzso in the case of DNA zzso zzso melanoma cells, zzso depletion of zzso (but not of its immediate downstream zzso zzso zzso engenders deficient zzso specifically during zzso On the other hand simultaneous zzso depletion of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso exerts no significant effect on either zzso of zzso at 1 h zzso or the efficiency of DNA zzso zzso Our data suggest that defective zzso exclusively during S phase, possibly associated with decreased zzso zzso may constitute an zzso zzso zzso in melanoma zzso
