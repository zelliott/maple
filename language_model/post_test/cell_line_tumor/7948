In this study, we constructed several novel breast cancer vaccines, zzso zzso zzso zzso tandem repeats zzso zzso that consist of zzso and express 1, 4, and 8 of the tandem repeats of zzso and human zzso zzso factor zzso The ability of the three zzso zzso vaccines to inhibit breast cancer growth was observed in human zzso blood zzso zzso combined zzso zzso zzso zzso protective responses were successfully induced and the tumor zzso in mice zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso was significantly decreased compared with control zzso at 42 days after tumor zzso ( zzso zzso control zzso We also found that zzso and zzso zzso were detected only in tumors grown in zzso animals, and strong zzso responses were induced by zzso with zzso and zzso zzso This study suggests a potential role of zzso zzso and tandem repeats of zzso in zzso zzso immune zzso Our results indicate that zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibited breast cancer growth in zzso mice and the both zzso vaccines may be good candidates for breast cancer zzso
