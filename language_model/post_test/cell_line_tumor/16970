zzso zzso coli zzso zzso strains that lack the locus of zzso zzso zzso efficiently invade zzso cells in zzso unlike zzso zzso zzso We used a zzso deletion zzso of the zzso zzso strain zzso zzso to show that invasion of zzso zzso zzso cells is heavily dependent on production of zzso even though adherence to the cells was actually enhanced in the zzso zzso binds and signals through zzso zzso 5 zzso but there was no evidence that either zzso the zzso protein zzso differentiation primary response gene 88 zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were required for invasion of zzso cells by strain zzso as judged by zzso zzso zzso or inhibitor zzso However, zzso of cells with zzso significantly decreased zzso invasion (by zzso while zzso treatment (which zzso terminal zzso acid zzso thus converting zzso into zzso significantly increased invasion (by zzso zzso of zzso cells with either the zzso agent zzso zzso or the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso significantly decreased invasion by zzso indicating a potential role for zzso zzso in the invasion zzso zzso zzso also showed invading zzso zzso with zzso raft markers zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso and zzso have similar effects on the vestigial level of zzso invasion seen for zzso strain zzso indicating that zzso zzso mediate a common step in zzso and zzso cellular zzso
