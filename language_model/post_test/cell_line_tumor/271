zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso have been shown effective against various solid tumors but were found selectively zzso to zzso cells in the zzso This work describes the use of a zzso zzso zzso zzso for the local controlled delivery of zzso zzso in the zzso lobe of the brain in an attempt to overcome zzso zzso toxicity while affecting zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were zzso in zzso zzso zzso using zzso technology and loaded onto surgical zzso zzso release was monitored by zzso zzso and by zzso specific zzso The implants were inserted into rat brains bearing zzso zzso to assess toxicity and zzso 

The various zzso showed extended linear release for several weeks with minimal burst zzso Best zzso efficacy was obtained with zzso containing zzso resulting in the extension of the median survival from 13 to 18 days with zzso long-term zzso 

zzso proteins were released from a zzso zzso implants in a controlled manner, providing efficacy against zzso zzso while evading zzso in the zzso The controlled release of zzso forms the potential for a new therapy against brain zzso
