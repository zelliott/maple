It has been zzso that the zzso and zzso zzso have different biological properties given their different binding affinities for the zzso zzso zzso is produced via the bacterial conversion of the soy zzso zzso in the zzso We have compared the biological effects of zzso zzso to that of zzso (R and zzso zzso on breast and prostate cancer cells of varying zzso status in zzso Both zzso and zzso inhibited the growth of the breast cancer cell line zzso zzso or zzso 10 zzso and the prostate cancer cell lines zzso zzso or zzso 5 zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The compounds also showed zzso effects in zzso the invasion of zzso and zzso cancer cells through zzso zzso zzso 10, 30 zzso was unable to prevent DNA damage in zzso or zzso breast cells following exposure to zzso zzso or zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso prevented DNA damage in zzso cells following exposure to zzso or zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso has strong zzso activity in contrast to the zzso zzso zzso implicating the zzso rather than the zzso as being responsible for the zzso effects of zzso a finding that may have implications for the in zzso zzso properties of zzso
