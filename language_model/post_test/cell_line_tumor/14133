The zzso zzso factor zzso promotes cellular locomotion or invasion, and regulates tumor zzso or zzso zzso These signals are triggered by binding between zzso and its zzso zzso a zzso on the cell zzso zzso has been identified as zzso zzso zzso Previous reports have suggested that the zzso of zzso is significant for zzso zzso zzso studies have shown that zzso consists of three zzso and that the zzso or inhibitor of zzso is stored between the large and small zzso corresponding to approximately zzso zzso Here, zzso zzso was used to investigate 18 zzso human zzso point zzso involving critical zzso acid zzso for zzso or zzso inhibitor recognition or zzso zzso of zzso that interact with the zzso group of the zzso zzso significantly reduced the cell zzso zzso Their binding capacities for zzso were also lower than zzso human zzso zzso that retained the zzso activity showed the zzso effect and zzso binding and had sensitivity to a zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso chain was expressed on the cell membrane but did not respond to zzso and zzso zzso did not compete with zzso binding of zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso that contain the zzso storage domain and zzso region stimulate cell zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso of zzso is a trigger and that interaction between the zzso part of zzso and the zzso core protein of zzso is needed during zzso zzso
