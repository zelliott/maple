zzso therapy research has primarily focused on the synthesis and development of effective zzso delivery zzso with easy zzso and low zzso In the present study, we zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso by introducing zzso bond linkages to graft low molecular weight linear zzso zzso to the block zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso The zzso block and zzso linkage rendered the carrier zzso while zzso zzso brought about the zzso zzso capacity for zzso zzso release and low zzso zzso zzso of a single chain zzso zzso zzso to the carrier as a targeting zzso for the zzso zzso significantly increased the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso in zzso a human zzso cancer cell zzso zzso of gene expression at both the zzso and protein levels demonstrated that zzso delivery of zzso zzso zzso effectively zzso the targeted zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso resulting in enhanced cancer cell zzso and improved therapeutic efficacy in zzso and in zzso The distinct features of low zzso easy zzso and high zzso zzso efficiency make the zzso a promising candidate for zzso therapy in zzso
