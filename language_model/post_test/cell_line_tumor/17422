zzso zzso zzso zzso is the gene zzso in the genetic disorder zzso zzso zzso the symptoms of which include sensitivity to radiation and an increased risk of zzso zzso is a zzso involved in zzso the appropriate zzso pathway, leading to either zzso arrest or zzso and is therefore a key checkpoint zzso in regulating zzso response to DNA damage and responsible for maintenance of zzso zzso However, little is known about the association of zzso zzso with human gastric cancer zzso In order to determine the zzso and zzso expression changes of the zzso gene in zzso we performed analyses by zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso DNA sequencing and zzso technique on 13 human gastric tumor cell lines and 30 cases of fresh tumor specimens matched normal zzso We compared the potential effect of the zzso gene zzso and cell behavior including zzso arrest and induction of zzso in the tumor cell lines zzso and zzso with and without zzso radiation zzso zzso Our data show that frequent variations were observed at 10 zzso and 2 zzso fragments which covered 8 other zzso of the zzso gene as 5 out of 13 on the cell lines zzso and 2 out of 30 cases in the tissue specimens zzso All point zzso were confirmed as base zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and deletions zzso by use of DNA zzso Among the zzso one was reported previously in breast cancer, the other five have not yet been zzso The expression of zzso was significantly lower in five cell lines zzso zzso zzso GES and zzso than in two others zzso and zzso zzso zzso arrest and zzso were observed in zzso zzso cells challenged with zzso A transient zzso of zzso occurred zzso zzso in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso might be a zzso factor for an increased risk of gastric cancer, and the dysfunction of zzso may lead to a hypersensitivity to zzso radiation in gastric cancer cells, possibly by a zzso zzso
