zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso in the de zzso zzso zzso pathway, which has long been considered a potential target for development of zzso zzso Here we report the biological and X-ray zzso evaluations of both independent zzso zzso zzso and zzso bound to human zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso structure to date zzso zzso Both zzso are potent zzso zzso zzso 210 zzso for zzso and Ki zzso 180 zzso for zzso of zzso zzso and exhibit effective zzso of human leukemia cell growth zzso zzso 80 and 50 zzso zzso Their zzso activity was surprisingly high, and these zzso zzso zzso show distinct advantages over their zzso counterparts, most zzso in retaining potency in zzso human leukemia cell lines that lack reduced folate carrier protein activity zzso zzso 70 and 60 zzso zzso zzso characterization reveals a new binding mode for these zzso in which the zzso zzso groups penetrate deeper into a zzso pocket within the zzso zzso In zzso zzso simulations of three other zzso folate zzso also indicate that this zzso zzso represents a favorable region for binding zzso zzso Overall, these results suggest sulfur and its zzso play an important role in not only the binding of zzso to zzso zzso but also the selectivity and cellular activity zzso zzso thereby presenting new possibilities for the future design of potent and selective zzso drugs that target zzso zzso
