Due to their inherent zzso properties, genetically engineered stem cells may be advantageous for gene therapy treatment of various human zzso including brain, liver, zzso and prostate zzso In this study, we employed human neural stem cells zzso zzso zzso with genes expressing zzso coli zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso as a treatment strategy for zzso breast zzso CD can convert the zzso zzso zzso to its active zzso form, zzso zzso which zzso a zzso effect through DNA synthesis zzso zzso also strongly zzso tumor growth by the zzso zzso zzso confirmed that zzso cells expressed CD and zzso cells expressed both CD and zzso A modified zzso migration zzso showed that zzso and zzso cells selectively migrated toward zzso and zzso human breast cancer zzso In zzso cancer zzso the viability of breast cancer cells which were significantly reduced by zzso or zzso cells in the presence of zzso The tumor zzso effect was greater with the zzso cells, indicating an additional effect of zzso to zzso In addition, the zzso properties of these zzso were found to be attributed to zzso molecules zzso by breast cancer cells, including stem cell factor zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso An in zzso zzso performed using zzso breast cancer zzso fat pad zzso in zzso mice resulted in 50% reduced tumor growth and increased long-term survival in zzso and zzso plus zzso treated mice relative to zzso Our results suggest that zzso genetically modified to express CD and/or zzso genes can be used as a novel targeted cancer gene zzso
