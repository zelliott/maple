zzso progression is driven by genetic zzso but little is known about the environmental conditions that select for these zzso zzso the zzso of paired zzso cancer cell lines that differed only in the zzso status of their zzso or zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso was one of three genes consistently zzso in cells with zzso or zzso zzso The zzso cells exhibited enhanced zzso zzso and zzso and survived in zzso conditions, zzso that all required zzso zzso In contrast, when cells with zzso zzso zzso were subjected to a zzso environment, very few cells zzso Most surviving cells expressed high levels of zzso and zzso of these survivors had acquired zzso zzso not present in their zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso zzso suppressed the growth of cells with zzso or zzso zzso Together, these data suggest that zzso deprivation can drive the acquisition of zzso zzso zzso in human zzso
