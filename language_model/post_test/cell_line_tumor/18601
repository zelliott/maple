zzso is a major component of zzso inclusions including zzso bodies zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and plays a key role in neurodegenerative processes in Parkinson's disease zzso and other zzso Although the molecular mechanisms of the disease process still remain to be zzso recent studies have suggested that an interaction between zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso may be closely associated with the initiation and/or the progression of zzso In this study, we established human zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso or zzso zzso and exposed them to various zzso zzso After the exposure to zzso zzso zzso were formed in the zzso of these cells, and these were zzso for zzso zzso and zzso and positive for zzso S zzso Thus, the obtained zzso zzso shared many features with inclusion bodies in zzso The zzso and molecular zzso zzso as well, suggesting that the zzso formation is associated with the zzso transport along zzso and may reflect protective responses against zzso zzso This cellular model not only will be zzso for our understanding of the zzso process in zzso but also can be applied to the screening of zzso molecules with therapeutic zzso
