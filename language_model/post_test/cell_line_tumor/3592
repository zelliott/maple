DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso DNA zzso closely related to terminal zzso zzso zzso and prone to induce zzso zzso and zzso In addition to a proposed general role in zzso end joining of zzso breaks, its zzso potential and preferential expression in secondary zzso zzso support a role in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Here, we show that human Pol zzso protein is expressed in the nucleus of zzso obtained from human zzso forming a characteristic zzso pattern resembling that of other DNA repair proteins in response to DNA zzso zzso of human Pol zzso in Ramos cells, in which the zzso process is zzso zzso the zzso zzso specifically at the variable zzso region of the zzso zzso The nature of the zzso introduced, mostly base zzso supports the contribution of Pol zzso to zzso of G and C zzso during zzso In zzso analysis of Pol zzso zzso on specific templates, that mimic DNA repair zzso and zzso to zzso zzso indicated that many of the zzso observed in zzso can be explained by the capacity of Pol zzso to induce transient zzso zzso
