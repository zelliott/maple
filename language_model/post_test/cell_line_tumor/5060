In human zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, a zzso zzso placing zzso near the zzso zzso of the H chain zzso causes tumor zzso Earlier, we showed that a zzso zzso acid complementary to the zzso sequence zzso specifically inhibited the expression of zzso zzso and impaired the growth of zzso zzso subcutaneous tumors in mice suffering from severe combined zzso zzso In this study, the therapeutic potential of zzso was evaluated in a systemic mouse zzso zzso cells zzso with the zzso gene were zzso zzso into zzso mice resulting in a preferential expansion, similar to the one of human adult patients, in the abdominal zzso central nervous system and bone zzso The mice were chronically injected zzso either with zzso or with control zzso The treatment was stopped when the control animals developed severe neurological zzso As detected both by inspection at zzso and imaging, overall tumor growth in zzso mice decreased by zzso zzso and zzso studies zzso only in zzso mice, a substantially reduced zzso cell growth at the major sites of invasion and vast areas of necrosis in the zzso zzso with zzso zzso expression zzso Altogether, the data support the therapeutic potential of zzso in human adult zzso
