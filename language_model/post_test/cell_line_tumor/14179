zzso DNA zzso is an important event in zzso Of the various regions of a gene that can be zzso in zzso the promoter is the most important for the regulation of gene zzso Here, we describe a zzso analysis of DNA zzso in the promoter regions of genes using a newly developed zzso zzso DNA amplification DNA chip zzso For each sample, zzso zzso zzso DNA fragments and zzso zzso zzso DNA fragments were amplified and labeled with zzso and zzso respectively, then zzso to a zzso containing the promoters of 288 zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso were zzso to signals from zzso zzso zzso DNA fragments zzso zzso signals from lung cancer cell lines were compared to signals from normal lung zzso About zzso of the zzso genes were zzso in lung cancer cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were zzso in most lung cancer cell lines zzso The expression profiles of these genes correlated to the zzso profiles of the zzso indicating that the zzso analysis of DNA zzso in the promoter region of the genes is convenient for zzso zzso Further analysis of primary tumors indicated that the frequency of zzso was high for zzso zzso and zzso zzso in all tumor types, and high for zzso in small cell zzso zzso This demonstrates that our zzso method is effective at finding zzso changes during zzso
