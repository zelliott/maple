zzso ultrasound zzso signals zzso from zzso cell zzso prepared under different zzso forces were analyzed to investigate the packing effect of cell zzso The zzso were performed in a zzso setup with a zzso zzso The changes of ultrasound signals from cell zzso in zzso power, statistical zzso and zzso thickness were monitored after zzso at between zzso and zzso Experimental results showed that the zzso zzso power from cell zzso was zzso zzso to zzso force and increased to a plateau within zzso after zzso The initial thickness of cell zzso decreased with higher zzso force, but the changes in thickness and time that took to reach a plateau increased at higher zzso zzso The envelope statistics of zzso signals with zzso distribution indicates that the zzso force and elapsed time after zzso affected the zzso zzso The present study suggests that zzso force and data acquisition time after cell zzso formation should be considered in in zzso cell packing method with zzso to emulate the tissue in zzso
