zzso is a member of the zzso cassette (ABC) family of zzso the zzso of which is associated with tumor resistance to a variety of zzso zzso zzso combining zzso zzso with chemotherapy has the potential to improve treatment zzso To search for clinically useful zzso zzso a zzso imaging zzso zzso was developed to allow zzso compound zzso This zzso exploits our finding that zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a specific zzso of zzso and zzso zzso block the export of zzso and enhance zzso signal by increasing zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, engineered to express zzso and zzso were used to screen the Hopkins Drug Library that includes drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration zzso as well as drug candidates that have entered phase II clinical zzso zzso compounds showed zzso enhancement, a measure of zzso activity, of zzso or zzso the majority of which were not previously known as zzso zzso The zzso was validated by its identification of known zzso zzso and by confirming previously unknown zzso zzso using established in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a potent new zzso also inhibited zzso activity in zzso The zzso zzso is an efficient method to identify new zzso of zzso As they were derived from a zzso compound library, many of the zzso uncovered in this study are ready for clinical zzso
