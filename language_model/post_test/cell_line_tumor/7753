In our previous study, we found that zzso zzso played a role in the genesis of toxicity of zzso in human zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present experiment, we examined whether zzso may suppress the zzso of zzso because zzso has been reported to protect nerve cells from various zzso processes including zzso zzso lowered zzso zzso leakage and elevated cell viability in zzso cells exposed to zzso It also lowered zzso activities and cell population in the zzso phase induced by zzso Nevertheless, zzso enhanced cellular zzso of zzso On the other hand, zzso markedly decreased zzso zzso in cells and zzso blocked the zzso The toxicity of zzso was suppressed by adding zzso or zzso zzso zzso whereas it was not lowered by zzso when zzso synthesis was inhibited by zzso zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso including zzso processes is closely related to zzso level in zzso cells and zzso suppresses the toxicity by maintaining zzso zzso Neither zzso acids without zzso zzso nor zzso zzso showed comparable effects of zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso suggesting the importance of the three zzso acid groups at specific positions in a zzso zzso for the zzso
