zzso the end of zzso are organized in a zzso fashion and form zzso in zzso of normal zzso Previous studies have shown that normal and tumor cell zzso differ in their zzso zzso zzso The differences include a change in the spatial organization of the zzso in zzso numbers and sizes and in the presence of zzso zzso Previous attempts to identify the above parameters of zzso zzso organization were zzso Here we describe the automation of zzso scanning for zzso signatures in zzso zzso based on three-dimensional fluorescent in zzso zzso zzso and, for the first time, define its sensitivity in tumor cell zzso The data were acquired with a zzso zzso system that allows to measure cells and acquire zzso images of zzso at high resolution with 40 zzso or 60 zzso oil and at a speed of zzso cells zzso , depending on the cell density on the zzso The automated zzso zzso is suitable for large series of samples and sample zzso We define the sensitivity of this automation for tumor cell zzso The data output includes zzso zzso positions, numbers of zzso zzso zzso numbers, and zzso signal zzso We were able to detect one zzso cell in 1,000 normal zzso In conclusions, we are able to detect tumor cells based on zzso architectural profiles of the zzso This new tool could, in the future, assist in patient diagnosis, in the detection of minimal residual disease, in the analysis of treatment response and in treatment zzso
