zzso zzso growth factor zzso regulates several cell functions zzso zzso zzso zzso vascular tone, and the production of zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potency of specific zzso zzso zzso to suppress human zzso expression by zzso and investigate the effects of zzso zzso on the cell proliferation and zzso of the human prostate cancer cell lines zzso 

zzso was performed using zzso zzso zzso zzso At different time zzso zzso cells were harvested and total zzso was extracted for zzso The zzso content in zzso were measured by zzso zzso of cell growth by zzso was measured by using cell proliferation zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were evaluated by using zzso zzso detection zzso 

zzso of zzso resulted in statistically significant zzso of zzso that in turn caused a marked reduction in the expression of zzso The cell growth was assessed every 24 h for 4 days after zzso treatment resulted in a marked zzso of cell proliferation as compared to scramble zzso The results of zzso showed that approximately 15 % of the cells treated with zzso zzso evident zzso changes after 24 zzso whereas zzso cells treated with zzso significantly were positive, that is to say, 53 % at 72 zzso zzso zzso zzso % zzso zzso zzso and 13 zzso zzso % at 96 zzso 

Our findings indicate that zzso are effective in zzso the zzso zzso in zzso cells and that specific zzso efficiently zzso zzso zzso They could decrease zzso production and induce zzso which may also be linked to the zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso it can be concluded that zzso suppression of zzso represents a powerful tool against prostate cancer cell zzso zzso zzso exerts a direct zzso function in the zzso cell lines and promises the development of drugs for cancer zzso
