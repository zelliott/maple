zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates multiple cell signaling pathways and has been implicated in zzso zzso neurodegenerative disorders, and zzso We investigated the zzso activity, and putative zzso role of zzso in zzso zzso and liver zzso 

zzso stomach, zzso and liver cancer cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and matched pairs of normal and tumor zzso of stomach and colon cancer patients were examined for zzso expression and its zzso at zzso 9 zzso zzso and zzso 216 zzso zzso by Western zzso and for zzso activity by in zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso zzso zzso and of zzso interference on cell survival, zzso and zzso were examined in zzso and on human colon cancer cell zzso in zzso zzso The effects of zzso zzso on human zzso reverse zzso zzso expression and zzso activity were compared between colon cancer and zzso zzso 

Cancer cell lines and most cancer zzso showed increased zzso expression and increased zzso 216 zzso and activity but decreased zzso 9 zzso compared with zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in attenuated cell survival and proliferation and increased zzso in most cancer cell lines and in zzso zzso in zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso in colon cancer cells was associated with decreased zzso expression and zzso zzso 

The results indicate that zzso zzso sustains gastrointestinal cancer cells survival through zzso of zzso and zzso
