To examine the effects of zzso bacterial extracts zzso from three related to zzso disease bacteria zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of tissue zzso of zzso zzso and zzso 

Each zzso was added to cultures of human zzso ligament zzso cells or zzso cells and their zzso were zzso by zzso for zzso Each zzso was added to zzso cell cultures, and the amount of zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso was incubated with zzso cell culture zzso and the amounts of zzso and zzso were determined by zzso zzso analysis was performed with the paired zzso zzso 

In extracts of zzso cells that had been incubated in the presence of zzso zzso zzso one representing zzso zzso zzso and a band corresponding to the active zzso zzso zzso were zzso but in the other extracts it was not zzso When zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso zzso the zzso was processed into zzso and zzso fragments, but in the other zzso the processing did not occur when the other zzso were zzso When zzso cells were incubated with the same zzso the amount of zzso was markedly decreased zzso zzso zzso but in the other zzso it was zzso The amounts of both zzso and zzso were decreased in a zzso manner when zzso cell culture zzso was incubated with zzso zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso may cause zzso tissue to be zzso contributing to the process of zzso disease, by zzso zzso as well as by zzso zzso and zzso
