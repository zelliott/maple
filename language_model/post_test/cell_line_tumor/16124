The zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in up to a third of breast zzso allowing targeted therapy with zzso humanized zzso such as zzso zzso targeting of zzso stability with zzso zzso is synergistic with zzso suggesting that pharmacological agents that can inhibit zzso as well as signaling pathways activated by zzso could be useful against zzso breast zzso The zzso natural product zzso zzso zzso and several pathways relevant to zzso zzso including the zzso zzso and the zzso and has shown promising activity in other cancer zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso exhibits in zzso zzso activity against a panel of human breast cancer cell lines with selectivity towards those zzso zzso zzso strongly zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso producing higher zzso with substantially lower doses of zzso zzso significantly retarded the rate of growth of zzso human breast cancer cells in a mouse zzso model with only minor systemic zzso zzso zzso not only induced the expected zzso and degradation of zzso and other zzso client zzso but it also increased the levels of zzso oxygen species zzso Our studies show that the Michael zzso functionality in zzso is important for its ability to destabilize zzso and exert its zzso against zzso breast cancer zzso These studies suggest the potential use of Michael zzso molecules as novel therapeutic zzso against zzso breast cancer by targeting multiple biological attributes of the driver zzso
