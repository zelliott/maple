The expression of the zzso acute regulatory protein zzso is regulated by zzso in response to zzso hormone stimulation through the second zzso zzso However, in zzso cells, the zzso of hormone necessary to zzso induce zzso synthesis and zzso activity are often significantly higher than is necessary to achieve maximum zzso One general mechanism believed to make zzso signaling more effective is the use of zzso zzso proteins zzso to recruit zzso to discrete zzso zzso which coordinates and focuses zzso action with respect to its zzso The characterization of zzso has suggested that it enhances the zzso regulation of zzso by recruiting both Star zzso and zzso to the zzso thereby permitting more effective translation and zzso of zzso Testing this hypothesis revealed that zzso zzso expression and zzso closely followed zzso abundance when this zzso was silenced or zzso in zzso cells but that these changes were zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso expression in these cells specifically altered the zzso of type II zzso regulatory zzso alpha zzso at the zzso but did not affect its relative expression within the zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso zzso associated with zzso and zzso zzso that activate type II zzso induced zzso zzso more efficiently than zzso stimulating type I zzso This suggests that zzso and zzso serve to enhance zzso by directing the synthesis and zzso of zzso at the zzso in response to zzso
