Our previous study showed that zzso zzso zzso had broader zzso spectrum than zzso zzso zzso This study examined the difference between the two kinds of zzso in inducing cells and the relationship between the zzso induced by zzso and the cell zzso zzso was employed to compare the zzso effect of two kinds of zzso on cell lines zzso and zzso zzso was used to detect zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso were used for determining the phase of zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso could kill not only zzso zzso cells but also zzso zzso zzso zzso predominantly induced zzso while zzso could induce both zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso cells induced by zzso mainly occurred in S phase and the zzso of zzso predominantly took place in zzso zzso It is concluded that the zzso effects of the two zzso differ zzso Since zzso works locally, mainly zzso zzso and has broader zzso spectrum, it may be more effective for the treatment of tumor than zzso
