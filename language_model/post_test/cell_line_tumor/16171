The purpose of the present study was to explore the zzso of zzso gold zzso zzso as zzso zzso agents for detection of cancer zzso 

zzso were zzso by a zzso zzso and the detailed characterization was performed by zzso zzso zzso and cellular zzso studies were carried out in normal human zzso and zzso zzso and zzso cells, zzso The efficacy of detecting zzso cells was monitored using a zzso zzso In zzso zzso was studied after IV injection of zzso in mice, and also a CT phantom model was zzso 

zzso zzso were zzso with high zzso zzso zzso of these gold zzso was observed in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells facilitated zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso in normal mice showed steady zzso of gold zzso in lungs and rapid clearance from zzso zzso analysis of CT values in phantom model revealed that the zzso zzso have reasonable zzso zzso 

The results indicate that these zzso zzso can serve as excellent zzso zzso zzso agents and may provide a novel approach toward tumor detection through zzso
