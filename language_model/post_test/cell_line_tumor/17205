In the present study the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso zzso regulation of the human zzso zzso gene were zzso zzso challenge of zzso cells resulted in an increase of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the promoter revealed that the zzso to zzso zzso was able to mediate zzso induced zzso zzso shift and zzso analyses showed that zzso treatment increased nuclear protein binding to a putative zzso site zzso to zzso and that zzso was part of the zzso This zzso element, when cloned either in its native arrangement or as tandem repeat zzso of the minimal zzso zzso promoter, zzso a significant increase of zzso activity after zzso treatment of zzso zzso cells, while its zzso counterpart abolished the zzso The same zzso element was able to mediate zzso induced expression in zzso zzso zzso these results indicate that like other zzso zzso zzso zzso too is a target for zzso zzso zzso
