In previous studies, we determined that zzso zzso from human colon tumors have elevated levels of zzso zzso a modification added by zzso zzso I zzso zzso the zzso zzso is thought to be a zzso for zzso zzso a zzso zzso The effects of zzso are complex; zzso forms typically protect cells against zzso through zzso mechanisms, whereas zzso forms bind to cell surface zzso and induce zzso In the current study, we tested whether zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso we report that zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso exhibit zzso zzso binding to zzso tissue culture zzso however, binding is attenuated upon forced expression of zzso zzso of zzso zzso acids from zzso zzso by zzso treatment restores zzso zzso Additionally, using a zzso overlay approach, we determined that zzso binds directly and zzso to zzso as compared with zzso zzso zzso To understand the zzso consequences of zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso and monitored for zzso zzso was found to induce zzso in parental zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by function blocking zzso against the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso are critical zzso of zzso effects on cell zzso zzso our results suggest that the coordinate zzso of zzso and zzso a feature that is characteristic of colon zzso may zzso tumor cells with a selective advantage by providing a mechanism for blockade of the zzso effects of zzso zzso
