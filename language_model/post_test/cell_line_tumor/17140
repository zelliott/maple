zzso levels in the prostate have been reported to be associated with the development and progression of zzso prostate zzso To investigate the reason why the zinc content decreases during the progression of prostate cancer to an zzso state, we compared the expression levels of zzso and zinc zzso between zzso zzso cells and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells showed lower zinc levels than zzso cells and comparable levels of zzso zzso expression to zzso cells, consistent with some clinical aspects of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited a lower expression of zinc zzso 1 zzso and higher expression of zzso than zzso zzso The content of zzso which is a major zzso zzso was significantly lower in zzso cells than in zzso zzso Furthermore, the expression of zzso zzso was decreased by zzso zzso cells in medium containing zzso fetal calf serum and increased by addition of synthetic zzso zzso to the zzso whereas the zzso zinc levels were not affected under these zzso These findings suggest that factors such as zzso and zzso other than zzso are associated with the low zzso zinc content in zzso zzso
