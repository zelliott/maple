The intermediate filament zzso is zzso expressed in neural zzso cells during the development of central nervous zzso Recently, increasing evidence has shown that zzso of zzso is related to zzso of several zzso especially zzso However, the function of zzso in zzso remains zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso in zzso zzso by comparing zzso of rat zzso zzso cells that were either high or low for zzso zzso We found that while zzso expression did not influence the in zzso proliferation of zzso cells, zzso characterized by high levels of zzso formed tumors in zzso at significantly faster rates than zzso with low zzso zzso zzso zzso that expressed zzso at low levels in zzso were also found to give rise to tumors highly positive for the zzso suggesting that induction of zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso zzso of zzso positive tumors from zzso negative human zzso zzso cells in zzso mice further confirmed that a switch to positive expression of zzso is fundamental to the course of zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso in zzso tumors via zzso injection of zzso significantly slowed tumor growth and zzso These results demonstrated that zzso plays a crucial role in development of zzso and may potentially be targeted for treatment of the zzso
