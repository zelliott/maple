The active zone is a specialized region of the zzso plasma membrane where the neurotransmitter release occurs by zzso zzso cells also release inflammatory zzso by zzso resulting in induction of allergic zzso In our previous reports, we found that active zone zzso zzso and zzso regulates zzso of mast cell zzso In this study, we investigated the involvement of zzso another active zone zzso in zzso in mast zzso We found that three zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso resided both in the zzso and on the plasma zzso Upon stimulation with zzso the area of a cell increased remarkably due to cell spreading and the distribution of zzso became zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso caused decrease in zzso release and cell zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso and these events might have correlated each other in mast zzso
