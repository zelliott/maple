zzso zzso zzso widely used as a spice in Middle Eastern cuisine and is known for zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso zzso in tumor cells has not been adequately zzso zzso we investigated the role of zzso and zzso protein in zzso zzso in zzso cells, a commonly used cell culture system for in zzso studies on breast zzso zzso were incubated with different zzso of saffron zzso Cell viability was zzso by zzso zzso zzso cells were determined using zzso zzso of DNA fragmentation by flow zzso zzso zzso Role of zzso were studied using the zzso zzso zzso protein expression was zzso by western zzso zzso extract zzso zzso decreased cell viability in zzso cells as a zzso and zzso manner with an zzso of zzso zzso after 48 zzso Analysis of DNA fragmentation by flow zzso showed zzso cell death in zzso cell treated with saffron zzso zzso zzso could be inhibited by zzso zzso indicating zzso zzso was induced by saffron in zzso zzso zzso protein expression was also increased in zzso zzso Thus saffron exerts zzso effects in a breast zzso cell line and could be considered as a potential zzso agent in breast zzso
