The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of zzso in zzso resistant zzso zzso It was first demonstrated that higher activated zzso was detected in zzso zzso cancer cell zzso To provide evidence that supported the hypothesis that zzso expression may promote zzso resistance, zzso zzso was expressed by zzso stimulation that partially abrogates zzso as opposed to the zzso of zzso by specific zzso that restores zzso sensitivity against zzso cancer zzso This hypothesis was further confirmed by clinical tumor specimens of zzso cancer obtained from patients with zzso Based on these premises, zzso an effective small molecular inhibitor of zzso was used to inhibit zzso zzso The data presented here show that zzso restored the sensitivity to zzso in zzso zzso cancer by significant reductions in the expression of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso with these zzso this experiment demonstrated the first evidence of zzso zzso zzso resistance of zzso zzso zzso cancer in zzso Altogether, these findings emphasize the importance of zzso in zzso resistance in zzso cancer and provide a further impetus to clinically evaluate biological zzso that may circumvent zzso resistance in patients with zzso zzso zzso
