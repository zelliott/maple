zzso zzso A zzso or zzso protein zzso zzso mediates the synergistic effects of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Using two human acute zzso leukemia cell zzso clones with respective zzso and zzso zzso we discovered that the zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in the zzso clone zzso cells, whereas other zzso zzso zzso including the exchange proteins directly activated by zzso zzso are expressed at similar levels in both zzso and zzso zzso High zzso expression level in zzso cells is associated with elevated total zzso cellular activity and zzso sensitivity, which consequently lead to an increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that selectively activate type II zzso zzso the effects of zzso of promoting zzso and zzso zzso activity in both zzso and zzso zzso whereas type I zzso zzso do zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso leads to increased zzso zzso and enhanced zzso resistance in zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso is responsible for increased zzso sensitivity, critical for zzso synergistic cell killing in zzso cells, and may represent a novel therapeutic target for zzso zzso zzso
