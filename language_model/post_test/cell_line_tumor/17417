zzso and zzso cells are important immune regulatory zzso The only efficient means to selectively stimulate zzso cells in zzso is zzso zzso However, zzso effectively stimulates and then diminishes the number of zzso zzso zzso It also exhibits a zzso indirect ability to activate zzso zzso We have now discovered another zzso compound, zzso zzso zzso that efficiently diminishes the number of zzso mouse zzso cells in zzso without inducing significant zzso expression or zzso of zzso zzso zzso studies using zzso zzso loaded with zzso zzso demonstrated significant but lower intensity binding to zzso cells when compared with zzso but both zzso were equally efficient in reducing the number of zzso zzso However, zzso zzso in contrast to zzso failed to increase zzso cell size, number, and zzso zzso Also in contrast to zzso zzso zzso is a poor zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso These qualitative differences in zzso zzso zzso have important implications for zzso the unique in zzso roles of zzso vs zzso zzso Thus, zzso (which triggers zzso cells and activates zzso zzso efficiently increases the resistance to zzso bone zzso transplantation while zzso zzso (which triggers zzso cells but does not activate zzso zzso fails to enhance bone zzso graft zzso Our results show zzso zzso can effectively discriminate between zzso and zzso responses in zzso These results indicate the use of different zzso zzso can provide a unique approach for understanding the intricate zzso contributions of these two cell zzso
