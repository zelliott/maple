Over zzso of drugs are zzso by the zzso zzso zzso family of liver zzso The most important zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Although zzso accounts for zzso of the total zzso liver zzso content, it mediates metabolism in almost zzso of zzso In order to study its zzso activity for drug zzso its zzso was cloned and a zzso cell line zzso expressing zzso was zzso 

Human zzso zzso was amplified with reverse zzso chain reaction zzso from total zzso extracted from human liver tissue and cloned into zzso zzso zzso segment was identified by DNA sequencing and zzso into a zzso expression zzso zzso A cell line was established by zzso the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was validated by zzso zzso activity of catalyzing zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso fraction of the cells was determined by high performance liquid zzso zzso 

The cloned zzso had 4 base differences, zzso 100 zzso 336 zzso zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso which resulted in zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso and two zzso zzso were 112 F and 136 V compared with that reported by Kimura et al zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso were the characteristics of zzso zzso The relative activity of zzso fraction of zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso but was zzso in parental zzso zzso 

zzso of human zzso can be successfully zzso A cell line, zzso expressing zzso zzso and having zzso activity, has been zzso
