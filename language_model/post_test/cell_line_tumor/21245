In a precedent report we showed that zzso a zzso present widely in the plant kingdom, exerts a rapid and efficient zzso action selectively towards human and zzso zzso zzso cell lines through zzso zzso The present study extends these data demonstrating the zzso action of zzso towards highly zzso human pancreatic zzso cell lines without affecting human zzso zzso The present study further shows the preferential incorporation of zzso to transformed cells through zzso zzso on plasma zzso and, thereafter, direct interaction between zzso and Bid zzso one of zzso zzso family zzso analyzed either by Surface zzso zzso method or by intrinsic zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso are rich in plasma zzso of transformed cells and that Bid, richly present in zzso zzso is deeply involved in zzso transport make highly credible the hypothesis that the molecular mechanism of zzso action may include its capacity to interact with Bid zzso
