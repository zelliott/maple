Many zzso zzso zzso E1 and its zzso low molecular weight zzso zzso However, the mechanism of zzso E1 deregulation in zzso is still not well zzso We show here that the zzso protein zzso increases zzso E1 zzso stability in zzso breast zzso zzso Thus, zzso stabilization may be a key event in the deregulation of zzso E1 in zzso zzso Compared with zzso immortalized breast zzso cells, zzso cells zzso full-length zzso E1 and its zzso zzso and exhibit increased zzso E1 zzso zzso Increased zzso stability is associated with a stable zzso state and an increased ratio of zzso versus nuclear zzso zzso zzso competition and zzso zzso zzso zzso verified that zzso specifically bound to the zzso E1 zzso zzso zzso of zzso with small interfering zzso zzso in zzso cells decreased zzso E1 zzso zzso zzso and its protein zzso a zzso decrease for the full-length zzso and zzso decrease for the zzso zzso zzso zzso also delayed zzso phase transition and inhibited zzso cell zzso which was partially recovered by zzso of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells increased zzso E1 zzso zzso and its protein zzso Taken together, our data show that zzso critically contributes to zzso E1 zzso and its zzso function, at least in part by increasing zzso E1 zzso stability, which provides a new mechanism of zzso E1 deregulation in breast zzso
