Multiple genetic zzso with subsequent molecular events are required for progression of normal zzso cells to cancer, with zzso zzso being a very common event in zzso zzso zzso of nuclear factor zzso B zzso is an associated feature of zzso however studies have not examined purposeful zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in in zzso models of oral zzso Our objective is to demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso into zzso deficient zzso zzso produces zzso zzso We zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso previously immortalized by zzso 40 thus zzso zzso and studied zzso dependent zzso zzso zzso zzso provided functional zzso of zzso and produced zzso zzso proliferation and zzso 8 zzso and zzso zzso we demonstrated zzso in zzso mice with zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso immortalized zzso produces zzso and that this single zzso in zzso expression on a zzso zzso background is sufficient for zzso zzso features, thus providing evidence that zzso may act as a gain of function zzso in this zzso
