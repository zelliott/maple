zzso and zzso are two main cell survival pathways that zzso the zzso efficacy of zzso Our previous studies demonstrated that the zzso zzso compound 3 zzso specifically suppresses zzso and zzso zzso zzso to kill cancer zzso However, zzso also zzso a cell survival signal through zzso zzso In this report, we further found that zzso zzso activates zzso which zzso zzso cancer cell zzso zzso concurrent blocking zzso and zzso resulted in a significantly zzso zzso Because heat shock protein 90 zzso plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of both the zzso and zzso pathways in cancer cells, we examined if suppression of zzso is able to zzso zzso cancer cell zzso The results show that targeting zzso does not interfere with zzso zzso degradation and zzso zzso the key processes for zzso cancer cell zzso However, zzso zzso effectively blocked zzso zzso zzso through degradation of zzso and zzso two key components of the zzso zzso pathway, and reduced both the zzso and zzso zzso activity through degradation of the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was markedly zzso and a synergistic zzso was zzso The results suggest that concurrent targeting zzso and zzso by combination of zzso and zzso zzso is an effective approach for improving the zzso value of zzso
