zzso cancer is a common cause for cancer death in women and there is no effective therapy for zzso zzso Thus, research is urgently needed to identify new therapeutic zzso We showed previously that all female zzso transgenic mice develop zzso zzso tumors, indicating that zzso causes zzso cancer in zzso We also demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso in this zzso Similarly, we found that zzso and zzso are zzso in human zzso a highly zzso zzso zzso Although zzso studies indicate that individuals who take zzso zzso have a lower zzso of some tumors, these zzso have not been evaluated in zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso mice on zzso (a zzso zzso have significantly smaller zzso tumors than zzso To determine if zzso zzso are active in human zzso zzso that zzso zzso we treated cultured cells with zzso zzso or zzso (a specific zzso zzso Both drugs block zzso growth in high-grade human zzso cancer cells that zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, neither inhibitor blocked transformation in cells that do not zzso zzso Moreover, zzso tumors from zzso cells were significantly inhibited in mice on zzso More zzso no tumors formed in mice on zzso These zzso studies suggest that zzso zzso could play a role in preventing tumor onset or progression in zzso zzso with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso these drugs have lower toxicity than zzso agents used to treat zzso zzso zzso
