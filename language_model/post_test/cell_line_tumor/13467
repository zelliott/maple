zzso zzso represent a valuable option for the production of zzso zzso medical devices aimed to improve the therapeutic approach and minimize the potential risks related to zzso zzso In this regard, the degradation process needs to be carefully evaluated in order to assess the effectiveness of the zzso support and the eventual toxic effects induced by the released zzso zzso zzso is one of the most common zzso element that raised several safety concerns, contributing to shift the investigation toward zzso zzso To delve into this issue, a long-term investigation (up to 28 zzso was performed using zzso zzso due to its relevant Al zzso zzso tests in zzso zzso saline (PBS) solution was performed following the zzso standards and the zzso zzso was evaluated at fixed time points by means of zzso zzso zzso effects were assessed by zzso human zzso cells with zzso medium derived from immersion tests at different dilution zzso An increase in the resistance zzso with the time was zzso In all the investigated cases the presence of Al in the zzso media did not induce significant toxic effects directly correlated to its zzso A decrease of cell viability was only observed in the case of 50 % dilution of PBS zzso for the longest immersion period zzso 28 zzso
