Sonic zzso zzso signaling zzso is associated with tumor zzso however, the role of zzso signaling in the development of zzso zzso zzso is zzso This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the regulation of zzso signaling and the zzso of zzso 

The expression of zzso signaling components was characterized by zzso in human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and by zzso and zzso in human zzso cell zzso The impact of the treatment with zzso (a selective inhibitor of the zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso on zzso cell zzso cycle and zzso was examined by zzso soft zzso colony formation and flow zzso zzso zzso The influence of zzso signaling on the expression of zzso signaling components and cell zzso regulators was determined by zzso and quantitative zzso zzso 

The expression of zzso zzso and zzso was detected in 70, 70, and zzso of human zzso zzso respectively, and in proportion of zzso cell lines, but not in zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of zzso cells, induced zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso and zzso the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso but zzso zzso expression in zzso These regulatory effects of zzso were partially or completely erased by zzso zzso 

These data suggest that the zzso signaling zzso is crucial for the growth of zzso
