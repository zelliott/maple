zzso are small zzso zzso molecules that control the expression of target zzso Our previous studies show that zzso decreased in gastric zzso and that zzso of zzso by gene zzso inhibited gastric zzso cell growth both in zzso and in zzso whereas it remains largely unclear as to how zzso affects tumor zzso In this study, proteins associated with the function of zzso were detected in zzso zzso The cell line of zzso zzso zzso zzso was successfully established by gene zzso zzso gel zzso zzso was used to separate the total proteins of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso software was applied to analyze zzso zzso Ten differential protein spots were identified by zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso and they may be the proteins associated with zzso zzso The zzso proteins include zzso protein 2, zzso growth factor binding protein 2, protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso The zzso proteins consisted of zzso zzso protein 2 zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the different expression levels of the partial proteins zzso and zzso were confirmed by Western zzso zzso The data suggest that these differential proteins are involved in novel zzso signal pathway, and these findings provided the basis to zzso investigate the functional mechanisms of zzso in gastric zzso
