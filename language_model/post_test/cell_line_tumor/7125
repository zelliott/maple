The zzso zzso functions as a zzso zzso zzso The ability of zzso to activate zzso relies in part on the recruitment of zzso complexes containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition to zzso zzso these zzso have been shown to zzso other proteins involved in transcription, including zzso zzso zzso This study was initiated in order to determine whether zzso is a direct zzso of zzso and zzso We report here that zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso By using zzso tandem mass zzso to examine zzso zzso from human cells, the major zzso zzso sites have been zzso zzso of zzso by either zzso or zzso results in a dramatic increase in protein zzso The data reported here suggest a zzso mechanism by which zzso regulate zzso function by altering its rate of zzso
