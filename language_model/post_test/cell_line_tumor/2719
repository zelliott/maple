Clinical responses of solid tumors after zzso human zzso zzso stem cell transplantation zzso often coincide with severe zzso disease zzso zzso minor zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso for example, zzso may allow boosting the zzso effect of zzso zzso without risking severe zzso The zzso zzso is zzso expressed in zzso of most zzso However, an estimated zzso to zzso of solid tumors do not express zzso zzso are zzso and cannot be targeted by zzso zzso Here, we investigated the zzso regulation of zzso gene expression in zzso We found that DNA zzso in the zzso promoter region is closely associated with the absence of zzso gene expression in solid tumor cell zzso Moreover, we detected zzso promoter zzso in primary zzso The zzso agent zzso induced zzso expression only in zzso tumor cells and zzso them for recognition by zzso zzso T zzso zzso the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso A induced zzso expression both in some zzso tumor cell lines and in normal zzso zzso Our data suggest that promoter zzso contributes to the zzso gene regulation in zzso zzso drugs might extend the safe zzso of zzso as an zzso target on solid tumors after zzso zzso
