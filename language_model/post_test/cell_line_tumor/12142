zzso of zzso and zzso zzso is required for T cell entry into zzso zzso Lewis X zzso are critical for zzso activity and are elevated on zzso zzso T zzso We zzso that these zzso are zzso targets for treating the zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso In this study, we analyzed the efficacy of a novel zzso analog of zzso zzso on zzso and zzso zzso expressed by zzso zzso T zzso We also examined the specificity of zzso zzso action by contrasting the effects on zzso Lewis X expression displayed by zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso expressed by zzso Using zzso flow analysis, we found that zzso zzso zzso more potent zzso on zzso zzso activity than on zzso zzso zzso To determine whether zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities were zzso we analyzed the expression of zzso Lewis X and zzso core 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso treatment resulted in zzso zzso of zzso Lewis X and zzso zzso expression on zzso whereas zzso zzso on zzso were minimally zzso These results indicate that zzso treatment can selectively zzso the zzso zzso activity and potentially prevent zzso dissemination of zzso zzso
