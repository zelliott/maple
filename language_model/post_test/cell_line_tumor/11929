Early identification of zzso cancer patients who are responding or resistant to combined zzso may lead to individualized therapeutic approaches and improved clinical zzso We assessed the ability of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to detect early changes in tumor proliferation after zzso in experimental models of zzso zzso 

The in zzso and ex zzso tumor zzso of zzso in zzso human zzso zzso cells were studied at various early time points after zzso plus zzso and validated with conventional assessments of cellular proliferation zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso correlation was determined by comparing spatial zzso and zzso distribution in zzso zzso with zzso zzso was done in all zzso 

In zzso zzso and zzso zzso rapidly decreased in zzso cells 24 hours after zzso with a zzso reduction of over zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso ratio in zzso declined by zzso compared with baseline zzso zzso zzso by 2 days after zzso despite the lack of change in tumor zzso In contrast, the decline of zzso zzso was gradual and less zzso zzso zzso of zzso was more closely correlated with zzso expression zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso than was zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso images depicted similar trends in reduction of zzso and zzso tumor zzso zzso displayed spatial correlations between zzso zzso and zzso zzso distribution in preliminary zzso 

zzso is suitable and more specific than zzso for depicting early reductions in tumor proliferation that zzso tumor size changes after zzso
