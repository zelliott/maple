Patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lung cancer zzso respond to zzso zzso zzso the presence of zzso cells with zzso identified on zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors as zzso zzso in native and rearranged zzso copy number also zzso 

In total, zzso zzso clinical specimens zzso zzso specimens and zzso zzso zzso and 24 zzso zzso cell lines were zzso zzso copy number and zzso status were assessed by zzso 

Clinical specimens with zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso cells were identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso An increased native zzso copy number zzso copies per cell in zzso of zzso was detected in zzso of zzso tumors and in zzso of zzso zzso In zzso tumors, abundant, focal amplification of native zzso was rare zzso Other zzso patterns occurred in approximately zzso of zzso The mean native zzso copy number ranged from zzso to zzso copies in cell lines and was not correlated with zzso sensitivity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Neither native or rearranged zzso copy number nor the percentage of positive cells correlated with zzso nervous system zzso survival in zzso patients who were receiving zzso 

Overall, zzso of tumors fell below the established zzso threshold by zzso Further investigation of zzso by other diagnostic techniques in such cases may be zzso Native zzso copy number increases alone were not associated with sensitivity to zzso zzso in zzso However, rare, complex patterns of increased native zzso in patients should be studied zzso because, otherwise, zzso zzso contained within these may be zzso
