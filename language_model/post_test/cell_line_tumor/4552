zzso evidence is emerging highlighting the role of zzso zzso protein zzso during zzso by regulating cell zzso The current study demonstrated that zzso of zzso expression by zzso zzso and small interfering zzso zzso resulted in changes in cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso interference of zzso zzso caused a significant reduction in cell zzso of a breast cancer cell line to collagen type I, zzso and zzso ( zzso and of a colon cancer cell to collagen type I and zzso ( zzso zzso of zzso induced a significant increase in cell zzso of colon ( zzso and breast ( zzso cancer cells to the same zzso zzso zzso These zzso effects were attributed to changes in zzso expression as the differences in zzso profile correlated with the zzso expression zzso In an attempt to zzso the mechanism zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso promoter activity of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso and significant increases in zzso activity were observed in zzso zzso cells ( zzso which was dependent on nuclear zzso These results indicate that zzso of cell zzso is a normal zzso action of zzso zzso by increasing zzso gene zzso
