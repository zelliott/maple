During the evolution of zzso zzso cells often lose their characteristic features and acquire a zzso zzso in a process known as zzso transition zzso In the present study we followed early stages of zzso transformation by zzso and observed diverse cellular changes, associated with zzso We compared primary zzso with early and late passages of zzso cells, a cell line of zzso zzso We have previously shown that during the progression from the normal cells to early zzso cells, zzso is acquired, while in the progression to late zzso cells become zzso zzso We show here that during the transition from the normal state to late zzso cells, there is a progressive reduction in zzso zzso zzso formation, zzso junctions and focal zzso ultimately leading to poorly adhesive zzso which is associated with zzso Surprisingly, unlike zzso zzso these changes are associated with reduced zzso cell zzso We monitored reduced zzso migration also in the cervical cancer cell line zzso Therefore we can conclude that up to the stage of tumor formation migratory activity is zzso
