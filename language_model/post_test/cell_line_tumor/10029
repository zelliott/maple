To study the effect and mechanism of zzso on human nature killer zzso 

zzso or zzso zzso cells were isolated from normal human peripheral blood with negative zzso tuberculosis zzso and cultured with zzso zzso zzso plus zzso and zzso plus zzso beta 1 zzso zzso zzso The levels of zzso and zzso in the culture zzso were measured by zzso The frequency of zzso and zzso B producing cells were analyzed by zzso The zzso activity was detected by zzso reduction zzso The surface expression of zzso beta 1 on zzso cells was detected by flow zzso 

zzso significantly induced zzso production by zzso in a zzso zzso When zzso was zzso with zzso the frequency of zzso B producing cells was higher than that in zzso zzso ( zzso zzso enhanced the zzso activity of zzso zzso alone didn't induce zzso production by zzso zzso cells, but it can augment zzso zzso production by zzso zzso zzso The zzso activities of zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells were not significantly different zzso zzso induced zzso production by zzso in a zzso manner and enhanced zzso beta 1 expression on different zzso of zzso zzso zzso the effect of zzso by zzso beta 1 zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso production and zzso B releasing by zzso 

zzso can indirectly promote zzso activity of zzso cells and the production of zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso beta 1 expression on the surface of zzso cells is a part of the mechanisms of zzso on human zzso zzso
