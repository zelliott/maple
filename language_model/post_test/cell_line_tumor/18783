We recently published the zzso characterization of the zzso and zzso zzso genes that are located head to head in the zzso zzso and share large regions of sequence zzso We here demonstrate by transient in zzso zzso that zzso and zzso promoters are able to direct comparable levels of zzso The expression of zzso promoters is enhanced after zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells while DNA zzso associated to the recruitment of zzso zzso zzso binding protein zzso zzso and B promoters by interfering with zzso zzso In addition, zzso sequence comparison identified a zzso negative zzso regulatory element located in the zzso zzso zzso
