zzso motif zzso 22 plays an important role in zzso zzso zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso regulatory zzso zzso was crucial for zzso and zzso zzso expression via binding to a special zzso named zzso extended zzso response zzso Here, we further investigate the molecular mechanisms of zzso with a focus on the zzso of zzso Using an in zzso DNA affinity binding zzso and an in zzso zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso stimulation significantly enhanced the binding of zzso and zzso factor, but not other zzso such as general control zzso 5, steroid zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso to the zzso extended zzso response element containing zzso promoter region together with zzso zzso and zzso analysis demonstrated that it was zzso but not zzso factor, that functioned as a zzso zzso of zzso in zzso induction of zzso We further show that zzso contributed to both zzso and zzso zzso zzso independent of its zzso zzso activity, however, it was required for the recruitment of zzso zzso II to zzso promoter zzso These data indicate that zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso expression via recruiting zzso zzso II to the zzso promoter, and might serve as a bridge between zzso and the zzso zzso apparatus in zzso zzso
