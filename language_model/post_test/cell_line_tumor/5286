zzso is a zzso zzso zzso exchange factor that plays an important role in zzso zzso and growth factor zzso trafficking in zzso In this study, we show that zzso is expressed at high levels in a large number of zzso cell lung zzso cell lines, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso depletion from zzso cells resulted in a decrease in cell proliferation that was correlated to a decrease in zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso of wild type zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso exchange zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso depletion effects, and zzso of zzso had a dominant negative effect on cell zzso zzso depletion stabilized the cell surface levels of zzso suggesting that zzso was necessary for robust signaling in zzso zzso In support of this conclusion, introduction of either dominant negative zzso or dominant negative zzso decreased zzso proliferation and zzso zzso These data demonstrate that proper zzso and zzso trafficking are critical for zzso signaling in zzso cells and suggest that zzso of zzso in zzso cell lines may contribute to their zzso zzso
