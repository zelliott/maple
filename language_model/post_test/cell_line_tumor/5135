The zzso regulation of the major zzso complex class zzso zzso gene zzso differs from the classical zzso class I zzso The zzso regulatory elements typical for classical zzso class I promoters are divergent in the promoter of zzso rendering this gene unresponsive to zzso zzso and class II zzso zzso zzso zzso However, as we have previously zzso zzso of zzso is regulated by zzso Because zzso is zzso zzso this observation does not explain the zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso Using zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells as a model, we have investigated the contribution of DNA zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso Despite similar levels of DNA zzso both in zzso and zzso cells, we found the levels of zzso zzso in zzso promoter zzso to be significantly enhanced in zzso cells coinciding with zzso zzso
