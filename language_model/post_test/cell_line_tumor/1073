Advanced zzso cell zzso zzso is resistant to zzso chemotherapy, and zzso has modest zzso zzso zzso represent a novel class of zzso agents that have activity across a wide spectrum of tumor zzso We investigated the efficacy of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso formerly known as zzso in zzso and found that zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso of the nuclear zzso zzso zzso is considered a crucial effect in zzso zzso but the dependence on zzso zzso for zzso death has not been formally zzso Thus, we also studied the contribution of zzso zzso as a mechanism of zzso zzso in zzso cells, which display zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso family members, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso markedly reduced zzso zzso However, when we used selective genetic and chemical zzso of zzso we found that zzso blockade was not sufficient to induce zzso of zzso zzso Thus, we conclude that zzso zzso zzso is dependent on its zzso zzso effect, but zzso effects also play a critical role in the induction of zzso by zzso This represents the first report to formally demonstrate that zzso zzso blockade is required to achieve the maximum degree of zzso by this zzso
