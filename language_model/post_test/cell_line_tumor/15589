For hormone resistant prostate cancer zzso chemotherapy is used but the mortality is zzso with a mean survival time of zzso zzso Our previous studies have shown the zzso effect of zzso in zzso zzso At doses zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso that are normally achieved at doses currently used for the treatment of zzso infections, inhibited zzso cancer cell growth and induced zzso arrest with zzso of key cell cycle regulatory genes and ultimately activated zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of zzso on zzso independent prostate zzso zzso cells and compared our results with zzso prostate zzso zzso The main advantage of this zzso zzso is its relative zzso as compared to current chemotherapy, which is not very effective, for the treatment of advanced hormone resistant prostate zzso zzso cells as well as normal prostate zzso cells zzso were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell counting was done during 3 days of zzso The cell death was determined using zzso zzso of cell zzso zzso followed by flow zzso analysis as well as by zzso of zzso a member of the ICE family of zzso involved in the zzso zzso The cell zzso were analyzed by zzso techniques for the expression of key genes targeted by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso was zzso using a zzso zzso procedure followed by laser zzso microscopic zzso Treatment of prostate cancer cells with zzso resulted in a zzso and zzso zzso of cell growth zzso with zzso zzso zzso of the zzso There was a zzso induction of cell cycle arrest at the S and zzso zzso of the cell cycle as well as induction of zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso was zzso as early as 12 h following zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso There was a significant increase in the zzso ratio with zzso of zzso a zzso zzso to zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest the potential usefulness of the zzso zzso as a zzso agent for advanced prostate zzso The zzso zzso showed zzso and zzso inducing activity on prostate cancer cells but not on zzso prostate zzso zzso These effects of zzso were zzso by cell cycle arrest at zzso phase of the cell cycle, zzso zzso to zzso membrane and by increasing the zzso ratio in zzso prostate cancer zzso Based on our in zzso results, further in-depth in zzso animal or human investigations are zzso
