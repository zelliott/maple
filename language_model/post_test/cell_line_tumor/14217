The first event occurring at the boundary between a metal implant and living tissue is the attachment of cells onto the metal surface of the zzso The attachment characteristics of the metal in this situation are critical in determining its zzso and usefulness as artificial bone and tooth zzso Using the human zzso cell line zzso we attempted to establish simple and reliable methods for evaluating the attachment of cultured zzso cells onto titanium samples that had been subjected to various surface zzso Fluorescence zzso imaging showed that cells cultured on titanium with zzso acid zzso zzso exhibited delayed spreading of their zzso as compared to cells cultured for the same length of time on zzso titanium or physically polished zzso The zzso cells also exhibited poor assembly of focal zzso as zzso by zzso zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso based on an in zzso wound model, cells cultured on zzso migrated more slowly than cells cultured on other titanium zzso These data suggest that zzso cells attach less effectively to the zzso zzso The methods described in this study should be useful for assessing the initial interactions of cultured cells with various materials, including zzso
