zzso zzso zzso are widely used to zzso the activity of zzso zzso in cell zzso to investigate the specificity and potency of zzso zzso zzso and to isolate and identify zzso by mass zzso With zzso arising as novel potential drug targets, zzso are required that can be produced in sufficient amounts and to meet the specific needs of a given zzso The established method for the generation of zzso zzso makes use of zzso zzso methods that have inherent limitations concerning the incorporation of zzso zzso acids and the amount of material that can be zzso Here, we describe the total chemical synthesis of zzso zzso and their application to zzso profiling and identification of functional zzso This synthetic methodology allowed the easy incorporation of desired tags for specific applications, for example, fluorescent reporters, handles for zzso or affinity zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, the synthetic method can be scaled up to provide significant amounts of zzso Fluorescent zzso zzso allowed faster, zzso detection of active zzso as compared to zzso zzso A zzso probe holding a zzso zzso enabled the affinity pull-down and subsequent mild, zzso of zzso Also, zzso activity levels were monitored in response to zzso or zzso and to zzso by small zzso Furthermore, fluorescent zzso revealed differential zzso activity profiles in a panel of lung and prostate cancer zzso
