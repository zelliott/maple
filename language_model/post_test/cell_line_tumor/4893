zzso or zzso gene expression profiling provides a powerful approach to the characterization of a cell's zzso zzso Such technology has been used in animal cell culture to create zzso snapshots of zzso activity in response to environmental factors or cellular triggers under zzso zzso Furthermore, it allows us to have a fundamental understanding of genetic mechanisms involved in zzso protein zzso One such mechanism adversely affecting the growth of zzso bacteria is the increased zzso burden resulting from the maintenance of zzso copy number and zzso protein zzso There have also been some reports on the effect of zzso burden in zzso cell zzso In the present study, we have used a mouse array representing zzso genes to assess the expression profile of a zzso zzso mouse zzso cell line, zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line expressing zzso zzso zzso The producer cells did not exhibit a slower growth as the result of any zzso burden, but showed differences in zzso zzso Gene expression profiling revealed that the producer cell line was selected for a higher expression of zzso zzso genes for zzso proteins as well as zzso zzso On the other hand, protein synthesis is greater and zzso genes were more expressed in the zzso zzso A possible shift from expressing zzso presenting proteins to zzso protein could also be zzso zzso gene expression profiling suggests that the effect of the zzso burden in slowing growth can be mostly negated in producer cell lines by careful zzso selection, where stable zzso cells are selected for both high productivity as well as high growth zzso
