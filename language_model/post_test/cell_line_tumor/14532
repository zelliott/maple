Previous studies demonstrated that zzso a zzso zzso endowed with zzso activities, also exerts zzso effects on proliferation and survival of a panel of tumor zzso In this study, we sought to ascertain the effects of zzso on the growth of zzso and zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso 

The growth of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells was analyzed in zzso both in the presence and absence of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression following treatment with zzso was analyzed by Western zzso and zzso zzso 

We observed that zzso causes a significant growth zzso of zzso cells without affecting proliferation of zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso These effects were associated with zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso of zzso zzso A and B and zzso zzso 

Our present findings indicate that the zzso activity of zzso on cell growth of zzso zzso zzso cells may be brought about by decreasing expression of functional zzso and selected zzso ultimately leading to cell growth zzso
