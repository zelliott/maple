Resistance toward zzso drugs is one of the primary causes for therapeutic failure in cancer zzso DNA repair mechanisms as well as deficient zzso zzso play a critical role in zzso resistance of tumor cells toward zzso drug zzso Here, we discovered that deficient zzso zzso in zzso cancer cells depends on zzso IV and zzso zzso zzso playing crucial roles in the zzso end joining zzso pathway, which is the zzso zzso for DNA zzso break repair zzso in zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso IV zzso cancer cells were zzso resistant and deficient in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and in zzso of zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso of zzso by knocking out zzso or zzso IV restored zzso zzso and zzso sensitivity after zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso but could not prevent zzso DNA damage, indicating that induction of DNA damage is independent of zzso zzso However, zzso zzso depends on induction of DNA damage left zzso by zzso We conclude that DNA damage left zzso by zzso IV or zzso might be the zzso for zzso zzso by zzso in cancer zzso Failure in zzso zzso using zzso depends on loss of DNA damage and is due to higher rates of zzso
