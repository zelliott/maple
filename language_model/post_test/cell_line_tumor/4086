The expression of zzso or vitamin D zzso zzso and zzso in specific zzso may act as the central part between zzso D zzso serum levels and the zzso effects zzso D zzso zzso of these zzso may affect their biological zzso Here, we describe the expression of zzso and its zzso zzso detected in breast cells and zzso zzso of zzso zzso was measured by zzso followed by western zzso analysis for protein zzso In zzso cells, the expression of zzso protein was reduced by about 57% compared to zzso zzso Western zzso analysis revealed a signal band at 56 zzso with additional bands detected at 42 and 44 zzso The expression of zzso zzso was reduced by about zzso in breast cancer zzso We found only one signal in the benign zzso at 56 zzso in western zzso whereas in zzso zzso an additional band was detected at zzso Our results suggest that alternative zzso of zzso may lead to a zzso dysfunctional zzso
