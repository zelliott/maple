zzso zzso zzso have been proposed as a new kind of cancer zzso however, their in zzso zzso effects are not zzso In order to further improve the efficacy of vaccination with zzso we investigated whether zzso zzso genetic modification of tumor cells can make zzso presence in the zzso thus increasing zzso effects of the zzso 

zzso tumor cells expressing zzso zzso as a tumor model zzso were used to prepare zzso by serial zzso and zzso zzso zzso To demonstrate their zzso effects, zzso zzso zzso were injected zzso into zzso zzso either bearing tumor or followed by tumor zzso 

We found zzso within those zzso as detected by both zzso and Western zzso zzso with these zzso could induce zzso zzso immune response and zzso T zzso zzso more zzso resulting in more significant zzso of tumor zzso zzso T cells are the main zzso cells, however, zzso T cells, and zzso cells are also involved in the induction of zzso response of this zzso 

Our results demonstrate that zzso genetic modification of tumor cells can make the zzso contain zzso with the increased zzso effects, representing a promising way of zzso tumor zzso
