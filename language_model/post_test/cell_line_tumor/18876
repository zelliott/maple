zzso zzso are a novel class of zzso I zzso zzso with enhanced chemical stability compared with the currently used zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is currently in clinical zzso We established two resistant human zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso by zzso exposure of the parental zzso line to increasing zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The two resistant cell lines were zzso to zzso resistant to zzso and zzso as well as 7- to zzso zzso to other zzso zzso including zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but sensitive to the zzso II zzso zzso and zzso Neither of the resistant cell lines displayed any zzso expression of the three major drug zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1, or zzso zzso zzso G zzso member 2, as assessed by zzso or flow zzso zzso expression of zzso protein occurred at the zzso level in both of the resistant cell lines, consistent with the reduction of zzso zzso level as the major contribution to the resistance zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Treatment of the resistant cell lines with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso or the DNA zzso inhibitor zzso alone or zzso did not result in zzso of zzso Our studies suggest that selection for resistance to zzso or zzso is primarily related to reduced zzso expression at the zzso level, resulting in reduced zzso zzso
