zzso is a zzso zzso involved in tumor zzso migration, and zzso and has been shown to zzso the zzso following zzso DNA zzso zzso is frequently activated in zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso and cell lines, but no zzso data regarding the effects of the novel potent zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso resistance are currently zzso The present study reports that treatment with zzso completely zzso zzso zzso in the majority of the zzso cell lines tested zzso zzso zzso with modest effects on cell proliferation and zzso In five cell lines, a higher zzso was observed delivering zzso in combination with zzso the most evident effects were found in the zzso zzso cells due to the effective block of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso treatment significantly blocked zzso zzso of a panel of DNA repair and synthesis zzso In addition, a real-time zzso analysis done on tumor and matched normal lung specimens from 44 surgically zzso zzso patients showed that zzso transcripts are significantly zzso in zzso of zzso In conclusion, zzso therapeutic strategies could interfere with zzso resistance, possibly allowing to reduce zzso doses, thus improving its zzso The data of this study support further clinical studies aimed to evaluate the efficacy of zzso agents in combination with zzso in the treatment of zzso
