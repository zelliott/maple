zzso initiation factor zzso an important regulator of translation, plays a crucial role in the zzso zzso progression and zzso of many human solid zzso The zzso of this gene has been associated with tumor formation in a wide range of human zzso including breast zzso In the present study, we attempted to explore the use of zzso as a therapeutic target to enhance zzso for breast zzso in a zzso zzso mice zzso 

zzso female zzso mice zzso with zzso cells were randomly divided into six groups: control, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso At the end of the experiments, all mice were sacrificed, the zzso were harvested to measure the tumor volume and mass, and the tumor zzso rates were zzso zzso was detected with a flow zzso zzso zzso was used to detect the expression of zzso 

The zzso in zzso mice showed a significantly delayed growth and smaller tumor volume, with a higher tumor zzso rate compared with the control and zzso zzso A similar result was obtained in the zzso group compared with zzso alone and zzso The expression of zzso in the tumor cells was significantly zzso while the zzso index was much zzso 

zzso can significantly inhibit tumor growth and enhance the zzso of breast zzso zzso in zzso zzso This is possibly associated with the zzso of zzso zzso which suggests that zzso may serve as an ideal molecular target for the zzso of breast zzso
