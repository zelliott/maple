In the present study, we have examined the transport of zzso in cultured zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest the existence of two different zzso for zzso in these zzso zzso and zzso zzso (K zzso m zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively), were affected when zzso sodium was replaced with zzso (about zzso zzso over zzso or zzso (about zzso zzso over zzso By contrast, the substitution of sodium by zzso or zzso did not modify zzso zzso (K zzso m zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of membrane potential with zzso was able to block zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso transport in zzso zzso cells is membrane potential dependent, whereas zzso zzso is not modulated by membrane zzso
