zzso is predominantly expressed on zzso thus zzso suited for zzso targeted imaging and therapy of zzso To isolate zzso affinity zzso we thought to screen a zzso zzso zzso library derived from the repertoire of a patient with zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso disorders may produce zzso zzso The zzso zzso library was constructed by zzso zzso of the zzso patient repertoire originally expressed on zzso zzso in the novel zzso zzso for zzso zzso The zzso zzso library zzso zzso was screened by magnetic and flow sorting with human zzso zzso zzso A pool of zzso zzso able to detect zzso of zzso was obtained and transformed into zzso zzso by zzso zzso using the novel zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were independently validated in zzso by flow zzso analysis and zzso zzso then in zzso zzso in zzso to produce zzso zzso bound specifically to zzso zzso tumor in zzso with functional stability over 48 zzso Our results suggest that our novel paired zzso zzso libraries can serve as an ideal platform for the rapid isolation of zzso zzso and that zzso zzso can be used for in zzso zzso including flow zzso analysis, as well as in zzso for targeted imaging and therapy of zzso
