zzso is the major zzso of high-risk human zzso zzso which causes cervical zzso To date zzso zzso have not been investigated in cervical zzso In this study we generated a rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which recognizes a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso resulting in a strong increase in the sensitivity for the detection of zzso zzso zzso protein relative to conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso we show that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso varies during the cell cycle in cervical cancer zzso Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that the zzso zzso zzso is abundantly expressed in cervical zzso in zzso and zzso suggesting an important role of zzso zzso for the development of these zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso zzso zzso could be a useful marker for the detection of cervical zzso and their zzso
