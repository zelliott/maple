A zzso double zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been described zzso The goal of this study was to investigate whether improved tumor targeting could be achieved with this zzso through the use of zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso was zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso agents that have been used successfully with intact zzso zzso zzso zzso of the labeled fragments were performed in zzso using zzso human breast cancer cells zzso to express zzso zzso comparisons were made to zzso zzso directly zzso using zzso The tissue distribution of the zzso zzso labeled with zzso and zzso was compared in zzso mice bearing zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso was labeled with zzso and zzso in zzso yields of zzso and zzso respectively, with preservation of zzso for zzso zzso zzso indicated that labeling via zzso resulted in a zzso to zzso higher ( zzso retention of zzso compared to that from the directly labeled fragment, in zzso cells during a zzso observation zzso Likewise, the amount of zzso retained in cells from the zzso zzso was zzso to zzso higher ( zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity in zzso mice bearing zzso zzso in zzso was significantly higher for the zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with that of the zzso fragment, particularly at later time zzso The zzso of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and fourfold zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso higher than that for zzso at 24 and 48 zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso zzso also exhibited considerably higher levels of zzso activity in liver, zzso and zzso 

The overall results further demonstrate the potential utility of these two prosthetic groups for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and their zzso Specifically, the zzso double zzso zzso in combination with these zzso agents warrants further evaluation for imaging and possibly treatment of zzso expressing zzso
