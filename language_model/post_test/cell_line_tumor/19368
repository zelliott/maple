In our continuing effort to discover and develop zzso inducing zzso as novel zzso agents, we explored the zzso relationship zzso of zzso zzso zzso fused at the zzso A zzso group zzso at the nitrogen in the zzso of the zzso ring led to a series of potent zzso zzso with potency in the low zzso zzso These compounds were also found to be low zzso or zzso zzso of cell growth, and they inhibited zzso zzso indicating that zzso of the zzso nitrogen does not change the mechanism of action of these zzso zzso zzso was identified as a highly potent zzso zzso with an zzso value of 2 zzso and a highly potent inhibitor of cell growth with a zzso value of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
