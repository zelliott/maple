The zzso are a family of cell surface zzso responsible for cell zzso which play an important role in cell zzso contact zzso and signal zzso during zzso zzso 8 zzso a member of the zzso family, has been reported to act as a tumor zzso involved in zzso in breast zzso In this study, we aimed to investigate the zzso zzso of zzso and its tumor zzso function in gastric zzso The expression of zzso was markedly reduced or silenced in gastric cancer cell lines compared with normal gastric cells or zzso zzso of the zzso gene promoter was observed in zzso zzso of cell lines and zzso zzso of the primary gastric cancer by zzso zzso but not in normal gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was able to restore or zzso zzso expression in gastric cancer cell zzso zzso expression of zzso in silenced gastric cancer cells significantly inhibited cell migration and induced zzso For the first time, our study demonstrates the zzso zzso of zzso by promoter zzso and its tumor zzso function in human gastric zzso Thus, zzso could be identified as a candidate tumor zzso in human gastric zzso
