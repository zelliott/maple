zzso zzso cancer zzso is an zzso aggressive zzso for which there are no effective zzso Though zzso only make up less than zzso of all zzso cancer cases, they represent over half of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a natural zzso has recently been reported as a potential zzso zzso However, the effect of this compound on zzso cells is not zzso Thus, in this study, we evaluated the zzso nature of zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso cells, derived from patients with zzso were treated with zzso zzso zzso for up to 6 zzso Cell proliferation was measured every 2 d using the zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis for molecular makers of zzso was carried out to investigate the effect and mechanism of zzso on zzso 

zzso inhibited proliferation of zzso and zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells with zzso treatment showed a significant increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso along with a decrease in zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, the ratio of zzso to zzso expression in zzso cells revealed an increase after the zzso 

zzso zzso growth in zzso cells via zzso in zzso zzso the natural zzso zzso warrants further clinical investigation as a new potential drug for the treatment for zzso
