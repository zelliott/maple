zzso proliferation is important in zzso In the present study, the effects of zzso on lung cancer cell proliferation were zzso The expression of zzso zzso one of the key zzso in the zzso transition, and zzso the zzso zzso zzso that targets the negative cell cycle regulator, zzso were also zzso Moreover, the underlying mechanisms of action of zzso were investigated in lung cancer zzso zzso and zzso cells were synchronized using zzso in the presence or absence of zzso The effect of zzso on lung cancer cell proliferation was determined by zzso zzso zzso E and zzso proteins and their zzso levels were detected by western zzso zzso Furthermore, the effect of zzso on the cell cycle was evaluated by flow zzso zzso was found to inhibit lung cancer cell proliferation and to suppress zzso and zzso E zzso zzso the zzso levels of zzso E zzso and zzso zzso were zzso by zzso and zzso correlated with zzso zzso was also found to arrest lung cancer cells in the zzso zzso Thus, zzso may inhibit lung cancer cell proliferation by blocking zzso transition through the zzso of zzso E and zzso protein zzso
