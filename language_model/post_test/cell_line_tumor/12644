In the search of zzso relationship studies and to explore the zzso effect associated with the zzso scaffold, several zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso Variation in the structure of the nitrogen zzso bonded to the zzso of the zzso system led to a set of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso activity of the zzso derivatives was evaluated in zzso using the zzso zzso method against one normal cell line zzso lung zzso and four human cancer cell lines zzso human gastric zzso zzso human lung cancer cells, and zzso human zzso zzso zzso human zzso in zzso drug exposure zzso Among the series, five compounds exhibited interesting zzso activity against zzso human gastric zzso and human lung cancer zzso The zzso studies revealed that both the nature of the nitrogen zzso into the zzso ring and the zzso group at the zzso play key roles in the zzso zzso
