The ability of tumor cells to resist zzso triggered by immune cells results in their escape from immune surveillance of the zzso A critical zzso of zzso is the zzso zzso zzso system that mediates the zzso effects of zzso T zzso Recently, in zzso zzso of zzso expressed in various tumor cells by zzso zzso zzso was zzso In the present study, we first analyzed the influence of this zzso on zzso signaling in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells by assessing their responses to either an zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso cells after they were zzso with zzso Interestingly, both zzso and zzso zzso zzso in three different zzso lines were significantly reduced by zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso was used to examine the expression levels of zzso and zzso in tumor samples of 54 zzso zzso In agreement with our in zzso zzso the expression of zzso in tumor zzso was zzso correlated with those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, shortened survival was found in patients with a higher zzso and a lower zzso zzso respectively, in their tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, by zzso analysis, we discovered that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels zzso zzso zzso were independent zzso factors for zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso and a consequential increased resistance to zzso zzso resulting from zzso zzso in zzso cancer cells could be a key mechanism for their escape from the immune zzso thereby predicting a poor survival in zzso zzso
