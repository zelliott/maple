Natural killer zzso group zzso zzso is a key zzso zzso expressed on zzso cells, whose interaction with zzso on target cells plays an important role in zzso However, the effect of zzso on zzso zzso on zzso cells is zzso Here we showed that human zzso zzso zzso cells zzso express zzso class zzso chain A zzso and zzso protein 1 on their surface, and incubation with zzso reduced the expression in a zzso and zzso manner as assessed by flow zzso zzso zzso the surface expression of the zzso zzso and this zzso was significantly attenuated by zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso by zzso and zzso respectively, had the same effect, indicating that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso by zzso and zzso zzso reverse zzso showed that zzso levels of the zzso zzso and relevant zzso were not significantly changed by zzso zzso zzso the surface expression of zzso zzso protein 5, and zzso of zzso zzso did not impair this zzso indicating that zzso shedding was not zzso Instead, pharmacological zzso of protein transport and zzso zzso it, and zzso enhanced zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment significantly reduced zzso to zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso through the zzso of an zzso and zzso zzso zzso and consequently reduces zzso to zzso zzso
