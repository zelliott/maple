zzso cells engineered to zzso zzso referred to as tumor cell vaccines, can often generate systemic zzso immunity and, in many cases, cause tumor zzso We compared the efficacy of zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso tumor cell vaccines on the growth of zzso or zzso liver zzso A chemically transformed zzso zzso cell line, zzso derived from Fischer 344 rats, was used to generate tumor models and tumor cell zzso Our results demonstrated that two zzso injections of an zzso tumor cell vaccine significantly controlled the growth of zzso tumors, but was completely ineffective against zzso liver zzso zzso cell zzso in liver tumors was markedly reduced compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso of some zzso cells was observed in the liver tumors compared with the zzso zzso Furthermore, the T cells induced by zzso zzso zzso migrated to zzso tumor sites, as demonstrated by adoptive transfer zzso In contrast, zzso zzso using parental tumor cells zzso with zzso carrying the zzso zzso yielded significantly better therapeutic effects on the liver tumors than on the zzso zzso zzso transfer experiments further confirmed that the T cells induced by liver zzso zzso migrated to the liver tumor zzso Our results demonstrate that distinct T cell populations are induced by different zzso zzso Thus, the zzso behavior of T cells depends on the route of zzso and is an important factor determining the efficacy of zzso for regional zzso
