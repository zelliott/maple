The aim of the study was to compare in zzso and in zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso analog of the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso labeled with zzso and zzso for its potential use in targeted zzso of tumors expressing zzso releasing zzso zzso zzso The same zzso acid zzso but with different zzso referred as zzso zzso has already been studied and zzso however, the zzso one, suitable for labeling with zzso type zzso was not yet zzso 

The conditions for labeling of zzso with zzso added zzso and with zzso zzso activity zzso 15 zzso zzso were investigated and zzso to provide zzso and zzso of high zzso The stability of the zzso compounds in human serum was evaluated over a period of 24 zzso The human prostate cancer cell line zzso known to express zzso zzso was used for in zzso evaluation of zzso zzso affinity to zzso receptors and for assessment of zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso accompanied by zzso blocking was studied in normal Swiss zzso 

zzso and zzso were obtained with zzso yield zzso and high zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso They were stable when incubated in human serum for up to 24 zzso The binding affinities of zzso and both zzso and zzso zzso to zzso receptors were high zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively), especially for the zzso zzso The zzso study of zzso to zzso cells revealed an zzso zzso after 72 h of zzso while the labeled derivatives showed no significant zzso zzso The zzso rate to zzso cells was more rapid for zzso zzso zzso than for the zzso one zzso while the zzso rate was slower for zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso study of both derivatives in normal mice revealed a specific binding to zzso zzso zzso which could be blocked by zzso of cold zzso The effect of zzso zzso in zzso was also more pronounced for the zzso zzso than that for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our studies demonstrated that zzso can be labeled with zzso zzso and zzso zzso with high zzso zzso The in zzso and in zzso comparison between zzso and zzso indicated that the change of zzso in the complex from Y to zzso influence the binding affinity to the zzso receptors with preference to the zzso zzso
