zzso also known as zzso is a type II zzso zzso zzso strongly implicated in both the development and progression of a variety of zzso zzso Evidence comes from studies of its expression in human zzso and from mouse models of spontaneous zzso zzso is considered to be a major zzso of two key zzso of invasive growth, namely zzso growth zzso factor and zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to examine the role of zzso in pancreatic zzso zzso by expression analysis and functional zzso in zzso zzso analysis of zzso performed on zzso zzso and large samples of 55 pancreatic zzso zzso and on 31 samples of normal pancreatic ducts revealed that although zzso expression differed greatly in both zzso and normal zzso pancreatic zzso zzso scores were significantly zzso elevated in pancreatic zzso zzso compared to normal pancreatic zzso To evaluate the role of zzso during development of pancreatic cancer, we studied the effects of newly designed zzso zzso on the processing of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the human zzso cell lines zzso and zzso In both cell lines, at 1 zzso all zzso zzso completely prevented zzso zzso At lower inhibitor zzso the degree of zzso of zzso processing correlated with the affinities of the zzso towards zzso indicating that this is a specific result of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso reduced the zzso of the zzso zzso and the overall cellular zzso of the human pancreatic zzso cell line zzso Our findings demonstrate for the first time that zzso may be involved in the progression of pancreatic zzso zzso and that zzso zzso may contribute to preventing the progression of this devastating zzso
