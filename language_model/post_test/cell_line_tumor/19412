We have developed zzso zzso zzso that have zzso zzso zzso zzso at all zzso chain zzso To obtain zzso zzso with sites for zzso of zzso drugs for this study, we prepared zzso zzso zzso that have a zzso acid zzso zzso at every chain end of zzso zzso chains were attached to zzso groups of zzso zzso We then combined the zzso drug zzso to side chains of the zzso zzso using an zzso bond, zzso or zzso bond, zzso For the zzso bearing zzso through zzso linkage, zzso was released only slightly at pH zzso and zzso Although a negligible level of release occurred at pH zzso for zzso with zzso via zzso linkage, a remarkable extent of zzso release was induced at pH zzso which zzso to the pH of late zzso These zzso zzso showed much lower toxicity to zzso cells than did free zzso However, compared to zzso zzso exhibited 7 times higher zzso suggesting the importance of zzso zzso linkage for high zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso exhibited an equivalent level of toxicity to that of zzso zzso cells and their parent zzso zzso zzso
