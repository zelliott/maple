zzso replication and zzso of zzso C viruses zzso have been studied using the infectious molecular clone zzso By zzso zzso in zzso cells in the absence or presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso we investigated the molecular mechanisms of zzso adaptation and sensitivity to zzso The cell zzso zzso virus zzso became more sensitive to zzso than its parental zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso viruses in the zzso population carried two zzso in their envelopes zzso and zzso Plasma that could neutralize zzso was found in 2 of 7 zzso individuals who have cleared the virus in zzso Plasma zzso with a higher 50% zzso zzso was used for in zzso selection of zzso resistant zzso Under the increasing selection pressure of plasma zzso the zzso sensitivity of zzso decreased zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso in envelope were found in all but one zzso clones in the viral population after eight rounds of zzso Interestingly, the zzso adapted zzso zzso reverted back to the zzso zzso zzso under the selection zzso By introducing zzso at positions zzso and 500 into the zzso zzso we confirmed that the zzso zzso alone can zzso zzso zzso The results of this current study suggest that zzso are present in a subset of zzso individuals who have cleared the virus in zzso Our data also provide the first evidence that, the zzso zzso zzso located within a previously identified highly zzso zzso zzso may be a target for zzso zzso present in individual who have spontaneously resolved the zzso zzso
