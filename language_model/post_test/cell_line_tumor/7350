Resistance can be overcome by modified zzso zzso containing an zzso zzso zzso We constructed an zzso zzso with zzso zzso expressing the TRAIL gene from the human zzso reverse zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso and evaluated its zzso activity in zzso and in zzso 

The induction of zzso by the new zzso zzso was evaluated in human zzso cells derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pancreatic zzso zzso zzso and colon zzso zzso SW zzso zzso Cell viability was measured by the zzso zzso and zzso expression and zzso induction by zzso cell sorting zzso and Western zzso In zzso experiments were performed in an zzso zzso tumor model in zzso nude zzso 

Treatment with zzso and zzso resulted in significantly reduced cell viability in comparison to PBS and zzso treatment in all examined human zzso cell zzso In addition, mice treated with zzso showed a significantly decreased tumor growth than both control zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso may become a potent therapeutic agent for the treatment of different human solid zzso
