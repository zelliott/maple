zzso III is a zzso newly isolated from zzso zzso zzso Since zzso have exhibited broad zzso and zzso activity, we investigated the ability of zzso III to induce zzso in human zzso zzso cells, as well as the involvement of zzso signaling zzso zzso III markedly suppressed proliferation of zzso cells in a zzso and zzso manner zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but did not affect the growth of primary cultures of human zzso zzso zzso zzso cells underwent typical zzso zzso Exposure to a low dose of zzso III provoked zzso cell cycle arrest, which preceded zzso characterized by the appearance of cells with zzso DNA zzso However, a higher dose of zzso III induced zzso without first causing cell cycle zzso In addition, zzso III exposure resulted in zzso BAD zzso and zzso as well as zzso of zzso and zzso zzso both the intrinsic zzso of zzso zzso by BAD zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso were involved in zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso III is a reliable candidate for zzso treatment of human zzso and should be investigated zzso
