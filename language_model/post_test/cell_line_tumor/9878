zzso zzso with modifications at positions zzso or zzso were zzso and evaluated for zzso activity against the zzso zzso cell model of serum zzso zzso The most potent compounds were the zzso derivatives zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 20, 23, and 27, up to the zzso range of zzso were unable to activate zzso zzso alpha and beta zzso and zzso or to interfere with zzso gene expression zzso In addition, they were unable to stimulate the growth of Ishikawa, zzso and zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso derivatives 20, 23, and 27 may prove to be lead molecules for the synthesis of novel zzso zzso
