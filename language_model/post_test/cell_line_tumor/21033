zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso is a promising cancer therapeutic agent because of its tumor zzso TRAIL is known to induce zzso in cancer cells but spare most normal zzso In this study, we examined whether treatment of zzso zzso can enhance zzso cell death by TRAIL against zzso prostate cancer zzso The cell death effect of combinations of TRAIL and zzso on prostate cancer cell lines zzso zzso and its derived zzso zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso of zzso Western zzso zzso and DNA fragmentation zzso were used to study the underlying mechanisms of cell death and search for any mechanisms of enhancement of TRAIL induced zzso in the presence of zzso In addition, we investigated the in zzso zzso effects of combined zzso and TRAIL using zzso zzso zzso zzso itself could not induce zzso cell death in 24 h even in high zzso zzso cell death, however, was drastically enhanced by zzso of zzso 20 h before TRAIL zzso zzso enhanced the zzso zzso and zzso zzso by TRAIL especially in zzso zzso zzso cell line, mainly by zzso of zzso by zzso zzso It appears that zzso cell death was protected by the zzso inhibitor zzso The results of our study show that zzso of zzso is able to enhance the zzso produced by TRAIL in prostate cancer cells, especially in zzso prostate cancer zzso
