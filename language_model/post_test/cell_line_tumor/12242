The plasma membrane of various zzso cell types is zzso in structure and may contain zzso which can impose constraints on the lateral diffusion of its zzso Fluorescence correlation zzso zzso can be used to investigate the dynamic properties of the plasma membrane of living zzso Very recently, zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso described a method to probe the nature of the lateral zzso of the membrane by varying the beam size in the zzso zzso The dependence of the zzso of the zzso function at zzso zzso the diffusion time, on the zzso area of the zzso volume gives information on the nature of the imposed zzso We describe an alternative approach that yields essentially the same information, and can readily be applied on commercial zzso instruments by measuring the diffusion time and the particle number at various relative positions of the cell membrane with respect to the waist of the laser zzso zzso by performing a zzso
