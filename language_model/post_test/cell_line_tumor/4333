zzso is the founding member of a diverse family of zzso zzso zzso and zzso has a key role in promoting cancer growth, in part, through its association with zzso zzso zzso However, some zzso proteins have widely divergent zzso roles, and these proteins include the zzso zzso zzso zzso stands for zzso zzso which zzso cancer cell growth and suppresses zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso tumor zzso protecting it from degradation, and zzso associates with the zzso zzso tumor zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso signaling is largely zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso associates with zzso growth factor zzso zzso increasing in activity and zzso binding after zzso zzso when it decreases the pool of zzso present at the plasma zzso zzso binding is zzso requires the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso for efficient complex formation and is not dependent on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are associated with increased zzso activity and zzso and we found that zzso associates zzso with an zzso zzso 19 zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso at an zzso site and dramatically decreased the levels of zzso from the plasma zzso Taken together, the results suggest that zzso zzso zzso signaling in cancer cells and has elevated activity against zzso zzso 19 zzso
