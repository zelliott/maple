zzso resistance zzso in cancer is a phenomenon in which administration of a single zzso agent causes zzso of cancer cells to a variety of therapies even with different mechanisms of zzso Development of zzso against standard therapies is a major challenge in the treatment of zzso Previously we have demonstrated a unique ability of zzso zzso to selectively target zzso cancer cells and zzso with zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Here we expand its scope and demonstrate that 5 can zzso with both zzso and zzso in three different zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso We also demonstrate that 5 has potent zzso in the zzso panel of cell lines with an average zzso of zzso zzso In addition, 5 has a unique mechanism of action in comparison with standard agents in the zzso database based on zzso zzso Further zzso relationship study led to the development of a more potent zzso compound zzso with an zzso of 640 zzso in zzso Additionally, one zzso of 5 is zzso more active than the less active zzso Taken together, our study has led to the discovery of a series of zzso that selectively target drug-resistant cancer cells with the potential for the treatment of drug-resistant zzso
