Recent studies have identified large sets of genes in embryonic stem and zzso zzso cells that are associated with the zzso factors zzso and zzso Other studies have shown that zzso and zzso work together zzso to stimulate the zzso of their own genes as well as a network of genes required for zzso Moreover, small changes in the levels of zzso target genes alter the fate of stem zzso Although positive zzso and feedback zzso have been proposed to explain the zzso of these zzso little is known about the mechanisms that prevent their zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso levels zzso the zzso expression of five zzso target zzso In addition, we show that zzso repression is dependent on the binding sites for zzso and zzso We also demonstrate that zzso is dependent on the zzso of zzso which contains its zzso zzso Finally, our studies argue that zzso of neither zzso nor zzso broadly zzso zzso target zzso zzso these studies provide new insights into the diversity of mechanisms that control zzso target genes and argue that zzso functions as a molecular zzso for the control of a key zzso regulatory zzso
