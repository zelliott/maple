Invasion and zzso cause death of patients with liver zzso Increased expression of zzso zzso zzso is closely associated with tumor zzso Type IV collagen is the main structure protein of zzso membrane which is a natural barrier for zzso the zzso of liver cancer zzso In this experiment, we used all zzso acid zzso to inhibit zzso type IV in order to protect the type IV collagen and zzso zzso further to suppress the zzso of zzso zzso 

By the use of cell culture and experimental animal models, the influence of all zzso acid zzso on the invasion of zzso liver cancer cells was studied in terms of zzso capacity to artificial zzso membrane and production of zzso type zzso 

zzso could inhibit the zzso capacity and zzso IV zzso of zzso cells in a zzso zzso 

zzso can exert multiple effects on the invasion of zzso zzso
