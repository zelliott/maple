Many bacterial toxins target small zzso zzso in order to manipulate the zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso toxin was previously identified to be due to the unique mechanism of zzso zzso zzso However, identification and subsequent deletion of the zzso zzso domain within the zzso toxin revealed that this toxin has an additional cell zzso zzso In this study, we identified that the zzso zzso toxin also zzso the zzso zzso by causing the zzso of small zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso by zzso was zzso in the presence of zzso and by treatment of cells with zzso to zzso activate zzso These data suggest that zzso targets zzso zzso regulation rather than affecting zzso zzso zzso A novel zzso region of zzso was identified to be responsible for the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso This domain did not carry GAP or zzso zzso Overall, these data show that the zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso zzso by a mechanism distinct from other zzso bacterial zzso
