Since zzso such as zzso are known to accumulate in tumors of zzso animals, and those that have zzso a zzso zzso can be used to image a tumor by zzso we applied zzso zzso zzso for the imaging of brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which are known to accumulate in tumors by passive targeting and those modified with zzso which are known to home into zzso sites were zzso Those zzso labeled with zzso zzso accumulated in a zzso implanted in a rat brain zzso after the injection, although they did not accumulate in the normal brain zzso due to the protection afforded by the zzso zzso zzso zzso were easily labeled with zzso and enabled the imaging of zzso by PET with higher contrast than that obtained with zzso In addition, the smallest tumor among those tested, having a diameter of zzso was successfully zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging of brain tumors is promising for the diagnosis of brain cancer and possible drug zzso zzso
