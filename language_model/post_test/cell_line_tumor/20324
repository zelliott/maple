To determine the zzso of drug zzso between in the zzso of human culture cells and of human zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso were chosen as the model zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso in human zzso zzso liver, and small zzso zzso were obtained and compared with ones in cell culture zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as human liver zzso The correlations of zzso stability in human small zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso cell zzso human liver tissue zzso zzso human liver zzso and human pancreatic tissue zzso zzso pancreatic cell, zzso and zzso zzso were zzso 

The zzso of zzso zzso in human small zzso zzso exhibited the great correlation to ones in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The stability of those zzso in human zzso tissue zzso also exhibited the good correlations to ones in zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the correlations of zzso zzso between in human liver tissue zzso and in human liver zzso were weaker than others zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The correlations of drug zzso in cultured cell zzso and in human tissue zzso were zzso Those results exhibited wide range of correlations between in cell zzso and in human tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso Those in zzso studies in cell zzso would be good tools to predict drug zzso in zzso and to select drug candidates for further zzso In the series of experiments, zzso and zzso would be selected as candidates of oral drug targeting delivery for cancer chemotherapy due to their relatively good zzso compared to other tested zzso
