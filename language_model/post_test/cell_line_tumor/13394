Breast zzso with a zzso gene signature are primarily zzso frequently zzso and carry a poor zzso zzso breast zzso are enriched for markers of breast cancer stem cells as well as markers of zzso transition zzso While zzso is generally thought to be important in the process of zzso in zzso evidence of zzso in human disease remains zzso Here we report a novel model of human zzso breast cancer, the zzso cell line, which was isolated from an aggressive, zzso zzso breast cancer that demonstrated zzso and zzso evidence suggestive of zzso plasticity in the zzso The zzso cell line displays a zzso zzso in zzso when cultured in zzso media, and zzso zzso changes consistent with zzso in response to zzso media, a unique property among the breast cancer cell lines we zzso This zzso is marked by increased expression of the zzso factor zzso and zzso is required for the enhanced migratory ability of zzso cells in the zzso zzso zzso cells also express zzso zzso and single zzso cells are able to generate zzso containing both zzso and zzso cell zzso In zzso as few as ten zzso cells are capable of forming zzso tumors which display a range of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso model provides a novel model to study the molecular mechanisms regulating zzso plasticity and the aggressive biology of zzso breast zzso
