zzso tumor zzso exhibit a high zzso potential and could potentially serve as an important target for cancer zzso In this study, we developed a zzso model that zzso and is representative of the principal components of biological blood vessels, including vessel zzso zzso and zzso zzso containing zzso Using this model, the zzso invasion of tumor zzso can be observed and recorded in zzso In this study we analyzed the zzso process of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso across the zzso under the stimulation of zzso zzso The zzso integrity was zzso damaged at the site of zzso zzso The zzso invasion of zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso but the zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso was not affected by the zzso zzso This model allows for detailed study of the attachment and zzso invasion of tumor zzso thus, it would be a useful tool for analysis of the underlying mechanisms of zzso and for testing novel zzso zzso
