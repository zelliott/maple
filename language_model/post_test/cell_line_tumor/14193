zzso is one of the most potent zzso agents with multiple targets in zzso and zzso zzso This study addressed a question of whether zzso zzso can be prevented by zzso coli zzso zzso due to its zzso activity towards zzso zzso zzso A number of characteristic zzso changes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were observed in the cell culture after zzso treatment with zzso zzso a well-known donor of zzso These zzso changes were clearly associated with a zzso zzso increase in the number of pathological zzso as well as with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells, an independent indicator of zzso activity of these zzso The zzso index of zzso zzso cells increased in response to zzso and underwent zzso changes depending on zzso zzso At a zzso concentration of 100 zzso zzso reduced significantly the toxicity of zzso determined as the zzso of pathological zzso thus acting as a protective zzso Taken together, our findings indicate that zzso specifically zzso the zzso process in zzso zzso cells, and provide the first evidence that zzso effects of zzso can be restored by zzso
