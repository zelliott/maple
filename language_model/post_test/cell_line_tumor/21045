We have previously reported that zzso affected cell cycle progression and zzso D1 and B1 expression in two zzso cell lines differing in zzso status zzso zzso In the present study, we further demonstrated that zzso affected zzso viability and zzso of the two cell lines in a zzso and zzso manner, and zzso cells were more sensitive than zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso and zzso of proliferation and zzso We further investigated the expression profiles of genes related with zzso and cell cycle in the two cell lines with a human zzso zzso spotted with 267 genes of zzso and cell zzso Thirty five genes were zzso and 15 genes zzso at least zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso 38 genes were zzso and 21 genes zzso at least zzso in zzso cells by zzso After zzso treatment, zzso expression was zzso zzso in zzso cells, but only zzso in zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso suppresses the growth of zzso cells mainly by regulating expression of genes of cell cycle arrest, stress and zzso whereas zzso affects zzso cells mainly by regulating expression of genes belonging to zzso tumor zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso The data may be helpful for zzso zzso as an zzso drug in the treatment of zzso
