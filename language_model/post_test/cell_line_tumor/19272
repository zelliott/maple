We characterized zzso virus 1 zzso a zzso isolated from the marine zzso zzso zzso zzso Genome sequence analysis established that zzso is representative of a viral cluster distant from other zzso The maturation process of the zzso zzso by the zzso segment A was delineated with the identification of the zzso of the viral zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and the characterization of peptides zzso from the processing of zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso One of these peptides was shown to possess a zzso zzso Like the zzso zzso virus, the zzso exhibits a zzso zzso (named zzso located between zzso and zzso zzso analysis allowed the identification in zzso of a zzso zzso zzso that does not possess the common zzso signature of the zzso zzso The zzso segment B encodes the viral zzso zzso zzso with the unique sequence motif arrangement identified in other zzso zzso
