zzso zzso growth factor A zzso to as zzso is implicated in colon cancer zzso Currently, the main accepted mechanism by which zzso promotes colon cancer growth is via the stimulation of zzso which was originally zzso by late Judah zzso However, the cellular source of zzso in colon cancer zzso and, the expression of zzso and its receptors zzso and zzso in colon cancer cells are not fully known and are subjects of zzso 

We examined and zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso in three different human zzso tissue zzso containing sections of zzso zzso and normal zzso zzso zzso zzso In human colon cancer cell lines zzso and zzso and normal colon cell lines zzso and zzso we examined expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso production and zzso into the culture zzso and, the effect of a zzso selective inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso on cell zzso 

Human zzso cancer specimens had strong expression of zzso in cancer cells and also expressed zzso and zzso zzso studies showed that human colon cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso but not normal zzso cell lines, express zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso into the medium up to a concentration 2000 zzso within 48 zzso Furthermore, we showed that zzso of zzso receptors using a specific zzso inhibitor significantly reduced proliferation (by zzso of cultured colon cancer cell zzso 

Our findings support the contention that zzso generated by colon cancer cells stimulates their growth directly through an zzso mechanism that is independent of its primary function in the induction of zzso
