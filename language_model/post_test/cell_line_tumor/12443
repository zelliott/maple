Our previous study demonstrate that vitamin D3 zzso the binding of vitamin D3 zzso zzso to zzso zzso factor and stimulates zzso expression via the zzso consensus sequences in the zzso Both zzso and zzso are zzso zzso it is unclear which protein functions as the zzso component of the zzso zzso To address this issue, we constructed the zzso deletion zzso of zzso and tested the effect of vitamin D3 on zzso zzso In consistent with our previous results, we found that expression of zzso zzso in zzso colon cancer cells, which expressed very low level of zzso zzso increased vitamin zzso zzso promoter activity and protein zzso On the contrary, expression of zzso deletion zzso had little zzso DNA affinity zzso zzso zzso showed that both zzso and deletion zzso of zzso bound to the DNA probe corresponding to the zzso binding site in the zzso promoter in a vitamin zzso manner indicating deletion of zzso domain does not affect the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also confirmed that zzso and its zzso deletion zzso bound to zzso promoter in zzso We found that deletion of zzso domain abolished the interaction of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso functions as the zzso component of the zzso complex to trigger gene zzso
