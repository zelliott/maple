Biological effects of nuclear zzso zzso zzso can differ tremendously depending on the cellular zzso For example, zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso is converted from an inhibitor of death zzso induced zzso into a promoter of zzso radiation zzso zzso This conversion requires prolonged zzso zzso zzso and is facilitated by zzso + zzso zzso of the negative feedback loop for zzso zzso involving a lack of inhibitor of zzso (I zzso zzso protein zzso Permanent zzso of the upstream zzso zzso beta results from zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to immediate zzso and degradation of newly zzso I zzso zzso 

To investigate the mechanism underlying the general zzso tuning of zzso beta zzso upon zzso zzso we have developed a strictly reduced mathematical model based on ordinary differential equations which includes the essential processes concerning the zzso zzso zzso beta and zzso Combining experimental and zzso approaches we demonstrate that zzso active, but not zzso activated zzso tunes out zzso beta zzso thus allowing for I zzso alpha zzso in response to zzso zzso analysis and determination of confidence intervals reveal that the model allows reliable predictions regarding the dynamics of zzso zzso and zzso beta zzso Additionally, scenario analysis is used to scrutinize several hypotheses regarding the mode of zzso zzso zzso The model suggests that down regulation of zzso activity, which results in prevention of I zzso alpha zzso is not a direct zzso action but requires zzso 

The model developed here can be used as a reliable building block of larger zzso zzso B models and offers comprehensive zzso potential for future modeling of zzso zzso B zzso It gives more insight into the newly discovered mechanisms for zzso zzso and allows for substantiated predictions and investigation of different zzso The evidence of zzso activity of zzso at the zzso complex provides new insights into the feedback regulation of zzso zzso B, which is crucial for the development of new zzso zzso
