The zzso zzso family is part of a gene expression signature that predicts poor prognosis in lung cancer zzso In a mouse model of zzso lung zzso zzso levels are suppressed in zzso tumor cells, and forced zzso expression zzso tumor growth and zzso but the zzso target genes that drive lung zzso have not been fully zzso Here, we scanned the zzso for putative zzso binding sites and found them in the zzso region zzso of 35 genes that are amplified in human zzso Mining of a database of zzso human lung zzso revealed that the levels of one of these zzso zzso correlate zzso with duration of zzso zzso zzso expression suppressed zzso levels in zzso lung zzso cells derived from zzso mice, and zzso regulated the zzso zzso in reporter zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso lung zzso zzso abundant zzso and enhanced tumor cell invasion in zzso zzso zzso tumor cell invasion was zzso by zzso zzso or zzso zzso in tumor zzso zzso zzso decreased the growth and zzso of tumor cells in zzso zzso We conclude that zzso suppresses lung zzso by targeting zzso
