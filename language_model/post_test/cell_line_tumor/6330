Strategies using zzso zzso as carriers for delivering zzso drugs to zzso have been described zzso Here a novel magnetic zzso zzso system, based on zzso carbon zzso zzso is presented with the aim of improving the outcome of cancer with zzso zzso zzso The potential therapeutic effect of zzso zzso loading magnetic zzso carbon zzso zzso was compared with that of zzso loading zzso carbon particles zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso and zzso both had high zzso activity in zzso similar to free zzso zzso administration of zzso loading magnetic zzso resulted in successful zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso under the magnetic field, with zzso superior to zzso and more effectively in the high-dose versus zzso zzso The successful application of zzso delivery of zzso using zzso highlights the clinical potential of zzso for future cancer zzso treatment with high efficacy and minimum zzso
