zzso gold zzso zzso zzso are highly promising materials for tumor imaging and therapy because of their low zzso intrinsic fluorescence, and the availability of zzso groups for zzso linkage of diverse zzso zzso zzso zzso stabilized by bovine serum zzso zzso were prepared via an improved zzso synthetic zzso To zzso the selective affinity of zzso zzso for high folate zzso zzso expressing tumors, zzso acid zzso was immobilized on the surface of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso fluorescent dye zzso was zzso with zzso zzso for in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso a widely used clinical zzso drug, was also zzso to the zzso zzso zzso to form a zzso zzso Cellular and in zzso acute toxicity studies demonstrated the low toxicity of the zzso to normal cells and zzso Additionally, in zzso and in zzso study of the dynamic behavior and targeting ability of zzso to different tumors validated the high selective affinity of zzso to zzso positive zzso With regard to the zzso high zzso activity was displayed by this zzso due to the zzso zzso zzso zzso all of the results supported the potential of using zzso zzso zzso for tumor imaging and targeted zzso
