Advanced zzso end products zzso are found in various zzso protein deposits such as zzso zzso in Alzheimer's disease and zzso bodies in Parkinson's zzso Among the many zzso zzso compounds and zzso zzso zzso is most likely to contribute to zzso zzso formation, since it is extremely zzso and constantly produced by degradation of zzso Furthermore, zzso levels increase under zzso conditions, for example, when zzso levels are zzso the expression or activity of zzso I is zzso as is the case when the concentration of reduced zzso the zzso zzso of zzso I, is zzso However, the effects of zzso on zzso function and energy levels have not been studied in zzso In this study, we show that zzso increases the formation of zzso zzso oxygen species and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso also decreases zzso membrane potential and zzso zzso levels, suggesting that zzso zzso loss of zzso integrity could contribute to the zzso of zzso The zzso effects such as zzso depletion and zzso dysfunction can be prevented by zzso of the cells with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso In a clinical context, these compounds could not only offer a promising therapeutic strategy to reduce zzso zzso but also to decrease the zzso impairment of energy production in aging and zzso
