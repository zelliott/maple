zzso zzso zzso gene expression by pairing to the zzso of target transcripts inducing zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso measured either at the primary zzso zzso or mature transcript level, was recently described in diffuse large zzso zzso zzso These studies have been limited in size, however, and have not attempted to link zzso expression to that of putative target zzso To start to address these issues, we examined a collection of 22 zzso zzso cell zzso The expression of zzso is zzso in these cell lines and associates with zzso zzso We found that the expression of the primary zzso transcript reliably reflects that of the functional mature zzso Because many gene array platforms include probe sets for the primary zzso zzso these findings allowed us to confidently examine large zzso expression zzso of primary zzso in the context of zzso zzso Our investigation revealed that zzso expression zzso with specific molecular zzso of zzso and it is highest in activated zzso zzso zzso These tumors are characterized by zzso zzso of zzso signals, which supports the data derived from our cell zzso More importantly, using supervised learning zzso we identified a robust gene signature driven by the differential expression of zzso These profiles contained several gene zzso including predicted targets, consistently zzso in tumors expressing high levels of zzso Our data start to unveil the zzso effects of zzso expression in zzso and indicate the utility of this strategy in the identification and validation of zzso target zzso
