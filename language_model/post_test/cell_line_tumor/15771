We assessed whether imaging zzso zzso could distinguish mature zzso from necrosis in human zzso germ cell zzso zzso zzso residual zzso 

Human zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso or treated to form mature zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso over a period of 8 zzso In another group, necrosis was induced in zzso with high-dose zzso plus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso small animal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging was performed in three rats (one control and two treated for 4 and 8 weeks with zzso Imaging of zzso expression was performed in six rats bearing mature zzso and two rats with zzso zzso on a zzso device after injection of the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso to zzso zzso zzso studies of human and mouse zzso expression were zzso 

zzso induced differentiation of the zzso After 8 weeks, some zzso structures and zzso cells were zzso in contrast, control zzso showed zzso zzso zzso PET imaging showed that mature zzso had very low zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso value zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging accurately distinguished mature zzso zzso to muscle zzso from necrosis zzso to muscle zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso zzso expression was strong in the zzso structures of mature zzso zzso and negative in host zzso 

Imaging zzso zzso accurately distinguished mature zzso from necrosis following zzso treatment in human zzso zzso
