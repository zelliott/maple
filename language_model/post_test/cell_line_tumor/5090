The T cell zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso through a complex interaction that results in an zzso zzso cell zzso zzso While it is well recognized that specific zzso interactions generate the zzso zzso their direct contribution to the zzso cell zzso has not been zzso zzso Moreover, since human zzso T zzso zzso clones are also susceptible to zzso zzso to target cells, it remains unclear whether zzso cell zzso formation can serve as an indicator of specific zzso recognition by the zzso To address this question, a zzso zzso zzso clone recognizing the zzso zzso zzso zzso in association with zzso was tested against melanoma cell lines lacking or expressing the zzso zzso and/or zzso In this model, zzso interactions cooperated with zzso molecules to facilitate zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso recognition played a dominant role resulting in up to zzso increases in zzso frequency, and a 50% increase of zzso binding to tumor cells over zzso The increased number of zzso contained in zzso correlated with the number of zzso producing zzso These results warrant further investigation to evaluate zzso zzso as a potential tool to detect and isolate viable and functionally active zzso Since zzso formation analysis does not require knowledge of the target zzso this zzso could potentially be used for enrichment of zzso directed against novel zzso
