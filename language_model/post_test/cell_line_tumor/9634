The biological functions and reaction pathways of zzso in zzso system were zzso Mouse zzso zzso protein is a zzso zzso from mouse zzso To evaluate the effect of zzso zzso protein on the zzso system, zzso zzso cell line zzso was an experimental target for achieving the in zzso zzso The cells were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso or under zzso medium to mimic the stress environment for various time zzso then employing Western zzso to measure the zzso protein zzso It showed the zzso induction effect on zzso protein and suggested the level of protein zzso zzso to environmental zzso Furthermore, the supplementation of zzso protein to the medium accompanied the reduction of cell zzso It showed that the zzso protein may be a death factor under conditional media via zzso and zzso zzso Based on the zzso hypothesis, we investigated the effect of zzso protein on cultured zzso cells upon the zzso protein zzso We have demonstrated significant increase in zzso zzso oxygen species upon zzso protein zzso While the changes of zzso membrane potential and zzso c release from zzso occurred, the activities of zzso -9 and zzso were found to have zzso The zzso of DNA was occurred suggesting that zzso protein induced zzso DNA damage, which in turn triggered the process of zzso It shows evidence for the direct effect of this protein on zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso protein creates an zzso zzso environment that zzso zzso in zzso zzso
