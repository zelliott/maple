The zzso zzso factor, a key regulator of proliferation and differentiation in zzso and other cell types, has an zzso DNA binding domain and a large zzso domain responsible for zzso zzso negative regulation and determining target gene zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso gene zzso has been reported in some patients with zzso and other types of zzso implicating activated zzso of zzso in the development of human zzso Alternative zzso zzso can produce zzso of zzso with zzso distinct zzso activities that may be involved in transformation and zzso Here, by performing a detailed, single zzso zzso we found that zzso alternative zzso zzso was elevated and much more complex in leukemia samples than in cell lines or zzso zzso zzso cells from normal zzso The results revealed that leukemia samples express more than 60 different zzso zzso zzso most of which have multiple alternative zzso events and were not zzso by conventional zzso or zzso zzso For example, the single zzso zzso detected 21 and 22 zzso zzso containing the zzso and zzso zzso respectively, most of which zzso unexpected zzso forms of zzso zzso Furthermore, the detailed analysis identified some zzso zzso whose expression correlated with poor survival in a small cohort of precursor zzso zzso Our findings indicate that single zzso zzso can reveal complexities in zzso alternative zzso that have potential as novel zzso and could help explain the role of zzso zzso in the development of human zzso
