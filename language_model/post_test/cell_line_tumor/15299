To study the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso on the growth of human zzso zzso cell strain zzso zzso in nude mice, and to explore the possible effect mechanisms of the zzso 

The models of human poorly differentiated zzso zzso in nude mice were established and randomly divided into four groups, control group, zzso group, zzso group and zzso + zzso zzso The effect of zzso on each group was zzso The zzso obtained from the mice were detected by optical microscope and zzso zzso rock end labeling zzso zzso zzso of zzso was detected by real zzso and zzso 

zzso group and zzso + zzso group could obviously inhibit the growth of zzso induce the zzso of human zzso zzso zzso cell and zzso the expression of zzso 

zzso can greatly inhibit the growth of human zzso zzso cell strain zzso zzso in nude mice, which were related to the induced zzso of human zzso zzso cell and zzso expression of zzso Combination of zzso with zzso seem to be more zzso
