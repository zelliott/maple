We have recently shown that sodium zzso zzso was able to inhibit the proliferation of the zzso cell line zzso zzso in a zzso way, and that it also induced the expression of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso is the main protein present in milk and is composed of alpha zzso beta zzso and zzso zzso zzso This work was undertaken to evaluate if any one zzso is responsible for the proliferation and differentiation properties found for zzso on zzso zzso Taking into consideration that zzso zzso cells are considered to be zzso and dependent on zzso for zzso we also included for this study a zzso cell line, zzso that does not depend on any external growth factor for its proliferation in order to evaluate if the growth zzso effect of zzso is also present for zzso zzso Our results showed that all zzso were zzso for the proliferation of either zzso zzso and zzso and that only the zzso zzso cells were induced to differentiate into the zzso zzso In order to evaluate if zzso was able to inhibit the proliferation of other zzso cells we used zzso and zzso and found that they were also zzso We also determined that the different zzso exhibit different differentiation properties, with zzso being the only one able to induce the zzso of zzso We consider this work to open a new field of research, where zzso or its zzso can be studied for their possible role in zzso and on the zzso of zzso cell proliferation for therapeutic zzso
