To explore the effect of zzso on the zzso migration and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso we constructed the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso them into zzso zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso and protein were detected using real-time quantitative zzso and western zzso The proliferation rates of zzso cells were determined by zzso zzso flow zzso zzso and zzso zzso The migration in two or three zzso space of zzso cells were determined by zzso zzso and in zzso invasion zzso The extent of zzso in zzso cells was estimated by observing the amount of zzso zzso absorbed with capture zzso zzso and zzso zzso was observed under zzso zzso zzso The results show that: zzso after zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso and protein in zzso cells decreased significantly, the growth of cells was zzso which induced cell cycle arrest, the proliferation rates were dramatically reduced and the expression of zzso declined, and migration and zzso in cells were zzso compared with zzso cells zzso zzso zzso Following zzso with zzso the expression of zzso zzso and protein in zzso cells increased, and both the proliferation of cells and the cell cycle were promoted ( zzso zzso However, the abilities of cell migration and zzso were not affected compared with zzso zzso These data suggest that: zzso the zzso gene may play an important role in zzso migration and zzso of zzso zzso zzso technology may efficiently suppress the expression and function of zzso in zzso suggesting that zzso may be a therapeutic target for zzso
