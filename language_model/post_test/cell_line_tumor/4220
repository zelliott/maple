zzso zzso zzso particles perform numerous zzso zzso Animal studies demonstrate that exposure to fine or zzso particulate matter zzso can promote HDL zzso However, the impact of PM on humans remains zzso 

We aimed to determine the effect of exposure to coarse concentrated ambient particles zzso on several metrics of HDL function in healthy zzso 

zzso adults zzso zzso were exposed to coarse zzso zzso in a rural location and filtered air zzso for zzso in a zzso zzso crossover zzso zzso blood collected zzso and zzso zzso was measured for zzso zzso of zzso from cells and zzso zzso for HDL zzso capacity by a fluorescent zzso and zzso zzso The changes zzso zzso third zzso between zzso among 29 subjects with available results were compared by matched zzso zzso 

zzso cholesterol zzso capacity did not differ between zzso at either time point zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso did not differ zzso zzso versus zzso zzso 

zzso inhalation of coarse PM from a rural location did not acutely impair several zzso of HDL zzso Whether coarse PM derived from urban sites, fine particles or longer term PM zzso can promote HDL dysfunction warrant future zzso
