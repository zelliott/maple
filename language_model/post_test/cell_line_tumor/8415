zzso have unique capacities of interacting with the cellular machinery and entering zzso To be able to exploit this potential, it is essential to understand what controls the interactions at the interface between zzso and zzso it is now established that zzso in biological media are covered by proteins and other zzso forming a zzso on the zzso surface, which zzso a new identity to the zzso By zzso the proteins of the serum, using zzso zzso we now show that this zzso layer is strong enough to be retained on the zzso as they enter cells and is zzso to the zzso on the zzso There, the zzso is zzso and this is followed by zzso damage, leading to zzso release of zzso content, and ultimately zzso Thus the zzso protects the cells from the damage induced by the bare zzso surface until zzso cleared in the zzso 

This study investigates the effects of protein zzso that normally forms on the surface of zzso during in zzso use, describing the steps of zzso processing of such zzso to enhance our understanding of how these particles interact with the cellular zzso
