Four zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso B zzso C zzso and D zzso were designed and zzso on the basis of a zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso peptides have been reported to exhibit multiple functions, including zzso and zzso activity, without zzso on normal zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we found that the zzso peptides inhibited zzso activity zzso zzso 40 zzso A new zzso zzso C2 zzso designed from zzso C to zzso into the zzso by a penetrating sequence zzso showed extremely strong zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C2 exhibited a great increase in zzso against various cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the immediate death of the cells suggested that the high zzso was not an effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso swelling zzso and zzso observations of zzso indicated that the major target of the zzso C2 was the zzso zzso
