Imaging with zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso has been developed for the zzso and diagnosis of a variety of human solid tumors including gastrointestinal zzso 

In this study we investigated the zzso safety and absorbed dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso in 9 patients with pancreatic zzso Following intravenous administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso sequential images were recorded during the initial 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso images were acquired in anterior and zzso views at various time zzso All patients underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso calculations were performed on the basis of gamma camera zzso Estimates of radiation absorbed dose were calculated using the zzso 3 zzso 

The highest absorbed organ doses were found to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso urinary zzso zzso zzso lungs zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The effective dose was estimated to be zzso zzso A majority of primary pancreatic tumors and their zzso were zzso by zzso zzso 

In zzso binding results confirmed specific binding of zzso to pancreatic tumor cells and zzso zzso shows favorable zzso and is a safe zzso that may be of potential value for the imaging of zzso zzso status in zzso
