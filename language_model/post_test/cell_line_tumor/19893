The potential role of zzso zzso zzso on the development of tumor recurrence in pancreatic cancer was zzso 

The zzso of 3 human pancreatic zzso cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso to zzso of zzso zzso cells after zzso with zzso or 10 zzso zzso zzso or zzso was assessed in a zzso human in zzso zzso zzso zzso served as zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso cells with zzso or zzso but not zzso increased zzso of all three tumor cell lines as compared to zzso in the control zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso reached zzso for zzso zzso and for zzso zzso (all zzso the control, zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells with zzso or zzso resulted in a significant zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The addition of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso did not decrease zzso to zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso enhanced tumor cell binding seems to be independent of these zzso zzso 

zzso zzso derived from surgical trauma may enhance tumor cell zzso to zzso zzso cells and thus bring about more successful tumor cell zzso resulting in an increased risk of zzso zzso
