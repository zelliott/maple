The role of zzso in numerous zzso responses triggered by a variety of mechanisms both in states of health and disease has raised considerable interest in this cellular zzso However, the current zzso tools to study zzso are either invasive or require genetic zzso zzso zzso is a potentially quantitative zzso method that has been shown to be useful for the zzso zzso analysis of living biological cells and zzso We present in this study initial efforts to study zzso using zzso zzso The response of adherent mouse and human cancer cells to zzso conditions zzso deprivation and zzso acid zzso was zzso by zzso zzso and compared to zzso zzso results using zzso zzso We also demonstrate the capability of zzso zzso to monitor the recovery dynamics of starved cells and to probe the zzso in the response to zzso that can arise in cell zzso Finally, this work suggests that the zzso zzso zzso line associated with zzso may be a useful spectral marker indicative of an zzso response to zzso zzso Overall, this study establishes the utility of zzso zzso to zzso detect biologically relevant changes in live cells exposed to conditions known to trigger zzso
