zzso are pediatric tumors that develop from sympathetic precursors and express zzso zzso such as zzso Y zzso zzso is a sympathetic neurotransmitter acting via multiple receptors zzso Both zzso and zzso are commonly expressed in zzso cell lines and zzso The zzso zzso from zzso stimulates tumor cell proliferation and zzso As both processes are zzso the aim of this study was to assess zzso as a potential therapeutic target for zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso which resulted in decreased proliferation and induction of zzso zzso Similar zzso effects were achieved with zzso small interfering zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited growth of zzso and zzso zzso which was associated with decreased zzso of zzso zzso as well as reduced proliferation zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso zzso end zzso zzso The zzso zzso also exerted an zzso zzso In zzso it reduced the proliferation of zzso cells induced by zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso had decreased zzso and a high degree of focal zzso In human zzso zzso the expression of zzso was observed in both tumor and zzso cells, while zzso was predominantly expressed in zzso zzso In zzso zzso is a promising new target for zzso therapy affecting both cancer cells and tumor zzso
