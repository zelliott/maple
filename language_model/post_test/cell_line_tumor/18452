We examined the potential role of zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited the activity of the zzso promoters for the zzso 14 and zzso genes and reduced the expression of the zzso for the zzso genes zzso and zzso The ability of zzso to suppress zzso promoter activity was lost in transformed zzso cell lines and was zzso by a zzso located between zzso zzso of zzso This domain lies outside the domain required to inhibit zzso zzso suggesting that this activity is zzso by a novel functional zzso zzso of zzso zzso serum response element, zzso zzso and zzso responsive reporters indicated that zzso significantly suppressed the zzso responsive reporter and modestly increased zzso activity in zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso may have a role in zzso signaling events in zzso zzso The effects of zzso in differentiated zzso indicated a more traditional role for zzso as an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso was unable to initiate the expression of differentiation markers but was able to zzso zzso markers and genes in differentiated zzso This latter role is consistent with the ability of zzso to inhibit zzso suppression of zzso differentiation and suggest that the opposing actions of zzso and zzso may serve to zzso zzso zzso
