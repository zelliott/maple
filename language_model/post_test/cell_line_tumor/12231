zzso and zzso studies of two zzso containing a common zzso base, zzso (1 and zzso have been zzso The synthesis was accomplished by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso with zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso studies were conducted using zzso as a zzso by measuring changes in chemical shifts of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the sugar zzso zzso of the zzso with variations in zzso and zzso Large downfield chemical shifts were observed for the NH, zzso and to a lesser extent for the zzso zzso when the temperature was lowered from 25 to 0 degrees C, and then further down to zzso degrees C in 10 degree zzso The observed experimental data are consistent with the results of molecular modeling zzso zzso 2 exhibited low level zzso activity against zzso in zzso cells with an zzso of zzso zzso No cellular toxicity was observed at the highest concentration of the compound zzso
