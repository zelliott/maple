In our previous study, we developed a novel series of zzso zzso acid derivatives as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2010, 18, zzso J zzso zzso 2011, 54, zzso among which, compound zzso zzso was identified and validated as the most potent one with marked in zzso and in zzso zzso potency zzso zzso zzso 2011, 54, zzso zzso further modification in 1 afforded another oral active analog zzso zzso with simplified structure and lower molecular zzso Biological evaluation of compound 2 showed zzso zzso against zzso zzso 1, 2, 3, and 6, which was confirmed by Western zzso analysis zzso Most importantly, compound 2 exhibited similar even more potent in zzso and in zzso zzso activities relative to the approved zzso zzso inhibitor zzso
