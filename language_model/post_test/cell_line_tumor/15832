We previously reported the frequent zzso of the zzso membrane zzso in zzso zzso zzso and its role for controlling cancer zzso zzso this study aimed at assessing the zzso properties of compounds zzso zzso activity by zzso its binding with the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We have designed small interfering peptides zzso that are able to enter within cells and to competitively antagonize the binding of zzso to the zzso domain of zzso Their zzso properties were assessed in zzso on a panel of human zzso cell lines and in zzso on the zzso transgenic mouse model of zzso 

We have shown that zzso decrease cell viability via zzso depending on their affinity for zzso with a therapeutic index between zzso and zzso zzso zzso properties were linked to zzso degradation and zzso zzso In transgenic mice, zzso injection of zzso inhibited zzso zzso 

We have completed a zzso showing that in zzso and in zzso the pharmacological zzso of zzso displays zzso properties against zzso The mechanisms can involve zzso and zzso zzso Further studies are warranted to design protocols showing the zzso with systemic in zzso zzso
