zzso virus zzso is one of the major infectious pathogens zzso zzso infection is a highly dynamic zzso Currently, no zzso drug is available for treating zzso diseases since little is known regarding how the virus interacts with host cells during zzso Advanced molecular imaging technologies are powerful tools to understand the dynamics of zzso interactions and molecular zzso This study exploited a zzso particle tracking technology to address whether zzso interacts with zzso machinery during the early stage of zzso Using zzso zzso and three-dimensional image analysis, we showed that zzso triggered the formation of green zzso zzso zzso protein zzso chain 3 zzso zzso and zzso zzso engulfed zzso particles within zzso zzso Moreover, zzso particle tracking revealed that both zzso particles and zzso traveled together during the viral zzso Finally, in the presence of zzso zzso zzso the replication of zzso was inhibited and the location of zzso particles spread in zzso In contrast, the numbers of newly zzso zzso were elevated and the zzso of zzso particles and zzso was detected while the cells were treated with zzso zzso zzso Taken together, we propose that zzso particles interact with zzso at the early stage of viral infection, which promotes the replication of zzso
