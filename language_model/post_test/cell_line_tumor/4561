zzso zzso that block the synthesis of zzso are proving to be superior to zzso and may replace tamoxifen as zzso treatment for zzso zzso zzso zzso breast cancer zzso However, acquisition of resistance to all forms of treatments is inevitable and a major clinical zzso In this study, we have investigated the effects of long-term zzso deprivation in the breast cancer zzso model and whether sensitivity to zzso can be restored in zzso We also compared whether combining zzso with tamoxifen or zzso inhibited tumor growth better than either drug zzso 

zzso zzso zzso human zzso breast cancer cells zzso were grown as tumors in zzso zzso nude zzso Twelve weeks after zzso when tumors reached 300 zzso animals were grouped and injected with vehicle, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tamoxifen plus zzso and zzso plus zzso zzso volumes were measured zzso 

zzso of zzso cells grew equally well with and without zzso indicating the ability of the cells to zzso in the absence of zzso The combination of zzso with tamoxifen or zzso inhibited tumor growth better than either drug zzso The combination of zzso plus zzso was the most effective treatment that maintained tumor zzso for a prolonged zzso 

These results suggest that blocking both zzso and growth factor zzso pathways could provide effective control over tumor growth of long-term zzso human breast zzso
