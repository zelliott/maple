zzso 1 protein zzso expression was evaluated in tumor and mast cells in human zzso cancer and control zzso The effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also examined during the cellular growth of the zzso human zzso zzso zzso cell zzso This zzso inhibited the proliferation of the zzso cells within 144 zzso In surgical tissue specimens from 20 patients with zzso cancer, zzso zzso analysis showed in zzso zzso of zzso expression in the tumor and increased in mast cells and zzso cells treated with zzso zzso Combined in zzso and in zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso plays a regulatory role in zzso cancer cell zzso We believe that a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of zzso in tumor and mast cells may lead to future biological targets for the therapeutic intervention of human zzso zzso
