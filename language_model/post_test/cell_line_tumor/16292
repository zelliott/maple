zzso cancer is the second most common cancer affecting women zzso It is characterized by zzso aberrations and zzso in the expression levels of many cell cycle regulatory zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso family that encodes DNA binding zzso These proteins are involved in cell proliferation and control of cellular zzso 

Four established cervical cancer cell lines were examined and compared with normal zzso using gene expression profiling and comparative zzso zzso and results were correlated to identify potential novel cervical cancer zzso zzso were validated using zzso zzso chain reaction, and the potential role of zzso as a clinical zzso was then evaluated by zzso on 30 tissue zzso 

zzso was found to be zzso in the cervical cancer cell lines by gene expression zzso and this result was confirmed using zzso zzso chain zzso Analysis of comparative zzso zzso data indicated that zzso zzso which encodes the zzso zzso was amplified in the human zzso zzso type zzso zzso and zzso cell lines but not in the zzso zzso or zzso zzso cell zzso 

Although zzso zzso was predominantly absent in normal cervical zzso strong zzso zzso of 2 or 3) was identified in all cases of cervical zzso zzso cervical zzso zzso zzso and invasive cancer on zzso In addition, strong zzso of a population of zzso scattered single cells is zzso We zzso that these may represent so-called cancer zzso zzso
