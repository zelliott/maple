The emergence of resistance to chemotherapy remains a principle problem in the treatment of zzso lung cancer zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso activates zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling in zzso cells and prevents zzso zzso zzso and subsequent zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso and radiation induce zzso cell cycle arrest in zzso cells prior to zzso and that zzso prevents this by overriding the zzso of zzso and zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso A and zzso These effects are zzso by pharmacological and genetic zzso of zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso is not zzso by altered zzso cell proliferation or DNA zzso Thus, zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso allowing zzso cells to survive with persistent DNA damage, providing a model to account for the emergence of acquired drug zzso
