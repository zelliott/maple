zzso is a zzso of DNA damage response zzso and a tumor zzso whose zzso on damaged zzso promotes DNA repair and enhances zzso zzso Using zzso formation of zzso as a zzso in two human cell lines, we performed an zzso functional zzso zzso screen for zzso of cellular response to zzso radiation zzso Here, we provide the complete results of this screen as an information resource, and validate and functionally characterize one of the identified zzso a nuclear pore component zzso as a novel factor specifically required for zzso nuclear zzso Using a range of cell and molecular biology approaches including zzso imaging, we show that zzso of zzso prevents zzso but not several other zzso factors, from entering the zzso in the newly forming daughter zzso This translates into decreased zzso zzso focus formation, delayed DNA repair and impaired cell survival after zzso In addition, zzso depletion zzso DNA damage caused by replication zzso Finally, we show that the zzso part of zzso is required for effective zzso nuclear import, and that zzso is imported to the nucleus through the zzso zzso Our data define the zzso relationships within this emerging zzso zzso and zzso this mechanism in the maintenance of zzso zzso
