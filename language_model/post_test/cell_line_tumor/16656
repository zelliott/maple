To explore the relationship between the expression of zzso gene and the proliferation ability of lung zzso zzso 

zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso were used to detect the expression of zzso gene in lung zzso tissue and cell lines compared with adjacent zzso region and the human lung zzso cell zzso zzso The zzso zzso interference technique was used to knock down the expression of zzso in lung zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso Cell cycle and cell zzso were measured by zzso zzso In zzso four groups of zzso nude mice were zzso injected with the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells at a single site to investigate the effect of zzso in the nude mice tumor zzso In zzso zzso was detection by zzso zzso 

zzso was highly expressed in lung zzso tissue and cell lines compared with adjacent zzso region and the human lung zzso cell zzso zzso zzso could decrease lung zzso cell proliferation by delaying zzso entry and induce cell zzso which led to the zzso of the zzso of zzso and zzso cell zzso Further investigation showed that injecting the zzso cells into the nude mice could significantly decrease the tumor zzso 

zzso of zzso expression by zzso zzso may provide a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of lung zzso
