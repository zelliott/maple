Few human pathogens possess the ability exhibited by zzso zzso to colonize and cause symptomatic infections at different body zzso The host immune system is the major factor determining whether this opportunistic zzso behaves as a zzso or as a zzso since zzso zzso strains appear capable of expressing similar zzso factors in response to specific zzso zzso This report provides evidence showing that zzso zzso zzso with diverse zzso backgrounds zzso and c zzso differently zzso their zzso potential when zzso in zzso with human zzso derived zzso zzso zzso zzso differences were observed in the ability to undergo zzso transition, a relevant zzso zzso zzso factor, between b and c zzso ( zzso upon their zzso by zzso All c types were able to develop zzso forms, resist zzso killing, zzso and escape from zzso The b type zzso which were shown to be more efficiently zzso by zzso cells than the c type strains zzso were susceptible to zzso killing and predominantly found as zzso inside zzso Despite their different zzso zzso both b and c type zzso were equally able to undergo zzso and to express zzso and zzso zzso markers of the zzso transition program, during in zzso zzso Since zzso play a critical role in the host resistance to zzso zzso the different response of b and c zzso to zzso infection suggests that the c type strains are better suited to behave as a more virulent strain zzso
