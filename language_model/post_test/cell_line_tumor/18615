Comparative zzso zzso zzso has proved to be a powerful tool for the detection of zzso copy number changes in human zzso and in other diseases caused by zzso zzso zzso versions of zzso allow the definition of these zzso with resolution determined by the size and distribution of the array zzso Resolution approaching 100 zzso can be achieved by use of zzso zzso bacterial artificial zzso zzso distributed zzso across regions of zzso We describe here a computer program that automatically assembles zzso of minimally overlapping zzso zzso using information about zzso zzso and the normal zzso DNA zzso We demonstrate the characteristics of zzso assembled and zzso by use of this approach for regions of zzso zzso in human zzso and breast zzso at zzso bands zzso and zzso and zzso arm zzso We also show illustrative analyses of regions of amplification in these regions in breast and zzso tumor cell lines by use of array zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso
