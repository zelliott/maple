zzso is a membrane protein of tight zzso and is associated with the development of various zzso However, the significance of zzso expression in cancer cells is not well zzso Here, we showed for the first time the zzso effect of zzso in human breast cancer zzso zzso 

Human breast cancer zzso and zzso D cells were treated with or without zzso zzso against zzso or tamoxifen and zzso zzso The samples were analyzed by zzso Western zzso or zzso zzso 

The expression of zzso was zzso in zzso zzso cells, whereas the expression of zzso was not altered in zzso zzso D zzso zzso of zzso by zzso increased the amount of zzso zzso zzso zzso regardless of tamoxifen treatment in zzso cells, but not zzso D zzso In the cell zzso of the zzso cells, tamoxifen treatment increased the amount of zzso but decreased the amount of zzso zzso zzso increased the amount of zzso in the zzso of the zzso cells as well as the amount of zzso in their cell zzso 

These results indicate that zzso has zzso effects, and is involved in the regulation of the expression and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso but not zzso D zzso
