There are several studies supporting the role of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso against zzso in which zzso the generation of zzso zzso involved in protein zzso plays the crucial zzso zzso of zzso gene is the most common genetic zzso in pancreatic cancer and the Ras protein requires zzso for its membrane zzso and zzso In the present study, the effectiveness of zzso against pancreatic zzso and its effect on protein zzso were determined using the zzso mouse model (called zzso zzso zzso zzso mice were fed either an zzso diet or a diet supplemented with 100 zzso zzso zzso survival analysis with zzso test revealed a significant increase in survival in mice fed 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to the control mice zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis showed that zzso treatment resulted in a significant reduction in tumor volume and zzso cell zzso zzso studies on primary pancreatic tumors and the cultured zzso pancreatic zzso cells revealed that zzso inhibited zzso in several key zzso including zzso protein and its activities, and similar effect was observed in pancreatic zzso cells treated with zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso on the global gene expression profile demonstrated that a total of 132 genes were significantly modulated by zzso and zzso zzso and soluble zzso zzso were crucial zzso genes which involve in inflammation and zzso This study indicates that zzso has the potential to serve as a zzso agent against pancreatic zzso
