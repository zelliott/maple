The deregulation of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso plays a major role in the zzso of prostate cancer zzso However, therapies targeting zzso have demonstrated limited effectiveness in zzso A potential mechanism to overcome zzso blockade in cancer cells is the zzso zzso of alternative receptors of the human zzso zzso family through the zzso of the zzso receptors and zzso In the present study, we were interested in analyzing if this intrinsic resistance mechanism might contribute to the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso To this end, we selected two zzso human prostate zzso cell lines zzso and zzso and established zzso zzso cells zzso zzso were treated with three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the sensitivity to each treatment was zzso The gene expression of the four zzso receptors and seven zzso of the zzso family was analyzed by real-time zzso prior to and after each zzso The receptors expression and zzso were further characterized by flow zzso and western zzso zzso zzso zzso rapidly induced enhanced gene expression of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso along with zzso zzso and zzso receptors in the zzso zzso In contrast, slight changes were observed in the zzso cells, which are defective in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso In the zzso zzso cells, the expression of zzso and zzso was increased at zzso and protein levels together with zzso leading to enhanced zzso zzso and the zzso of the downstream zzso survival zzso zzso zzso by a zzso zzso restored the zzso activity of zzso in zzso zzso Our results confirm that the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso play a key role in zzso the resistance to zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso
