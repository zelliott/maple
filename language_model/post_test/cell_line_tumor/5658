zzso zzso zzso cancer cells invasion and is expressed in normal zzso and zzso zzso cancer zzso however, the upstream zzso of zzso expression in these cells remains zzso We now demonstrate that zzso growth factor zzso increases zzso zzso levels in several human zzso zzso cell lines and zzso zzso promoter activity in zzso cells in a zzso manner, whereas an zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso increases in zzso promoter activity and zzso zzso zzso zzso increases the zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso and its association with the zzso zzso binding protein zzso whereas blocking the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso markedly reduced these zzso Moreover, depletion of zzso using small interfering zzso attenuated zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso binding to a zzso zzso within the zzso promoter, likely in association with zzso binding protein zzso and zzso of this zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso promoter activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso acts zzso with zzso to promote invasion of zzso and zzso cells, but not zzso cells that express low levels of zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso small interfering zzso also partially inhibited the zzso invasion of zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment zzso increases zzso levels in zzso and zzso which likely zzso the effects of increase zzso production on cell zzso These results provide evidence that zzso is an upstream regulator of the zzso actions of zzso on the invasive properties of zzso cancer zzso
