zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso family, which mediates programmed cell death zzso selectively in tumor zzso The selective zzso activity of TRAIL is believed to be modulated by zzso zzso and zzso and zzso receptors zzso and zzso which appear to compete for zzso zzso Because TRAIL is expressed in a wide range of zzso including brain, zzso and zzso and seems consistently to induce cell death in tumor cells, the zzso has been identified as a promising approach for selectively inducing tumor cell zzso In this study, the authors examine the importance of zzso receptors in both its selectivity for tumor cells and its ability to induce zzso 

The authors first examined sensitivity to TRAIL and expression of TRAIL receptors in four established and four primary cultured zzso cell lines by using viability and fluorescent zzso zzso They then evaluated zzso expression and zzso zzso 3, and zzso 7 zzso by conducting zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was performed to study expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso transcripts from one zzso one partially zzso and one zzso cell line were subsequently zzso The expression of TRAIL receptors in normal and zzso brain tumor pathological specimens were then compared using zzso Finally, to study the direct effects of zzso on zzso cells, the authors conducted transient and stable zzso of the full-length zzso transcript into zzso cells with and without zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso The established zzso cell lines zzso and zzso and all primary cell lines, were zzso at greater than or equal to 100 zzso zzso The zzso cells, by contrast, were susceptible only with zzso whereas zzso cells were not susceptible to zzso The zzso zzso 3, and zzso 7 activity evaluated after treatment with TRAIL showed that zzso cell lines exhibited downstream zzso zzso whereas zzso cells did zzso The zzso sequences in zzso zzso and zzso cell lines were identical to published sequences despite these differences in sensitivity to zzso The zzso performed on extracts from the eight zzso cell lines showed that all expressed zzso zzso revealed ubiquitous expression of zzso in zzso zzso with an associated lack of decoy zzso zzso zzso brain zzso by contrast, stained positive for both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso under both zzso conditions resulted in cell death in all three cell zzso The previously seen resistance of zzso cells to TRAIL was not zzso zzso cell death was confirmed using DNA fragmentation in zzso cell lines and fluorescent zzso in all cell zzso The zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso before zzso zzso were protected from cell zzso 

The authors conclude that zzso represents a promising new approach to directly zzso the intrinsic zzso zzso in zzso zzso The fact that zzso zzso do not express decoy receptors suggests a mechanism of resistance unique from that proposed for normal zzso The zzso of zzso induced zzso cell death in zzso cells without TRAIL and was able to overcome the resistance to TRAIL demonstrated in zzso zzso The zzso protects cells from zzso by acting downstream of the zzso most likely at the level of zzso zzso
