The zzso cell line, zzso and non zzso cell line, zzso cells, established from a zzso zzso were employed for zzso zzso cloning to identify genes with expression unique to zzso producing zzso Several zzso that code for known as well as for many unidentified clones were zzso Most clones were the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso the zzso of which causes zzso and loss of zzso zzso zzso We examined whether the expression of zzso gene in zzso cells is related to hormone zzso We also compared the expression of zzso with that in various other zzso tumor derived cell lines, and confirmed the prominent expression of zzso in zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso for zzso gene expression was zzso The expression level in female rats was low and did not change during the zzso cycle, but increased significantly after zzso and did not return to the normal level under low and high doses of zzso In the male zzso zzso gene expression increased markedly after zzso and was not decreased by zzso or zzso The zzso of zzso gene expression was investigated in zzso fetal and zzso zzso and revealed zzso and sexually zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso gene was observed at fetal day 50 and 65 in males and day 40 in zzso followed by a decline and increased expression before birth in both zzso Thus the expression of zzso gene is prominent in zzso cells and is not under direct control of zzso zzso in both zzso In addition to the variable expression of zzso gene during the fetus period, the present results provide a novel aspect to the understanding of zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso zzso
