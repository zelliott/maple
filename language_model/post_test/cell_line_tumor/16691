The zzso effects of zzso zzso have been proven in many human zzso zzso However, the roles of zzso zzso an important zzso converted from zzso under pH zzso on the growth and proliferation of cervical cancer zzso and zzso cells still remain zzso In the present study, we investigated the potential zzso and zzso effects of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso Cell proliferation was detected by Cell Counting zzso and zzso was analyzed by flow zzso In addition, zzso changes accompanying cell zzso were observed using an zzso microscope after zzso zzso zzso In addition, expression changes of proteins involved in the zzso and zzso pathways were determined by western zzso zzso treatment inhibited the proliferation and induced zzso of zzso and zzso cells significantly in a zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso cells were more sensitive to zzso treatment than zzso cells ( zzso In addition, the expression of zzso zzso and zzso which are involved in the zzso pathway, was zzso by zzso zzso Another protein involved in the zzso pathway, zzso was zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment significantly suppressed the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso class III, zzso zzso and zzso which are involved in the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso exerts zzso effects on zzso and zzso cells through its zzso and zzso roles, especially for zzso zzso The molecular mechanism for these effects may be related to its regulatory effects on zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso may be a preventive and therapeutic agent against cervical zzso
