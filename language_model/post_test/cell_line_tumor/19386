zzso is a protein zzso by the zzso 2 zzso gene and its zzso expression is involved in zzso of zzso zzso To clarify the roles of zzso expression in zzso and progression of gastric zzso it was examined by zzso zzso on tissue zzso containing gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 49) with a comparison of its expression with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were studied for zzso expression by zzso and western zzso zzso expression was zzso in the nucleus of gastric zzso cells, zzso zzso cells and cell zzso Its expression was gradually decreased from zzso to gastric zzso through gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso correlated with zzso size, depth of invasion, zzso invasion, zzso zzso zzso and Union zzso zzso le Cancer zzso staging zzso zzso zzso but not with sex or zzso invasion zzso zzso zzso zzso was strongly expressed in older zzso patients compared with younger ones zzso zzso zzso There was stronger zzso of zzso in zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated cumulative survival rate of patients with positive zzso expression to be higher than without its expression zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that age, zzso size, depth of invasion, zzso invasion, zzso zzso zzso zzso staging and zzso zzso but not sex, zzso invasion or zzso expression were independent zzso factors for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression possibly contributed to zzso growth, invasion and zzso of gastric zzso It was considered as a promising marker to indicate the aggressive zzso and prognosis of gastric zzso
