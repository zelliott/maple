Stress has been shown to be a tumor promoting zzso Both clinical and laboratory studies have shown that chronic stress is associated with tumor growth in several types of zzso zzso zzso Factor zzso is the major zzso zzso of stress, but is also expressed in peripheral zzso Earlier studies have shown that peripheral zzso affects breast cancer cell proliferation and zzso The aim of the present study was to assess the significance of peripheral zzso on tumor growth as a zzso of the response to stress in zzso 

For this purpose we used the zzso breast cancer cell line in cell culture and in zzso zzso were treated with zzso in culture and gene specific zzso were performed to identify genes directly affected by zzso and involved in breast cancer cell zzso To assess the impact of peripheral zzso as a stress zzso in tumor growth, zzso mice were zzso injected with zzso cells in the zzso fat pad to induce breast zzso Mice were subjected to repetitive zzso stress as a model of chronic zzso To inhibit the action of zzso the zzso zzso zzso was injected zzso Breast tissue samples were zzso analyzed and assessed for zzso 

zzso analysis revealed among other genes that zzso induced the expression of zzso and zzso genes involved in breast cancer cell proliferation and zzso changes associated with zzso Cell zzso and zzso zzso confirmed the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso cell proliferation and zzso the zzso action on proliferation confirming its impact on zzso zzso In addition, zzso promoted zzso reorganization and cell migration, suggesting a direct zzso zzso zzso stress zzso tumor growth in zzso breast tumor bearing mice and peripheral administration of the zzso zzso zzso suppressed this zzso Moreover, zzso suppressed zzso in zzso tumors in zzso 

This is the first report demonstrating that peripheral zzso at least in part, mediates the zzso effects of stress and implicates zzso in zzso and zzso zzso
