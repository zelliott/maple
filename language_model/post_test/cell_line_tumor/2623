zzso zzso stem cells zzso have gained interest as promising tools for delivering cancer zzso zzso tissue can be obtained readily in amounts sufficient for zzso isolation, which can be expanded zzso allowing its use at low passage numbers, and can be zzso by viral and zzso zzso Our goal was to examine the potential of zzso to deliver zzso gene therapies melanoma differentiation associated zzso zzso or zzso zzso factor zzso to cancer zzso These novel zzso are a potent zzso and an zzso mediator, respectively, with potential as zzso zzso zzso of zzso therapies did not adversely affect zzso biology, and these cells were still able to differentiate and retain normal zzso The zzso zzso therapies were efficient in reducing tumor cell growth in zzso and also in suppressing in zzso zzso zzso We also observed that zzso retained their innate ability to migrate toward tumor cells in zzso and this ability could be blocked by zzso of zzso zzso The zzso were found to be zzso in zzso using a soft zzso zzso as well as in zzso utilizing 2 prostate cancer zzso zzso The zzso only reduced tumor growth in the zzso zzso prostate cancer zzso The zzso however, reduced growth in both the zzso and the zzso highly aggressive prostate cancer models, and it was able to completely prevent prostate tumor establishment in zzso In conclusion, zzso expressing zzso and zzso could effectively reduce prostate tumor growth in zzso suggesting zzso therapies might have zzso applications, especially the zzso zzso
