Although gene expression following zzso treatment has been previously zzso direct effects of zzso zzso zzso on protein level has not been analyzed so zzso Using zzso PAGE in five mantle cell zzso cell lines, we screened for cellular protein level zzso following treatment with 25 zzso zzso for up to 4 zzso Using zzso we identified 38 of the 41 most prominent reliably detected protein zzso zzso were affected in all cell lines, whereas the remaining 20 protein spots were exclusively altered in sensitive cell zzso Western zzso analysis was performed for 17 of the 38 identified proteins and zzso of the observed protein level zzso in zzso gels was zzso All cell lines exhibited zzso of the cellular protein levels of heat zzso protein species zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas sensitive cell lines also displayed altered cellular protein levels of energy metabolism zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulation zzso zzso and cell division zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as tumor zzso genes zzso zzso These proteins clustered in a tight interaction network centered on the major cellular checkpoints zzso The results were confirmed in primary mantle cell lymphoma, thus confirming the critical role of these candidate proteins of zzso zzso
