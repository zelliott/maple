zzso zzso alpha zzso plays a key role in zzso and zzso processes as a zzso zzso factor that is regulated by zzso zzso zzso regulation is closely correlated with the mobility of zzso in the nucleus in association with the nuclear zzso the framework for nuclear events including zzso However, the relationship between zzso mobility and the zzso of zzso is zzso zzso attachment factor B1 zzso and its zzso zzso are nuclear zzso binding proteins that have been characterized as zzso zzso Here, using zzso fluorescent proteins zzso we show that zzso and zzso zzso with zzso in the nucleus of living cells after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments indicated that zzso interacts with both zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso Fluorescence recovery after zzso analysis revealed that zzso and zzso each decrease zzso mobility, and interestingly, zzso of zzso and zzso causes a synergistic reduction in zzso dynamics under zzso zzso In accordance with these mobility changes, zzso zzso and proliferation are zzso inhibited by zzso and zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso are crucial zzso for zzso dynamics in association with the nuclear zzso and that their synergistic regulation of zzso mobility is sufficient for zzso zzso zzso
