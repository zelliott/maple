zzso zzso zzso melanoma cells zzso zzso in ear skin do not form tumors but prevent tumor formation by zzso cells injected into the zzso To determine the requirements for such zzso we followed the fate of zzso cells following ear zzso Surprisingly, small numbers of viable zzso cells were detected in zzso mouse skin for up to 60 days zzso After 1 week, the number of zzso T cells (along with zzso zzso zzso increased rapidly in the injected ear zzso zzso tumor cells in ears were reduced in mice treated with zzso zzso and in zzso mice, but increased in zzso zzso zzso the loss of zzso cells in the ear skin, either spontaneously or following zzso of the injected ear, resulted in significantly enhanced tumor formation by parental and zzso zzso cells after zzso zzso These studies suggest that small numbers of tumor cells zzso regulated by zzso regulatory T cells expressing zzso are required for effective host zzso responses at alternate zzso zzso
