zzso of zzso sensory zzso are derived from the neural crest and zzso zzso but the mechanisms that control the relative contributions of each are not zzso zzso cells of the second zzso arch generate few facial zzso zzso and no zzso zzso zzso but crest cells in other zzso arches generate many sensory zzso Here we report that the facial zzso of zzso zzso mice contain a large population of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso normally zzso the zzso potential of second arch crest zzso This may represent an anterior transformation of second arch neural crest cells toward a fate resembling that of first arch neural crest cells, which normally do not express zzso or any other zzso zzso We additionally found that zzso zzso in cultures of zzso zzso zzso cells reduced the frequency of spontaneous zzso zzso but only in the presence of zzso zzso and Meis zzso zzso Finally, expression of zzso and the zzso in chick neural crest cells zzso the zzso zzso also reduced the frequency of zzso in the intact zzso These data suggest an unanticipated role for zzso genes in controlling the zzso potential of at least some zzso neural crest zzso
