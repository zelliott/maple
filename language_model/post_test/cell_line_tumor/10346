zzso and zzso are two common zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso human zzso cells zzso zzso to express either wild type zzso zzso or the zzso or zzso zzso were analyzed for effect of expression of the zzso proteins on zzso of 14 zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso showed significant increases zzso in zzso of five genes and decreases in two compared to that seen for cells expressing zzso while cells expressing the zzso zzso showed an zzso in zzso of one gene and a decrease in zzso These changes were seen as zzso in zzso zzso cell surface binding by the binding zzso of zzso zzso expression of zzso and synthesis of zzso These changes may explain why zzso is a risk factor for colon and breast cancer and possibly protective against Alzheimer's disease while zzso is a risk factor for neurodegenerative zzso
