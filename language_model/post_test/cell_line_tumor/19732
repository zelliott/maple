zzso and zzso expression of zzso proteins are hallmarks of zzso These changes prevent zzso signals from being transmitted to executioner zzso thereby averting zzso death and allowing cellular zzso zzso is the key executioner zzso and it exists as an inactive zzso that is activated by upstream zzso zzso zzso of zzso in certain zzso cells are significantly higher than those in zzso zzso Here we report the identification of a small zzso zzso that directly activates zzso to zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells isolated from primary colon tumors in a manner directly zzso to the concentration of zzso inside these zzso We found that zzso retarded the growth of tumors in three different mouse models of cancer, including two models in which zzso was administered zzso zzso is the first small zzso known to directly activate zzso to zzso a transformation that allows induction of zzso even in cells that have defective zzso zzso The direct zzso of executioner zzso is an zzso strategy that may prove beneficial in treating the many zzso in which zzso zzso are zzso
