zzso a zzso zzso zzso was originally identified by virtue of its zzso expression in zzso leukemia and subsequently found to be crucial for normal zzso zzso The precise mechanism of zzso function remains poorly zzso although it is known that it can act as both a zzso zzso and zzso and can zzso the zzso gene in embryonic mouse zzso Using a zzso zzso approach, we show here that zzso protein directly interacts with zzso human satellite 2 DNA zzso Such DNA is known to zzso to zzso which among other roles has been implicated in gene zzso The interaction was confirmed in zzso and in zzso by gel zzso and zzso zzso zzso involving satellite 2 DNA, which contained sequences resembling zzso binding zzso Using zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a zzso pattern of zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Double zzso indicated that zzso zzso with the zzso protein zzso demonstrating that the zzso zzso corresponded to clusters of zzso zzso The novel interaction of zzso with zzso zzso adds an additional level of complexity to the zzso functions of this zzso regulator and may have relevance to its roles in zzso repression and zzso zzso
