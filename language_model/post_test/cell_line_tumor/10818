The cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso in many solid zzso and zzso zzso whilst showing minimal expression in normal zzso and is therefore a promising target for zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso have previously been identified as potential zzso to drive zzso zzso zzso responses, capable of zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso lines, from 13 normal donors and 10 melanoma patients, all of whom were zzso positive, were generated against the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso killing activity against zzso zzso targets was weak compared with zzso lines directed against known zzso zzso Moreover, limiting dilution cloning from selected zzso zzso lines resulted in the generation of a clone of only low to intermediate zzso zzso of the zzso agent zzso zzso increased zzso expression in 7 out of 11 zzso cell lines including several B lineage zzso lines and also increased class I zzso zzso of target cells was associated with increased sensitivity to zzso killing by the low zzso zzso When zzso as well as of the target cells, were treated, the zzso killing was further zzso Interestingly, one zzso zzso line zzso showed increased sensitivity to killing by clones despite a failure of expression of zzso or zzso Together these data point to a general increased zzso of cancer zzso by zzso involving both zzso and zzso zzso
