Treatment of adult Philadelphia zzso zzso leukemia is rarely zzso We report here the effects of zzso a novel dual zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso alpha and gamma zzso on zzso zzso leukemia cell lines zzso zzso and zzso Exposure of these cells to zzso resulted in growth zzso in a zzso and zzso manner that was associated with zzso cell cycle zzso This effect was much stronger than that zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso which also belongs to the zzso zzso class of zzso However, it may not be zzso through zzso or zzso zzso because zzso of zzso and zzso cannot reverse zzso Study of the key regulators of cell cycle progression by Western zzso analysis showed that the expression of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso but not that of zzso was zzso whereas that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2 and 4 zzso and zzso was decreased when these cells were treated with zzso (10 or 20 zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso and zzso may, at least in part, account for the zzso cell cycle zzso Furthermore, a remarkable induction of zzso was observed in the cells treated with this dual zzso No obvious zzso of zzso protein level occurred, but zzso was zzso in these zzso zzso zzso of zzso 8 and zzso 9 by zzso was also zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was markedly decreased by the zzso zzso In addition, zzso enhanced the growth zzso effect of zzso a specific zzso zzso inhibitor zzso used in the treatment of zzso zzso Overall, our findings strongly suggest that zzso may offer a new therapeutic approach to aid in the treatment of zzso zzso zzso
