To investigate the relationship between the inhibited growth zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with its molecular mechanism of zzso 

The in zzso zzso techniques were zzso by cell cycle analysis and determination of zzso for zzso in human gastric zzso zzso zzso Percentage of viable cells, cell cycle, and zzso group zzso were examined and determined by the flow zzso zzso The associated proteins for cell cycle arrest and zzso were examined by Western zzso 

For zzso cell line, the zzso was found to be 48 zzso of zzso In zzso cells treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso cell cycle arrest was observed which was associated with a marked zzso of the expression of zzso zzso and zzso proteins and decreased zzso zzso A zzso decrease of cells in zzso phase and an increase in zzso phase were zzso In addition, zzso detected as zzso cell population in cell cycle measurement was proved in zzso zzso zzso cells by monitoring the zzso zzso zzso was identified by zzso cell population, and zzso of zzso zzso of zzso release of zzso decreased the zzso membrane potential and then led to the release of zzso zzso C into the zzso and caused the zzso of zzso and finally led to the occurrence of zzso 

zzso zzso zzso expression and leads to the decrease of the zzso membrane potential, zzso C release and zzso of zzso for the induction of zzso
