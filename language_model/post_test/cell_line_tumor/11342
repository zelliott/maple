zzso the recruitment and zzso of pre-existing zzso is essential for tumor growth and zzso Increased tumor zzso often zzso with poor patient outcomes in a broad spectrum of zzso We identified four zzso box 1 zzso as a candidate regulator of tumor zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein are zzso in human zzso tumor zzso as compared with normal zzso and zzso zzso and high expression of zzso is associated with poor patient zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cancer zzso is significantly correlated with changes in known zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in colon cancer cells promotes growth of zzso in zzso mice and is associated with increased tumor cell proliferation and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso mice develop significantly fewer zzso zzso than zzso zzso after combined zzso sodium zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso media from zzso expressing cells promoted zzso cell zzso tube formation in a zzso dependent zzso Taken together our results support the conclusion that zzso is a novel regulator of tumor zzso due in part, to its effect on tumor zzso
