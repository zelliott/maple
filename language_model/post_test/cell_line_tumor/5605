To establish differential zzso profiles of zzso cell lines from Chinese, and to provide reference for future basic zzso 

Total protein was extracted from 3 zzso cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso After zzso the total protein was presented by two-dimensional zzso zzso scanned and zzso Some of the identified protein spots were verified by zzso of cell lines and zzso of solid zzso The zzso cells were used as the control throughout the zzso 

A total of 13 differential protein spots were selected, and eventually 10 were identified as unique zzso These 10 proteins were involved in zzso zzso cellular zzso tumor migration, stress and inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso further confirmed these proteins present in the solid zzso 

zzso differential zzso profiles exist in zzso cell lines and normal zzso cells, likely related to the transformation of normal zzso to zzso
