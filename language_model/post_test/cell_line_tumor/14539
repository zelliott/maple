Signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso is zzso active in approximately 50% of acute zzso leukemia zzso cases and mediates multiple cellular processes including cell resistance to zzso zzso of zzso active zzso has been shown to induce zzso cell zzso Our aim was to ascertain if zzso a zzso zzso may also inhibit zzso signaling and, therefore, be zzso for zzso We found that zzso inhibited proliferation and induced zzso in human zzso cell line zzso zzso In addition, zzso exposure reduced zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso and zzso zzso Similar results were obtained with the zzso zzso inhibitor I, suggesting that zzso suppresses zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, significant zzso of zzso zzso activity by zzso was observed in the zzso zzso In addition, zzso could be zzso with zzso and the zzso of zzso was significantly inhibited by zzso only in cell lines in which zzso zzso is highly zzso Taken together, our study indicates that zzso blocks zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreases the expression of zzso regulatory proteins zzso and zzso which are associated with increased zzso in zzso zzso These findings provide a rationale for the treatment of human zzso
