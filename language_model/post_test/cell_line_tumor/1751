We used a zzso zzso approach to screen zzso medium from a panel of zzso (less zzso and triple negative (more zzso breast cancer cell lines zzso The samples were zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which recognize zzso and zzso acid, zzso The bound zzso were zzso zzso and analyzed by zzso In total, we identified zzso zzso zzso of which were components of the cell surface or zzso zzso We observed 1011 zzso 100 of which were solely detected in zzso triple negative zzso zzso analyses suggested that a number of these zzso were triple zzso and thus potential zzso for this tumor zzso An analysis of zzso data revealed that approximately half of the zzso zzso the protein scaffolds that carried potential zzso zzso were zzso in triple negative vs zzso cell lines, and that a number of genes zzso zzso or zzso were zzso expressed between the two zzso suggesting that zzso in zzso may also drive candidate zzso zzso the zzso from which these putative zzso candidates were derived are involved in zzso zzso Thus, they may represent novel therapeutic targets for this aggressive tumor zzso
