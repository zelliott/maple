zzso cancer is potentially well suited for local zzso zzso zzso zzso because it remains within the zzso cavity for a long period of time before giving rise to distant zzso At the stage of minimal residual disease, the cells appear to be in a state of dormancy zzso or at least have lower rates of zzso cell zzso They should be a promising target for zzso Here we first examined the zzso expression of zzso and zzso factor zzso zzso on four different zzso zzso cell lines, using simultaneous flow zzso analysis of DNA content or the zzso nuclear proliferation protein zzso and zzso or zzso surface zzso We found that zzso and zzso are zzso expressed throughout the cell zzso The zzso approach to zzso zzso to improve the efficiency of zzso complement zzso damages was promising, and zzso cells become sensitive to C damage, when incubated with zzso zzso against different zzso zzso zzso such immune zzso C zzso was rather ineffective in killing the cells, it could be zzso by the addition of blocking zzso against zzso and zzso Our results suggest that the activities of intrinsic C regulators must be neutralized to make minimal residual disease a promising target for zzso zzso
