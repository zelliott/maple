zzso zzso is a new member of zzso zzso antibiotics family that can be separated and zzso It consists of a zzso active zzso zzso zzso and a zzso bound zzso zzso zzso is now in phase II clinical zzso In this study, we described the zzso features of a fusion protein of zzso zzso targeted to zzso expressed by zzso zzso zzso zzso was prepared by a novel zzso method including DNA zzso and molecular zzso zzso exerted potent zzso against zzso zzso zzso cell lines in zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso were allowed to grow to an initial mass of 80 and 500 zzso respectively, and then zzso was administered zzso with the highest dose of 4 zzso zzso zzso The zzso rates of tumor growth were zzso and zzso which were zzso superior to those of zzso zzso It is noteworthy that zzso can inhibit the growth of zzso cells, including zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso delivery of zzso is a specific and potent therapeutic strategy for zzso zzso In addition, the zzso approach could serve as a new technology platform for making a series of highly potent engineered zzso zzso
