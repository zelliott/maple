zzso in zzso or zzso frequently manifest in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso blocks zzso zzso and is currently undergoing clinical zzso zzso cells can vary markedly in their response to zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and the presence of a zzso zzso is thought to predict sensitivity, with the zzso zzso being associated with intrinsic zzso We zzso cell proliferation in a panel of 19 zzso cancer cell lines and found no simple correlation between zzso or zzso zzso and sensitivity to zzso though cells that zzso neither zzso tended to be zzso zzso that were sensitive arrested in zzso and/or underwent zzso and the presence of zzso or zzso zzso was not sufficient to predict either zzso Cell lines that were resistant to zzso exhibited low or no zzso zzso or exhibited zzso zzso of zzso and protein zzso B zzso the latter indicative of zzso of the zzso zzso In cell lines with zzso zzso and zzso zzso sensitivity to zzso could be zzso by any of the 3 distinct zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is effective in zzso cancer cell lines with zzso or zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso those cells with high zzso activity zzso zzso for zzso or zzso evolve a dependency upon that zzso and tend to be sensitive to zzso but this can be offset by high zzso zzso This may have implications for the use of zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso
