Classical and zzso zzso class II zzso genes are zzso by the zzso factor zzso zzso factor zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso coordinates the assembly of a zzso zzso complex on zzso zzso This zzso serves as a zzso site for the binding of zzso Whereas the role of the zzso in recruiting zzso is well established, little is known about its zzso zzso A novel role of the zzso was revealed by the analysis of zzso expression in human zzso B cell lines lacking zzso or zzso zzso was found to be zzso by zzso of zzso but not zzso B zzso zzso of zzso was associated with DNA zzso at its promoter, and was relieved by the zzso agent zzso Surprisingly, DNA zzso was also established at the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso This was a direct consequence of the absence of zzso as it could be reversed by restoring zzso zzso DNA zzso at the zzso zzso and zzso promoters was observed in zzso B cells and zzso but not in zzso B cells and zzso or in zzso zzso which lack zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso and/or zzso assembly plays a key zzso role in protecting zzso promoters against DNA zzso This function is likely to be crucial for retaining zzso genes in an open zzso zzso zzso for zzso in zzso cells, such as the precursors of zzso and zzso zzso before induction with zzso
