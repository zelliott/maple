The aim of this study was to determine the detection of zzso zzso zzso in oral zzso cell zzso zzso cells and to evaluate the zzso relevance for zzso diagnosis in a brush biopsy zzso 

zzso pairs of zzso cells and normal oral zzso cells were obtained by brush biopsy from zzso zzso zzso was extracted from cell zzso for real-time quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso levels of zzso 17, zzso 19 and zzso 20 zzso in zzso cells were examined by zzso green real-time zzso 

Compared to normal zzso cells, the zzso of zzso 17 zzso was zzso in 40 zzso cells zzso that of zzso 19 zzso in 19 zzso while that of zzso 20 zzso was not zzso Compared with zzso 19, the mean value of zzso 17 zzso expression level was significantly higher in all 52 patients zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the value of zzso 17 was significantly higher in zzso and zzso zzso patients zzso zzso zzso respectively), in patients without zzso of neck zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in stage I and stage II patients zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso and in well differentiated zzso patients zzso zzso zzso 

Brush biopsy properly serves for detection of zzso zzso using real-time zzso This preliminary study demonstrates the zzso 17 possibility for zzso however, pivotal studies are encouraged to confirm zzso 17 as a diagnostic marker of zzso in a brush biopsy zzso
