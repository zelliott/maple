zzso evidence supports the idea that two known zzso zzso zzso downstream zzso zzso and zzso are potential targets for cancer zzso Increased expression of zzso a zzso family member of the zzso factor zzso zzso has been implicated in both the maintenance and the progression of the transformed state of several cancer zzso In addition, high zzso expression in tumors zzso with more aggressive behavior, lower response to zzso drugs, and shortened survival zzso Previously, we reported that, in zzso zzso cells with increased zzso activity, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acted zzso with the zzso zzso zzso drug zzso to inhibit cell zzso Because the zzso zzso drug zzso targets the zzso pathway, we investigated the effect of the combination of these two drugs in cell survival in several cancer cell zzso We show here that the combination of zzso and zzso zzso decreases cell viability and increases cell zzso in several cancer cell zzso Cell killing is associated with decreased zzso and zzso expression and zzso of zzso increases cell killing by zzso in a zzso manner but not by zzso The drug combination does not have a synergistic effect on killing in zzso zzso cells, showing that zzso zzso accounts in part for the zzso The novel drug combination of zzso and zzso is a promising combination to treat zzso with increased zzso zzso expression or zzso
