zzso theoretical calculations were employed to direct the design of zzso zzso with enhanced zzso in the internal phase of a zzso zzso The zzso optimal zzso zzso were zzso by direct attachment of zzso zzso through an zzso linkage to zzso In comparison to zzso the zzso exhibited significantly improved zzso in oil, as predicted by our theoretical zzso This contributed to high drug zzso efficiencies (up to zzso and a high drug loading capacity zzso zzso for the zzso zzso The zzso of an zzso group at zzso of zzso resulted in a zzso with zzso to zzso lower zzso than that of the parent drug in two human cancer cell zzso zzso the activity exerted by the zzso zzso on the cancer cells was due in part to the zzso of the parent drug that was released via zzso of the zzso bond between the zzso zzso and the drug under biologically relevant zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso of zzso groups at zzso zzso and/or zzso of zzso resulted in zzso zzso that were found to be zzso Overall, our results show that computer-based theoretical calculation is a promising strategy for guiding the enhancement of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Also, these studies confirm that chemical modification of zzso for enhancement of zzso zzso should be limited to zzso at zzso and result in a zzso that is zzso at a moderate rate under biologically relevant zzso
