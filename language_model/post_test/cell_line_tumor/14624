In zzso zzso zzso based on a method in which a protein of interest is zzso with a zzso that is zzso in zzso by zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso has been successfully used for the isolation of zzso and zzso complexes in zzso zzso We describe a modification of this methodology in which cells zzso expressing the zzso gene of interest and the zzso gene can be selected by zzso cell sorting zzso We recently implemented this approach to isolate and characterize proteins associated with zzso a zzso zzso factor with zzso zzso The modified technique zzso two zzso a zzso zzso zzso the gene of interest containing a zzso tag on a zzso transcript together with a downstream yellow fluorescent protein zzso zzso and a second zzso zzso zzso a fusion protein composed of bacterial zzso linked to the green fluorescent protein zzso This zzso zzso in zzso zzso tagging system allows precise control over the levels of zzso zzso as well as the expression of the gene of interest, which is especially important if high-level expression zzso impacts cell growth or zzso
