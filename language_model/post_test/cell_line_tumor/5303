Multiple zzso an incurable plasma cell zzso is characterized by altered cellular metabolism and resistance to zzso Recent connections between zzso metabolism and resistance to zzso provide a compelling rationale for targeting zzso changes in zzso In this study, we have examined the ability of the zzso analogue zzso to acutely reduce zzso consumption by regulating zzso and expression of key zzso zzso zzso cells zzso the zzso stress by zzso zzso zzso with zzso of zzso results in marked enhancement of cell zzso zzso consumption by drug-resistant myeloma cells was unaffected by zzso and zzso no zzso of zzso was zzso However, these cells can be zzso to zzso under zzso zzso The zzso zzso response of myeloma to zzso deprivation or to zzso analogue treatment has not been described zzso This study establishes the potential of zzso targeting as a broader means to kill and sensitize myeloma and identifies a compound that can achieve this zzso
