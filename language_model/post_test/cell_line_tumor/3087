The organic zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso play an important role in the disposition of zzso and zzso zzso Here, we analyzed the sequence of the zzso promoter regions of zzso and zzso in four ethnic groups and determined the effects of the identified genetic zzso on zzso activities and zzso zzso Six zzso were found in the zzso promoter of zzso one of which showed high zzso frequency ranging from 13 to zzso in samples from individuals with zzso in Africa, Europe, China, and zzso zzso zzso had similar activities as the reference in zzso reporter zzso For zzso three of the seven zzso identified in the zzso promoter showed zzso zzso greater than zzso in all zzso with the exception of zzso zzso that was zzso in Asian zzso zzso zzso containing zzso present in all zzso were associated with a gain of function in zzso reporter zzso zzso with reporter zzso zzso zzso expression levels in zzso cell lines zzso from gene expression analysis were greater in samples carrying a marker for zzso This zzso seems to contribute to racial differences in zzso zzso expression levels in zzso Our study with healthy subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso for either zzso or zzso showed no appreciable effect of this zzso on zzso zzso However, there were significant effects of gender on zzso plasma levels zzso zzso zzso Further in zzso studies of zzso promoter zzso on zzso disposition and variation in drug response are zzso
