Despite significant advances in our understanding of the molecular pathology of zzso cancer, it remains a significant health problem with high morbidity and mortality associated with zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso and high costs associated with the surveillance of zzso zzso cancer zzso stages zzso Moreover, current diagnostic zzso are zzso and of poor utility for low grade disease and zzso In this study, we show that the zzso zzso zzso factor is expressed in, and zzso by, zzso cancer cell lines and patient zzso zzso zzso an evaluation of urinary zzso as a diagnostic zzso in zzso cancer using zzso samples from an established zzso zzso In patients with zzso urinary zzso was detected in most cases with an overall sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso The sensitivity for stage zzso and zzso zzso was zzso and zzso respectively, and zzso for stage zzso zzso This compares zzso with existing zzso The sensitivity for zzso grades 1, 2 and 3 was zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus urinary zzso has the potential to be a more sensitive and specific protein zzso for zzso than currently available zzso
