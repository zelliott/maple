More than zzso of breast zzso are sporadic and attributable to long-term exposure to environmental zzso such as those in the diet, through a zzso disease process progressing from zzso to zzso and zzso zzso The chemical zzso zzso zzso is one of the most abundant zzso zzso found in zzso cooked meats and is recognized as a zzso zzso However, the zzso mechanism of action in breast cell zzso is not zzso Here, we demonstrated, for the first time, that cumulative zzso to zzso at zzso achievable, zzso to zzso zzso effectively induced progressive zzso of human breast zzso zzso cells from a zzso stage to zzso and zzso stages in a zzso and zzso zzso Progressive zzso was measured by zzso acquired zzso properties of reduced dependence on growth factors, zzso growth, zzso zzso zzso migration, invasion, zzso with zzso and increased zzso cell zzso These biological changes were accompanied by zzso and molecular changes, including zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso oxygen species zzso zzso increased zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and reduced zzso The zzso zzso played an important role in not only initiation but also maintenance of cellular zzso induced by zzso Using zzso zzso and molecular changes as targeted zzso we identified that the green tea zzso components zzso and zzso at zzso doses, were capable of suppressing zzso cellular zzso and zzso
