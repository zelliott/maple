Increased expressions of zzso zzso and its downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso are well documented events in the development of zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso itself can induce the expression of zzso thereby creating the potential for positive zzso Although evidence for such a positive feedback has been previously zzso the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that mediates this response, as well as the relevant signaling zzso remain zzso We now report that the zzso zzso induction of zzso expression in human colon cancer zzso cells is zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and is followed by zzso of the zzso to zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso releases membrane bound zzso zzso growth zzso growth factor resulting in the zzso of zzso growth factor receptors and the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and induction of zzso zzso This induction of zzso expression by zzso stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso may zzso the zzso of zzso during zzso cancer and appears to be an early event in the process of zzso
