Internal tandem zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso gene have been identified in zzso of acute zzso leukemia zzso patients and are associated with a poor zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso zzso growth arrest and zzso at much lower zzso in zzso cell lines that harbor zzso zzso than in zzso cell lines with zzso zzso 

The zzso activity of zzso was investigated in zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines that expressed zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso human zzso in primary human zzso cells, and in a mouse leukemia zzso zzso zzso of zzso on zzso and signaling in zzso cell lines were investigated by flow zzso and zzso analysis, respectively, and the in zzso effects were determined by monitoring the survival of leukemia zzso mice treated with zzso zzso of 15 zzso In a phase 1 clinical trial, 16 patients with zzso or relapsed zzso were treated with zzso on different dose zzso We determined their zzso zzso status by a zzso chain reaction zzso and analyzed clinical responses by standard zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

zzso was zzso to zzso more effective in inducing growth arrest and zzso in zzso cells with zzso or zzso zzso than in zzso cells with zzso zzso or zzso zzso and inhibited the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso In a mouse model, zzso decreased the leukemia burden and prolonged survival zzso survival in the zzso group vs the zzso group zzso zzso vs 16 days, difference zzso zzso days, zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso reduced the percentage of leukemia blasts in the peripheral blood and the bone zzso of zzso patients with zzso zzso percentages before and after zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not in patients without this zzso 

zzso may have therapeutic efficacy in zzso patients whose cells harbor zzso zzso
