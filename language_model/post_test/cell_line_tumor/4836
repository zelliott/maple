zzso genes zzso zzso factors that play a key role in zzso and cell differentiation during zzso of zzso Human zzso cells are known to be chemically induced to differentiate into zzso or zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the roles of zzso genes in differentiation of zzso zzso cells into zzso zzso When zzso cells were grown in the presence of zzso zzso they increased the expressions of two zzso genes zzso and zzso and marker genes for zzso cells zzso and zzso basic zzso zzso expression of zzso alone or both zzso zzso 1 and zzso induced the expression of zzso in zzso zzso In transient zzso experiments, the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso and zzso are associated with differentiation of zzso cells into zzso cells through the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
