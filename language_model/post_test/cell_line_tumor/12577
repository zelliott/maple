In zzso zzso interference zzso screens, it is critical to control false zzso and false zzso zzso Traditional statistical methods for controlling false discovery and false zzso rates are inappropriate for hit selection in zzso screens because the major goal in zzso screens is to control both the proportion of short interfering zzso zzso with a small effect among selected hits and the proportion of zzso with a large effect among declared zzso An effective method based on strictly standardized mean difference zzso has been proposed for statistically controlling false discovery rate zzso and false zzso rate zzso appropriate for zzso zzso In this article, the authors explore the utility of the zzso method for hit selection in zzso zzso As demonstrated in 2 zzso zzso screens, the zzso method addresses the zzso need of controlling for the proportion of zzso with a small effect among selected hits, as well as controlling for the proportion of zzso with a large effect among declared zzso Furthermore, the zzso method results in reasonably low zzso and zzso for selecting zzso or zzso zzso This method works effectively and should have a broad utility for hit selection in zzso screens with zzso
