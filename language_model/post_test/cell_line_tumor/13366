An oral zzso cell zzso zzso cell line was treated with zzso an active compound isolated from the soft coral zzso zzso in order to evaluate the effect of this compound on cell growth and protein zzso Cell proliferation was strongly inhibited by zzso zzso The zzso master maps of control and treated zzso cells were generated by analysis with the zzso zzso The comparison between such maps showed zzso and zzso of 23 zzso of which 14 were zzso and 9 were zzso The zzso studies described here have identified some zzso which are involved in the zzso dysfunction and zzso zzso and imply that zzso zzso cell zzso through either zzso zzso or zzso stress zzso Based on this zzso several proteins related to zzso zzso were explored for the potential roles involved in this drug-induced zzso Furthermore, zzso an zzso stress zzso is able to protect the cell from zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The significance of these studies illustrates the potential development of zzso drugs from the natural derivatives of soft zzso
