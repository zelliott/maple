Resistance of cancer cells to zzso drugs is the main reason for the failure of traditional cancer zzso Various cellular components and different zzso within the signaling pathways contribute to drug resistance which could be modulated with the aim to restore drug zzso zzso the molecular mechanisms for cancer drug resistance has now paved the way for the development of novel approaches to regulate the response rates to zzso drugs at the genetic zzso The recent progress on identification and validation of the vital genes directly or indirectly involved in development of cancer drug resistance with the aid of the specific knock down ability of zzso interference technology is discussed in this zzso
