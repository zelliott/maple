zzso are thought to be maintained by the preferential recruitment of zzso to the shortest zzso The extension of the zzso zzso strand by zzso is also believed to be coordinated with the complementary synthesis of the C strand by the conventional replication zzso However, we show that under zzso zzso conditions in cancer cells, human zzso extends most zzso ends during each S phase and is not zzso recruited to the shortest zzso zzso rapidly extends the zzso strand following zzso replication but zzso of the C strand is delayed into late S zzso This late zzso zzso is not executed by conventional Okazaki zzso synthesis but by a mechanism using a series of small incremental zzso These findings highlight differences between zzso actions during steady state versus zzso conditions and reveal steps in the human zzso maintenance zzso that may provide additional targets for the development of zzso zzso
