We previously reported that the zzso effect of an zzso extract of black zzso zzso on zzso zzso breast cancer cell line was due to the induction of zzso Here we address the question to what extent zzso induction can be ascribed to one of the two major zzso of zzso the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso acid zzso zzso Furthermore, as black zzso is routinely administered orally, we studied whether its pharmacological effects would withstand simulated liver zzso The zzso activity of zzso and zzso as well as of rat liver zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso cells were investigated by zzso zzso The features of cell death induced were tested for zzso by flow zzso zzso scatter zzso zzso V zzso zzso of zzso 72 h zzso treatment induced a zzso down regulation of cell proliferation with the same zzso of zzso zzso dry zzso which zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The degree of zzso zzso cells was also zzso Both, isolated zzso and zzso zzso inhibited cell growth, the zzso being zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, whereas zzso and zzso induction zzso well for the whole zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced zzso at zzso zzso and 5 zzso well below those required for significant growth zzso Observation of this study zzso showed that the cell death induced by zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso and zzso compounds significantly contributed to its zzso effect, zzso being the more potent inhibitor of proliferation and zzso zzso
