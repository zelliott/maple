Several front-line zzso cause zzso zzso zzso zzso Iron zzso and other antioxidants have not completely succeeded in zzso this zzso One hindrance to the development of zzso is the lack of zzso animal models to simultaneously study zzso activity and zzso zzso we zzso a zzso rat model and examined the mechanisms by which zzso stress affects zzso zzso spontaneously zzso rats zzso were implanted with zzso zzso breast tumor cell line, zzso zzso growth and zzso responses zzso zzso zzso were observed for two weeks zzso To demonstrate the utility of the zzso model for monitoring both zzso efficacy and zzso we tested cardiotoxic zzso alone and in combination with an established zzso zzso or a zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso As predicted, tumor reduction and zzso were demonstrated by zzso We confirmed zzso zzso of zzso zzso in tumor and cardiac zzso zzso and zzso zzso ameliorated zzso zzso without altering the zzso zzso Both agents increased the zzso zzso marker zzso and decreased the zzso marker zzso in the heart, independently and in combination with zzso zzso and transmission electron zzso demonstrated zzso zzso and necrosis corresponding to zzso in the tumor and zzso in the zzso Changes in serum levels of zzso DNA and total protein zzso corresponded to zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso identified specific serum proteins oxidized under cardiotoxic zzso Our results demonstrate the utility of the zzso model and the potential of zzso agents to mitigate zzso zzso zzso Our findings also emphasize the novel role of specific protein zzso markers and zzso mechanisms for zzso
