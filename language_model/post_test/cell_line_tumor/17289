To construct and identify the zzso zzso carrying zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso or zzso zzso genes expressed in gastric zzso cell line zzso 

The fragments of zzso internal zzso entry sites zzso and zzso or zzso genes were inserted in a zzso or zzso order into zzso and zzso to generate the therapeutic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, which were structurally confirmed by the zzso analysis of restriction zzso The former two plasmids were used for the transient expression of zzso proteins in the target cells while zzso and zzso were zzso into zzso cells by zzso for the stable expression of objective genes through zzso zzso The protein products expressed zzso and zzso in zzso cells by the constructed zzso were confirmed by fluorescent zzso and Western zzso zzso 

The inserted fragments in all constructed plasmids were structurally confirmed to be consistent with that of the published zzso In the transient zzso both zzso and zzso were shown expressed in nearly 50% of the zzso zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso selected zzso zzso and zzso were confirmed to be successful in the stable expression of the objective proteins in the target zzso 

The constructed zzso zzso in the present study that can express the suicide gene zzso in combination with zzso genes may serve as the potential tools to perform more effective investigations in future for the gene therapy of gastric zzso
