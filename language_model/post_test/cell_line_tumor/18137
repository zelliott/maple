Progressive spinal muscular zzso zzso the most prevalent zzso lower motor zzso disease, is caused by zzso in the zzso copy of the survival of motor zzso zzso zzso Unlike other cells, lower motor zzso cannot tolerate low levels of zzso zzso However, it is unclear as to the nature of the cell death zzso There is evidence that lower motor zzso undergo zzso in zzso leading to muscle weakness and zzso This study investigated whether zzso regulation in a motor zzso model affected zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso hybrid zzso cell lines by small interfering zzso zzso was demonstrated at the zzso and protein zzso zzso cells showed elevated zzso activity, decreased cell viability and increased percentage of zzso positive zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso by zzso gene transfer decreased zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced cell toxicity as assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, increased zzso expression by itself did not increase cell zzso These data suggest not only that decreased zzso levels increase zzso in an in zzso model of zzso but also that increased zzso can protect against neural zzso
