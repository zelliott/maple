To evaluate the dynamics and feasibility of imaging zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso induced by zzso treatment using zzso zzso domain of zzso I in a mouse zzso 

zzso zzso mice were treated with intravenous zzso and 12, 24, 48 and 72 h later, zzso was injected zzso and zzso images were acquired at 2, 4 and 6 h zzso on a zzso gamma camera fitted with a pinhole zzso zzso tissue ratios zzso were calculated by zzso analysis and reflected specific binding of zzso Mice were sacrificed after zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso was determined by flow zzso DNA fragmentation was analyzed by terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso labeling zzso zzso Whereas zzso zzso was estimated using zzso zzso The imaging data were correlated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso significantly increased after zzso zzso whereas it was low in zzso tumors zzso In terms of % zzso activity in Group 2 (12 zzso Group 3 (24 zzso Group 4 zzso zzso and Group 5 zzso zzso after the treatment was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Whereas in the zzso group, Group 1 % zzso was zzso The zzso zzso was positively correlated to the zzso index zzso zzso as well as zzso activity zzso zzso 

This study addresses the dynamics and feasibility of imaging zzso cell lung tumor zzso using zzso zzso
