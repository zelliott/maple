Heat shock protein 90 zzso has a key role in the maintenance of the cellular zzso However, zzso is also involved in zzso of zzso client proteins and zzso zzso addiction and cancer cell zzso The development of zzso zzso for cancer treatment is an area of growing interest as such agents can affect multiple pathways that are linked to all hallmarks of zzso This study aimed to test the hypothesis that targeting zzso zzso of zzso will lead to degradation of client proteins and zzso of cancer cell zzso 

Combining chemical zzso biological zzso and zzso relationship analysis, we identified a new class of zzso zzso Click chemistry and zzso zzso established the sites of modification of the zzso 

The mildly zzso zzso zzso zzso selectively targets zzso zzso of zzso forming stable zzso zzso Without interfering with the zzso ability of the zzso zzso zzso the client proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and decreases proliferation of breast cancer zzso zzso of a zzso or a zzso group in tandem with the zzso zzso at nitrogen increased the zzso A new compound, zzso was identified as the most robust zzso inhibitor within a series of 19 zzso 

By virtue of their zzso zzso zzso target zzso causing zzso of its client zzso and zzso cell zzso
