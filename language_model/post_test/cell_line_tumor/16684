zzso zzso plays an important role in the growth and differentiation of human B cells and zzso However, little is known about the effect of zzso on cancer zzso In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in the zzso migration of zzso zzso cancer zzso Our results indicated that zzso significantly enhanced migration and zzso expression in zzso zzso We also found that zzso zzso zzso zzso of the binding of zzso and zzso which are two important nuclear zzso factors that are linked to zzso expression in zzso zzso In subsequent experiments, we found zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso To examine the involvement of the zzso signaling zzso on zzso cell responses, we zzso zzso cells with the zzso inhibitor zzso followed by zzso zzso The results showed that zzso treatment inhibited migration of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso expression was suppressed by the addition of zzso zzso of zzso function consistently rescued zzso activity of zzso without altering zzso zzso in zzso zzso Finally, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by small interfering zzso zzso suppressed migration, zzso zzso zzso expression and binding zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso The results of the present study indicate that the zzso zzso zzso cell migration through zzso expression of zzso by binding zzso of zzso in zzso cancer zzso In conclusion, these novel findings indicate that binding of zzso to zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso which may be involved in the migration of zzso zzso
