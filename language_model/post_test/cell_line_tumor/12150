zzso is a type II zzso protein predominantly expressed in the liver and has been implicated in participation in blood zzso zzso and zzso zzso The aim of this current study is to investigate the role of zzso in zzso 

zzso real-time zzso was used to investigate the expression levels of zzso in a total of 50 paired zzso zzso zzso and the corresponding zzso liver zzso zzso was zzso to the zzso zzso cells to study the change of cell zzso 

In zzso zzso patients, the expression levels of zzso in zzso liver zzso are at least twofold higher than those in the corresponding zzso zzso Positive zzso B surface zzso was more often detected in patients with zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients with zzso zzso in the zzso zzso survived shorter time than those without zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The cell proliferation and for a colony formation of zzso zzso cells were inhibited by zzso 

Most zzso patients had zzso zzso in the zzso zzso These patients survived for a shorter time compared with those without zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso expression could inhibit cell proliferation and colony formation of zzso zzso
