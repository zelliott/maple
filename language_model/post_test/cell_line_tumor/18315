To investigate the effects of zzso gene on proliferation activity of zzso cells in zzso and in zzso 

The zzso zzso carrying zzso gene was zzso into zzso cells, and the positive clones were screened and identified with zzso and zzso zzso The growth curve and population doubling time were zzso and the cell cycle was analyzed by flow zzso zzso The proliferation activity of transformed cells was measured with zzso incorporation rate and nude mice model in zzso and in zzso 

The result of zzso indicated that zzso gene was integrated into the zzso DNA of zzso cells and zzso The growth curve and population doubling time showed a high proliferation activity of transformed zzso The amount of cells at stage S and zzso were significantly higher, and cells at stage zzso were lower than those in control zzso The tumors developed from zzso cells grew much quicker than those developed from zzso cells in nude mice zzso 

zzso gene can facilitate the proliferation of zzso cells both in zzso and in zzso
