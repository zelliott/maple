The folate zzso is zzso in a broad spectrum of zzso tumors and represents an attractive target for selective delivery of zzso agents to folate zzso zzso This study examines zzso zzso as a means of enhancing the tumor selectivity of zzso drugs in a mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso at various zzso into the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso labeled in the zzso compartment with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We incubated zzso zzso or fluorescent zzso with mouse zzso zzso cells zzso for their folate receptors zzso to determine the optimal zzso concentration required in the zzso zzso for zzso cell association, and to examine whether zzso zzso are zzso by zzso cells in zzso zzso association with cells was zzso based on zzso and zzso cell sorting analysis, and zzso was assessed by zzso zzso zzso We found an optimal zzso zzso concentration of approximately zzso using our zzso A substantial zzso zzso increase in zzso zzso was found in zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso depth scanning showed that a substantial amount of the zzso zzso are zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso by zzso cells were also observed in zzso after zzso injection of zzso zzso in mice bearing zzso zzso zzso The drug levels in zzso tumor cells were increased by zzso whereas those in plasma were decreased by zzso when zzso zzso were compared with zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso represent an attractive approach for the zzso delivery of drugs to folate zzso zzso cells and seem to be a promising tool for in zzso zzso drug zzso
