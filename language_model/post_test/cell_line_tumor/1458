zzso human zzso resisted the zzso action of zzso zzso zzso but became susceptible to the zzso following treatment with a calcium zzso zzso To test the hypothesis that this zzso requires exposure of the zzso zzso zzso on the external face of the cell zzso experiments were repeated with a human zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso In contrast to normal zzso or zzso mouse zzso cells, most of the zzso cells zzso did not zzso zzso to the cell surface upon treatment with zzso Those few that did display exposed zzso were zzso immediately upon addition of zzso zzso Interestingly, the remaining cells were also completely susceptible to the zzso but were zzso at a slower rate and after a zzso of about zzso In zzso to the zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells did display other physical membrane changes upon zzso treatment that may be relevant to zzso by zzso zzso These changes were detected by zzso 540 and zzso zzso zzso and were common among normal zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso The levels of these latter effects corresponded well with the relative rates of zzso among the three cell zzso These results suggested that while zzso enhances the rate of cell membrane zzso by zzso zzso zzso it is not an absolute zzso Other physical properties such as membrane order contribute to the level of membrane zzso to the zzso independent of zzso
