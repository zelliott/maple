Resistance of zzso zzso breast cancer cells to tamoxifen represents a major barrier to the successful treatment of breast zzso In the present study, we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A1 and zzso A, sensitize zzso cell zzso zzso targeting zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso that plays a central role in zzso zzso markedly increased cell death induced by zzso Interestingly, zzso A1 induced zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso by zzso suppressed the cell death induced by zzso A1 and zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso In addition, we found that zzso A1 enhances zzso cell death in breast cancer zzso Furthermore, we showed that combination of zzso zzso with tamoxifen also effectively induced cell death in zzso and zzso breast cancer zzso Overall, our results demonstrate that zzso of zzso can zzso the zzso effects of tamoxifen through zzso of zzso
