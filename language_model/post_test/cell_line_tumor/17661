zzso zzso a potent zzso agent that belongs to the zzso series, was previously shown to zzso zzso activity in the human zzso lung zzso cell zzso We show here that the zzso of zzso activity is caused by an zzso of the zzso zzso pattern induced by zzso zzso an almost complete disappearance of the active zzso transcript and an zzso of the inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 forming the zzso zzso transcript contained several tracks of zzso sequences able to form zzso By using a specific zzso zzso we show that zzso is able to stabilize the formation of these zzso zzso zzso cell line clones selected for resistance to zzso have been analyzed for their zzso zzso zzso zzso clones are able to maintain the active zzso transcript under zzso treatment, suggesting the appearance of mechanisms able to bypass the zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso and zzso two other zzso agents, have no effect on the zzso zzso pattern in zzso cells, are zzso against the zzso clones and display a lower efficiency to stabilize zzso zzso These results lead us to propose that zzso zzso the zzso machinery of zzso through stabilization of zzso located in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of selectivity between zzso zzso and zzso for these zzso zzso may be important to explain their respective activity and zzso against zzso zzso
