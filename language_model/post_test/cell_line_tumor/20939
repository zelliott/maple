The present study aimed to investigate the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso on the survival of the human gastric cancer cell line zzso zzso and small interfering zzso zzso plasmids were used to target zzso in zzso Meanwhile, we also constructed a zzso zzso zzso to assess the effect of zzso of this protein on cell zzso The zzso of zzso decreased cell survival by approximately zzso compared to the control and resulted in cell cycle arrest at the zzso zzso These cells also had lower levels of zzso compared to control cells, while zzso of zzso increased cell proliferation and induced the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso with either zzso or zzso decreases the viability of zzso transformed gastric cancer cells and suggests that zzso zzso may be a novel zzso zzso
