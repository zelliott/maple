Breast cancer research is hampered by difficulties in obtaining and studying primary human breast zzso and by the lack of in zzso zzso models that reflect patient tumor biology zzso To overcome these limitations, we zzso a cohort of human breast tumors grown in the zzso zzso fat pad of severe combined zzso zzso and zzso diabetic zzso zzso zzso mice under a series of transplant zzso Both models yielded zzso zzso zzso at comparably high rates zzso and zzso zzso Of the conditions tested, zzso take rate was highest in the presence of a zzso zzso zzso Overall, 32 zzso zzso zzso lines were established, representing 25 unique zzso Most tumors yielding zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, we established lines from 3 zzso tumors, one zzso one zzso and one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso show zzso consistency with the tumor of origin, are zzso stable across multiple transplant generations at the zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels, and show comparable treatment responses as those observed zzso zzso representing 12 patients, including 2 zzso lines, showed zzso to the mouse zzso These models thus serve as a renewable, zzso tissue resource for zzso studies investigating treatment response and zzso
