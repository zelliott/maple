zzso zzso has been used for healing cuts, injuries, zzso hypertension, zzso and diabetes in some zzso However, the effect of zzso zzso on human cancer remains poorly zzso The goal of this study was to investigate whether zzso zzso zzso could have an zzso property against human zzso zzso The human zzso cancer SW zzso cells treated with the zzso of zzso zzso would cause marked DNA damages and zzso cellular zzso Treatment with 225 zzso zzso zzso zzso also led to the zzso cells to produce readily zzso zzso oxygen species zzso after zzso of treatment and last to 24 zzso The zzso zzso zzso depletion occurred after zzso of zzso The treatment of the zzso would also caused zzso zzso potential zzso to decrease and zzso zzso c to zzso The zzso zzso activities were activated from 3 to 6 h after the zzso The percentages of zzso induced by the zzso of zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso and zzso when the SW zzso cells were zzso with Vitamin C, zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, we demonstrated for the first time that the zzso of zzso zzso could induce zzso that was related to the zzso production and zzso depletion in human zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso might have therapeutic value against the human zzso zzso
