zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes of the type zzso zzso where L represents a zzso zzso have been zzso and characterized zzso The structures of five complexes were also established by zzso X-ray zzso confirming a zzso geometry with zzso coordination of the zzso zzso zzso bonding between the zzso group of the zzso and a chlorine atom attached to zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso coordinated to a zzso framework zzso or zzso zzso showed high zzso against several cancer cells but not against normal zzso In zzso studies have shown that the zzso of cancer cell growth involves primarily zzso arrest as well as the generation of zzso oxygen species zzso The complexes are found to bind DNA in a zzso fashion and cause unwinding of zzso DNA in a zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso complexes zzso and zzso differ in their interaction with DNA, as observed by zzso studies, they either cause a zzso melting of the DNA or the zzso of zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso of the aromatic ring of the zzso or adding a second zzso donor on the zzso reduces the zzso
