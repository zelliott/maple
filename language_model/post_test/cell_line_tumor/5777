zzso is a traditional Chinese medicine, and it zzso zzso in some lines of human tumor zzso 

We investigated the effect of zzso in the zzso cell line, zzso zzso cells were treated with various zzso of zzso and changes in cell growth, the cell cycle, zzso and related parameters were zzso 

An zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso cells were sensitive to the growth zzso effect of zzso Cell cycle analysis indicated that exposure to zzso decreased the proportion of cells in the synthesis phase and increased the proportion in the zzso zzso of the cell zzso zzso of zzso was confirmed by zzso V zzso of zzso zzso and by the loss of zzso zzso zzso This induction occurred in conjunction with the altered expression of genes related to cell growth, zzso zzso and zzso 

These results suggest that zzso may serve as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of zzso
