A selected chemical library of six zzso complexes having zzso zzso were zzso after a rational design in order to evaluate their zzso activity and the zzso zzso The zzso studies were performed using cancer cell lines sensitive zzso and resistant zzso to zzso Excellent zzso was observed for most of complexes, which presented better resistance factors than zzso against the zzso cell zzso The interaction of these complexes with DNA, as the target zzso was evaluated by several zzso zzso binding zzso changes in the DNA melting temperature, evaluation of the unwinding angle of zzso DNA, evaluation of the zzso zzso and replication zzso The zzso of the interaction with zzso was also investigated to better understand the resistant factors observed for the new zzso
