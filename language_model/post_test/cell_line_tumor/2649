zzso zzso is a zzso zzso shown to associate via its zzso domain with the zzso and zzso zzso potentially regulating cell zzso zzso and invasion of cells expressing these zzso Using zzso deletion zzso expressed in human zzso zzso cells, we identified the active site within the zzso core protein and derived a zzso inhibitor called zzso zzso that zzso zzso interaction with these zzso Because the zzso and zzso zzso are critical in zzso a process in which a role for zzso has been uncertain, we used human vascular zzso cells in zzso to show that the zzso regulatory mechanism is also required for zzso zzso on these zzso We found zzso expressed in the vascular zzso during zzso outgrowth from zzso zzso in zzso and in mouse zzso tumors in zzso Moreover, we show that zzso blocks zzso in zzso or when delivered zzso in a mouse model of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso tumor growth in an zzso mouse tumor zzso Thus, zzso is a critical regulator of these two important zzso during zzso and zzso and is inhibited by the novel zzso zzso
