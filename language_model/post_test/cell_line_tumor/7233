The zzso zzso zzso functions as a zzso zzso factor that regulates the zzso of genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and also mediates most of the toxic effects caused by zzso and zzso aromatic zzso The zzso zzso complex exists as a zzso cryptic complex, consisting of the 90 zzso heat shock protein zzso and the zzso B virus zzso protein 2 zzso The zzso zzso especially zzso of the zzso zzso complex are poorly zzso although the zzso of a zzso active zzso of zzso and an zzso nuclear zzso is critically involved in zzso zzso To reveal the zzso status involved in zzso function, we used mass zzso to determine the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso complex, prepared from Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso expressing mouse zzso We identified zzso of the zzso zzso within the zzso complex at zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso By zzso zzso these zzso zzso were zzso with zzso and zzso acid to zzso the role of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso showed that the replacement of zzso and zzso by Ala, zzso increased the binding affinity for zzso as compared with the zzso zzso In a zzso zzso zzso activity zzso using zzso zzso the zzso zzso exhibited more potent zzso activity than the zzso zzso which had activity similar to that of zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso in the charged zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso the formation of the functional zzso zzso zzso
