The type I zzso growth factor zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso involved in cancer zzso survival, and zzso 

In this study, we used two different fluorescent technologies zzso zzso and quantum dot zzso zzso to detect zzso expression and its zzso by zzso in zzso 

After zzso with zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso zzso zzso or Alexa zzso zzso zzso detected expression and zzso of zzso in zzso To examine their utility in zzso either zzso zzso were zzso delivered to mice bearing zzso zzso of mouse zzso zzso expressing human zzso or zzso human breast cancer zzso zzso dot zzso was mainly zzso to the zzso system in several zzso and engulfed by zzso with only very small amount of zzso detected in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso did not alter the zzso zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso Alexa zzso solely targeted to zzso zzso and was able to detect zzso zzso with little zzso targeting to other zzso or zzso in zzso 

Taken together, our data suggest that zzso zzso not zzso are suitable to detect the expression and zzso of zzso in zzso
