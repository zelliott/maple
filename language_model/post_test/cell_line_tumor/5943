zzso development relies upon essential contributions from the tumor zzso and host immune zzso These contributions may inform the plasma zzso in a manner that could be exploited for cancer diagnosis and zzso In this study, we employed a systems biology approach to characterize the plasma zzso response in the zzso zzso mouse model of breast cancer during tumor zzso zzso and zzso Mass zzso data derived from approximately zzso million zzso identified protein networks involved in wound healing, zzso and metabolism that zzso changed during tumor zzso The observed zzso developed prior to cancer zzso increased progressively with tumor growth and reverted toward baseline with tumor zzso Gene expression and zzso analyses suggested that the zzso plasma zzso was derived from zzso responses in the zzso host zzso as well as the developing zzso The zzso signature was distinct from a zzso response to zzso Overall, the developing tumor simultaneously engaged a number of innate zzso zzso including wound repair, immune response, zzso and complement zzso tissue zzso and zzso zzso that were all zzso in zzso Our findings offer an integrated view of tumor development relevant to zzso strategies to detect and diagnose zzso
