We sought to identify zzso of growth response to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using a large panel of zzso cancer cell zzso 

zzso zzso and second-generation zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso were compared with control zzso Growth was assessed by cell zzso zzso was assessed by zzso zzso zzso and cell cycle analysis was assessed by flow zzso zzso expression was detected by Western zzso analysis, and zzso expression was detected by quantitative reverse zzso zzso zzso activity was detected by zzso zzso followed by zzso basic protein zzso 

A panel of 15 zzso cancer cell lines was used to model a range of growth responses to zzso targeting zzso zzso Growth zzso varied from zzso to zzso zzso Growth zzso was associated with increased zzso and zzso of cells in the zzso and S zzso of the cell zzso Growth response was not related to level of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso or degree of zzso protein zzso However, zzso growth response was associated with a high proportion of zzso zzso zzso to total zzso zzso + zzso + zzso zzso zzso and significantly higher zzso zzso activity induction following growth factor zzso growth factor zzso stimulation in the cell lines consistent with dependency of these cell lines on zzso 

These data indicate that zzso zzso demonstrate differential sensitivity to zzso targeted against zzso and target expression levels and degree of zzso of zzso signaling are zzso zzso sensitive tumors could zzso be zzso
