Although zzso acid isolated from zzso zzso zzso was known to have zzso activities in zzso breast and liver zzso the underlying mechanism of zzso acid in zzso cancer cells was not investigated so zzso In the present study, the zzso mechanism of zzso acid was zzso in zzso zzso cancer cells by zzso zzso zzso cell cycle analysis and Western zzso zzso acid exerted zzso against zzso and zzso zzso cancer cells with zzso of zzso 50 and zzso zzso zzso bodies were observed in zzso acid treated zzso zzso Also, zzso acid significantly increased zzso zzso stained cells and zzso zzso portion in zzso zzso zzso Western zzso revealed that zzso acid effectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suppressed the expression of survival genes such as zzso zzso and zzso elevated gene zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso acid suppressed zzso degradation as well as enhanced zzso of zzso zzso zzso 3 beta zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso inhibitor zzso blocked the zzso of zzso and zzso induced by zzso acid and zzso inhibitor zzso disturbed zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and decreased zzso membrane potential zzso induced by zzso acid in zzso zzso Overall, our findings suggest that zzso acid zzso zzso via zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cancer cells as a potent zzso agent for zzso cancer zzso
