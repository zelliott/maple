zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein promoting resistance of tumor cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso cells are particularly resistant to this class of drugs which include zzso zzso and zzso zzso A previous study using the zzso zzso technique showed that decrease of zzso zzso stands out among the zzso in gene expression caused by the cell zzso zzso of a zzso zzso cell line with zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 57, zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso cells zzso exhibit decreased zzso protein expression and activity as compared with zzso or mock zzso cells zzso However, the decrease of expression occurs in the absence of changes in the zzso of the promoter region, indicating that zzso zzso by an as yet unknown route, the most common mechanism of zzso zzso zzso turned out to be significantly more sensitive to treatment with zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in the acute cell growth zzso zzso zzso In the zzso survival zzso zzso cells displayed increased sensitivity even to 10 zzso zzso and zzso Our results indicate that enrichment with zzso in addition to zzso zzso growth, may facilitate zzso zzso
