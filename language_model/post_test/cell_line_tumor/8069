zzso is an important evolutionary force for the creation of new and potentially functional zzso genes which are collectively called zzso Many zzso are expressed in the zzso and the gene products have been shown to actively participate in zzso and other unique functions of the male zzso We have previously reported a cluster of zzso in the rat zzso that zzso putative zzso and zzso zzso Two of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso and zzso have further been shown to be expressed specifically in the rat zzso 

We show here that the zzso and zzso genes are also expressed in the rat zzso up to days zzso of development when the genes are silenced until being zzso in the adult zzso On database interrogation, we find that some zzso zzso are zzso duplicated as zzso of 2 or 3 zzso consistent with zzso The embryonic zzso zzso zzso by zzso and rapid amplification of zzso ends, are further found to have acquired one or more zzso zzso in the zzso region zzso Most importantly, the zzso locus is embedded within a dense field of relics of zzso element zzso derived mainly from zzso and zzso zzso and the TE sequences are frequently zzso through alternative zzso to form the zzso sequences of the zzso zzso In a case of zzso transcript, the zzso is extended into and terminated within an zzso zzso Since the two genes share a common zzso 1 and are, therefore, regulated by a single promoter, a zzso zzso model is zzso We further demonstrate that the zzso zzso TE sequences could lead to the creation of upstream open reading frames resulting in zzso zzso 

zzso of TE sequences is a frequent event in the zzso of zzso during embryonic development and in the zzso and may contribute to zzso regulation of expression of zzso
