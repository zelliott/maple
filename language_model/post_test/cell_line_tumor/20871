We characterized the expression and function of the zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in zzso but not in zzso and its expression is zzso correlated with median patient zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells decreases zzso 7 zzso and renders the cells resistant to zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso decreases cell growth and zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso and zzso Thus, zzso contributes to the increased zzso resistance and growth of zzso cells and may provide a target for enhancing the therapeutic responsiveness of these zzso
