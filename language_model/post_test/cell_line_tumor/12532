Despite the existence of successful vaccine and zzso therapies, infection with zzso B virus zzso continues to be a major global cause of acute and chronic liver disease and high zzso We zzso and evaluated several zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso activities against zzso B zzso Among the compounds zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (39), zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found to possess significant zzso activity against zzso in primary duck zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 23, 25, 39, 48, and 49 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibited significant activity against zzso human zzso in zzso zzso zzso 25, 39, 48, and 49 retained sensitivity against zzso zzso containing a single zzso zzso and 48 emerged as an effective inhibitor of drug-resistant zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, 50% zzso could not be achieved by zzso at 44 zzso concentration in the drug-resistant zzso The compounds investigated did not show zzso to host cells up to the highest zzso zzso
