zzso zzso are potent negative regulators of gene expression that have been implicated in most major cellular zzso Despite rapid advances in our understanding of zzso zzso and zzso many fundamental questions still remain regarding zzso function and their influence on cell cycle zzso Considering recent reports on the impact of zzso fluctuations in gene expression on zzso diversity, it is likely that looking at the average zzso expression of cell populations could result in the loss of important information connecting zzso expression and cell zzso Currently, however, there are no efficient techniques to zzso zzso expression at the zzso zzso Here, a method is described for the detection of individual zzso molecules in cancer cells using zzso in zzso zzso The method combines the unique recognition properties of locked zzso acid zzso with zzso zzso Using this approach, individual zzso are identified as bright, zzso fluorescent zzso In this study, zzso was zzso in zzso and zzso cells, while zzso was zzso in zzso zzso The dynamic range was found to span over three orders of magnitude and the average zzso copy number per cell was within zzso of zzso acquired by quantitative zzso
