We attempted to clone candidate genes on zzso zzso which may regulate zzso zzso through zzso zzso using 3 zzso clones covering the zzso After obtaining 20 zzso we examined the function of zzso zzso zzso gene for zzso we cloned from primary cultured human zzso and zzso cell zzso We confirmed approximately 20 zzso products zzso by zzso and investigated the function of this cloned gene and its involvement in zzso expression by zzso the zzso cell lines with full-length zzso zzso designed zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso showed zzso intense expression similar to zzso in cancer cell lines, whereas very weak expression was evident in human primary zzso without zzso zzso This gene was predicted to be a zzso precursor zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited more than zzso of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, primary cultured cells zzso the gene showed no significant change in zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the gene strongly suppressed zzso zzso in poorly differentiated zzso 

These findings indicate that zzso might be a zzso precursor gene involved in the differentiation and function upstream of zzso
