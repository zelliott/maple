Although the rate of development of drug resistance remains very high, zzso zzso is still the most common zzso drug used for the treatment of colon zzso A better understanding of the mechanism of why zzso develop resistance to zzso could improve its therapeutic zzso Sometimes, antioxidants are used simultaneously with zzso zzso However, a recent clinical trial showed no advantage or even a harmful effect of combining antioxidants with zzso compared with administration of zzso zzso The mechanism explaining this phenomenon is still poorly zzso In this study, we show that zzso can induce zzso oxygen zzso zzso zzso in colon cancer zzso Mouse embryonic zzso that are deficient in zzso showed a clear resistance to zzso and knocking down zzso protein expression in colon cancer cells also decreased zzso zzso We found that zzso could interact with and zzso zzso at multiple zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso increases its activity, thereby enhancing cellular zzso When using zzso and antioxidants together, zzso zzso was zzso resulting in decreased zzso zzso Our results provide a novel explanation as to why zzso is not effective in combination with some antioxidants in colon cancer patients, which is important for clinical zzso
