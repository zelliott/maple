Half of patients with zzso zzso cancer develop zzso disease, and this is responsible for most of the deaths from this zzso Low expression of zzso zzso inhibitor 2 zzso also known as zzso and zzso is associated with zzso disease in patients with zzso zzso zzso Moreover, a reduction in zzso is observed upon zzso of zzso in zzso models of zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso suppresses lung zzso in mouse models by reducing the expression of zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso In addition, we found that high zzso levels zzso poor prognosis in patients with zzso zzso The functional importance of tumor expression of zzso in promoting zzso was established in in zzso and in zzso studies in mice that implicated a role for the zzso zzso (also known as zzso and zzso Further analysis indicated that zzso suppressed zzso by altering inflammation in the tumor zzso In zzso we demonstrate what we believe to be a new mechanism of zzso suppression that works by reducing host responses that promote zzso colonization of the zzso zzso targeting of these interactions may provide a novel zzso strategy for delaying the appearance of clinical zzso in zzso
