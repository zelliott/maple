Since bone zzso breast cancer is an incurable disease, causing significant morbidity and zzso an understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms would be highly zzso Here, we describe in zzso and in zzso zzso for the importance of zzso zzso in the zzso of breast cancer to zzso We first characterized the bone zzso propensity of the zzso cell line zzso as compared to the parental zzso cells by zzso and zzso observations in the zzso zzso zzso gene expression profiling of this zzso cell line pair revealed that all the three genes involved in the zzso zzso zzso pathway, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso in the highly zzso zzso This zzso is the primary zzso source for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso we observed that the proliferation of zzso cells in zzso conditions was dependent on zzso zzso In addition, we observed that zzso zzso is essential for the formation of bone zzso human zzso and may thus contribute to the vicious cycle of zzso bone zzso High expression of zzso and zzso in primary breast cancer was significantly associated with decreased zzso and overall survival of patients and zzso zzso features of breast zzso In conclusion, high expression of zzso zzso genes in zzso breast cancer cells and the stimulating effect of zzso zzso on zzso and cancer cell proliferation indicate a functionally critical role for zzso zzso in bone zzso breast cancer and thereby an opportunity for targeted therapeutic zzso
