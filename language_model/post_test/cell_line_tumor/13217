zzso zzso 3 zzso mediates cellular resistance toward various forms of zzso Here, we show that in zzso cells subjected to zzso and zzso treatment zzso prevents loss of zzso membrane potential zzso zzso zzso and zzso oxygen species zzso Our results indicate that: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transition and loss of membrane potential by preventing zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso increases zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso thereby preventing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso In conclusion we propose that, in zzso cells, zzso has a central role in connecting changes in zzso zzso pH and zzso zzso zzso
