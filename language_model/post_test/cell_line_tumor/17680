zzso zzso IX zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso in three-dimensional organ zzso of human zzso zzso which were infiltrated by four different lung zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed in zzso cultures of these zzso cell lines and zzso cells as a model for normal zzso zzso by flow zzso zzso differences of zzso zzso zzso between the zzso were detected in organ zzso as well as in single cell zzso Relative zzso values in organ zzso zzso did not zzso to the zzso in single cells zzso zzso of organ zzso revealed different patterns of invasion and zzso cell zzso depending on the zzso zzso After correction of zzso in the zzso to zzso cell density the correlation zzso for zzso values between both models increased zzso Thus, additionally to distinctive features of zzso zzso patterns of zzso invasion may be a factor determining zzso zzso Considering these results, a pronounced zzso of zzso zzso might be expected in different zzso zzso in zzso This could interfere with the diagnostic reliability of zzso zzso for early zzso zzso
