Since zzso have individual zzso zzso are zzso and evolve from normal cells treated by zzso only after zzso long zzso of many months to zzso deduce that zzso may be a form of zzso This theory proposes that zzso initiate zzso by causing zzso zzso losses or gains of zzso zzso zzso the zzso because it zzso thousands of collaborating genes including those that zzso segregate and repair zzso Driven by this inherent instability zzso cells evolve zzso random zzso zzso Most of these zzso but a very small minority acquires zzso zzso primary characteristic of cancer cells and zzso zzso for autonomy zzso new cancer species against the inherent instability of zzso within specific margins of zzso The zzso theory explains five common characteristics of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso variations within stable margins of zzso zzso by replacing defective zzso from zzso pools of competent zzso or subspecies generated by this zzso and zzso zzso zzso by the low probability that random zzso zzso generate new autonomous zzso Moreover, the theory explains zzso relations between zzso of the same zzso because zzso is restricted by zzso zzso The theory also zzso zzso of other cancer zzso For example, zzso of zzso is now said to be a zzso or zzso fatal zzso because zzso zzso normal growth and zzso But if the zzso of zzso are in effect the zzso of new species, this paradox is zzso
