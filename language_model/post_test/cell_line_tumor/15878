It is well known that zzso zzso zzso support tumor development through zzso soluble factors such as various zzso zzso and growth zzso It has also been suggested that zzso zzso and immune cells have a high expression of zzso zzso and produce and zzso several zzso zzso to adjacent cancer zzso From these findings, we assumed that zzso zzso might have an zzso effect on cancer cells even without zzso expression in zzso mechanisms through blocking the effect of zzso zzso Here, because of the complex involvement of various factors in zzso we investigated this possibility with an in zzso model using a zzso zzso To test our hypothesis, we used zzso cell lines as zzso cells in our zzso When we zzso cancer cells zzso cells without zzso zzso with zzso zzso cells in the zzso membrane system, we observed that the proliferation of cancer cells was promoted and vascular zzso growth factor synthesis was zzso zzso These effects were blocked completely by zzso zzso and zzso zzso and partially by the PG zzso zzso 4 zzso Even if some cancer cells did not express zzso they were found to have expression of PG receptors and zzso downstream signaling molecules associated with cell zzso Our observation suggests that these cells can be influenced by zzso derived from zzso zzso These findings also suggest that zzso zzso can be used to control the interaction between cancer and surrounding zzso zzso and suppress the proliferation of cancer cells regardless of the expression of zzso in cancer zzso
