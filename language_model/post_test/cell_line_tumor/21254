Recent studies have suggested that the proliferation of zzso zzso may result from zzso of protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso is an oral inhibitor of zzso as well as other zzso The initial objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of zzso in a series of zzso human zzso cell lines with diverse zzso zzso Although zzso independently produced a zzso zzso of cellular proliferation and decreased cell viability in each of the zzso cell lines zzso and partially zzso zzso and zzso zzso median effective zzso were at the upper limits of, or above, the clinically achievable range in all cell lines zzso We therefore examined whether the efficacy of zzso could be enhanced by combination with the zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso and other signaling zzso by a distinct zzso In comparison to the effect of zzso alone, combination of zzso with zzso led to marked enhancement of zzso and zzso zzso zzso exposure to both agents significantly increased the release of zzso zzso as well as zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso exposed to zzso and zzso also displayed a significant reduction in cell cycle regulatory zzso such as zzso and zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that the efficacy of zzso can be zzso by the addition of zzso and indicate that combining zzso targeted therapies may provide a more effective strategy than zzso therapy to treat patients with zzso zzso
