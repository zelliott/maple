zzso cellular zzso is an attractive zzso zzso Here, we reported zzso a novel compound from the zzso zzso zzso library generated by using the zzso reaction strategy, as a new zzso zzso zzso zzso apparent zzso of cell proliferation by arresting zzso specifically and zzso in various tumor cell lines originating from different human zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso induced typical gene expression profiles related to zzso arrest shown by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to analyze the zzso data and suggested that zzso was possibly a zzso inhibitor due to its similar gene expression profiles to those of the known zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Further analyses demonstrated that zzso inhibited the zzso of cellular zzso although it was not zzso to bind to zzso zzso The zzso of cellular zzso zzso by zzso subsequently resulted in the disruption of zzso zzso formation, activated the zzso assembly checkpoint and consequently arrested the cells at zzso The persistent zzso arrest by the treatment with zzso led the tested tumor cells to zzso Our data indicate that zzso could act as a promising lead for further zzso in hopes of developing new zzso zzso and being used to probe the biology of zzso specifically, the mode of interference with zzso
