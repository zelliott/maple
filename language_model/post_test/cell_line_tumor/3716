High continuous zzso pressure has been shown to affect many cellular functions within the zzso cells, for instance, zzso of heat shock protein 70 occurs during zzso Various signal zzso pathways are likely to mediate these changes, however, at the present time our knowledge of the pathways involved is rather zzso The aim of this study was to investigate whether some of the well known zzso pathways are activated by the exposure of human zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso The results showed an increased presence of the active, zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in cells exposed to 15 and 30 zzso continuous zzso pressure, while zzso zzso zzso loading had weaker zzso zzso of zzso with zzso did not prevent the zzso of heat shock protein zzso No zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso or zzso could be noticed in zzso zzso In conclusion, we could identify at least two different signal zzso pathways that are activated under high continuous zzso zzso zzso of heat shock protein 70 was independent of zzso
