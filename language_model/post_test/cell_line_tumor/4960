zzso zzso is a well-known zzso zzso which has high zzso efficiency due to its zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso and zzso time in zzso still need to be overcome for a successful gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso and low molecular weight zzso zzso were successfully zzso and evaluated as a zzso gene zzso The zzso were obtained in significant yields through Michael type addition reaction of zzso zzso and low molecular weight zzso zzso Analysis of degradation products by the reduction in molecular weight demonstrated that zzso degrade in a controlled zzso The zzso showed good DNA binding ability and the sizes of complexes under zzso condition were below 150 zzso implicating its potential for zzso zzso It showed lower zzso in three different cell lines zzso zzso and zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso showed much higher zzso efficiencies in three cell lines compared with zzso zzso and zzso zzso and revealed little serum dependency in zzso cell line when the content of zzso in the zzso was increased up to zzso
