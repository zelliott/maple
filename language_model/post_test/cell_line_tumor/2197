We have previously observed an increased of zzso II zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso with enhanced zzso sympathetic zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso with reduced zzso zzso from the zzso nucleus zzso in rats with heart zzso To test the hypothesis that NO exerts an zzso effect on zzso expression in the zzso we used primary cultured zzso cells of zzso rats and zzso cell line zzso as in zzso zzso In zzso primary culture, NO donor sodium zzso zzso induced zzso decreases in zzso and protein of zzso zzso M zzso zzso protein was 10 zzso zzso of control zzso while zzso inhibitor zzso zzso induced zzso increases in zzso and protein levels of zzso zzso M zzso zzso protein was 148 zzso zzso of control zzso Similar effects of zzso and zzso on zzso expression were also observed in zzso cell line zzso M zzso zzso protein was 30 zzso zzso of control level while at the dose of zzso M zzso zzso protein was zzso zzso zzso of the control zzso zzso zzso of zzso using zzso caused an increase in zzso expression while zzso of zzso using zzso gene transfer zzso caused an zzso of zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the increase while zzso infection blunted the increase in zzso calcium concentration in response to zzso II treatment in zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso as well as protein level in zzso cell line in response to zzso zzso zzso treatment was blocked by protein zzso G zzso zzso while the zzso scavenger zzso had no zzso These results suggest that NO acts as an zzso regulator of zzso expression and the zzso of zzso is the required step in the regulation of zzso gene expression via zzso signaling zzso
