zzso zzso zzso was shown to harbor zzso cancer stem cells that were major causes of zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso cell factor zzso signaling play important roles in initiation and maintenance of zzso zzso This study demonstrated that long-term culture with zzso zzso the zzso zzso inhibitor against zzso and zzso resulted in reduced cancer stem cell ability in zzso cells through cell zzso zzso from zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso for 3 months, zzso cells showed distinct properties of cell cycle distribution and zzso in addition to significantly decreased ability to form zzso and colonies in zzso and zzso in zzso Increased expression of zzso zzso zzso and class III zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected with zzso like zzso or zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, decreased expression of stem cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and increased terminal neural cell zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified in zzso at the zzso zzso All these markers were changed in zzso cells when zzso and zzso expression were double knocked down by zzso Cell differentiation agent, zzso zzso acid zzso caused similar effect as that with zzso in zzso cells, while adding zzso and zzso in zzso resulted in cell zzso to some zzso Moreover, differentiation in zzso cells treated by zzso or zzso was mainly driven by zzso signaling zzso In zzso continuous zzso on zzso and zzso signaling disturbed zzso stem cells biology in zzso of zzso cells and may have zzso in clinical zzso
