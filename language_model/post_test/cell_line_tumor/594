zzso zzso are materials with one dimension in the range of zzso zzso The toxicity of zzso remains widely unknown and still poses concerns, due to the peculiar characteristics of materials in the zzso zzso We analyze the toxicity of seven zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on primary cultures of human zzso zzso cells from the bone zzso of healthy donors with zzso zzso and show that zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have a toxic effect, while the other zzso have no effect at the tested zzso zzso 25 and 100 zzso While Co zzso suspension is toxic to both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at 5 zzso are specifically toxic to zzso colony development, suggesting a highly selective type of zzso With liquid culture zzso we show that zzso zzso impair the proliferation of zzso zzso while no toxic effect is observed when zzso zzso are added during zzso zzso zzso zzso and liquid culture zzso on seven human cell lines of zzso origin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso show that, contrary to what observed on primary cultures of bone zzso zzso zzso zzso have no toxic effect on proliferation of any of the cell lines, raising concerns about the use of immortalized cell lines for zzso zzso
