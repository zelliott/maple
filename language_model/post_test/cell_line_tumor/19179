The tumor zzso zzso is zzso in zzso of zzso cell lung cancer zzso tumors and cell lines and is proposed to be a key regulator of zzso cell zzso however, how zzso regulates cancer cell polarity is not zzso The experiments described zzso show for the first time that zzso is a zzso zzso protein that rapidly zzso to the leading edge of zzso cancer zzso zzso proves to be essential for zzso zzso because zzso depletion results in classic cell polarity zzso such as zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso formation, and zzso zzso To probe how zzso regulates these events, we show that zzso zzso at the cellular leading edge with two key components of the polarity zzso - the small zzso zzso zzso and its downstream binding partner zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso functionality is required for zzso polarization to the leading edge, maintaining active zzso levels, and downstream zzso zzso To do this, zzso interacts only with active form of zzso and zzso but not with inactive zzso Taken together, these results show that zzso is a critical zzso of the zzso polarity program in lung cancer cells through a novel zzso zzso
