Parkinson's disease zzso is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by genetic and environmental zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso within zzso and zzso in the zzso and zzso genes have been shown to play a role in the zzso of zzso In light of recent reports suggesting an interaction between zzso and zzso we investigated the effects of zzso zzso on zzso distribution and expression levels in primary zzso and zzso zzso derived from non transgenic zzso zzso and zzso over expressing zzso zzso We show that suppression of zzso activity increased zzso levels in control, non zzso zzso and resulted in a zzso zzso of zzso zzso in these zzso In contrast, blocking zzso activity in zzso over expressing zzso decreased zzso levels, and enhanced its synaptic zzso In zzso studies verified the zzso zzso of zzso had minimal effect on zzso (a marker of zzso in control cells, in cells over expressing zzso zzso zzso resulted in increased zzso zzso These findings suggest a possible differential role of zzso function under normal and pathological zzso Furthermore, in the context of zzso pathology, zzso of zzso activity could serve as a therapeutic tool to enhance the zzso zzso and induce clearance of the observed zzso zzso species in the zzso zzso
