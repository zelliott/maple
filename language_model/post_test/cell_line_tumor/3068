A membrane protein on the surface of a single living zzso cell was zzso by scanning zzso zzso zzso The zzso growth factor zzso zzso is one of the key membrane proteins associated with zzso It elicits a wide range of zzso responses, leading to cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso To estimate zzso expression levels by zzso zzso was labeled with alkaline zzso zzso via an zzso The zzso current of zzso zzso produced by the zzso reaction was monitored to estimate the density of cell surface zzso zzso measurement by zzso has three zzso First, a single zzso cell can be measured without peeling it from the culture zzso second, it is possible to zzso labeling zzso zzso by using living cells because detection of zzso current is suitable for quantitative zzso in zzso and third, zzso zzso afford information on the expression state at the cell membrane at the zzso zzso In this study, we zzso the concentration of labeling zzso for zzso at the cell surface and confirmed distinct differences in zzso expression levels among three types of zzso zzso zzso were compatible with the results of flow zzso
