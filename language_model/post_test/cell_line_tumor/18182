This study evaluated the zzso and zzso efficacy of two zzso members of the zzso of zzso peptides against zzso tumor cells and benign zzso 

The zzso and zzso potential of the zzso A and B was zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso in four zzso cancer cell lines as well as in zzso and human zzso cell zzso zzso values were assessed by zzso zzso representing the concentration at which cell viability was reduced by zzso zzso electron zzso zzso was performed to zzso the zzso changes induced by zzso A and B in zzso tumor cells and zzso 

zzso A and B inhibit zzso cancer cell proliferation and viability in a zzso zzso The average zzso values of zzso A and B against all zzso cancer cell lines ranged between zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, benign zzso were significantly less or not at all susceptible to zzso A and zzso Both zzso induced an increase in zzso release from zzso tumor cells whereas benign zzso were not zzso zzso demonstrated lethal membrane disruption in zzso cancer cells as opposed to zzso 

zzso A and B exert selective zzso and zzso efficacy in zzso cancer cells while sparing targets of benign zzso or human zzso zzso Both peptides may offer novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of zzso cancer with limited zzso effects on benign zzso
