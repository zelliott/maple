zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso are highly zzso zzso zzso zzso which have been widely zzso as zzso markers for zzso cell zzso but it has recently been demonstrated that only zzso is truly specific for certain forms of lung zzso Using a construct containing the zzso region of the zzso gene between zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso reporter zzso zzso promoter activity was detected in zzso SCC cell lines zzso zzso but not in zzso lung zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso or normal cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso marker gene only in zzso and zzso zzso The same strategy was used for zzso expression of a zzso zzso zzso which can cause zzso disruption by triggering zzso zzso and zzso resulting in the release of zzso c and induction of zzso zzso with zzso specifically reduced the growth of the two human lung SCC cell lines compared to the zzso zzso cell lines both in zzso and in zzso suggesting that the zzso promoter had a zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso zzso suicide genes by zzso zzso can zzso zzso targeted zzso in zzso lung SCC cells, and represents a novel strategy for gene transfer specifically targeted to SCC in the zzso
