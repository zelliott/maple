zzso zzso cell zzso zzso is associated both with the local expansion of clones of zzso cells and with their further migration to regional and distant zzso The interactions that occur between normal and zzso cells during these events are not well zzso by standard culture conditions, but zzso cultures, in which zzso cells are grown on a zzso containing zzso provide a suitable environment for such zzso 

zzso from five cell lines, each derived from zzso and marked by zzso zzso with alkaline zzso were incorporated as small zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cultures constructed from normal oral zzso zzso The patterns of growth of the zzso cells within the normal zzso were examined for 3 zzso 

There was variation between the different cell lines in their rates and patterns of growth, but all cell lines produced clusters of zzso cells that had expanded within 3 weeks to replace the normal zzso The appearance and spacing of these clusters suggested that each was derived from a single zzso zzso The number of zzso cells initially present within a given area of zzso zzso was much greater than the number of expanding cell clusters subsequently zzso zzso cells thus represented only a zzso of the zzso zzso 

The zzso model allows examination of interactions occurring between cells derived from zzso and normal zzso The three-dimensional nature of zzso cultures, together with their more normal patterns of zzso provides an environment that more closely mimics the in zzso environment in which zzso zzso The finding that only a zzso of zzso cells forms expanding zzso colonies suggests a range of growth zzso within a zzso population and may provide preliminary evidence for some form of stem and amplifying cell zzso
