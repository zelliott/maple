The zzso a zzso zzso is currently zzso as zzso protein or zzso zzso Over expressing zzso can slow zzso cell proliferation zzso In zzso cells, it had been demonstrated that zzso is involved in protein zzso The knowledge about the protein is very limited and not zzso The zzso and its zzso proteins form a family and are restricted to zzso In the family, there are no zzso sequences with resolved three-dimensional structure and their functions are difficult to zzso zzso expression of zzso in three zzso cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso was lower than normal liver tissue and liver zzso zzso In this study, functional zzso techniques were zzso in searching the interacting counterpart of zzso Several proteins involved in protein translation and folding were selectively zzso with zzso and identified mass zzso zzso of zzso and zzso factor zzso was confirmed by Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso factor zzso is a multiple function protein and involved in several biological mechanisms, including protein zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso down regulated the proliferation of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso participated in the zzso factor zzso regulated zzso
