Agents that activate expression of specific genes to probe cellular pathways or alleviate disease would go beyond existing approaches for controlling gene zzso Duplex zzso complementary to promoter regions can repress or activate gene zzso The mechanism of these zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso Other work has revealed zzso transcripts that overlap zzso The function of these zzso transcripts is also not zzso Here we link these two sets of enigmatic zzso We find that zzso transcripts are the target for zzso that activate or repress expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso recruit zzso proteins to zzso zzso transcripts and shift zzso of the zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso II and zzso protein 1 zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso transcripts have a central role in recognition of the zzso promoter by both zzso and zzso zzso
