The investigation of zzso interactions in the cellular context presents significant technical challenges, first, to zzso the zzso in a manner that preserves functional properties and, second, to relate zzso properties to cell zzso and other cellular zzso 

zzso cell zzso was characterized by the development of a cellulose zzso zzso zzso in which zzso zzso zzso was immobilized onto the cellulose membrane as a zzso fusion protein containing a zzso domain affinity zzso zzso containing single cellulose hollow fibers were connected to a zzso system for cell deposition and detachment with fluid zzso zzso The cell zzso process that occurred inside a segment of hollow fiber was observed in real time by using an zzso microscope equipped with a zzso camera and digital frame zzso Image analysis software was developed to count cells and record digital zzso 

Cell zzso strength was characterized by counting the number of cells that were detached by application of fluid zzso stress with values that ranged from zzso to 185 zzso The median zzso stress of detachment of zzso cells was directly related to the duration of membrane contact and the amount of immobilized zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso provides a general method to determine functional properties of molecular zzso that interact with cell surface receptors and zzso
