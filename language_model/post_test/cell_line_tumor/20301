zzso cultures of zzso zzso are used to produce zzso zzso which is used as a functional food and in the production of various zzso including zzso acids zzso zzso culture approaches that produce zzso zzso with high levels of zzso and good biological activity are critical in the functional food zzso In this study, a zzso culture approach to producing zzso was compared to the submerged culture zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the cultured zzso were compared as between solid and submerged zzso Growing zzso zzso strains on solid potato zzso zzso medium increased zzso the production of zzso acid 24 zzso zzso zzso zzso and total zzso zzso as compared to zzso grown in submerged zzso zzso methanol extracts of zzso from zzso culture showed higher zzso than those from submerged zzso The zzso values of methanol extracts from zzso culture were zzso zzso and zzso times less than submerged culture on human lung cancer cells zzso melanoma cells zzso and oral cancer cells zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso coding genes had higher expression on the culture of solid potato zzso zzso This is the first report that zzso culture is able to increase zzso production significantly as compared to submerged culture and, in the process, produces much higher biological zzso This indicates that it may be possible to enhance the production of zzso by implementing zzso culture on solid zzso
