In this study, we examined effects of soluble factors released by gastric cancer cells on zzso zzso cells in zzso and in zzso 

zzso a human zzso zzso cell line, was incubated with zzso from gastric cancer zzso zzso changes of zzso cells were zzso zzso of zzso cells was observed under a transmission electron microscope and zzso determined by zzso zzso and flow zzso Expressions of zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso 

zzso zzso changes indicating zzso were observed in zzso cells zzso after treatment with the zzso of gastric cancer zzso In zzso zzso zzso treated with gastric cancer cell zzso were substantially thickened and contained extensive zzso 

These findings demonstrate that zzso of gastric cancer cells can induce zzso and zzso in zzso human zzso zzso cells through zzso in the early zzso zzso in a zzso manner, and indicate that soluble factors in the zzso cavity affect the zzso and function of zzso cells so that the resulting environment can become favorable to zzso zzso
