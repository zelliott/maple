We have designed a novel approach using genetically engineered mice to make a systematic study of the zzso zzso regulation of the zzso gene during development and zzso The zzso of the mice was modified either by zzso of the zzso natural zzso sites or by deleting the zzso zzso The previous in zzso observation that the zzso of the zzso sites leads to zzso inclusion of the zzso zzso was confirmed in our animal zzso In fact, all the adult zzso of the genetically modified mice showed only zzso zzso zzso demonstrating the zzso of in zzso models, despite of the zzso and zzso zzso regulation of the zzso zzso and regardless of the presence of zzso elements described within the zzso This result indicates that the zzso regulatory elements of the zzso zzso are zzso in the presence of consensus zzso zzso Moreover, we demonstrate the autonomy of both the zzso and the zzso alternatively spliced regions in adult mice lacking regulation of the alternative zzso at the zzso zzso We also show here the tight zzso regulation of all three alternative spliced regions of the zzso gene at different zzso during development and aging of zzso
