This study was conducted to evaluate the expression of the zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its clinical significance in zzso zzso zzso Nine zzso cell lines, 62 NHL samples including 31 diffuse large zzso zzso zzso and 10 benign zzso zzso zzso were analyzed for zzso zzso using zzso with DNA sequencing performed where zzso transcripts were zzso zzso zzso studies were conducted for evaluation of zzso protein expression with clinical data collected for assessment of the clinical relevance of the zzso expression in zzso Eight of nine zzso cell lines showed abnormal zzso zzso transcription, including 4 with zzso of normal and zzso zzso and 4 with absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was noted in 10 zzso zzso patients, including 3 with loss of zzso zzso expression and 7 with zzso zzso In all zzso abnormal zzso transcripts were determined for 17 of 62 patients zzso Regarding the zzso protein expression in zzso zzso showed strong zzso zzso expression zzso where zzso patients revealed reduced zzso or absence zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein expression was associated with a worse survival after zzso and zzso zzso Our result indicates that abnormal zzso zzso expression is noted frequently in NHL cell lines and a certain proportion of NHL patients, and decreased zzso protein expression indicates a significantly worse prognosis in zzso
