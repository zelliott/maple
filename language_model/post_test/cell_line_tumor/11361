We previously reported that zzso zzso is zzso in many cases of lung cancer, and X-ray zzso increased zzso expression and inhibited lung cancer zzso The mechanisms, however, were not zzso 

Four lung cancer cell lines were used to detect the zzso status of zzso with or without X-ray zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso the expression of zzso and western zzso analysis was applied to measure protein levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis, colony formation zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth experiment were used to study the biological behavior of the cells with zzso or zzso zzso gene after X-ray zzso 

zzso zzso gene was detected in 2 of 4 cell lines, and it correlated zzso with zzso zzso X-ray treatment significantly zzso zzso expression in zzso and zzso cells, which possess intrinsic zzso of the zzso gene ( zzso but did not show zzso in zzso and zzso cells, which have zzso zzso zzso zzso X-ray significantly reduced colony formation (from zzso to zzso in zzso cells, while the reduction was lower in zzso cells (from zzso to zzso After X-ray zzso zzso growth was significantly decreased in zzso cells (from zzso g to zzso zzso in comparison with zzso cells (from zzso g to zzso zzso zzso decreased cell zzso and increased zzso were also observed in zzso cells treated with X-ray zzso ( zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso could be detected in lung cancer zzso 

zzso zzso of lung cancer cells may be zzso by enhanced expression of zzso via zzso DNA zzso and zzso zzso Lung cancer cells with a different zzso status of the zzso gene showed different zzso suggesting that the zzso status of the zzso gene may be one important factor to predict zzso of the zzso
