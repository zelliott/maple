zzso factor 1 zzso a zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso mediates zzso of the gene for vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso of zzso is associated with tumor zzso and tumor cell proliferation and zzso We examined the effects of zzso zzso activity on zzso and human gastric cancer growth in zzso 

Human gastric cancer zzso cells were zzso zzso with zzso an expression zzso zzso a zzso form of zzso that zzso with zzso zzso to produce zzso complexes that cannot activate transcription, or with the empty expression zzso zzso Two clones of zzso cells, zzso and zzso were tested in all zzso We used an zzso zzso zzso to measure zzso zzso by zzso cells cultured in hypoxic zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso We used subcutaneous and zzso mouse tumor models to examine the growth of tumors derived from injected zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso vessel area (a measure of functional vascular zzso and tumor zzso cell association with zzso cells (a measure of vessel zzso were analyzed by zzso or zzso zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

zzso cells and zzso cells zzso less zzso than zzso zzso cells when cultured in zzso or hypoxic conditions zzso zzso versus zzso in zzso conditions: 645 zzso of zzso cells versus zzso zzso of zzso cells, difference zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso 640 to zzso zzso of zzso zzso P zzso zzso versus zzso in hypoxic conditions: zzso zzso of zzso cells versus zzso zzso of zzso cells, difference zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso In the subcutaneous tumor model, tumors derived from zzso or zzso cells had lower final volumes, zzso and vessel areas, less tumor zzso cell association with zzso cells, and fewer zzso tumor cells than tumors derived from zzso zzso In the zzso tumor model, tumors derived from zzso cells had smaller volumes and less vessel area and maturation than tumors derived from zzso zzso
