zzso zzso have a significant role in the zzso response of the brain to zzso zzso evidence has demonstrated that an increase of zzso levels may induce zzso cell death via zzso zzso There is a correlation between zzso of zzso oxygen species zzso and an zzso in zzso calcium that causes a subsequent increase in the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso via its zzso activity, exhibits a zzso effect against zzso induced by zzso calcium zzso zzso in the present study, we explored the protective effect of zzso in zzso toxicity in zzso zzso zzso Cellular treatment with the synthetic zzso zzso zzso resulted in a marked decrease in cell viability and in the level of the zzso zzso zzso zzso toxicity also caused an increase in zzso production and the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso along with an increase in zzso zzso zzso of the cells with zzso substantially prevented the decrease in cell zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso and zzso and reversed the depletion in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may exert its protective effects against the zzso and zzso death process in zzso zzso
