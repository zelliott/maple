zzso was thought to express in the zzso lineage exclusively until recently when zzso was shown to be expressed by cancer zzso It was indicated that zzso may play a wider role in biology by zzso tumor cells with immune zzso zzso However, researches between zzso and zzso zzso zzso of gastric cancer were relatively zzso so the present work was aimed to investigate the relationship between zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso in human gastric zzso 

A total of 122 gastric cancer patients were enrolled in this study, and gastric tumor specimens and zzso zzso were zzso Thirty patients who had chronic superficial zzso diagnosed by zzso zzso in the zzso University People's Hospital were chosen randomly as the control zzso zzso was performed to evaluate zzso zzso A survival analysis on the 122 patients was then zzso Then, zzso cell lines were used to confirm zzso expression in gastric zzso zzso Finally, evaluation of zzso expression in gastric tumor and zzso zzso in 12 patients were conducted using zzso and Western zzso A zzso test or zzso exact test zzso was conducted to compare the percentage of positive percentage zzso between zzso zzso analysis was performed for survival zzso 

zzso was expressed by gastric cancer cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was increased in primary tumors zzso than that in control group zzso In the zzso zzso group, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso which was less than zzso had a significant zzso of zzso in primary tumors and zzso zzso However, the frequency of zzso expression had no relationship with zzso 

zzso probably has a relationship with zzso zzso zzso of gastric zzso
