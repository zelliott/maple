zzso of this study was to investigate the zzso properties of the new zzso compound zzso zzso zzso In zzso growth zzso by zzso was comparable for zzso zzso cell models with zzso values generally in the low zzso zzso zzso induced zzso cell zzso indicated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso membrane zzso DNA is unlikely to represent the primary molecular target of zzso as no significant interaction or damage of DNA was zzso both in zzso and in living zzso Moreover, we found no evidence for induction of radical zzso In contrast, zzso zzso inhibited DNA synthesis paralleled by a massive block of cell cycle in zzso phase and a selective decrease of zzso zzso Although treatment with zzso induced expression of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso into zzso cells only marginally enhanced the zzso activity of zzso In zzso the zzso activity of zzso against human zzso colon zzso zzso was comparable to that of zzso and zzso at doses not causing significant adverse zzso With regard to zzso the zzso and zzso levels zzso of zzso in zzso rats were zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso mice 62 and 10 zzso zzso In zzso zzso exerts zzso activity via potent induction of cell cycle arrest and/or zzso and has promising in zzso zzso activity against a human colon cancer zzso Together, these data suggest further development of zzso as a new zzso zzso
