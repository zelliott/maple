The zzso salt zzso zzso is zzso in low to moderate zzso with a remarkable specificity for cancer cells resistant to conventional zzso Our data show that zzso zzso and zzso rather than zzso events, are crucial to the specific zzso zzso observed in resistant cancer zzso We show that zzso zzso depends on zzso reduction, and that the zzso environment is a key factor specific to zzso zzso The zzso reduction is zzso by zzso and the efficacy is determined by the zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso by zzso resistance zzso both of which are frequently zzso by resistant cancer zzso This mechanism provides molecular evidence for the existence of an inverse relationship between resistance to conventional chemotherapy and sensitivity to zzso zzso and highlights the great therapeutic potential in treating zzso zzso
