zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is based on cell capability to zzso zzso While a significantly higher expression of the zzso zzso zzso has been reported in zzso tumors only few data are available on the expression of other zzso zzso We studied several zzso zzso expression in zzso tumor cell lines zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also studied in 157 human zzso zzso and benign zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso levels were higher in zzso cells zzso zzso while zzso zzso levels were prevalent in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso Western zzso showed high expression and correct membrane targeting of zzso protein in zzso and zzso and of zzso protein in zzso and zzso All cell lines were able to zzso different rates of zzso The analysis of zzso and zzso zzso expression in human zzso zzso showed the prevalence of zzso but not of zzso in zzso with respect to normal zzso Finally, both zzso and zzso showed a slightly higher expression in zzso than in zzso zzso In conclusion, we showed that zzso and zzso were the most important zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In particular zzso was the most prevalent in zzso cells zzso and zzso while zzso was the most prevalent in zzso cells zzso and zzso A similar pattern of expression was found for zzso but not for zzso in human zzso zzso
