zzso factor zzso functions as cell attachment zzso for a wide range of human zzso The zzso zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso but requires interactions with zzso cell zzso zzso 1 zzso to zzso zzso We show here that a zzso zzso of zzso zzso generated by multiple passages in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells acquired the capacity to induce rapid and complete zzso of zzso cells while retaining the capacity to bind zzso zzso binding to zzso on zzso cells zzso zzso infection and was inhibited by either zzso blockade with a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or soluble human zzso Despite being zzso in zzso cells, zzso was able to zzso zzso an additional zzso cancer cell line via zzso interactions zzso The finding that zzso zzso zzso are less readily zzso from zzso zzso than are parental zzso zzso during a competitive zzso challenge by an zzso zzso zzso suggests that interactions between zzso and zzso are of higher affinity than those of the parental zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso region of the zzso revealed the presence of two zzso acid zzso in zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso possibly zzso the enhanced zzso zzso of zzso These zzso are predicted to be embedded at the interface of zzso zzso and zzso and are zzso to enhance the affinity of zzso interaction occurring outside the zzso zzso Taken together, the data clearly demonstrate an enhanced zzso zzso and expanded zzso zzso of zzso compared to the parental strain, further highlighting that zzso interactions with zzso alone facilitate rapid zzso zzso cell zzso
