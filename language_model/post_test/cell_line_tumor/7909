zzso zzso zzso remains a common cancer worldwide that lacks effective zzso or zzso zzso liver disease often leads to impaired zzso zzso zzso zzso and mice with zzso zzso develop zzso zzso zzso is zzso in normal zzso but zzso in zzso zzso The present study investigated zzso effectiveness in prevention and treatment of zzso Two weeks after injecting zzso million zzso cells into the liver zzso of zzso rats, they typically form a zzso zzso When zzso zzso zzso was delivered through continuous intravenous infusion, zzso zzso levels reached zzso zzso (over zzso 24 hours zzso This regimen, started 1 day after injecting zzso cells and continued for 10 days, was able to reduce tumor establishment and zzso However, if intravenous zzso was started after zzso had already developed, it was ineffective in reducing tumor growth for 24 zzso Although plasma zzso levels remained zzso zzso zzso levels were minimally increased zzso zzso zzso zzso administration led to induction of zzso zzso which prevented zzso zzso To see if zzso preventive effect on tumor establishment involves zzso the effect of zzso on zzso genes was zzso zzso treatment of zzso cells altered the expression of several genes with the net effect of zzso zzso These changes were confirmed at the protein level and functionally in human zzso vein zzso zzso 

zzso is effective in preventing zzso establishment but ineffective in treating established zzso because of induction of zzso zzso which prevents zzso level to reach high enough to kill liver cancer zzso zzso zzso effect may be related to its zzso action and its ability to inhibit zzso
