zzso tumor zzso protein regulates cell cycle progression primarily through interactions with members of the zzso family of zzso factors and repression of the zzso of zzso target zzso In zzso sensitive zzso zzso zzso cells, a dramatic increase in zzso protein mediates growth arrest at zzso However, although zzso is expressed at high levels in zzso cells, they fail to growth arrest in response to zzso zzso We show that the functional activity of zzso in zzso cells is reduced when compared to zzso zzso To determine the basis for the reduced functional activity, we characterized the zzso protein in zzso cells and investigated the possible role of zzso to this zzso in zzso resistance to zzso growth zzso zzso sequencing of zzso zzso cloned from zzso cells revealed the presence of two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which result in zzso acid changes zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso Unfortunately the same zzso zzso were observed in zzso zzso cloned from zzso sensitive zzso zzso We next investigated differences in zzso protein zzso zzso While zzso was localized in the nucleus in both cell lines, we observed regions of intense zzso within the nucleus of zzso zzso This is suggestive of zzso and/or zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Finally, the PAGE migration pattern of zzso suggested that a zzso form of zzso accumulated in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso It is possible that this zzso form can be responsible for the decreased zzso functional activity observed in zzso cells and may contribute to the resistance of these cells to zzso zzso growth zzso
