To determine the zzso contamination of excised zzso zzso ear, and evaluate the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso for preventing zzso into zzso diffusion zzso 

zzso were taken from four locations and used to inoculate zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were assembled to include zzso skin with and without zzso and the zzso phase sampled periodically and spread onto zzso 

Five distinct colony types were isolated after incubation of all zzso on zzso plates at 37 degrees zzso on SDA plates, one zzso colony was found at 30 degrees C and one at 37 degrees zzso The SDA zzso plate incubated at 30 degrees C resulted in the growth of a large diffused white zzso zzso No regional differences were zzso Without the zzso the zzso phase became contaminated within 6 zzso With the zzso present, microbial zzso was substantially retarded with visible zzso zzso growth occurring at 24 h and zzso contamination on both zzso media at 48 zzso 

As expected, the native zzso ears were considerably zzso The zzso of contamination into the diffusion cell zzso zzso can be zzso but not entirely, eliminated using zzso The addition of zzso agents was necessary to eliminate zzso that were observed at later time zzso 

This article, while highlighting the presence of a high number of zzso on native zzso skin, presents a practical means to reduce the risk of microbial contamination in zzso zzso studies, particularly in the study of cell cultures grown within Franz diffusion cell zzso zzso
