Previous studies have revealed that zzso a member of the family of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso with the zzso to bring about zzso zzso zzso arrest, and that the zzso of either zzso alone is sufficient to sensitize zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso another zzso has been reported to have several roles of cell survival, zzso growth, differentiation and cell zzso To zzso the functions of zzso in zzso cells treated with zzso we analyzed zzso in zzso and the effect of modification of zzso in zzso human zzso cells treated with zzso We found that zzso was zzso 1-2 days after zzso treatment and that zzso (for 24 zzso and zzso (for 72 zzso with a zzso inhibitor zzso at a concentration of 200 zzso or higher remarkably reduced zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso target protein zzso but not of zzso was inhibited by this concentration of zzso Therefore zzso was proved to have a role of survival in zzso cells treated with zzso and zzso responses were suggested to be more important in the zzso survival of zzso cells with DNA zzso zzso amplified the percentage of zzso cells and of zzso catastrophe cells in zzso zzso and zzso cells, respectively, suggesting that the enhancement of zzso zzso by a zzso inhibitor in zzso cells is induced (at least in part) by the zzso of cell death pathways induced by zzso zzso Further investigation based on the present data may provide a viable approach for enhancing zzso zzso in human zzso
