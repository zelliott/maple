zzso zzso zzso zzso is a scaffold protein that mediates the actions of zzso growth zzso zzso Its expression increases dramatically after partial zzso (a liver zzso zzso zzso we report zzso expression in a human zzso cell line zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The role of zzso in zzso proliferation was established by zzso interference zzso After zzso of zzso with zzso zzso we observed a specific reduction in zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso levels decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso Changes in zzso zzso in zzso cells were independent of zzso and zzso zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso and zzso plus zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso mediates the effect of zzso on zzso zzso Moreover, decreased zzso levels diminished zzso and zzso zzso growth and cause stress fiber disruption in zzso cell zzso 

zzso our data suggest that zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso and exerts its actions through zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso manner and in a zzso zzso
