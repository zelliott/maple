The functional relationships between zzso zzso zzso and their host genes in zzso cancer remain zzso zzso a zzso zzso in several kinds of zzso and associated with multiple cancer zzso is transcribed from 2 zzso located on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso within the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso 

The aim of our work was to investigate the expression and the roles of zzso and zzso as well as their host genes zzso and zzso in zzso zzso 

The expression of zzso and zzso as well as their host genes zzso and zzso in a panel of normal and zzso human zzso zzso was assessed by quantitative zzso We restored the expression of zzso and zzso in zzso cancer cells and evaluated their effects on cell invasion, migration, and zzso 

We found that zzso and its host gene zzso were zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso effects of zzso with zzso on zzso cancer cell invasion, migration, and proliferation were zzso Moreover, the effects of zzso on zzso cancer cells were due, at least zzso to targeting zzso and zzso 

These results zzso the involvement of zzso and its host gene zzso in zzso cancer cell invasion, migration, and zzso Our findings highlight the functional associations of zzso zzso and their host genes in zzso zzso
