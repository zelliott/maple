zzso in rod zzso zzso protein of rod zzso zzso zzso Many rod zzso zzso lead to protein zzso and therefore it is important to understand the role of molecular zzso in rod zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso prevents the zzso of rod zzso zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso results in zzso zzso zzso retention and zzso of zzso zzso rod zzso zzso fluorescent protein zzso at the zzso Fluorescence recovery after zzso reveals that zzso is usually mobile in the zzso By contrast, depletion of zzso activity by treatment with zzso or zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso decreases zzso mobility to below that of the zzso zzso zzso of rod zzso zzso which is retained in the zzso and can form zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso cells decreases the mobility of the zzso protein further and leads to zzso throughout the zzso Of interest, zzso zzso increases the mobility of zzso suggesting that it can reduce zzso rod zzso zzso Therefore zzso of zzso function results in zzso of rod zzso in the zzso which suggests that zzso is important for maintaining the zzso of rod zzso in the zzso
