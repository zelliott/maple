Although cumulative evidence supports the fact that zzso zzso promote tumor zzso the influence of zzso on zzso zzso zzso is zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso zzso cells can differentiate into zzso in zzso zzso and that they promote cancer zzso This study aims to: zzso assess the influence of zzso on the prognosis of zzso zzso identify HS cells in zzso zzso and zzso investigate the interaction between HS cells zzso and zzso and zzso cells zzso and zzso in zzso 

The association between zzso muscle zzso zzso expression and the zzso of 46 zzso patients after zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso The HS cells in zzso of zzso were identified zzso zzso using zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso The influence of HS cells on the invasion and growth of zzso cells was examined in zzso using a zzso zzso 

Patients with high zzso expression exhibited the worse zzso zzso analyses revealed that high zzso expression zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso were independent zzso zzso Because zzso or zzso cells zzso zzso were observed in the zzso samples, they were considered to be derived from the HS zzso On zzso with HS cells, a remarkable increase was observed in the invasion and growth of the two zzso cell zzso 

zzso zzso may relate to the poor zzso in zzso zzso HS cells appear to be involved in the progression of zzso
