Nuclear zzso influences the expression of certain zzso zzso zzso can zzso genes in the nucleus and thus could impact the expression of genes far from zzso zzso However, the extent to which zzso zzso influence nuclear organization and gene expression is poorly zzso We examined mouse zzso B cell zzso with a common zzso zzso which zzso a zzso region of mouse zzso 12 zzso zzso with a zzso region of mouse zzso 15 zzso zzso We found that sequences zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso had different nuclear positions measured relative to the nuclear zzso However, their positions were similar on zzso zzso in the same tumor cells and normal zzso B zzso In addition, zzso zzso folding marked by three-dimensional gene zzso was not significantly altered for the 7 zzso of zzso 15 sequence zzso to this zzso zzso zzso also did not zzso to significant changes in gene expression in this zzso Thus, any changes to zzso 15 structure and function imposed by the zzso zzso are constrained to sequences near zzso zzso the zzso zzso These data contrast with those of certain other zzso zzso and suggest that significant changes to zzso 15 sequence are structurally and functionally tolerated in the tumor cells zzso
