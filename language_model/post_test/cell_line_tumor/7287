The zzso zzso component zzso zzso has fundamental functions in cell attachment, zzso zzso and zzso zzso of cellular zzso named zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso are generated by alternative zzso of its zzso zzso Little is known about the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in human zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the expression pattern of zzso zzso zzso in bone cell lines and in different human bone tissue samples zzso bone, early stages of fracture healing, zzso zzso zzso Analysis was done by zzso with zzso and zzso zzso qualitative zzso and zzso real-time quantitative zzso zzso In zzso and zzso cell lines, abundant expression of zzso and zzso zzso was found in zzso High zzso levels of both zzso zzso zzso were seen in quantitative zzso in zzso cell zzso In mature bone, zzso and zzso were not zzso in zzso zzso of zzso in both zzso zzso was absent in these zzso Early stages of fracture healing and zzso cell samples exhibited extensive zzso for zzso and zzso zzso and high zzso levels were zzso Both zzso and bone fracture healing tissue expressed high zzso levels of the zzso zzso zzso independent of benign or zzso zzso Low level of zzso zzso zzso zzso and focal zzso zzso of zzso zzso was found in zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso was not detected by zzso and qualitative or quantitative zzso zzso zzso was found in zzso zzso processes in bone independent from zzso zzso zzso zzso was seen only in zzso new zzso processes like early stages of fracture healing and zzso and was absent in zzso processes like mature bone and zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso mark active processes in bone without differentiation between zzso or benign zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are strong markers for active zzso and zzso processes in human zzso
