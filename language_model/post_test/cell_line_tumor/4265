zzso is a zzso zzso approved for the treatment of zzso cell lung cancer zzso However, the lower objective response rate and higher adverse effects of zzso hinder its wide use in treatment of advanced zzso zzso it is of great interest to uncover the zzso for sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso to allow the identification of patients most likely to benefit from zzso chemotherapy and to improve the zzso In present work, four zzso cell lines were divided into zzso zzso group and zzso zzso group according to their sensitivities to zzso And then the gene expression profiles of these two groups was zzso the zzso expressed genes zzso difference higher than zzso and zzso totally zzso zzso were applied to zzso zzso Analysis zzso zzso results showed that zzso and zzso signaling were predicted to be zzso in zzso cell lines, which was partially validated by quantitative zzso or western zzso zzso The higher expression of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso proteins in zzso zzso cell lines may zzso resistance to zzso Our work may provide potential zzso signature for zzso sensitivity and some therapeutic targets for combined zzso
