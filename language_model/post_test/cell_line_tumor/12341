The molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso of human zzso zzso cells are zzso zzso treatment resulted in significant zzso of zzso cells in a zzso and zzso zzso Typical zzso changes and zzso zzso in zzso cells were observed after treatment with zzso zzso zzso for a period of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed a dramatic increase in the number of zzso and zzso phase cells after zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso is attributed to its ability to zzso the expression of zzso and zzso zzso It is observed that the expression of zzso protein is dramatically increased whereas the synthesis of zzso protein is significantly decreased when cells are treated with zzso The results presented in this paper suggested an important relationship between gene regulation and zzso zzso and indicated the possibility of developing naturally occurring zzso as novel zzso agents for better management of human zzso
