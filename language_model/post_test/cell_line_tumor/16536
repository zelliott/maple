zzso zzso factor zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso a zzso and proposed functional zzso of the widely expressed zzso is zzso expressed in multiple tumor types and has been implicated in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso We have reported previously that zzso zzso whose expression is restricted to the zzso is zzso zzso in lung zzso In this work, we establish that zzso is a novel zzso target of zzso zzso zzso With the use of a zzso zzso expressing zzso we demonstrate that relative zzso dosage is critical for zzso zzso At lower zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso island and disruption and zzso of zzso around the zzso zzso start site zzso resulting in a zzso increase in zzso expression in the zzso human lung cancer cell zzso Interestingly, increasing zzso zzso leads to a subsequent reduction in zzso expression via zzso zzso In a similar manner, increase in zzso zzso leads to eventual decrease of cell growth and colony zzso This is the first report demonstrating that different amount of zzso defines its varied effects on the expression of a target gene via zzso structure zzso
