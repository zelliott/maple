zzso is the major reason for breast zzso zzso Although there is a host of indirect evidence for a role of protein zzso C zzso zzso in primary breast cancer growth, its role in the molecular pathways leading to zzso has not been studied zzso By treating mice with zzso a novel zzso inhibitor selective for zzso we were able to determine how zzso regulates zzso of zzso cancer cells using a zzso and zzso zzso The primary tumor growth was not affected by zzso zzso However, the mortality rate was reduced and zzso in the lung decreased by more than zzso in the zzso mice relative to the zzso zzso zzso treatment reduced zzso by reducing zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment also reduced lung seeding of tumor cells and decreased cell migration, effects that were accompanied by a reduction in nuclear factor zzso B activity and cell surface levels of the zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment caused no apparent toxicity in zzso zzso zzso Rather, zzso zzso protected against liver damage and increased the number of immune cells in zzso zzso zzso zzso showed superior efficacy relative to zzso zzso in reducing zzso in zzso Together, these data show that pharmacological zzso of zzso effectively reduces zzso cancer zzso by targeting zzso and lung seeding steps in the zzso process and suggest that zzso zzso such as zzso can be used to study the zzso roles of zzso specifically and may provide a safe and effective treatment for the prevention of lung zzso of breast cancer zzso
