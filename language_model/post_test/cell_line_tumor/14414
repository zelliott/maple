zzso zzso C zzso is a family of zzso zzso that regulate many cell zzso To study the role of zzso in zzso cancer cells, we used a zzso zzso zzso to tightly control zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso induced an arrest in cell growth at zzso phase, which was itself inhibited by the zzso inhibitor zzso Furthermore, zzso of a dominant negative zzso did not induce zzso zzso These findings strongly suggested that zzso induced cell growth arrest in zzso zzso We investigated the mechanism of zzso arrest by examining zzso proteins and zzso protein zzso zzso by Western zzso After zzso of zzso with zzso zzso E expression and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso increased and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicated that the zzso of zzso induced cell growth arrest in zzso cells, through an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may therefore be an effective molecular target for novel therapy in zzso zzso
