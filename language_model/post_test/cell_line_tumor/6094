We have previously described enhanced human breast cancer cell proliferation and mouse zzso tumor growth induced by zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso The aim of the present work was to assess if zzso zzso can contribute to this zzso zzso expression was assessed by zzso and zzso cell proliferation by zzso incorporation and tumor growth by measuring with zzso All tested mouse and human zzso expressed at least two zzso zzso and zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso In zzso the zzso zzso zzso significantly enhanced tumor zzso The zzso zzso zzso reversed this effect, but when administered alone, significantly inhibited tumor zzso zzso significantly zzso cell proliferation in the zzso zzso the cancer associated zzso fraction and the zzso of both zzso in primary cultures from both tumors zzso and zzso zzso reversed zzso stimulation in every zzso However, when incubated alone, the zzso effect was observed in zzso from zzso tumors but not from zzso zzso These experiments show that zzso from tumor zzso are also influenced by zzso compounds through the zzso expressed in these zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso could eventually block in both zzso and zzso cells, the zzso effect of catecholamines released during stress, providing a potential additional treatment for breast cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso compounds should consider their action in breast cancer zzso
