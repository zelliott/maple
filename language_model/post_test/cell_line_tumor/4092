Cancer zzso cells express high amount of zzso zzso which protects cancer cells from zzso zzso We have demonstrated by zzso analysis and Western zzso and zzso zzso chain reaction, that zzso zzso and zzso tend to show the zzso expression manner in gastric cancer zzso That is attributable to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of the downstream zzso one of which is zzso zzso is not easily to occur in zzso zzso cancer zzso We have also found out that zzso expression is associated with the zzso of the zzso with the experiments using gastric cancer cell zzso This cannot be simply explained by the model of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer cells are enriched at the invasive zzso zzso tissue at the invasive area is considered to be composed of zzso cellular population; dormant cancer zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cancer zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
