The expression of two tumor zzso zzso fragile zzso zzso zzso and WW domain containing zzso zzso encompassing common zzso fragile regions, zzso at zzso and zzso at zzso is altered in many zzso zzso Since DNA sequence search shows that the zzso gene has the zzso recognition site in zzso region, which regulates cell cycle, we tested the effect of zzso zzso in tumor zzso zzso zzso expression led to an increase of zzso and zzso expression in zzso remaining tumor cells and resulted in induction of zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso site in zzso zzso region was involved in the zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso detected zzso zzso binding to the recognition site in zzso zzso zzso The data suggest that zzso zzso plays a role in suppression of zzso at least in part trough zzso regulation of zzso and relevant zzso of zzso
