To analyze three kinds of zzso zzso C virus zzso core protein expressed in human zzso zzso cell line and to recognize zzso core proteins biological function and its zzso zzso 

The zzso cell expressed three kinds of core proteins were established zzso zzso human gene chip was used for identifying the gene expression zzso on zzso zzso All genes changed by 3 or zzso folds between the zzso cells and a control cells were further zzso and zzso by using zzso analysis through zzso zzso and were zzso based on their biological zzso 

The zzso core protein caused 16 genes zzso zzso of which the immune response genes of zzso and zzso were zzso zzso or zzso folds zzso The zzso core protein had caused the immune response gene zzso and zzso gene zzso a zzso expression of zzso and zzso folds respectively, but caused the zzso genes of zzso and zzso an zzso expression of zzso and zzso folds zzso As compared with zzso zzso or zzso core zzso zzso core protein caused 111 genes expression changing and it had more obvious effects on gene zzso If we applied zzso fold change for a comparison gene zzso a few of the same gene expression profiles might be caused by these two core zzso 

The three kinds of zzso core protein should have its own expression character and be mainly shown in immune responses, signal zzso zzso zzso It should be helpful for our recognizing the zzso core protein biological function and its zzso zzso
