zzso is responsible for the regulation of zzso zzso which plays a key role in zzso zzso Here, we examined the role and regulation of zzso in response to zzso in cancer zzso We first showed that zzso plays a key role in promoting zzso zzso cell survival, and zzso resistance as its depletion by zzso attenuated zzso induction and cell viability in response to zzso We also found that the zzso activity mirrors the expression patterns of zzso and zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso breast cancer cells, suggesting that zzso has a role in regulating zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso studies using zzso zzso zzso zzso and knockout mouse embryonic zzso zzso revealed that zzso mediates the zzso induction by zzso and that the induction of zzso by zzso is, in turn, zzso through its downstream zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso protein zzso 2; zzso In agreement, in zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso can directly zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso also showed that zzso zzso at zzso zzso in its induction by zzso but also suggests that other zzso events are also zzso In addition, the zzso axis can also limit zzso zzso induction by zzso and, notably, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these findings underscore the importance of zzso signaling in the control of zzso and zzso expression as well as zzso zzso
