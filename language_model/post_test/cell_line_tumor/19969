zzso of the zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in the stress response of virtually all cell zzso Despite recent advances in large-scale zzso and zzso data zzso identification of zzso relevant molecular events downstream of nuclear hormone zzso zzso remains zzso By analyzing gene expression changes 30 zzso after zzso zzso treatment, we previously found that immediate induction of serum and zzso zzso zzso expression is required for zzso zzso zzso cell survival zzso We now report that zzso of the zzso mediates zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso expression is required for zzso zzso additional growth factor stimulation is not zzso To further explore the gene expression changes that occur downstream of zzso zzso zzso we analyzed zzso gene expression data and selected zzso genes containing core zzso binding motifs in their zzso zzso This approach revealed several previously zzso zzso target genes of zzso including zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was confirmed to be dependent on the zzso signaling zzso Moreover, zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso zzso zzso is an important mechanism contributing to zzso zzso zzso cell zzso
