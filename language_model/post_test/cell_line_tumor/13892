Although primary zzso cell cultures, usually obtained from embryonic or early zzso zzso have been used in zzso to study the neural zzso zzso system, development of cell lines with neural properties exhibiting native expression of zzso receptors is zzso This study was undertaken to investigate the expression of zzso and zzso zzso receptors in zzso that develop from zzso acid zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso were positive, by using reverse zzso chain reaction zzso for zzso (but not zzso zzso zzso differentiation increased the zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso with a zzso zzso zzso showed a strong zzso band at approximately 62 zzso in zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso produced zzso zzso of zzso (3 zzso zzso zzso production in the zzso zzso zzso at 1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso at 1 zzso zzso which could be blocked by the zzso zzso zzso zzso but not by the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso induced a sustained increase in zzso in zzso zzso that could be zzso blocked by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, the protocol used provides an in zzso model system expressing zzso zzso receptors at the level of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso which may be useful to investigate the zzso regulation, expression and function of zzso zzso zzso
