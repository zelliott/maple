zzso is the most useful treatment zzso for cancer zzso It zzso a series of signal zzso such as DNA damage response zzso signaling for repairing damaged DNA, arresting the cell cycle, and inducing cell zzso Until now, few genes have been found to be regulated by radiation, which explains the molecular mechanisms of cellular responses to zzso Although the zzso changes caused by radiation have been widely investigated, little is known about the direct evidence for the zzso control of zzso zzso Here, we examined the zzso of two zzso cell lung cancer cell lines zzso and zzso which have different zzso zzso We monitored the zzso changes of 24 zzso gene expressions via zzso zzso Based on the zzso expression levels and zzso patterns, we further classified 24 zzso genes into four zzso Then, we also addressed the protein levels of several zzso genes such as zzso zzso and zzso confirming the results of zzso zzso Together, these results indicate that the expression patterns of zzso genes are associated with zzso and with the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso which adds to the understanding of the complex biological responses to zzso
