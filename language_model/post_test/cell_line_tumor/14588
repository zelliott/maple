zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified as 1 of the zzso zzso that bind zzso zzso However, the functional significance of zzso in zzso cell cancer zzso has not been zzso We hypothesized that zzso may be zzso zzso through DNA zzso and zzso modification and function as a tumor zzso gene in zzso Using tissue zzso and real-time zzso we found that zzso was significantly zzso in kidney cancer zzso and cell lines, zzso DNA zzso sequencing of the zzso promoter region in zzso cell lines showed it to be densely zzso whereas there was few promoter zzso in normal zzso The zzso expression was restored and the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso associated with the zzso promoter region were significantly increased after treatment with zzso agent zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor zzso When zzso cells were zzso with the zzso zzso significant zzso of zzso independent colony formation and cell invasion were observed compared to zzso The zzso zzso also significantly induced zzso in zzso zzso In conclusion, this is the first report documenting that the zzso is zzso by promoter zzso and zzso zzso and functions as a tumor zzso gene by inducing zzso in zzso zzso
