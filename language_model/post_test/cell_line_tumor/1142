A screening program for zzso compounds from marine zzso led to the isolation of zzso zzso zzso A is a novel and highly zzso zzso containing an zzso zzso vinyl zzso zzso zzso system, and zzso zzso The zzso show sodium zzso activity and fish zzso zzso feeding to zzso cultures mapped out the series of zzso and zzso acid zzso and helped develop an effective cloning strategy for the zzso gene zzso The 58 zzso gene cluster is composed of 17 open reading frames that show an exact zzso with their expected zzso A novel cassette of genes appears to form a zzso carbon atom possessing the vinyl zzso zzso at its core this contains an zzso zzso zzso giving insight into the mechanism by which this functional group is zzso
