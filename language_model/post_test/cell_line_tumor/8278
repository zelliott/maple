We identified four breast cancer cell lines and one stomach cancer cell line resistant to the zzso effects of zzso zzso and examined their sensitivity to other zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of the zzso pathway, reduced the cellular viability of all five zzso cancer cell zzso zzso zzso also reduced the viability of the one zzso cell line in which it was zzso Similar results were produced in an in zzso mouse model, in which the volume of tumors derived from the zzso cell line was reduced more effectively by treatment with zzso than by treatment with zzso whereas those from a zzso cell line were reduced only by zzso zzso Overall, these results may contribute to the development of zzso treatments for patients with zzso zzso
