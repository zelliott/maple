zzso studies have shown that zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso drugs possess zzso zzso Here, we report in zzso and in zzso studies showing the zzso effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso but not the zzso parental compound zzso significantly affected viability of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso and human zzso zzso zzso and zzso tumor cell zzso zzso triggered either zzso cell death zzso zzso zzso or zzso cell death zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso hampered the viability of zzso zzso zzso NO scavenger zzso completely prevented zzso death, indicating that NO release zzso the zzso effect of the zzso zzso in zzso NO upon on the treatment was associated with intensified production of zzso oxygen species, whereas their zzso by zzso zzso resulted in partial recovery of cell zzso The zzso activity of the drug was zzso by the selective zzso of zzso protein zzso in a zzso manner and was neutralized by their specific zzso In zzso treatment with zzso significantly reduced the zzso melanoma growth in zzso zzso zzso The therapeutic effect occurred at dose zzso zzso up to 160 times lower than those needed to induce acute zzso zzso zzso In addition, a dose of zzso five times higher than that found effective in the melanoma model was well tolerated by the mice when administered for 4 consecutive zzso These data warrant additional studies to evaluate the possible translation of these findings to the clinical zzso
