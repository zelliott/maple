zzso factors are proteins that bind specifically to defined DNA sequences to promote gene zzso zzso zzso factors with small molecules to zzso the expression of certain genes has been notoriously difficult to zzso The natural product zzso is known to reduce the zzso activity of zzso a zzso factor involved in zzso and cancer zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso interacts directly with zzso protein in the human breast cancer cells zzso zzso analyses of the zzso interaction provide additional insights on the molecular mode of action of zzso In cellular experiments, we show that zzso can inhibit the binding of zzso to zzso target zzso These findings illustrate the potential zzso of zzso factors and provide a molecular basis for targeting the zzso family with small zzso
