The zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso is targeted by zzso for degradation by the zzso shortly after its zzso by zzso zzso In zzso screening identified zzso zzso as a putative inhibitor of an zzso zzso that partners with an zzso zzso implicated in zzso zzso We investigated whether zzso could modify zzso zzso of its target gene zzso zzso zzso zzso alone did not affect zzso content, or stimulate zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso with zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso and zzso degradation via its functioning as an zzso zzso At a lower concentration zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso without zzso zzso turnover or altering zzso zzso zzso Whereas zzso alone did not affect zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso was zzso and induced a zzso arrest that lasted zzso h and induced an S phase arrest that peaked 5 to 8 h zzso zzso neither affected zzso cell cycle progression nor did it alter zzso effects on the cell zzso The magnitude of zzso zzso depended upon the time elapsed between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso occupancy of the zzso promoter and zzso of zzso zzso nuclear zzso and zzso occurred when zzso cultures were exposed to zzso in late zzso and zzso S zzso zzso induction of zzso was also cell zzso in zzso zzso Similar studies with zzso cultures indicated that the cell cycle dependence of zzso induction is cell zzso
