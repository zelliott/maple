zzso delivery of zzso zzso is a promising novel option in cancer zzso We generated stable zzso of the vascular zzso zzso F3 both with zzso and zzso that specifically bind to zzso on the surface of zzso zzso zzso The aim of our study was to determine the therapeutic efficacy of zzso in comparison with that of zzso 

zzso values of zzso and zzso were determined via zzso zzso The therapeutic efficacy of both zzso was zzso by repeated treatment of mice bearing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was monitored by zzso zzso zzso effects were zzso by zzso 

zzso values of zzso and zzso were 53 zzso and 67 zzso zzso The median survival of control mice treated with zzso saline was 60 days after zzso zzso of 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with 6 zzso zzso zzso of zzso or 6 zzso zzso zzso of zzso prolonged median survival to 95 days and 97 days, zzso While F3 zzso with short-lived zzso zzso zzso 46 zzso reduced the zzso mass at early zzso up to 30 days after treatment, the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso increased at later zzso The difference in the fraction of zzso cells after treatment with zzso zzso and with zzso zzso was not zzso Though zzso analysis of kidney samples revealed acute zzso necrosis and zzso zzso in zzso of animals after treatment with zzso or zzso protein casts were negligible zzso indicating only minor damage to the zzso 

zzso with both zzso and zzso increased survival of mice with zzso zzso zzso zzso toxicity of both zzso zzso future therapeutic zzso
