zzso maps of zzso modifications have provided evidence for the zzso of zzso into zzso of distinct zzso states, which assist coordinated gene zzso The maintenance of zzso domain integrity can require the setting of zzso The zzso zzso element marks the 3' boundary of a zzso region located upstream of the chicken zzso gene zzso Here we show that zzso recruits the zzso zzso zzso to mediate zzso zzso zzso at this zzso zzso experiments show that zzso is required for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in a collapse of the active zzso modification signature at the zzso zzso boundary, where zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso are rapidly zzso A remarkably similar set of events occurs at the zzso regulatory elements of the zzso zzso which mark the zzso boundary of the same zzso zzso We find that persistent zzso at the zzso and zzso elements is required for zzso boundary zzso The loss of boundary function leads to the sequential spreading of zzso zzso and zzso over the entire 50 zzso zzso and zzso region and zzso of zzso zzso These findings show that the zzso and zzso boundary elements direct a cascade of active zzso modifications that defend the zzso and zzso gene zzso from the pervasive encroachment of an adjacent zzso zzso We propose that many gene zzso employ zzso boundaries to prevent zzso zzso
