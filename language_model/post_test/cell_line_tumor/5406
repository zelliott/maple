zzso are biological response zzso with zzso effects on zzso zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of a soluble zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso vaccination against the B cell zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso We found that repeated zzso with two zzso zzso restricted peptides derived from the tumor zzso zzso combined with oral zzso of zzso could significantly diminish zzso tumor growth, whereas zzso vaccination alone failed to control tumor zzso zzso as single agent induced only a weak but zzso growth zzso zzso To determine whether the tumor zzso effect of the combined treatment was associated with the induction of a zzso immune response we zzso zzso DC and zzso analyzed the maturation of DC and measured the frequency of zzso zzso and zzso T zzso zzso mice showed significantly increased numbers of zzso zzso and mature DC compared to zzso zzso zzso After zzso with both peptides in zzso elevated levels of zzso zzso zzso T cells were found in two of four tested mice following treatment and one of four mice showed a strong increase of zzso zzso zzso T zzso Our data reveal a beneficial effect of zzso zzso in tumor growth zzso by zzso zzso vaccination which may rely on a function of the zzso sugar as zzso zzso
