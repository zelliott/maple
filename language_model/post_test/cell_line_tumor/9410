The effects of the zzso and particle composition of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso of zzso after its intravenous zzso injection in zzso zzso zzso were evaluated for its application in cancer zzso zzso zzso whose particles had an oily core zzso oil, zzso zzso zzso or zzso and a surface layer of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso 53, zzso zzso or zzso were prepared by a zzso zzso zzso zzso data revealed that zzso 700 and zzso prolonged the retention of zzso in the blood and enhanced its zzso in zzso Among the core components zzso soybean oil yielded the highest zzso concentration in the blood and tumor and the lowest in the liver and zzso zzso with a zzso content of zzso zzso could be formulated by using zzso and soybean oil at a constant zzso ratio, and by enriching zzso in the surface layer with the particle size maintained below 100 zzso When each zzso was IV injected once or twice at a zzso zzso the zzso concentration in the tumor correlated well with the total dose of zzso and it reached a maximum of 189 zzso wet zzso This maximum zzso level was greater than the limit required for significantly suppressing tumor growth in zzso zzso
