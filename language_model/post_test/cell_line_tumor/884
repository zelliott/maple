Ewing's zzso is the second most common human bone tumor in zzso Here, we investigated the sensitivity of the Ewing tumor cell line, zzso to the zzso effect of type I zzso and type II zzso zzso and zzso We demonstrate that although zzso and zzso alone are unable to induce cell death, they act in zzso with zzso to induce zzso cell zzso The synergistic induction of zzso correlated with the synergistic induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and TRAIL protein synthesis as well as of TRAIL zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso cells zzso with combinations of zzso were shown to be zzso for zzso zzso zzso This zzso was partially inhibited by addition of zzso fusion zzso indicating that the zzso TRAIL zzso at least in part, the zzso effect displayed by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso We have shown that the presence of zzso is required to allow the sustained expression of zzso in zzso cells zzso by addition of zzso or zzso suggesting that zzso plays a role in the synergistic induction of zzso by combinations of zzso Furthermore, we have shown that zzso of zzso zzso contributes to the zzso zzso to the zzso effect of zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that zzso combinations are able to induce TRAIL gene expression and TRAIL protein synthesis and zzso in Ewing zzso zzso We believe that the observations reported here might contribute to the development of alternative new approaches to the treatment of Ewing tumors resistant to conventional zzso
