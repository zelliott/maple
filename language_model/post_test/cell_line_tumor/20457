zzso zzso was evaluated as a technique to discriminate spectral signals of cellular response at the single cell level, when cancer cells are exposed to zzso zzso an established drug of known mode of action, was tested against a zzso zzso cell line zzso along with two experimental zzso of zzso zzso The use of zzso principal component analysis zzso failed to clearly define any distinction between control and drug treated cell zzso zzso principal component linear zzso analysis zzso did have some potential to reveal signatures of cell response and repair but again failed to distinctly discriminate groups of zzso with different drug zzso zzso clear zzso discrimination was observed in zzso from average cell populations via single point zzso zzso probing several cells simultaneously with an increased zzso The zzso cell line initially appeared to be sensitive to the novel compounds, inducing a cellular response prior to zzso cell recovery which was assessed by both zzso and cell viability zzso
