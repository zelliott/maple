zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is a zzso zzso expressed on zzso cells and cells of the immune zzso Human zzso mediates zzso and migration of zzso and is implicated in inflammatory zzso zzso diseases and in many cancer zzso Additionally, zzso acts as zzso for pathogens like human zzso and zzso zzso malaria zzso A group of related zzso zzso zzso membrane protein 1 zzso zzso the zzso mediates zzso binding of zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso has been suggested to be involved in the development of cerebral zzso However, more studies identifying zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the establishment of a clinical link between zzso expression and zzso cerebral malaria are needed before the zzso zzso can be put forward as vaccine candidates and go into clinical zzso Such studies require availability of functional zzso zzso in large zzso In this study, we compared zzso zzso expressed in zzso and zzso cells with mouse myeloma zzso zzso purchased from a commercial vendor in terms of protein zzso yield, fold, ability to bind zzso and relative zzso We present a zzso zzso high-yield expression and zzso scheme for producing zzso functional zzso zzso expressed in zzso is zzso to malaria research and can also be useful in other research zzso
