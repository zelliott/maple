zzso diseases are fatal zzso neurodegenerative zzso In the zzso of the disease, the cellular prion protein zzso is required for replication of abnormal prion zzso which results in zzso of zzso Although there have been extensive studies using zzso knockout systems, the normal function of zzso remains zzso Compared with conventional zzso knockout technologies and transient naked zzso zzso systems, newly constructed durable zzso could provide a cell culture model that is closer to the disease status and easier to achieve with no zzso zzso The selective zzso of a target gene by zzso interference zzso is a powerful approach to investigate the unknown function of genes in zzso and in zzso To reduce zzso zzso a novel dual zzso zzso was zzso The zzso which targets zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso more effectively suppressed zzso expression compared with conventional single site zzso Furthermore, to investigate the cellular change following zzso zzso gene expression analysis of zzso interacting and/or zzso genes and several zzso including zzso viability and zzso were zzso The transcripts zzso and zzso zzso and zzso increase in abundance and are reported to be involved in cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso against zzso will be useful for analyzing the zzso function of zzso in zzso cell lines and may provide a potential therapeutic intervention for prion diseases in the zzso
