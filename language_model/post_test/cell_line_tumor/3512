Increased zzso and metabolism of zzso is a characteristic of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso especially zzso is a common event in human zzso To date, little is known about the role of zzso in human prostate cancer zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of zzso both in PC cell lines and clinical specimens of primary zzso 

The PC cell lines zzso zzso and zzso were assessed for zzso zzso expression by Northern zzso zzso In a total of 45 primary PC zzso radioactive zzso in zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso expression were performed on frozen zzso zzso of zzso expression was obtained by use of an image analysis zzso 

zzso expression was detected in all 3 cell zzso zzso in the more zzso cell lines zzso and zzso was even higher than in the zzso zzso cell zzso In zzso zzso in primary PC revealed zzso expression just above the detection limit in zzso zzso zzso increased zzso expression was detected in zzso to zzso zzso 

zzso is expressed in PC cell lines and primary zzso The level of expression increases with advancing grade of zzso These findings support a role for zzso in PC zzso
