Some zzso wild potato species are reportedly higher in potential zzso traits, such as zzso activity zzso and total zzso content zzso than commercial zzso therefore, they could be used as parental material in breeding for high zzso and zzso However, using wild species might result in zzso that are toxic for human consumption because of the presence of high total zzso zzso and other unknown zzso zzso wild potato zzso should be screened for zzso before their introduction into breeding zzso The objective of this study was to investigate zzso activity and zzso of zzso extracts from 15 zzso zzso zzso on human zzso colon and zzso prostate cancer cell lines in zzso Also, correlations among zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity were zzso The zzso extracts significantly inhibited proliferation of zzso and zzso cell lines and were not zzso to the cells compared to the control zzso The zzso activity exhibited by zzso extracts was not due to zzso because the amount of zzso zzso zzso released from cells incubated with the extracts was not significantly different from that released from cells incubated without extracts zzso zzso cancer cells were more responsive to zzso extract treatment than prostate cancer zzso In both zzso and zzso cells, there were no zzso significant correlations between zzso activity zzso and zzso and zzso of cell proliferation or between zzso and cell proliferation zzso Also, zzso did not exhibit significant correlations with the zzso of cancer cell zzso zzso of this study show that zzso zzso zzso probably pose no zzso effects when used as parental material in improving the nutritional value of potato zzso zzso results, along with cell proliferation data, suggest that not only the compounds measured in this study but also other zzso compounds present in the zzso acting zzso or zzso may be more responsible for the zzso effects of potato zzso extracts than higher zzso of a single or group of zzso
