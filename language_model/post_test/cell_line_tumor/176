zzso is the most common zzso zzso in zzso zzso is currently the primary zzso of treatment for this fatal zzso Although chemotherapy is very effective in terms of cell killing, severe side effects such as severe infections, zzso zzso zzso are frequently encountered due to its poor selective damage between normal and zzso cells or zzso Thus, a new therapy with highly selective killing of zzso cells which leaves the normal cells unaffected is desperately zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the targeting efficacy in zzso with a new clone of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on B lineage leukemia cell line zzso cells and its mechanisms in order to provide the evidence of target therapy on B lineage leukemia and zzso 

zzso zzso was generated by zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso via the zzso an zzso sensitive zzso zzso a zzso B cell leukemia cell line, was used as target cells, while zzso a zzso cell leukemia cell line, was taken as the negative zzso The zzso of the cells was observed under the reverted reversed light microscope and the viability was checked with either zzso blue exclusion or zzso zzso zzso flow zzso was applied to study the mechanism of cell zzso 

After 24 hours of culture, zzso showed marked target killing on zzso cells at nine different zzso from 20 zzso through 100 zzso with cell survival rates from zzso zzso zzso down to zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso which were all significantly lower than that of control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The killing effect was even more significant when the concentration was over 80 zzso The growth zzso rates of this zzso on zzso cells were zzso zzso and zzso respectively at 24, 48 and 72 hours of culture in a time dependent zzso zzso difference was observed between the cell growth curve of zzso cultured with 100 zzso of zzso and those of zzso cultured with medium zzso PBS zzso zzso or the same concentration of pure zzso zzso zzso zzso groups zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso but there was no significant difference among the three control groups zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso When zzso cells were used as target cells, the cell growth zzso of zzso cultured with zzso zzso zzso and with negative control of blank did not show any significant difference zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso V double zzso analysis with flow zzso showed that the positive rate zzso zzso zzso of early zzso on zzso cells induced by 100 zzso of zzso was significantly higher than that of negative control of blank zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso at 24 hours of zzso 

zzso zzso can significantly target the zzso cells in zzso in a time response manner and the zzso induction is involved in the course of this killing zzso
