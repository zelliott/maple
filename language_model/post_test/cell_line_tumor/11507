Despite efforts to improve zzso zzso and zzso strategies, the outcome of patients with zzso zzso is still zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is a zzso zzso that plays key roles in cell cycle control and has been associated with tumor growth and zzso Here, we aimed at testing the zzso effects of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso on eight zzso cell zzso For cell cycle analysis, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines were treated with 10, 50, or 100 zzso of zzso zzso for 24 zzso In addition, cell cultures exposed to zzso zzso 50 zzso for 24 hours were zzso with zzso from zzso source at final doses of 2, 4, and 6 zzso zzso effects were evaluated through proliferation and zzso capacity zzso Treatment with zzso zzso caused zzso arrest after 24 hours, and increased zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, our results demonstrate that zzso with this drug zzso six out of seven zzso cell lines to different doses of zzso as shown by decreased growth and zzso of zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso has a zzso effect on zzso which could improve treatment strategies for this devastating zzso
