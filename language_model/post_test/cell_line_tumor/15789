Alpha zzso zzso are known for their ability to zzso zzso organization and cell zzso by zzso zzso zzso We show here that zzso harbors a functional zzso zzso interaction zzso interacts with nuclear receptors in zzso and in zzso cells, and zzso activates zzso zzso by nuclear zzso Whereas zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in transient zzso reporter zzso zzso of zzso decreases zzso In contrast, zzso zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso domain that is required for its interaction with zzso fails to activate zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso associations of zzso and zzso with the zzso promoter are mutually zzso zzso of zzso significantly decreases the expression of zzso target genes including zzso and zzso and also affects cell proliferation of zzso breast cancer cells with or without hormone, whereas zzso of zzso exhibits opposite zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso zzso but not the zzso defective in interacting with zzso or zzso results in an increase in zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso In zzso we have identified zzso as a novel, zzso zzso that regulates zzso networks to control cell zzso
