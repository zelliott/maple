zzso is the main zzso substance for human zzso breast zzso There is evidence that proliferation is also zzso by growth factors mainly zzso by the surrounding zzso In the present in zzso study we have compared the zzso activity of three growth factors alone and in combination with zzso in human breast cancer zzso 

As a cell model the zzso human breast cancer cell line zzso was zzso The growth factors tested were basic zzso growth factor zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso and zzso M alone and in zzso combination with zzso M zzso Cell proliferation was measured after seven days incubation by the zzso 

The growth factors alone significantly zzso proliferation of zzso cells in the tested concentration zzso The increases were about zzso for zzso between 40 and zzso for zzso and between 30 and zzso for zzso The strongest zzso factor was zzso alone with values between 70 and zzso For all three growth factors an additive effect was seen in combination with zzso which was greatest for zzso 

These data indicate that zzso is the strongest zzso factor for human breast cancer zzso Therefore the zzso value of cell models using zzso as a zzso agent seems to be highly zzso However, zzso influence by growth factors should not be zzso since proliferation of pre-existing zzso cells may be accelerated by the zzso presence of zzso and growth zzso
