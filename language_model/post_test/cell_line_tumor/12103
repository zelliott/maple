To investigate whether zzso zzso in the zzso lung could be prevented by zzso zzso soluble transforming growth zzso zzso type II zzso gene zzso zzso zzso mice zzso were randomly divided into four groups consisting of a zzso control group zzso zzso radiation zzso zzso zzso zzso group and zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso mice were killed at several time points after zzso zzso with a single dose of 9 zzso and then the zzso zzso in serum and zzso zzso fluid zzso were zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso We used an zzso zzso expressing a soluble zzso type II zzso zzso which can bind to zzso and then block the zzso zzso signal zzso The zzso mice were zzso zzso injected with either 5 zzso zzso zzso units of zzso or zzso a control zzso zzso a week preceding and a week following the X-ray zzso zzso Four weeks after zzso the mice were killed and the concentration of zzso in the serum and zzso were then measured using zzso and the lung tissue specimens were examined zzso Following zzso zzso with a single dose of 9 zzso zzso zzso release in the serum reached the first peak concentration at 12 h and then zzso It reached a zzso value at 2 weeks after zzso In the zzso the zzso concentration was appreciable within the first hour and thereafter zzso It reached a zzso value at 3 days after zzso A one-time zzso injection of zzso 1 week before zzso could not completely suppress the two zzso of the zzso zzso increase, whereas an injection a week preceding and a week following zzso zzso was able to suppress those two zzso zzso The zzso was completely suppressed in the zzso mouse serum and zzso however, no statistical difference was observed in the serum and zzso between the zzso mice and the control mice at 4 weeks after zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso examination showed only mild radiation zzso in the zzso lungs of zzso mice in comparison to the zzso and zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso plays an important role in radiation zzso thus suggesting that the zzso zzso in soluble zzso type II zzso gene therapy may be a potentially feasible and effective strategy for the prevention of radiation zzso
