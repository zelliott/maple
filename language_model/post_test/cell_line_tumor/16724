In the 21st century, drug development has shifted toward larger molecules such as proteins and zzso zzso which require the use of new chemical zzso In this process, the drug delivery system plays a central role and zzso targeting using zzso has become a key technology for the development of successful new zzso We have developed a new delivery system, a zzso zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso In this new concept of packaging, zzso zzso are integrated into a zzso system according to a program designed to overcome all barriers during the course of zzso and zzso zzso In this Account, we introduce our method for delivering zzso acids or proteins to zzso sites of action such as the zzso nucleus, and zzso and for targeting selective zzso in zzso via systemic administration of the zzso First, we introduce an zzso zzso zzso as an efficient zzso delivery system, designed especially for zzso and zzso zzso Many types of cells can zzso the zzso mainly by inducing zzso and the zzso escapes from zzso via membrane fusion, which leads to efficient zzso presentation via the major zzso complex I zzso in zzso zzso In addition, the zzso activities of the zzso in dividing cells, such as zzso or zzso cells, are as high as those for zzso However, because the zzso cannot induce sufficient zzso activity in primary cultured zzso cells, which are critical regulators of the immune response, we converted the zzso into a zzso zzso zzso The zzso uses a new packaging method and delivers condensed zzso into the nucleus via fusion between the envelopes and the nuclear zzso To achieve efficient zzso activity, we also zzso the zzso of zzso acids within the zzso To zzso zzso drug delivery, we introduced the zzso Many types of materials can be packaged into this zzso zzso and then delivered to zzso via membrane fusion zzso Finally, we describe an integrated strategy for in zzso tumor delivery and zzso of zzso zzso zzso tumor delivery typically requires coating the surfaces of zzso with zzso but zzso can also limit zzso by the zzso system and reduce the efficiency of zzso zzso Here we integrate the optimum zzso and zzso trafficking of the zzso with an innovative strategy such as zzso zzso zzso and a short membrane zzso zzso Some of these strategies will soon be tested in the zzso
