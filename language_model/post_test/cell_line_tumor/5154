zzso zzso zzso cells zzso have been shown to participate in zzso responses and have been implicated in the zzso of zzso syndrome zzso Experimental evidence from animal models indicates that zzso zzso may also participate in SS zzso However, the expression and functionality of the zzso receptors alpha zzso and beta zzso in normal human zzso zzso is zzso To investigate these points, zzso zzso specimens and cultured zzso zzso lines derived from nine minor zzso zzso zzso zzso with normal zzso were zzso zzso analyses detected the zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso both in zzso zzso and in cultured zzso Such zzso expression was verified by zzso of various zzso proteins in cellular extracts of cultured zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not induce growth or zzso in cultured zzso However, similarly to other cellular systems, treatment of cultured zzso with zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibited the zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso This finding zzso the functionality of zzso expressed by zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso expresses zzso functional zzso and zzso proteins that apparently mediate zzso zzso
