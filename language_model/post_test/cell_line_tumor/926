zzso has been implicated in a number of cellular zzso including zzso regulation, DNA damage repair, cell cycle arrest, and zzso We identified zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso an upstream regulator of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso as a novel zzso protein in a zzso zzso screen and confirmed the interaction by zzso in zzso zzso zzso mapping demonstrated that zzso acids zzso are required to mediate the interaction with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the interaction in zzso and zzso failed to interact with zzso in zzso zzso zzso breast cancer zzso We demonstrate that small interfering zzso zzso of zzso zzso reduces zzso zzso activity and zzso that zzso expression of zzso activates zzso and zzso Finally, we demonstrate using complementary approaches that zzso is required for zzso zzso of zzso These data indicate that zzso is a key regulator of the zzso stress response zzso and suggest that the ability of zzso to associate with, and mediate the zzso of, zzso represents a potential mechanism through which this zzso is zzso
