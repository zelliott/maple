zzso zzso are a class of zzso zzso zzso molecules that play critical roles in the regulation of various zzso including human lung zzso Among them, zzso has been identified as a zzso regulator in several zzso but its zzso properties and correlation with the development of human lung cancer remain zzso In this study, it was determined that zzso expression is clearly zzso in human lung cancer zzso relative to normal zzso Meanwhile, the zzso of zzso in the zzso human lung cancer cell line dramatically inhibited cell zzso blocked zzso phase transition, induced zzso and inhibited cell zzso and invasion zzso In contrast, a zzso inhibitor was used to zzso zzso cells, and the zzso of zzso zzso promoted cell zzso and zzso In addition, zzso expression inhibited the expression of zzso of zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso downstream target zzso including disabled zzso 2 zzso interacting protein gene zzso and human zzso zzso factor 3 zzso which suggests that zzso is a potential target of zzso as previously zzso In conclusion, zzso plays an important role as an zzso in the molecular mechanism of human lung cancer and could potentially be used for the treatment of lung zzso
