zzso zzso continues to be investigated clinically as a PET agent both for zzso of tumor zzso and as an effective indicator of patient zzso but there are still aspects of the mechanism of action that are not fully zzso 

The retention of zzso in tumors after administration of zzso in zzso is substantially higher for tumors with a significant hypoxic zzso This zzso retention is believed to involve the reduction of zzso followed by the loss of copper to cellular copper zzso To shed light on a possible role of copper metabolism in zzso zzso we have compared zzso retention in zzso and in zzso in zzso and zzso cells or zzso after the administration of zzso or zzso 

In zzso in mice bearing zzso or zzso tumors, zzso and dynamic PET data are broadly similar for zzso and zzso zzso retention in tumors at 15 zzso is higher after injection of zzso than zzso but similar values result at 2 and 16 h for zzso zzso with zzso as measured by zzso zzso is evident for both at 16 h after administration but not at 15 zzso or 2 zzso Interestingly, at 2 h tumor retention for zzso and zzso although not zzso with zzso is reduced by similar amounts by increased tumor zzso due to inhalation of increased zzso In zzso substantially less zzso is observed for zzso although this zzso had some zzso zzso Although zzso is stable in mouse serum alone, there is rapid disappearance of intact complex from the blood in zzso and comparable amounts of serum bound activity for both zzso and zzso 

That in zzso in the zzso and zzso tumors zzso the distribution of zzso from zzso in tumors essentially mirrors that of zzso suggests that copper metabolism may also play a role in the mechanism of selectivity of zzso
