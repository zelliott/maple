zzso is localized to zzso of zzso zzso where it zzso the zzso zzso thus contributing to the production of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression leads to defects in the zzso checkpoint, zzso zzso and zzso However, the mechanism by which deregulation and/or zzso of zzso expression remains to be zzso Here, we clone and analyze a approximately zzso zzso zzso upstream of zzso and show that this zzso acts as a strong zzso zzso dysfunction of zzso is frequently observed in zzso zzso cells, and zzso of zzso protein expression is correlated with zzso zzso of the zzso promoter by zzso These results imply a relationship between zzso zzso of this zzso checkpoint gene and zzso zzso in human zzso
