zzso disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a zzso expansion near the zzso of zzso The mechanisms of zzso zzso and cellular responses are not fully zzso We have studied gene expression profiles by short zzso array using an zzso zzso cell model expressing an zzso zzso zzso with expanded zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced cell death and increased the zzso and protein levels of zzso zzso factor 3 zzso zzso zzso also significantly enhanced zzso zzso activity by a zzso reporter zzso zzso of zzso protects against zzso zzso toxicity and knocking down zzso expression reduced zzso toxicity in a stable zzso cell zzso These results indicated that zzso plays a critical role in toxicity induced by zzso zzso and may lead to a useful therapeutic zzso
