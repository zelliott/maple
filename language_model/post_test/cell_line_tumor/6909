Although the zzso factor zzso has been implicated in the regulation of cellular growth and zzso it is unknown whether zzso in zzso contribute to zzso and tumor zzso We examined the role of zzso in prostate zzso Western zzso analysis revealed markedly decreased zzso levels in three zzso prostate cancer cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso as compared to zzso prostate zzso cells or the zzso cell line, zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells did not affect the cell proliferation rate of zzso cells on plastic zzso However, it dramatically decreased zzso growth of zzso cells in soft zzso zzso zzso and the invasion capability zzso zzso of zzso cells in zzso gel zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells inhibited the zzso of zzso cells in an in zzso nude mice zzso model zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso has zzso zzso zzso with its function in tumor suppression, we found that the zzso protein is present in normal prostate zzso cells but absent in 18 of 42 zzso human prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso To further examine the functional role of zzso in zzso we generated mice with genetic deletion of zzso zzso We found that zzso mice displayed marked prostate zzso at a young age, suggesting that zzso is involved in the normal growth and differentiation of zzso Together, these studies demonstrate that zzso has zzso function and plays a role in prostate zzso
