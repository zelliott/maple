Breast cancer is one of the most common zzso tumors and the leading cause of mortality among zzso In this study, we propose a human stem cell transplantation strategy, an important method for treating various zzso as a potential breast cancer zzso To this end, we used human zzso zzso zzso stem cells zzso as a cell source for performing human stem cell zzso zzso have zzso differentiation abilities and possess high zzso zzso We transplanted zzso into female zzso nude mice bearing tumors originating from zzso breast cancer zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells at a ratio of zzso or zzso zzso cells to stem zzso inhibited breast cancer cell growth by zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso mouse model, tumor volumes were significantly decreased by zzso zzso treatment and two different ratios of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Treatment of nude mice with zzso zzso produced remarkable zzso effects without any zzso zzso weight loss, death and zzso compared to the mice that received only zzso zzso zzso progression was significantly reduced by zzso treatment compared to the zzso zzso On the other hand, breast zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso appeared to be well-maintained following treatment with zzso Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that zzso can be used as a safe and effective zzso zzso for treating breast zzso
