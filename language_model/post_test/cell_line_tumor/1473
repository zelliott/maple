A zzso block zzso composed of conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The chemical structure of this zzso and its precursors was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was used to prepare zzso zzso that were then loaded with either the zzso drug zzso or small interfering zzso zzso using a double emulsion zzso zzso zzso used to study the in zzso zzso of zzso zzso showed that these particles were not toxic in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso laser scanning zzso zzso and flow zzso analysis results demonstrated efficient zzso zzso delivery of both zzso and zzso into the zzso In zzso the targeting delivery of zzso or zzso zzso by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso mice was evaluated using a zzso imaging zzso The targeting delivery results and froze section analysis confirmed that drug or zzso is deliver to tumor more efficiently by zzso zzso than free drug or zzso The high efficiency delivery of zzso zzso mainly due to the enhancement of cellular zzso These results imply that zzso zzso have a great potential to be used as an effective carriers for zzso or zzso
