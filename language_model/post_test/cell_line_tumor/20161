zzso zzso zzso are promising new therapeutic targets for cancer because they regulate the balance between zzso zzso and zzso zzso The functions of the two SK zzso zzso and zzso are not zzso with genetic zzso of zzso having more pronounced zzso effects than removal of zzso Although several small zzso zzso of zzso have been described in the literature, detailed characterization of their molecular and cellular zzso particularly their activities against human zzso and zzso have not been zzso zzso modeling of the putative active sites of zzso and zzso suggests structural differences that might allow zzso zzso zzso we characterized several zzso compounds which revealed differential zzso effects on zzso and zzso as zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and zzso is a zzso zzso We examined the effects of the SK zzso on several zzso and zzso processes in zzso kidney zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso demonstrated the most pronounced effects on zzso and zzso zzso zzso decrease of zzso levels, zzso of zzso levels, cell cycle arrest, and zzso of zzso migration and zzso zzso also zzso the expression or zzso of several signaling zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These effects were equivalent or superior to responses to the zzso zzso Overall, these results suggest that zzso of zzso results in stronger zzso effects than does zzso of zzso or both zzso and zzso
