Recent literature suggests that some human cancer cell lines possess a calcium zzso zzso Human myeloma cell lines have demonstrated zzso cell proliferation by the zzso zzso through this zzso and zzso cell lines possess the same zzso zzso Although enhanced zzso is a very useful diagnostic tool for the treatment of zzso in the orthopedic area, incorporating the use of zzso contrast agents based on zzso raises the possibility of the stimulation of cancer cell zzso 

Human myeloma zzso zzso zzso zzso and rat zzso zzso cell lines were exposed to various zzso of common zzso contrast agent zzso zzso (5 zzso 50 zzso 500 zzso 5 zzso 50 zzso in a culture zzso The response of the cells was then assessed by measuring cell proliferation and DNA zzso 

Treatment with 5 zzso to 5 zzso zzso did not stimulate cell zzso only cells exposed to 50 zzso zzso showed suppressed proliferation zzso 

Since zzso injected zzso is diluted from 500 zzso to 1 zzso by patient blood flow at enhanced zzso zzso the results of the present study suggest that zzso has not effect on these types of cancer zzso
