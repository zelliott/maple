The zzso factor zzso is a candidate zzso in the zzso on zzso zzso that occurs in zzso to zzso of primary human breast zzso and that zzso with poor zzso We show that zzso zzso drives zzso differentiation and signaling events, promotes increased zzso capacity, zzso marker zzso zzso and zzso and zzso an adult tissue stem cell gene signature zzso in zzso By in zzso zzso we identified candidate zzso that at low zzso inhibit growth of cancer cells expressing high zzso We show that the zzso analogue zzso zzso zzso tumor growth and chemotherapy resistance and zzso signaling events zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso Our data suggest that zzso is a zzso of poor prognosis and a therapeutic target in patients with breast cancer and that zzso may be part of a personalized treatment strategy in patients zzso zzso Because zzso is amplified in numerous zzso these results have implications for other zzso 

This study finds that zzso is a poor zzso indicator and therapeutic target in patients with breast cancer and may be a strong zzso of zzso treatment efficacy in zzso Because previous clinical trials for zzso did not include zzso of treatment zzso this study provides a rationale for revisiting zzso in the clinical setting as a therapy for patients with breast cancer who zzso zzso
