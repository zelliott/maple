To investigate the effects of zzso zzso on a mouse myeloma cell line zzso and human multiple myeloma cell lines zzso and zzso and provide the basis for the use of zzso in cancer zzso 

A zzso inner salt zzso zzso was used to determine the degree of growth zzso by the drugs analyzed in this zzso Cell cycle distribution and analysis were measured by flow zzso combined with zzso zzso zzso zzso The effects on zzso were measured by zzso zzso zzso and by flow zzso combined with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was determined by Western zzso zzso In zzso zzso activity was measured using a zzso myeloma model in zzso zzso 

There was a significant reduction in cell proliferation after treatment with zzso The overall growth zzso correlated with increased zzso cell zzso zzso cell zzso was associated with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso markedly suppressed tumor growth in a zzso myeloma zzso 

zzso zzso zzso in zzso myeloma zzso cells as well as in human myeloma zzso and zzso cell zzso The sustained zzso of zzso might play a critical role in zzso zzso in the zzso cell zzso zzso demonstrates significant zzso efficacy against myeloma zzso cells in zzso Taken together, our data provide some clues for further research of the effects of zzso on human multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
