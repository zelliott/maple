zzso dissemination is a frequent zzso route for zzso of the zzso and gastrointestinal zzso zzso cells zzso by attaching to and invading through the zzso cell zzso zzso that lines the zzso zzso zzso are influenced by zzso zzso zzso a cell population that derives from different zzso zzso we investigated whether zzso through zzso transition zzso were a source of zzso during zzso zzso and whether zzso affected the zzso and invasion of zzso zzso zzso from patients with zzso dissemination revealed the presence of zzso expressing zzso markers in the proximity of zzso zzso zzso new vessel formation was observed in the zzso areas zzso zzso cells when compared with zzso zzso The use of a mouse model of zzso dissemination confirmed the zzso conversion of zzso and the increase in zzso at places of zzso zzso Treatment of zzso zzso with zzso media from zzso cell cultures resulted in zzso changes reminiscent of zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso enhanced the binding of cancer cells to zzso in a zzso zzso zzso electron zzso imaging showed that the enhanced zzso was mostly due to increased zzso interaction and not to a mere zzso zzso Invasion zzso suggested a zzso stimulation of the invasive capacity of zzso cells and zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso can derive from zzso cells during zzso zzso We suggest that zzso renders the zzso more receptive for zzso cell zzso and contributes to secondary zzso growth by promoting its zzso
