zzso association studies zzso variations in zzso and zzso as being associated with nicotine addiction zzso Multiple common zzso zzso zzso and zzso exist in zzso however, high linkage zzso between variations in zzso and zzso makes assigning zzso zzso for zzso difficult through zzso experiments zzso We investigated whether zzso or zzso promoter zzso associated previously with zzso might influence zzso expression zzso For in zzso zzso promoter zzso were zzso into a zzso reporter zzso When assessed in zzso cells, zzso expression was equivalent among zzso zzso but the combination of deletion at zzso and variation at zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso activity, possibly due to loss of an zzso and other zzso Variation within the zzso zzso at zzso and zzso also altered zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso expression imbalance zzso from the zzso or zzso zzso was assessed in zzso brain tissue from individuals zzso at coding zzso in zzso zzso or zzso zzso In most cases, equivalent zzso expression was zzso however, one individual showed zzso zzso that favored the zzso zzso and that was zzso with zzso at zzso zzso zzso upstream of the zzso zzso start zzso zzso zzso activity from these zzso promoter elements was assessed using zzso promoter zzso We observed no differences in promoter activity from the two zzso promoter zzso zzso but found that the zzso promoter region strongly zzso zzso We conclude that zzso promoter zzso may affect relative risk for zzso in some zzso zzso
