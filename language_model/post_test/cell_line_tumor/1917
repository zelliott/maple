To investigate the expression of zzso death domain protein zzso in lung zzso zzso and its effects on proliferation and zzso of lung zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was used to detect the expression of zzso in lung normal and tumor zzso The expression of zzso gene in zzso cells was measured by reverse zzso zzso chain zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso plasmids carrying zzso gene or zzso zzso zzso used for zzso zzso zzso expression and cell proliferation and zzso were determined by Western zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso 

The expression levels of zzso were higher in lung zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso than that in lung normal zzso and lung zzso zzso expressed more zzso than lung zzso cell zzso zzso The transcript zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso plasmids could increase zzso expression and cell proliferation of zzso cells, while the zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso showed significantly decreases in the zzso level and zzso It is shown that zzso zzso could inhibit zzso cell zzso and knock down of zzso could promote zzso of zzso 

The expression of zzso increases obviously in lung zzso and zzso can promote survival of lung zzso cells by zzso zzso
