zzso zzso models for zzso cancer are a complementary tool for the study of zzso in zzso They are more closely related to human cancer than are subcutaneous zzso models, since evaluation of spontaneous zzso formation is zzso In the present study, fragments of subcutaneous zzso established from 12 zzso and generally available zzso cancer cell lines were implanted in the zzso of nude mice and zzso growth and zzso events zzso The results showed considerable differences between the cell lines with respect to take rate, zzso growth and zzso zzso This resulted in variable disease progression that seemingly reflects clinically relevant zzso The most common zzso findings were zzso zzso zzso occurring at variable frequency in zzso mice with 10 out of 12 cell lines, whereas only one line gave rise to liver zzso in two of 10 zzso The study provides useful background information on the 12 zzso cancer cell lines in a clinically relevant zzso zzso zzso
