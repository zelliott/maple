Surface expression of zzso members has been previously reported on human tumor cell zzso Here we examined how the zzso mouse zzso can be expressed on the surface of two types of zzso tumor cell lines in response to zzso heat zzso Exposure to 42 degrees C for zzso led to the zzso production of zzso for both zzso zzso lung zzso and zzso melanoma zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that living zzso zzso but not zzso melanoma, transported a fraction of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of the surface expression of zzso occurred upon zzso heat shock only when zzso expression was forced to be elevated in zzso zzso zzso expressed on the zzso cell surface was detected by the zzso zzso that recognized the zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso but not by another zzso with the zzso of zzso zzso When we analyzed the binding of zzso full-length zzso to mouse zzso significant binding was observed for innate immune cells such as zzso zzso or zzso The zzso zzso obtained by zzso of the zzso zzso region of zzso exhibited more robust binding to these innate immune cells in a similar fashion, however, further deletion offered less binding to those zzso Two zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso domain were found to extensively bind to zzso zzso Taken together with these results, it thus follows that the sentinels in an innate immune system, zzso zzso cells and zzso cells, can be involved in the surveillance of functionally zzso cells through the recognition of a specific zzso structure of zzso as a danger signal in living zzso
