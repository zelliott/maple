zzso of the Ewing family are characterized by zzso zzso that yield zzso zzso factors, such as zzso which regulate the expression of specific genes that contribute to the zzso zzso In the present study, we show that zzso zzso is a new target of the zzso zzso and assess its functional role in Ewing tumor zzso 

zzso zzso targets were identified using a combination of cell systems with zzso zzso zzso Ewing tumors and cell lines, zzso and zzso interference with zzso small hairpin zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso in zzso and zzso Ewing cell lines to assess the role of zzso in cell proliferation and tumor zzso 

zzso analysis revealed that zzso was zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso was zzso in Ewing tumors as compared with other pediatric zzso such as zzso and zzso with levels close to those detected in normal zzso expressing the highest levels of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso in zzso and zzso Ewing cells using two different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and diminished the levels of zzso zzso showing that zzso is a zzso specific target gene in Ewing zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso successfully zzso zzso zzso reduced the levels of zzso zzso in Ewing cell lines, and inhibited cell growth and proliferation in zzso and in zzso Finally, we show that Ewing cell lines and tumors express zzso receptors and that the growth zzso produced by zzso zzso can be rescued by zzso the cells with medium containing zzso 

Our data support the hypothesis that zzso acts as an zzso growth factor stimulating the proliferation of Ewing cells and suggest that therapies targeting zzso could be promising in the treatment of Ewing zzso
