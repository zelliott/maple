zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown in several zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso have been reported to regulate zzso in several in zzso models, but this regulation has never been examined in tumors from zzso Because of the established importance of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cell lung cancer zzso we investigated the relationship between these zzso and zzso in this cancer zzso The significance of zzso expression was further examined by testing for correlation with other clinical zzso 

zzso expression was analyzed by zzso in tissue zzso format using surgically zzso zzso specimens zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso status was determined for most zzso The correlation between zzso expression and zzso or zzso zzso status was zzso along with several zzso variables of the zzso The effects of increasing zzso and zzso activity on zzso expression and activity were examined in two cell zzso 

zzso expression was detected in zzso of tumor zzso zzso of zzso was positively correlated with activated zzso but not with zzso zzso zzso expression was increased in patients harboring zzso zzso zzso expression was positively correlated with a history of smoking, and high zzso scores predicted poorer zzso and overall zzso 

zzso expression in zzso is associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso smoking history, and poor zzso zzso expression is zzso in the context of zzso or zzso zzso The potential of zzso as a therapeutic target for zzso should be further zzso
