To investigate the potential value of targeting zzso growth zzso zzso zzso in breast cancer, we examined the effects of zzso a selective zzso inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso in a panel of 16 breast cancer cell zzso All cell lines expressed zzso but zzso expressed much higher levels of insulin zzso zzso zzso than the zzso zzso was more potent at zzso growth of zzso cells as compared to the others zzso 1 zzso zzso approximately 7 zzso Comparing zzso to zzso cells, which express zzso at a level identical to zzso but have less than zzso the amount of zzso zzso caused zzso arrest at the zzso boundary, reduced in zzso cell migration, and enhanced the zzso effects of zzso and zzso in zzso but not in zzso While zzso decreased the zzso of zzso in both cell lines, it inhibited zzso of zzso and disrupted the zzso complex only in zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso may be an effective therapeutic strategy for breast zzso that zzso zzso and zzso at high zzso
