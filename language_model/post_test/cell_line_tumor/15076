zzso nut chewing is associated with oral cavity cancer in zzso zzso is an oral zzso cell line that was established from cells collected from a long-term zzso nut zzso who does not zzso After we found that zzso zzso is induced in zzso cells, we used this cell line to examine the biological zzso of this zzso in response to exposure to zzso zzso 

A combined zzso zzso real-time zzso and zzso zzso zzso was used to examine the expression of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The roles of zzso and zzso were evaluated with specific zzso zzso zzso that were designed and used to inhibit their zzso zzso of the zzso protein was evaluated by Western zzso The zzso zzso and zzso V zzso were used to evaluate cell survival and zzso zzso zzso in which zzso was zzso knocked down were used to create zzso zzso to evaluate in zzso the role of zzso 

A radiation dose of zzso significantly increased zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression enhanced the zzso of the zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells and, by using a tumor zzso model, it was found that zzso plays a critical role in increasing the zzso of zzso cells in zzso and in zzso 

zzso is induced in zzso zzso cells and it zzso zzso protein zzso contributing to the zzso of zzso zzso
