zzso are the most common adult primary brain tumors, and the most zzso form, zzso zzso is invariably zzso The zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso is altered in most zzso zzso zzso an important negative regulator of the zzso pathway, is also commonly zzso in zzso leading to zzso zzso of zzso One ultimate consequence is zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso factors that regulate genes involved in zzso cell cycle arrest, zzso zzso DNA repair, stress, and zzso We tested the ability of a zzso zzso factor that is not subject to zzso zzso to overcome zzso zzso signaling in two zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso gene transfer of the zzso zzso successfully restored cell cycle arrest and induced cell death in zzso and prolonged survival in zzso in zzso models of human zzso zzso survival at 1 year of animals bearing zzso zzso However, zzso were much more resistant than zzso to zzso zzso death, showing evidence of increased nuclear export and zzso zzso of zzso at zzso A zzso zzso 2 inhibitor decreased zzso of zzso and rendered zzso cells significantly more susceptible to zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that targeting zzso which is at the convergence point of several growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso can effectively induce zzso cell death and inhibit tumor zzso They also highlight the importance of zzso zzso events in the nuclear export of zzso
