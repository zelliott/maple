zzso zzso are the most common and lethal zzso tumors, and differentiation therapy shows great potential to be a promising candidate for their zzso Here, we have elaborated that a zzso zzso zzso zzso cell growth via cell cycle arrest in the zzso phase and zzso cell differentiation characteristic with zzso processes and restoration of zzso zzso In mechanisms, we verified that zzso significantly diminishes the zzso and protein level of a key cell cycle regulator zzso zzso and maintenance of low zzso D1 expression level was required for zzso proliferation zzso and differentiation by gain and loss of function zzso In addition, that zzso zzso the zzso D1 by zzso zzso mechanisms was dependent on zzso zzso at zzso The zzso activity of zzso and related molecular mechanisms imply that zzso can be developed into a candidate for the future in differentiation therapy of zzso and zzso D1 is a promising target for zzso zzso
