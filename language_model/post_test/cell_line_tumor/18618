zzso zzso a positive regulator of the cell cycle, controls the transition of cells from zzso to S zzso zzso of the zzso checkpoint contributes to uncontrolled cell division, a hallmark of zzso We have reported previously that zzso E is zzso in breast cancer and such zzso is usually accompanied by the appearance of low molecular weight zzso of zzso E zzso which are not present in normal zzso Furthermore, we have shown that the expression of zzso E low molecular weight zzso can be used as a reliable zzso marker for breast cancer to predict patient zzso In this study we examined the role of zzso E in directly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For this purpose, a series of zzso deleted forms of zzso E corresponding to the low molecular weight forms detected only in cancer cells were translated in zzso and mixed with cell zzso These zzso zzso deleted forms of zzso E are able to activate zzso zzso of zzso E into both normal and tumor cell extracts was shown to increase the levels of zzso activity, along with an increase in the amount of zzso zzso The increase in zzso activity was because of zzso E binding to zzso zzso in complex with zzso zzso zzso zzso A, or zzso zzso The increase in zzso zzso was through a zzso involving zzso zzso but addition of zzso E to an extract containing zzso zzso can still lead to increase in zzso zzso Our data suggest that the ability of high levels of full-length and low molecular weight forms of zzso E to activate zzso may be one mechanism that leads to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso complexes leading to zzso deregulation and tumor zzso
