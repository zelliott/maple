zzso gene has been characterized as an zzso zzso One zzso site was previously identified to be indispensable for zzso zzso zzso zzso within zzso regulatory region to zzso zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso zzso zzso has higher zzso than that of region A in zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses of region B showed that multiple zzso are involved in the zzso response and one zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso is essential for zzso maximum zzso zzso from the zzso zzso containing zzso revealed that zzso is required for the zzso zzso activity and zzso of both regions A and zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso of zzso in zzso cells not only decreased the zzso expression of zzso but markedly impaired its zzso by zzso zzso from gel mobility shift zzso exhibited the direct binding of zzso protein to the zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso which was enhanced by the zzso zzso Moreover, the functional interaction of zzso and zzso proteins in the presence of zzso at the zzso sites in region B was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso zzso In general, these results demonstrate that zzso sites in the zzso promoter of zzso gene are sufficient for zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso containing only one zzso site is essential for the zzso induction in zzso zzso We also provide a model for zzso regulation of genes by zzso through zzso zzso
