Full exploitation of zzso data requires hidden information that cannot be extracted using current analysis zzso We present a new approach, hidden variable dynamic modeling zzso which derives the hidden profile of a zzso factor from time series zzso data, and generates a ranked list of predicted zzso We applied zzso to the zzso network, zzso predictions zzso using small interfering zzso zzso can be applied in many systems biology contexts to predict regulation of gene activity zzso
