zzso is among the most aggressive and treatment resistant of all human zzso Conventional therapeutic approaches are unsuccessful because of diffuse zzso invasion of zzso tumor cells into normal brain zzso Stem zzso therapies provide a promising approach for the treatment of zzso zzso because of their migratory ability to invasive tumor zzso Our therapeutic strategy was to use human bone zzso zzso zzso cells zzso as a cellular vehicle for the targeted delivery and local production of the zzso agent tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso tumor zzso zzso were zzso with a zzso expressing zzso TRAIL zzso and zzso (red fluorescent zzso Our results clearly demonstrate the retention of tumor zzso ability of zzso zzso cells by in zzso and in zzso migration zzso In zzso zzso confirmed the zzso release, and biological activity of zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso For the in zzso assessment of therapeutic zzso zzso were injected zzso to an established zzso zzso tumor in a mouse zzso zzso zzso engineered zzso zzso cells were effective in zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor growth zzso in zzso and resulted in significantly longer animal zzso zzso studies demonstrated zzso eight fold greater tumor cell zzso in the zzso zzso group than in zzso Our study demonstrates the therapeutic efficacy of zzso zzso cells and confirms that zzso can serve as a powerful zzso delivery vehicle for the zzso release of therapeutic zzso
