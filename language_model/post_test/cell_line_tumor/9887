In the present study, we have evaluated a zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso as a molecular targeting agent for zzso zzso capture therapy zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso rat zzso designated zzso zzso was chemically linked to a heavily zzso zzso zzso zzso by means of the zzso zzso zzso zzso studies were carried out at 6 h and 24 h following zzso zzso injection or zzso zzso zzso enhanced delivery zzso of zzso or zzso zzso (40 zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso bearing zzso At 24 zzso there was zzso more zzso in zzso tumors following zzso compared to zzso injection, and a doubling of the tumor zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a zzso increase in the volume of distribution within the infused cerebral zzso and a zzso increase in tumor zzso of zzso compared with zzso zzso Based on these favorable zzso data, zzso was carried out at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology nuclear reactor 14 days following zzso tumor zzso and 24 zzso after zzso of zzso These animals had a zzso of zzso zzso zzso days compared to zzso zzso zzso days following zzso zzso zzso that received zzso by zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso which has been used in both experimental and clinical studies, had a zzso of zzso zzso zzso days compared to zzso zzso zzso days for zzso zzso alone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso days for zzso controls and zzso zzso zzso days for zzso controls zzso P zzso zzso These data have demonstrated that the efficacy of zzso was significantly increased zzso zzso zzso following zzso zzso of zzso compared to zzso injection, and that the survival data were equivalent to those previously reported by us using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
