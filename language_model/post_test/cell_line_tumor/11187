Here, we report a natural chemical zzso which exhibits zzso potential with its zzso zzso zzso zzso effectively inhibited proliferation of several zzso cell lines, including melanoma zzso harboring zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed zzso induced zzso cell cycle arrest in zzso cells zzso zzso in zzso cells induced by zzso was identified by Terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso zzso study suggested that zzso zzso both zzso level and protein expression level of zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso ten zzso leading to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso activated zzso and zzso which contributed to zzso cell cycle and zzso Besides, zzso enhanced the zzso zzso effects to inhibit the cell proliferation with zzso zzso zzso In zzso our findings suggest zzso is a promising zzso drug candidate with its possible zzso zzso mechanisms for treating cancer diseases, such as zzso
