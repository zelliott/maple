The aim of the research was to evaluate a heavy metal, zzso zzso which was used to produce zzso in human breast cancer cell line zzso Moreover, we analyzed both zzso and zzso zzso induced by the zzso drug, zzso zzso after exposure to different zzso of zzso Also, we compared the effects of these compounds on zzso and zzso zzso zzso Under zzso zzso control cells looked zzso with zzso In cells already treated with small zzso of zzso after brief times of zzso we observed an intense zzso activity with larger, zzso and zzso zzso characterized by thin and numerous zzso zzso zzso cells showed zzso signs with presence of zzso zzso in the cell membrane and evident zzso of zzso and cell zzso The addition of zzso zzso zzso to the cells treated with zzso (5 zzso zzso did not induce significant zzso changes in comparison with cells treated only with zzso In zzso cells zzso with zzso aspect and regular zzso indicated the active zzso zzso In cells treated only with zzso we observed zzso in zzso distribution, while zzso zzso out throughout the zzso With the association of zzso we observed less zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although the mechanism remains unknown at present, our findings suggest that zzso prevents the zzso effect of zzso on breast cancer zzso These preliminary results could have an important clinical application in patients with breast zzso
