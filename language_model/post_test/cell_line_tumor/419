zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that controls cellular proliferation and survival in response to zzso zzso Here, we show that the human zzso factor zzso is a new target of zzso The two proteins interact in zzso zzso and associate in zzso and zzso zzso several zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso causes the degradation of zzso whereas zzso a zzso zzso of zzso has no zzso The chemical zzso of zzso also decreases the amount of zzso in zzso zzso the zzso of zzso by drugs or by zzso interference causes a large increase in zzso zzso This negative regulation of zzso by zzso occurs under normal conditions of cell zzso In addition, the degradation is increased by DNA zzso These findings have two zzso First, we have recently shown that zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso the zzso of zzso by zzso is zzso stimulation of the zzso zzso and simultaneous repression of the inhibitor zzso Second, zzso is also known to bind zzso DNA and repress zzso zzso zzso our findings raise the possibility that zzso might influence the zzso regulation of gene expression at zzso that remain to be zzso
