zzso zzso and relationships between genes have the potential to provide information for modeling effects of zzso gene expression on complex zzso For example, researchers may wish to incorporate the prior belief that zzso genes zzso with many zzso are more likely to influence the zzso In this paper, we propose and compare six zzso zzso prior models to incorporate zzso zzso information into association zzso Including prior information regarding the relationships among genes in a zzso was effective in somewhat improving detection rates for genes associated with complex zzso Through an extensive set of simulations, we found that when hub zzso effects are expected, the diagonal degree model is zzso when spoke zzso effects are expected, the spatial power model is zzso When there is no prior knowledge about the location of the effect genes in the zzso zzso hub versus spoke zzso it is worthwhile to apply multiple models, as the model with the best zzso is not always the one with the best detection zzso We also applied the models to zzso studies for the drugs zzso and zzso and found that the diagonal degree model identified an association between zzso response and expression of the gene zzso which was not zzso using the model including no zzso zzso These results demonstrate the value of incorporating zzso information into association zzso
