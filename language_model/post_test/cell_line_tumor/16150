zzso has become one of the most effective and widely used zzso agents over the past zzso Although it has shown promise to selectively zzso regulatory T zzso cells in our previous study, the underlying molecular mechanism remains to be further zzso The present study focused on the effect of zzso on zzso cells in zzso Lewis tumor model and explored the possible molecular pathways involved in this zzso We found that zzso significantly decreased the percentage of zzso cells in zzso cells and impaired their zzso functions, but zzso T zzso cells remained zzso Compared with zzso cells, zzso cells exhibited a high sensitivity to zzso zzso in zzso Interestingly, though zzso has been characterized as a zzso zzso zzso was not involved in the selective function of zzso zzso cells exposed to zzso displayed zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso eliminated the difference between zzso and zzso cells responding to zzso These results suggest that zzso rather than zzso contributes to the distinctive effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso we here identify a molecular zzso through which zzso selectively zzso zzso zzso
