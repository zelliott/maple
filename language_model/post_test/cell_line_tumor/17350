zzso zzso factors, nuclear zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been considered as the regulators of zzso genes such as zzso Since oxygen zzso are considered as an important regulator in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso gastric zzso and zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso may be regulated by zzso and/or zzso zzso the upstream zzso for zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso cascade regulate zzso zzso The present study aims to investigate whether zzso zzso in a Korean isolate zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso which is regulated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso in gastric zzso zzso cells, and whether these zzso regulations of zzso are inhibited by zzso with zzso genes for Ras zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or treatment with zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso or zzso for zzso zzso In addition, zzso factors of zzso were characterized by zzso analysis for the isolated zzso As a result, zzso is identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a zzso expression of zzso and protein for zzso and zzso via mediation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso genes for zzso zzso and zzso and treatment with zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso of zzso factors zzso zzso and expression of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso In conclusion, Ras and zzso cascade may act as the upstream signaling for the zzso of zzso and zzso which induce zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting of the zzso of zzso and zzso may be effective for the prevention or treatment of gastric inflammation associated with zzso zzso zzso
