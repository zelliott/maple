Cell detachment from zzso zzso is closely related to induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to have zzso effect and to protect zzso zzso We investigated whether zzso reduced zzso zzso and cell detachment in zzso zzso zzso prevented cell death by zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity zzso showed that the zzso cell death was caused by zzso increasing zzso level of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso reduced increase of these zzso and zzso zzso Western zzso analysis and zzso showed that zzso increased cell zzso proteins including zzso zzso zzso calcium signal zzso 1 zzso and protein zzso zzso 2 zzso decreased by zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, and zzso contributed to the zzso cell survival by attenuating the zzso
