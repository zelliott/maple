zzso a tumor zzso zzso zzso cancer migration, invasion, and zzso in zzso and in zzso The zzso effects of zzso depend in part on its ability to enhance cell zzso to zzso zzso Although the molecular mechanism of zzso action is still zzso its functional domain is believed to be located at the zzso center loop zzso We have zzso the role of zzso zzso on zzso migration, and invasion by zzso the highly invasive human breast zzso zzso cell line with zzso containing zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso in which zzso zzso is replaced by zzso zzso and vice versa zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso or zzso zzso expression zzso zzso significant increase in zzso to zzso and reduction in in zzso migration and invasion through zzso compared with mock zzso or cells zzso with zzso or zzso zzso analysis of zzso or zzso zzso cells revealed reduction in contents of proteins known to promote cancer zzso and those of zzso pathway, while those with zzso properties were zzso Furthermore, zzso cells containing zzso or zzso zzso have significantly higher levels of zzso and zzso zzso but reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso These results clearly demonstrate that the zzso properties of zzso reside in its zzso zzso
