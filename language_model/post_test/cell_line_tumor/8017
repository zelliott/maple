zzso control a wide array of biological processes including cell zzso zzso and zzso whose zzso is a hallmark of zzso zzso zzso is zzso in many zzso including zzso and contributes to tumor resistance to zzso We investigated whether zzso zzso zzso to the zzso agent zzso in zzso cells and sought to identify the candidate target genes for zzso by gene expression zzso Here we report that zzso was involved in zzso zzso to zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso by specific zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso led to enhanced zzso of zzso against zzso zzso zzso We further identified and validated zzso whose product is an inhibitor of zzso zzso as a direct target gene of zzso Our findings suggest that zzso represents a promising target for therapeutic manipulation to increase the efficacy of zzso agents in treating glioblastoma, a highly lethal type of zzso
