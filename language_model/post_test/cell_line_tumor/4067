zzso with sphere forming capacity, zzso cells, are present in the zzso zzso of patients with zzso zzso cancer zzso and represent a significant impediment to zzso treatment due to their putative role in zzso zzso and chemotherapy zzso The exact mechanisms that zzso zzso zzso and drug resistance are not zzso zzso the biology of sphere forming cells may contribute to the identification of novel therapeutic opportunities for zzso zzso Here we generated zzso cells from human zzso cancer cell lines and primary zzso zzso zzso of as few as 2000 zzso zzso cells into zzso mice allowed full zzso of the original zzso whereas zzso parent tumor cells remained zzso The zzso cells were found to be enriched for cells with cancer stem zzso characteristics such as zzso of stem cell zzso zzso high zzso and differentiation potential, and high zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso cells were more aggressive in growth, migration, invasion, scratch recovery, zzso survival, zzso growth, and more resistant to chemotherapy in zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso cells route zzso predominantly to zzso zzso and zzso cycle to the detriment of zzso zzso for anabolic zzso These zzso properties of sphere forming cells appear to zzso increased resistance to zzso and contribute to more aggressive tumor zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso cells with cancer stem zzso characteristics contributed to tumor generation, progression and chemotherapy zzso This study provides insight into the relationship between tumor dissemination and zzso attributes of human cancer stem cells and has clinical implications for cancer zzso
