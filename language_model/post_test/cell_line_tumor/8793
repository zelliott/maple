zzso zzso 1 zzso has been implicated in sporadic Alzheimer's disease zzso by a number of zzso wide association studies zzso in a variety of zzso Here we measured zzso in frontal zzso samples from 24 sporadic zzso and 24 zzso zzso brains and correlated the expression of this protein with markers of zzso zzso was reduced by zzso zzso in sporadic zzso compared to zzso controls, but zzso in sporadic zzso did not correlate with soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plaque load zzso zzso or zzso load zzso zzso In contrast to our findings in sporadic zzso zzso was unchanged in the zzso from 6 cases of familial zzso compared to 6 zzso controls zzso zzso declined with age in a cohort of zzso control cases between 25 and 88 years but the correlation was not significant zzso zzso Although zzso is known to have a role in zzso and the processing of the zzso precursor protein zzso to form zzso zzso peptides is dependent on zzso zzso of zzso by targeted zzso or the zzso of zzso in a human zzso cell line zzso had no effect on zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso in zzso is involved in the zzso of zzso but not familial zzso and is not a consequence of zzso zzso or the zzso process, a finding in keeping with the numerous zzso that zzso zzso in sporadic zzso However, the mechanism of its contribution remains to be zzso
