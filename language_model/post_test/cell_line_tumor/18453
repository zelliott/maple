zzso have been implicated in many cell functions, even though in most cases it is still unclear whether these functions may actually be zzso by other proteins that are zzso affected by zzso zzso zzso systems provide useful models in which to tackle this central zzso zzso pancreatic zzso and zzso lines are connected by gap junction channels made of zzso Using stable zzso of an zzso zzso zzso we have previously obtained clones of zzso cells that featured a markedly reduced expression of zzso and impaired insulin zzso Here, we first show that this change also resulted in loss of zzso and zzso zzso thus preventing the attribution of the zzso defects to a specific type of membrane zzso To investigate this question, we have now restored the expression of either zzso or zzso in the zzso zzso zzso We show that a zzso zzso efficiently restored zzso expression in zzso cells and allowed for expression of variable levels of this zzso We further document that adequate but not excessive levels of zzso allowed for recover of normal insulin zzso in response to various zzso Finally, we demonstrate that restoration of normal zzso expression was not able to achieve the same zzso zzso The data demonstrate that zzso but not zzso is necessary to control specific steps of zzso zzso
