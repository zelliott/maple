The zzso zzso zzso C virus zzso zzso zzso has only one internal zzso entry site zzso for translation to a single zzso In search of zzso zzso zzso agents, two zzso zzso were designed to cleave the zzso in zzso and zzso dependent zzso zzso zzso regions to prevent translation and replication of zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso specific zzso zzso and zzso specific zzso zzso was carried out using zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso transcripts of core and zzso zzso zzso of core and zzso zzso by zzso zzso in zzso cells was assessed by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso using zzso from cells zzso with cloned core or zzso gene and its respective zzso zzso of core or zzso protein expression due to zzso zzso by zzso in zzso cells was determined by Western zzso analysis and zzso intensity of zzso expressed zzso Reduction of zzso protein activity in zzso zzso cells was determined by zzso zzso 

The designed zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and their respective in zzso generated zzso Both zzso and protein expressions of core or zzso from their cloned genes reduced substantially when zzso with respective zzso Reduction of zzso expression by zzso was accompanied with its reduced zzso zzso Increased zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso and reduction of zzso activity were observed on increasing zzso zzso 

Core and zzso targeted zzso can be used in controlling the replication of zzso zzso
