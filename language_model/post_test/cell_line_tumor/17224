Cell division cycle 25A zzso was shown to zzso both with nuclear and zzso zzso Recently, we have demonstrated that zzso zzso promoted the survival of rat 423 cells through indirect zzso of zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso fusion zzso which can be shuttled from the zzso into the nucleus, the present investigation zzso that the zzso effect of zzso was restricted to its zzso zzso in rat 423 zzso In contrast, nuclear zzso zzso caused zzso and nuclear retention of the zzso zzso factor zzso in zzso 1 zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso This resulted in the increased zzso expression of the zzso targets zzso zzso and zzso and promoted zzso Thus, the zzso zzso which was found to be frequently zzso in certain human zzso can increase or decrease the zzso to zzso depending on the zzso zzso zzso
