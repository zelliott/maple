Analysis of zzso gene sequence zzso has been shown to be an effective and relatively inexpensive method for zzso zzso zzso zzso allowing the division of the population of this species into two deeply separate zzso This zzso method as well as zzso zzso were applied here for the differentiation of 49 zzso of food and clinical zzso zzso between these two typing approaches was zzso Both methods divided the zzso into two zzso designated I zzso zzso and II (16 zzso All the 33 lineage I zzso were assigned to the same, or closely zzso six clusters by both typing zzso For the lineage II zzso zzso zzso was found to be more zzso The zzso were characterized by cell invasion zzso All highly invasive zzso were assigned to lineage I, which constituted a zzso group also containing zzso zzso zzso zzso were not found in the genetically determined lineage zzso A particular zzso zzso designated zzso contained all the zzso showing the lowest zzso A common trait of the zzso belonging to this cluster was the presence of a zzso of the deduced zzso sequence instead of the zzso present in the remaining zzso Thirteen human zzso were classified to lineage I and five to lineage zzso A zzso method can therefore differentiate zzso zzso zzso in accordance with the current zzso model of the evolution of this zzso
