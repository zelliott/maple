zzso zzso zzso is the most common primary brain cancer in adults and there are few effective zzso zzso contain cells with molecular and cellular characteristics of neural stem cells that drive zzso zzso Here we compare responses of human zzso neural stem zzso cells and genetically normal neural stem zzso cells to a panel of 160 small zzso zzso zzso We used zzso imaging and high content image analysis tools and identified zzso zzso as an agent that zzso zzso arrest at zzso in zzso cells but not zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso profiling suggested that zzso responses are triggered by suppression of the active zzso form of zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso defects and arrest at zzso We found that potent and specific zzso zzso already in clinical development zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and were selective against zzso zzso Using a zzso brain zzso cell zzso barrier model we also observed that these compounds exhibited greater zzso barrier zzso in zzso than zzso Our analysis of mouse zzso zzso cells zzso or zzso as well as the acute genetic deletion of zzso from a conditional zzso zzso zzso cell line, suggests that the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso zzso or zzso may be explained by the lack of a zzso zzso zzso Together these data indicate that zzso stem cells are acutely susceptible to zzso disruption by zzso zzso and that such agents may have immediate therapeutic zzso
