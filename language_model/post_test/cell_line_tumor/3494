A humanized zzso zzso against zzso zzso protein zzso was generated from the mouse zzso zzso raised against the zzso corresponding to the zzso 34 zzso acids of the human zzso zzso The humanized zzso zzso with the zzso with a zzso value of zzso zzso zzso M, and the zzso resides between the zzso acids 20 and 30 of the zzso zzso significantly increased the zzso zzso levels in the rat zzso cells that expressed zzso and the 5 zzso or higher zzso of the humanized zzso almost completely blocked the zzso zzso production even in the presence of 2 zzso zzso demonstrating its ability to fully neutralize zzso zzso There was no significant difference in the potency of the zzso zzso or the humanized zzso to suppress the zzso increase in the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, at the same doses, the administration of the zzso or the humanized zzso was equally effective in reducing the blood zzso calcium levels of zzso mice bearing the zzso human pancreatic cancer zzso or the zzso human lung cancer zzso that zzso zzso Thus, humanized zzso may be useful for the treatment of the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso
