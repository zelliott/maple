Investigation of a terminally modified zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a novel drug for pancreatic zzso zzso therapy in zzso and in zzso 

The impact of zzso modifications at the zzso end of zzso zzso on cellular zzso was analyzed in zzso using proliferation zzso zzso cell sorting analysis, and zzso laser scanning zzso The in zzso effects of zzso on the growth of zzso zzso human pancreatic zzso zzso cells zzso were studied in zzso beige zzso Distribution was examined in zzso and in zzso using zzso zzso 

zzso modified zzso showed excellent cellular zzso without using zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso were reached in zzso within 3 hours after zzso injection, even in zzso zzso At this time, zzso zzso was found in solid tumor zzso We observed a significant zzso of tumor growth zzso in zzso at low doses of zzso whereas at high doses, 2 of 9 animals had no zzso tumors at zzso When zzso was injected on the day of tumor cell zzso the growth zzso of solid tumors was significantly stronger compared with that with delayed zzso 

zzso modified zzso might be of therapeutic value in pancreatic zzso zzso particularly as zzso therapy after pancreatic tumor zzso
