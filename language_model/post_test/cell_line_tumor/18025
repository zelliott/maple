zzso growth zzso zzso is a potent growth inhibitor in a wide range of cell zzso A zzso of zzso signaling known as Mothers against zzso zzso 4 zzso is a known tumor zzso found on zzso zzso and is typically zzso by deletion or zzso in pancreatic and zzso zzso The purpose of the article is to investigate zzso zzso gene copy number and zzso status in advanced cases of prostate zzso 

We have employed zzso zzso zzso zzso to identify zzso sites within the zzso promoter and combined this with quantitative real-time zzso to look for zzso between zzso status and zzso expression and to examine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso artificial zzso zzso zzso zzso has been used to look for zzso zzso and deletions which may also contribute to expression zzso 

We fail to find evidence of zzso deletions or zzso affecting the zzso locus on zzso 18 but show a correlation between promoter zzso and the loss of zzso expression in the same zzso We confirm that the zzso locus on the X zzso is amplified in zzso of the advanced clinical samples and that this zzso with increased transcript levels as previously reported by other zzso 

This indicates that zzso changes affect the expression of the zzso protein in prostate cancer and points to zzso of the promoter as a novel marker of and contributor to the disease zzso further zzso
