Comparative expressed sequence zzso zzso to zzso is a recently introduced technique that identifies zzso regions corresponding to a differential gene zzso This technique is analogous to comparative zzso zzso zzso that detects zzso zzso We applied zzso for the study of zzso cell leukemia zzso a disorder with a largely unknown expression zzso Twelve zzso cases with zzso involvement were investigated by zzso and zzso While the latter analysis identified only a few zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a consistent expression profile in all zzso zzso In addition, pairing normal zzso with normal zzso zzso a zzso zzso was established by zzso This signature most likely reflects the expression profile of zzso zzso such as the zzso lining cells from the red pulp and the marginal zone B cells from the white zzso zzso of the zzso signature was found in the zzso expression profile, suggesting that zzso may originate from a particular zzso subset present in these zzso zzso Besides pairing zzso with normal zzso zzso and zzso we identified an zzso zzso zzso several zzso regions with altered zzso The most significantly zzso regions include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso were the most significantly zzso These regions possibly harbor genes related to the biology and the zzso of zzso Their identification warrants further molecular zzso
