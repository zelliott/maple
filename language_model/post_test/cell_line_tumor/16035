Recent studies demonstrated the importance of zzso in prostate cancer zzso upon zzso In this study, we determined the role of zzso in the therapeutic resistance to radiation and zzso 

zzso was either zzso or zzso knocked down in zzso prostate cancer zzso The sensitivity of zzso zzso cells toward radiation and zzso agents were zzso Additionally, the effects of zzso zzso on prostate cancer cell zzso zzso and functional zzso were zzso 

Both transient and stable zzso of zzso resulted in increased zzso and increased sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso also increased prostate cancer sensitivity to several zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in increased zzso and altered zzso expression and underwent zzso zzso zzso These were reflected by the zzso zzso and functional zzso in the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso plays a crucial role in prostate cancer progression and therapeutic resistance in part by altering zzso and zzso zzso zzso is an important target for the consideration of treating prostate cancer patients who developed therapeutic resistance and disease zzso
