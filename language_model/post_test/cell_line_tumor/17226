We report here that the zzso drug zzso zzso can control zzso zzso gene transfer to zzso zzso following zzso zzso zzso improvement of gene expression levels could be achieved depending on zzso dose zzso zzso concentration of zzso zzso with zzso DNA was found to be zzso zzso showing up to a zzso increase in reporter gene expression levels when compared to DNA administered zzso In zzso gene transfer activity of zzso was not affected by the nature of the zzso used, zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Although in zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso could not be zzso a zzso leakage zzso revealed that zzso could significantly destabilize stable zzso zzso suggesting that a possible membrane zzso zzso activity of zzso combined to the physical stress induced by the zzso injection may facilitate zzso DNA entry inside the cells resulting in increased gene zzso zzso zzso represent new and attractive zzso gene delivery systems with potential in cancer gene therapy and zzso
