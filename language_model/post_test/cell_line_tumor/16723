The application of zzso interference to treat disease is an important yet challenging concept in modern zzso In particular, small interfering zzso zzso have shown tremendous promise in the treatment of zzso However, zzso show poor pharmacological properties, which presents a major hurdle for effective disease treatment especially through intravenous delivery zzso In response to these shortcomings, a variety of zzso carriers have emerged, which are designed to zzso zzso and transport zzso into diseased zzso To be effective as carrier vehicles, zzso must overcome a series of biological hurdles throughout the course of zzso As a result, one promising approach to zzso carriers is zzso versatile zzso that can perform several in zzso zzso Over the last several years, our research group has investigated zzso zzso zzso as candidate delivery vehicles for zzso including zzso Throughout the course of our research, we have developed higher order zzso composed entirely of zzso zzso where several different zzso zzso may be isolated in unique compartments of a single zzso In this Account, we zzso a subset of our experiences in the design and application of zzso in the context of drug delivery, zzso the relevant characteristics for these materials as delivery vehicles for zzso Through the layering of zzso zzso zzso in a zzso structure, we can impart multiple functions to the zzso We consider zzso as a platform technology, where each functional element of the particle may be independently tuned to zzso the particle for the desired zzso For instance, we can modify the shell compartment of a vehicle for zzso targeting or evasion of the innate immune system, whereas other compartments may incorporate fluorescent zzso or regulate the zzso and release of zzso zzso zzso experiments have demonstrated the utility of zzso zzso For example, using a simple zzso zzso architecture, we have recently reported the delivery of zzso to zzso drug resistant zzso cancer zzso zzso efforts have resulted in several advanced zzso structures, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso our research group has studied other properties of the zzso including their behavior in confined environments and their ability to zzso through small zzso
