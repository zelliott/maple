The activity of the zzso functions zzso function zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso alpha zzso is zzso This study aimed to decipher the yet unclear mechanisms involved in this differential cell sensitivity, with particular attention to the specific influence that cell differentiation may have on these zzso zzso we comparatively evaluated the zzso of cells to either zzso zzso in two different zzso zzso a series of cell lines originating from a common zzso but with distinct differentiation zzso and zzso cell lines that undergo differentiation processes in zzso These experiments demonstrate that the respective contribution that zzso and zzso make toward zzso activity varies in a cell differentiation zzso zzso Specifically, whereas zzso is the dominant zzso involved in zzso zzso activity in differentiated cells, the more a cell is zzso the more this cell mediates zzso signaling through zzso For instance, zzso is the only active zzso in cells that have achieved their zzso zzso Moreover, the stable expression of a functional zzso in strictly zzso zzso cells restores an zzso cell zzso These results, together with data obtained in different zzso cell lines tested strongly suggest that the zzso activity of zzso relies on its zzso in most zzso target cell zzso
