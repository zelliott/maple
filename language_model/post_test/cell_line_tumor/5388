The worldwide appearance of drug-resistant strains of zzso zzso motivates a search for new agents with therapeutic potential against this family of bacteria that zzso the stomach, and is associated with zzso zzso This study was designed to assess in zzso the zzso zzso potential of zzso zzso zzso which is naturally present in gastric juice, its zzso synthetic analog zzso and the zzso zzso agent zzso zzso 

In agreement with previous studies, increased expression of zzso was observed in gastric zzso obtained from zzso zzso infected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values determined in zzso media range from zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso These data indicate substantial, but widely differing zzso activities against clinical zzso of zzso zzso After incubation in simulated gastric juice zzso pH with presence of zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso retained zzso zzso Compared to zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity was also more resistant to zzso by isolated host gastric zzso 

These data indicate that zzso zzso zzso agents such as zzso resist zzso degradation and zzso by zzso and have potential for treatment of zzso zzso infections, including those caused by the zzso and/or zzso zzso
