zzso zzso receptors zzso have been originally thought to be restricted to zzso metabolism or zzso zzso Recently, evidence is growing that zzso zzso have zzso effects on tumor zzso To shed light on the potential therapeutic effects on melanoma we tested a panel of zzso zzso on their ability to block tumor proliferation in zzso Whereas zzso zzso and zzso showed moderate effects on zzso zzso displayed profound zzso activity on four different melanoma cell lines zzso Additionally, zzso inhibited proliferation of zzso zzso and tube formation of zzso zzso zzso induced the tumor zzso gene zzso a zzso arrest and inhibited tumor cell zzso Shot gun zzso analysis in addition to zzso zzso and zzso of zzso melanoma cells suggested that zzso might exert its effects via modification and/or zzso of zzso zzso shock protein zzso and several zzso zzso the recently established zzso database with a panel of defined zzso signatures, we demonstrated a regulation of proteins involved in zzso transport or protein synthesis including zzso zzso migratory cell protein or zzso zzso as confirmed by zzso Our data revealed for the first time a profound effect of the single compound zzso on melanoma cells in addition to the zzso zzso suggesting synergistic therapeutic zzso
