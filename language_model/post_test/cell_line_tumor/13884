Mice carrying the zzso zzso exhibit white coat spotting due to the regional absence of neural zzso zzso We reported previously that the zzso locus encodes the zzso gene and that zzso mice express low levels of structurally intact zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Richardson, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Cell 79, zzso Here, we report that both the life span of the zzso zzso and the promoter activity of the zzso gene are indistinguishable between zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2-6 of the zzso gene in zzso mice were correctly excised with an efficiency indistinguishable from those in zzso mice in zzso zzso zzso We found that the zzso zzso of the zzso gene has a zzso zzso element in zzso 1 possessing zzso sequences of a zzso signal and a zzso zzso zzso zzso hybrid transcripts carrying zzso 1 of the zzso gene and a portion of the zzso element are expressed in zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso element into a zzso zzso in a zzso expression zzso markedly reduced the expression of the reporter zzso zzso termination and zzso zzso of the zzso transcript caused by the zzso element in zzso 1 lead to a reduced level of the normal zzso transcript, which is responsible for the partial zzso zzso of zzso zzso
