Most normal cells have two zzso that form bipolar zzso during zzso while cancer cells often contain more than two, or zzso zzso Such cancer cells achieve bipolar division by zzso their zzso into two functional zzso and zzso this process then leads to zzso cell zzso A major problem with clinically used zzso drugs, such as zzso is their toxicity in normal zzso To discover new compounds with greater specificity for cancer cells, we established a zzso screen for agents that block zzso zzso in zzso cells, a breast cancer cell line that harbors zzso zzso Using this screen, we identified 14 compounds that inhibit zzso zzso and induce zzso zzso Some of these compounds were structurally similar, suggesting a common structural motif important for preventing zzso zzso We next compared the effects of these compounds on the growth of several breast and other cancer cell lines, an immortalized normal human zzso zzso cell line, and zzso primary normal human zzso zzso zzso From these zzso we found some compounds that kill breast cancer cells, but not their normal zzso counterparts, suggesting their potential for targeted zzso One of these compounds, zzso zzso zzso Chemical zzso zzso that showed the greatest differential response in this screen was confirmed to have selective effects on cancer as compared to normal breast zzso using more precise zzso induction and zzso growth zzso The concentration of zzso that killed cancer cells in the zzso zzso spared normal human bone zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cell zzso indicating a potential therapeutic window for zzso whose selectivity might be further improved by zzso the zzso zzso analysis showed that treatment with zzso lead to zzso zzso in zzso while maintaining bipolar zzso in the normal primary human zzso zzso zzso Since zzso zzso is a complex process involving multiple zzso the 14 compounds identified in this study provide a potentially novel means to developing zzso zzso drugs that block zzso zzso
