The effect of zzso on proliferation and zzso of human multiple myeloma zzso cells in zzso as well as the roles of nuclear zzso B zzso and zzso was zzso The effect of zzso on the growth of zzso cells was studied by zzso zzso zzso was detected by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso double zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso was observed by Western zzso and zzso zzso The results showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in human multiple myeloma zzso zzso zzso at zzso range induced proliferation zzso in a zzso and zzso manner and zzso in a zzso fashion in zzso zzso Besides, we observed the zzso of zzso zzso in the nuclear fraction was correlated with the increase in the protein expression of zzso in the zzso These results suggested that zzso might exhibit its strong zzso effects via zzso of zzso and zzso
