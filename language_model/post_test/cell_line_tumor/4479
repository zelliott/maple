zzso zzso is characterized by zzso oxygen species zzso zzso zzso dysfunction, and excessive zzso but the precise sequence of zzso events leading to zzso damage and cell death remains zzso The goal of this study was to delineate the role of zzso metabolism in zzso zzso zzso 

We treated zzso rat zzso cells with free fatty acids in combination with antioxidants and zzso zzso designed to block key events in the progression toward zzso We then applied zzso zzso flux analysis zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with these zzso 

Treatment with zzso alone led to a doubling in oxygen zzso rate and in most zzso zzso zzso culture media with the zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso and zzso zzso and partially restored cell zzso However, zzso zzso revealed that treatment with zzso did not zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that neither elevated zzso nor downstream zzso events contributed to zzso zzso To directly limit zzso zzso the complex I inhibitor zzso was added to cells treated with zzso zzso addition eliminated abnormal zzso zzso prevented the appearance of zzso zzso and zzso zzso carbon zzso Further studies revealed that zzso provided the primary fuel for elevated zzso metabolism in the presence of zzso rather than fatty acid zzso and that zzso consumption could be reduced through zzso with zzso but not zzso 

Our results indicate that zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells occurs downstream of altered zzso zzso zzso which is independent of zzso and precedes zzso zzso
