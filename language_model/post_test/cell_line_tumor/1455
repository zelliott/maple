zzso zzso was recently reported to be zzso in various zzso and associated with the zzso behavior of cancer zzso However, the expression of zzso in primary lung cancer and its biological roles in zzso cell lung cancer zzso have not been zzso The molecular mechanism of zzso in cancer aggressiveness remains zzso In the present study, we analyzed the expression pattern of zzso in zzso zzso and found that zzso was zzso at both the zzso and protein zzso There was a significant association between zzso zzso and zzso stage zzso and poor differentiation zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso expression in zzso and zzso cells with high zzso zzso expression resulted in a decrease of colony formation ability and zzso of cell cycle zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso in these cell zzso Further analysis showed that zzso zzso decreased zzso D1 expression and zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso is zzso in zzso and contributes to zzso cell growth by zzso D1 and zzso zzso which makes zzso a candidate therapeutic target in lung zzso
