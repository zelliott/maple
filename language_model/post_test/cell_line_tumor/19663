zzso is a widely expressed zzso zzso factor which is involved in regulating cell proliferation and tissue zzso Several studies describe a strong zzso of zzso expression during inflammatory processes like zzso and zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso which is an important zzso of innate zzso against zzso bacteria, significantly stimulates zzso protein production in zzso rat zzso cells within 2 zzso Since a putative zzso zzso motif has been zzso we further tested whether zzso stimulates zzso expression via zzso of zzso zzso We characterized the zzso binding of zzso zzso to this zzso We show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso contributes to the induction of zzso during zzso and zzso zzso
