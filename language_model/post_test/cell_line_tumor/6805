Introduction of foreign genes into target cells is a crucial step for achievement of gene zzso We have recently developed a novel zzso system for zzso cells, namely the electric zzso gas plasma zzso To measure the zzso efficiency and mortality by zzso we employed enhanced green fluorescent protein and zzso zzso zzso zzso One day after the zzso plasma zzso with DNA concentration at zzso zzso favorable zzso efficiencies zzso and zzso zzso were obtained for zzso zzso and zzso zzso The recipient cells became zzso permeable for zzso DNA during the plasma exposure, suggesting that zzso zzso may involve similar mechanisms that accounts for zzso The relatively low mortality rates are encouraging in our attempt to apply this system to the various cell lines including the primary cell zzso
