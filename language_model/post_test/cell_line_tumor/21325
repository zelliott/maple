Lack of good models has complicated investigations on the mechanisms of prostate zzso By far, the most commonly used transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer is zzso which, however, has not been fully characterized for genetic and zzso zzso Here, we screened zzso C2 cell line for the zzso using different zzso approaches, and compared it to human prostate zzso zzso had relatively few zzso copy number zzso according to array comparative zzso zzso zzso However, the gene copy number and expression were significantly correlated zzso zzso zzso zzso genes for promoter zzso using zzso treatment with zzso and subsequent expression profiling indicated 43 zzso zzso silenced zzso Further studies revealed that zzso is zzso in the zzso cell line, as well as in the human prostate cancer cell line zzso Its expression was found to be significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso human prostate zzso Together with known function of zzso the data suggest an zzso component in the regulation of zzso in prostate zzso
