zzso zzso are small zzso zzso that have important roles in gene zzso We have previously reported that zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso and its zzso zzso induce zzso in human zzso zzso cancer zzso In this study, we examined the regulation of zzso by zzso and demonstrate that zzso targets zzso zzso expression of zzso significantly increased cell proliferation and survival, enhanced zzso formation and blocked zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso blocked zzso cell death, whereas zzso enhanced the effect of zzso These effects of zzso were partially compensated by the zzso of zzso Moreover, in zzso zzso samples taken from zzso cancer patients who responded well to chemotherapy, strong zzso zzso and low zzso expression was zzso By contrast, zzso expression was weak and zzso levels were high in samples from patients who responded poorly to zzso Finally, treatment with zzso led to an increase in expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso but a decrease in zzso zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that the zzso zzso is involved in zzso cell death in zzso cancer cells and that zzso enhances zzso survival and zzso by zzso at least in part, zzso
