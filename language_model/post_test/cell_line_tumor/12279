zzso hormone zzso and zzso zzso bind with various affinities to two zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are expressed in brain and in peripheral zzso including immune zzso zzso mice display zzso behavior, hypersensitivity to stress, altered feeding behavior and zzso and cardiovascular zzso However, the zzso of these mice in inflammatory responses has not been zzso In the present study we found that compared with zzso zzso mice developed substantially reduced zzso inflammation and had lower zzso zzso expression of the potent zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein 1 following zzso exposure to zzso zzso toxin A, a potent zzso that mediates zzso zzso and colitis in zzso This effect was zzso by administration of zzso zzso a selective zzso zzso before toxin A zzso Moreover, zzso array analysis revealed reduced expression of several inflammatory zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein 1 in toxin zzso mice zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso mouse zzso showed that only zzso but not other zzso was significantly zzso by zzso administration of toxin A at 4 h compared with buffer zzso We also found that human zzso zzso zzso cells express zzso zzso whereas expression of beta and gamma spliced zzso was zzso Moreover, treatment of zzso cells with zzso which binds exclusively to zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso Taken together, these results provide direct evidence that zzso mediates zzso inflammatory responses via release of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso
