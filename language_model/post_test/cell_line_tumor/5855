zzso gene therapy approaches often lack long-term zzso expression in zzso as a result of zzso or loss of the zzso One way to overcome these limitations is to combine zzso promoters with strong zzso 

In the present study, we combine zzso or human zzso zzso zzso elements with the human zzso factor zzso zzso promoter in a zzso backbone devoid of potentially zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso activity was monitored in mouse liver after zzso zzso zzso 

zzso activity of a zzso driven zzso rapidly declined within days, whereas the activity of the zzso driven zzso remained high for zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso levels clearly correlated with higher zzso copy number found in the liver at zzso after gene zzso Furthermore, we developed a novel synthetic zzso hybrid promoter zzso combining the high activity of zzso and sustained activity of zzso zzso The zzso led to a zzso zzso increase in expression levels compared to the zzso promoter in zzso 

This novel combination of zzso and promoter element with zzso zzso zzso will pave the way for more efficient zzso approaches in gene zzso
