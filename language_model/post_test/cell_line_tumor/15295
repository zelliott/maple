To explore the effects of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso on the proliferation and invasion of human zzso zzso cells in zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso The changes in zzso and protein expression of zzso in the zzso cells were investigated using real-time zzso and Western zzso respectively, and zzso zzso was employed to assess the cell proliferation zzso In zzso zzso zzso and zzso chamber test were used to observe the zzso and zzso of zzso cells, zzso 

zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso resulted in a significantly decreased expression of zzso at both zzso and protein levels ( zzso and obvious suppression of the cell zzso activity ( zzso zzso also significantly suppressed the zzso and zzso of zzso cells ( zzso 

zzso zzso can significantly inhibit the proliferation and zzso of human zzso zzso cells in zzso suggesting the value of zzso as a potential target for zzso zzso zzso
