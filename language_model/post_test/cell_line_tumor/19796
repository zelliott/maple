zzso regulatory factor zzso plays an important role in initiating cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we evaluated the effects of zzso expression and zzso on zzso zzso C virus zzso replication using an zzso zzso zzso 

An zzso zzso was constructed that expressed a zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso A small interfering zzso zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso was designed and zzso A zzso expression zzso zzso was constructed that expressed zzso zzso under control of the zzso early zzso To evaluate zzso activity of the zzso zzso a reporter zzso was used that expressed zzso zzso under control of the zzso response element zzso 

The baseline expression of zzso did not significantly differ between cells with and without expression of the zzso zzso of an zzso expression zzso into the cells raised the zzso zzso The increase of zzso activity was significantly more potent in the zzso cells than in cells without zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso suppressed zzso replication zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of zzso suppressed zzso activity by 38% zzso zzso Interestingly, the suppression of zzso resulted in a significant increase of zzso zzso by up to zzso depending on the zzso suppression zzso 

zzso zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso and was partially activated in cells that expressed the zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a key zzso controlling zzso replication through zzso of host zzso gene zzso
