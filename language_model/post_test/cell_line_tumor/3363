zzso zzso has been exploited in various applications involving living zzso We have observed correlation between the collagen zzso with the rate of cell proliferation in three-dimensional zzso zzso To zzso the degree of collagen zzso we have developed a zzso zone zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso detection at 200 zzso we have zzso pH and separated the native collagen into three major bands in zzso buffer zzso zzso pH zzso with zzso zzso Under these conditions, the zzso zzso were separated into four major bands, which changed with different zzso reaction zzso We propose an index to zzso the degree of collagen zzso that also zzso with their effects on cell zzso
