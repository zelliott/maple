zzso cancer is the most common zzso in men and the second leading cause of zzso mortality in men of the Western zzso zzso has received attention because of its zzso potential to prevent zzso In the present study, we evaluated the influence of lycopene on cell zzso cell cycle, and zzso of human prostate cancer cells and benign prostate zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we observed a decrease of cell viability in all cancer cell lines after treatment with zzso which decreased the percentage of cells in zzso phase and increased in S and zzso zzso after zzso of treatment in zzso prostate cancer cell zzso zzso zzso analysis of cell cycle revealed lycopene promoted cell cycle arrest in zzso phase after 48 and zzso of treatment in a primary cancer cell zzso Using real time zzso zzso lycopene also induced zzso in prostate cancer cells with altered gene expression of zzso and zzso No effect was observed in benign prostate zzso zzso These results suggest an effect of lycopene on activity of human prostate cancer zzso
