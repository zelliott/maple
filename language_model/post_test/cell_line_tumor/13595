zzso are zzso zzso zzso that can arise centrally (in the zzso or peripherally (at the zzso of the zzso They are classified into three zzso grades which zzso to the clinical zzso Previous studies by our group have shown altered signal zzso of the zzso growth factor and zzso zzso pathways during peripheral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso that zzso zzso binding of multiple growth factors, in which the zzso of zzso position plays a pivotal zzso zzso occurs through three HS zzso zzso and is fine-tuned by two zzso zzso that remove zzso zzso We have investigated whether the expression of zzso and zzso changes during zzso progression and have determined zzso levels in two zzso cell zzso zzso on tissue zzso of zzso showed that zzso and zzso were highly expressed in most zzso whereas zzso expression was absent in most zzso zzso and zzso expression are significantly increased during zzso zzso which suggest that zzso is increased during zzso This was confirmed in one grade III zzso cell line, which showed a dramatically increased zzso compared to an zzso zzso cell line by zzso another cell line showed an increased expression of one zzso HS zzso In conclusion, our results show increased zzso and zzso expression during zzso progression and increased HS zzso in zzso As zzso plays an important role in signal zzso altered zzso expression might be associated with changes in signal zzso pathways in zzso zzso
