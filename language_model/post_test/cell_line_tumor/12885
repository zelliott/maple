zzso growth factor zzso zzso is highly expressed in primary prostate cancer and associated skeletal zzso Here, we tested whether targeting this zzso could impair zzso colonization and zzso as well as prolong survival, either as primary or as combination zzso 

We used a zzso animal model of zzso in which zzso human prostate cancer cells are zzso directly in the blood zzso First, the zzso zzso zzso zzso was administered to mice bearing established skeletal zzso Second, we targeted the zzso zzso with zzso an zzso specific for the zzso zzso Third, zzso and the zzso zzso acid zzso administered separately or in zzso were tested on the progression of skeletal zzso and overall zzso In addition, the ability of zzso and zzso to impair initial colonization of the bone zzso by prostate cancer cells was zzso 

The blockade of zzso on prostate cancer cells by zzso reduces the size of established skeletal zzso whereas the zzso zzso directed against the zzso zzso fails to inhibit zzso zzso zzso and zzso either separately or in zzso significantly slow tumor growth and seem to prolong zzso Lastly, the blockade of zzso by zzso zzso the initial phase of bone zzso whereas zzso is ineffective at this zzso 

This study presents compelling evidence that targeting zzso with zzso delays the progression of early zzso zzso and reduces the size of more established zzso In addition, zzso either alone or in combination with zzso zzso survival in animal zzso
