zzso has been proposed as a treatment for the same gastrointestinal indications for which zzso has been approved, chronic idiopathic zzso and irritable zzso syndrome with zzso zzso damage the zzso cell barrier and cellular zzso leading to loss of these zzso zzso of active zzso on repair of barrier and cell function in pig zzso after zzso and in zzso cells after treatment with zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso were zzso zzso with effects of zzso known to promote repair of barrier function was carried zzso 

In zzso pig zzso using zzso of zzso resistance, zzso zzso zzso current zzso zzso and zzso zzso active zzso failed to effectively promote repair of the zzso barrier or recovery of zzso zzso whereas zzso promoted barrier repair and increased zzso zzso In control pig zzso 1 zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso both caused similar increases in zzso current zzso zzso In zzso cells, using zzso of zzso resistance, zzso of fluorescent zzso zzso and zzso membrane potential, active zzso was virtually ineffective against damage caused by zzso and tumor necrosis zzso while zzso protected or promoted repair of zzso barrier and cell zzso zzso zzso by zzso was inhibited by zzso a zzso zzso zzso but not zzso increased zzso as expected and zzso and zzso zzso while zzso zzso the zzso plasma membrane potential suggesting that zzso may lead to greater cellular stability compared to zzso In zzso cells, as found with zzso but not with zzso zzso resistance was slightly but significantly decreased by zzso zzso and zzso zzso and fluorescent zzso zzso were increased by zzso However the zzso implications of these small but statistically significant changes remain zzso 

Considering the zzso importance of zzso barrier function and cell integrity and the known impact of zzso the finding that zzso but not active zzso exhibits the additional distinct property of effective protection or repair of the zzso barrier and cell function after stress suggests potential clinical importance for patients with impaired or compromised barrier function such as might occur in zzso
