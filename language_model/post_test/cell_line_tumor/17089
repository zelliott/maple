On the genetic level zzso zzso is best described by the zzso zzso but it may be modulated by zzso factors, particularly by dietary factors and zzso zzso The protective effects of zzso factors are thought to be exerted rather in the early stages of the zzso zzso Thus, an in zzso model consisting of cells stemming from an colon zzso would be zzso However, establishing such a cell line has proven zzso 

We report the establishment of a colon zzso cell zzso The cells were generated from a colon zzso and zzso as a stable cell line for more than 40 zzso The cells are zzso stable and confirmed to be of zzso origin by zzso zzso 

In contrast to commercially available colon cancer cell lines, zzso analysis with spectral zzso analysis revealed no zzso zzso in this zzso cell zzso zzso with zzso resulted in a zzso and zzso zzso of proliferation and in an significant increase in cellular zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso which plays a pivotal role in growth zzso and differentiation is expressed zzso in zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso important regulatory elements in the cell cycle, is zzso following treatment with zzso 

The presented colon zzso cell line zzso may prove a versatile tool for further exploring the underlying mechanisms of protective and promoting factors in early colon zzso
