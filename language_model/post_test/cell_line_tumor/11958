To evaluate the effect of combination of zzso zzso and zzso C zzso on the human gastric zzso cell line zzso in zzso 

The effects of zzso and zzso were measured by zzso zzso and the interaction between the two agents was evaluated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso was used for cell cycle zzso 

zzso did not significantly stimulate the cell growth in zzso zzso of zzso could inhibit the cell zzso zzso could effectively inhibit the cell growth in a zzso zzso The interaction of these two agents showed a weak zzso activity (1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced remarkable zzso zzso zzso zzso has limited effect on the zzso arrest of zzso while high-dose zzso significantly attenuated the zzso arrest and lowered the proliferation index of zzso zzso 

Combination of zzso and zzso has a a weak and zzso zzso activity in the treatment of gastric zzso cell line zzso The combination of high-dose zzso and zzso zzso may achieve better zzso
