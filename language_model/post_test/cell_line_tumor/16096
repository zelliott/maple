Limited efficacy of zzso drugs against solid tumors has been attributed to poor drug penetration into tumor zzso zzso layer zzso cultures zzso barriers to drug penetration and distribution and have been used successfully in the production of clinically relevant zzso In the present study, we evaluated the characteristics of zzso zzso and zzso zzso penetration and their effects on tissue penetration using zzso of human zzso cancer cells zzso and zzso grown in zzso zzso Drug concentration in zzso media after zzso penetration was estimated using % survival of cells exposed to the zzso media, and the penetration rate was calculated as % drug concentration relative to the expected concentration after penetration of zzso zzso zzso showed limited penetration in both zzso in contrast to the full penetration seen by zzso The penetration rate measured after 24 h by zzso of the zzso media was 40 and 38% in zzso (20 zzso and zzso zzso (1 zzso respectively, at which concentration the zzso media produced 50% growth zzso in zzso The penetration profile obtained using zzso also showed slow and limited penetration with zzso and cell zzso In zzso zzso full penetration of zzso was obtained at 10 zzso after 48 zzso whereas only zzso was obtained at 1 zzso In zzso zzso penetration of zzso was zzso especially at 1 zzso showing penetration rates as low as 10 and zzso after 24 and 96 zzso zzso When zzso and zzso were allowed to penetrate in sequential zzso no effect on the penetration rate was zzso Overall, our results demonstrated limited penetration of zzso in human zzso cancer zzso along with zzso zzso and cell zzso Assessment of penetration using zzso of the zzso media used in the present study may be useful in early stage screening of zzso agents for their potential in tissue zzso
