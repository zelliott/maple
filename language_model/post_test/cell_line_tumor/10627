zzso plays a zzso role by zzso regulating zzso signaling of zzso zzso or zzso zzso expression of zzso has been shown to suppress zzso zzso cell proliferation indicating its therapeutic value in cancer zzso However, zzso gene delivery carries risks of zzso zzso To circumvent this zzso consequence, we fused a cell permeable zzso zzso to zzso and evaluated the efficacy of zzso of zzso cell proliferation in zzso 

In this study, proliferation zzso flow zzso Western zzso analyses were performed on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso treated zzso zzso We found that delivered zzso but not zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso showed no growth zzso effect on zzso zzso or zzso zzso Moreover, we demonstrated that zzso zzso cell growth zzso by zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced cell cycle arrest and zzso zzso and Western blots data indicated zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso level in zzso cells after zzso zzso Treatment with specific zzso zzso and zzso indicated zzso and zzso pathways were crucial for zzso proliferation of zzso zzso Further analyses using zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso cell zzso Using zzso zzso zzso stem cells, we found that delivered zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso delivery of zzso zzso zzso fusion protein efficiently inhibited zzso zzso zzso cell growth by promoting zzso zzso zzso zzso protein delivery may provide a safer and more practical approach to inhibit zzso cell growth worthy of further zzso
