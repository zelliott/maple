zzso zzso cancer demonstrates high mortality due to diagnosis at an advanced zzso In the search for a zzso for early diagnosis and a target for therapy, the issue of whether zzso zzso zzso shown to be expressed on a variety of human zzso is expressed in zzso tumor samples was zzso In addition, whether this zzso serves as a zzso and can be targeted by zzso zzso was zzso 

zzso expression in 15 normal and 68 zzso tumor tissue samples was determined by zzso zzso between zzso features and zzso expression was zzso The efficacy of zzso zzso was determined in mice with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso analyses revealed that zzso of zzso cancer specimens express zzso a zzso zzso zzso chain, whereas normal zzso samples expressed none or very low zzso The majority of clear cell zzso zzso with the worst prognosis showed strong zzso for zzso zzso zzso was highly zzso to the zzso zzso cancer cell line in zzso and it zzso significant zzso activity against a zzso tumor zzso The zzso effects were confirmed by treating zzso implanted or zzso zzso zzso tumors, which showed significant extension of survival in zzso zzso zzso zzso also prevented zzso in treated zzso The soluble form of zzso was detected in the serum of mice with zzso zzso and the level decreased to baseline in the treated zzso 

zzso is a promising target for zzso cancer therapy, and the soluble form of zzso may be a possible surrogate marker for disease zzso
