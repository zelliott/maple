The zzso zzso zzso has been extensively studied in context of zzso gene therapy for zzso However, there is strong evidence that besides its decisive role in zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a component of zzso tight junctions and involved in zzso zzso in normal and cancer zzso Furthermore, this zzso zzso behaves like a cell surface zzso endowed with tumor zzso properties via signal zzso Moreover, 3 truncated soluble zzso of zzso were recently zzso We investigated the quantitative expression of all known zzso zzso in a training set of 140 zzso cancer samples and 21 controls by zzso The expression levels of the various zzso were compared with zzso parameters and their zzso significance was zzso zzso levels of all zzso zzso were elevated in zzso zzso as compared with those of zzso zzso zzso correlated with protein zzso Moreover, expression of the soluble zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not that of zzso was significantly increased in advanced zzso cancer as revealed by a highly significant correlation with zzso stage and residual disease zzso 2 zzso in diameter after zzso zzso High expression of zzso zzso and zzso was shown to be of independent zzso relevance for zzso zzso zzso and overall survival zzso zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, soluble zzso zzso zzso and zzso may play a pivotal role in zzso cancer biology, possibly by zzso zzso and zzso properties of the zzso zzso and thus favoring cancer cell dissemination throughout the zzso zzso
