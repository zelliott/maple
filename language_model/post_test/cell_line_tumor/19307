The zzso apparatus zzso of zzso cells is positioned in the vicinity of the zzso the major zzso organizing center of the zzso The significance of this physical proximity for zzso function and cell cycle progression is only beginning to being zzso We have identified a novel function for the zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso position and function during zzso zzso zzso depletion of zzso from five human cell lines revealed abnormal zzso zzso that were zzso and defective with respect to zzso organization and cell zzso When zzso cells entered zzso they formed zzso zzso arrested in zzso and zzso We also detected zzso zzso during zzso and zzso zzso during zzso in zzso cells, which do not contain zzso zzso Although zzso proteins have been described to regulate zzso zzso and zzso formation, this is the first report of a role for a zzso protein in the regulation of zzso during zzso
