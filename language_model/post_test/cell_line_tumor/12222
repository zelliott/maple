While it has long been known that inflammation and infection reduce expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso genes involved in zzso metabolism and that exposure to zzso chemicals can impair immune function, the molecular mechanisms underlying both of these phenomena have remained largely zzso Here we show that zzso of the nuclear steroid and zzso zzso zzso by commonly used drugs in humans zzso the activity of zzso a key regulator of inflammation and the immune zzso zzso target genes are zzso and small zzso inflammation is significantly increased in mice lacking the SXR zzso zzso X zzso zzso thereby demonstrating a direct link between SXR and zzso antagonism of zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso zzso SXR and its target genes whereas zzso of zzso enhances SXR zzso This zzso axis provides a molecular explanation for the suppression of zzso zzso zzso by inflammatory stimuli as well as the zzso effects of zzso and zzso zzso This zzso relationship has clinical consequences for individuals undergoing therapeutic exposure to the wide variety of drugs that are also SXR zzso
