The aim of the study was to investigate expression of zzso (A zzso and A zzso of host cell origin during zzso fusion induced by human zzso virus type 2 zzso 

zzso of host cell zzso was observed in zzso cells, but the zzso of this model was restricted by lack of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with the corresponding green monkey zzso zzso cells were not susceptible to zzso virus zzso In contrast, in human zzso zzso zzso cells, a natural host cell for zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso increased dramatically over time from zzso zzso zzso at zero hours to zzso zzso zzso at 72 hours zzso zzso zzso Without zzso the corresponding percentages were only zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso positive cells formed zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso on day one and the corresponding percentages on day three were zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso 

zzso well recognized for participation in zzso fusion especially in zzso formation, is zzso upon formation of zzso giant cells after zzso induction in zzso zzso The zzso cell system provides a novel experimental model for study of the molecular mechanism of cell fusion zzso
