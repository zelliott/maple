zzso zzso is a lethal zzso with the best available therapeutic zzso response rates of zzso zzso Because nuclear zzso zzso has been determined to play a role in cell zzso in human pancreatic zzso this zzso factor is a potential therapeutic zzso 

The authors investigated the ability of zzso zzso an agent that is zzso safe in humans, to zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso active in all human pancreatic zzso cell lines zzso and zzso consistently suppressed zzso binding (as assessed using an zzso mobility zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso decreased the expression of zzso gene products, including zzso (as assessed using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (as assessed using an zzso zzso all of which have been implicated in the growth and zzso of pancreatic zzso These changes were associated with zzso and zzso zzso activity (as assessed using a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso effects (as assessed via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso as well as with the induction of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and growth control molecules induced by zzso in human pancreatic zzso These effects were accompanied by marked growth zzso and zzso Through these findings, the authors provided a zzso rationale for the treatment of patients with pancreatic zzso using this nontoxic zzso
