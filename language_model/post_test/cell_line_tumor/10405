zzso zzso factor 2) is a nuclear zzso factor that in response to chemical and radiation stress regulates coordinated induction of a battery of zzso gene expressions leading to cellular zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso and downstream zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Yes, and zzso but not zzso in mouse zzso zzso cells, led to nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso downstream gene zzso Mouse embryonic zzso with combined zzso of zzso supported results from zzso In addition, zzso zzso of zzso zzso and Yes zzso zzso that triggered nuclear export and degradation of zzso and zzso of zzso downstream gene zzso Exposure of cells to zzso zzso or zzso radiation increased nuclear import of zzso zzso and Yes zzso which zzso zzso resulting in nuclear export and degradation of zzso Further analysis revealed that zzso zzso acted upstream to the zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso leading to their nuclear zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells led to decreased zzso increased zzso and decreased cell zzso Mouse embryonic zzso deficient in zzso zzso showed nuclear zzso of zzso induction of zzso and downstream gene zzso reduced zzso and increased cell zzso The studies together demonstrate that zzso zzso play a critical role in nuclear export and degradation of zzso thereby providing a negative feedback mechanism to switch off zzso zzso and restore normal cellular zzso
