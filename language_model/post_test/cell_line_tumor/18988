Cell zzso and migration are strongly influenced by zzso zzso zzso architecture and zzso but little is known about the zzso influence of such environmental signals to cell responses, especially when considering cells of similar origin and zzso but exhibiting a normal or zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso 750 zzso 2000 zzso and topography zzso pillars or zzso we systematically zzso the differential response of normal zzso and cancer zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that both cells exhibit differential zzso and zzso responses to changes in zzso rigidity and zzso zzso zzso and spreading are influenced by zzso zzso and zzso The cells exhibit a persistent type of migration, which depends on the zzso zzso In contrast, the dynamic of zzso spreading is strongly modified by the zzso topography but not by zzso zzso zzso zzso and migration seem to escape from zzso zzso the cells exhibit zzso migration zzso and a large zzso of their migration speed, which increases with zzso zzso
