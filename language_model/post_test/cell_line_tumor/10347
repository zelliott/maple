The zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso has been implicated in many cellular zzso such as, zzso cell death, and zzso In zzso four distinct genes zzso the four known members of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Despite the fact that zzso and zzso zzso share over zzso zzso zzso they have zzso perhaps even opposite roles under stress zzso In our previous report, we showed that zzso zzso is induced in activated zzso in the zzso of the zzso brain, wherein it was zzso with zzso and zzso To investigate the functional significance of zzso zzso in zzso a zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso In these cells, hydrogen zzso zzso was reduced to zzso of that obtained from normal zzso zzso Interestingly, we found that expression of a small heat shock zzso zzso was significantly increased in these cells, but that the expressions of zzso and zzso were zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso zzso zzso suppressed the protective effect and recovered zzso 3 activity, indicating that zzso induction plays a crucial role in the protection against zzso zzso observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that the binding between zzso and partially processed zzso (a zzso zzso was significantly increased in zzso cells, which might result in suppression of zzso 3 activity in these zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso protection against zzso zzso zzso by inducing a small heat shock zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso
