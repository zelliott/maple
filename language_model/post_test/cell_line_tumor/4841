zzso play critical roles in the development of zzso and diabetic zzso as well as many inflammatory zzso zzso II type 1 zzso zzso zzso are beneficial for the prevention of zzso and diabetic zzso suggesting that zzso II zzso zzso promotes the development of these zzso It has recently been reported that zzso II exerts zzso actions in zzso and in zzso This study was aimed to clarify the direct effects of zzso II on zzso 

zzso zzso cells, a human zzso zzso cell line, were treated with zzso II zzso zzso for 24 hours with or without zzso zzso We evaluated gene expression profiles of these cells using DNA zzso system and zzso them by real-time zzso 

DNA zzso revealed that in total 19 zzso including zzso zzso protein zzso were zzso by zzso II and zzso by zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso of zzso with zzso II is blocked by the zzso zzso but not by an zzso zzso 

These results suggest that zzso II directly stimulates zzso expression through zzso in activated zzso zzso II may contribute to the persistence or amplification of zzso in vessel walls, heart and zzso zzso or zzso effects of zzso might partly depend on direct zzso effects on zzso
