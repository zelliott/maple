zzso is a third-generation platinum drug that has favorable activity in zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso resistance are not well zzso To investigate the molecular mechanisms involved, resistant cell lines were independently derived from colon cancer zzso and zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines were approximately zzso and zzso more resistant to zzso than the parent cell lines, respectively, and had zzso and zzso higher zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines were approximately zzso more resistant to zzso than the parent cell line and had zzso higher zzso to zzso One hundred and zzso genes commonly zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso were identified by zzso zzso These genes were mainly involved in the function of zzso regulators zzso zzso molecules zzso and zzso zzso Of these, nuclear factor zzso zzso was zzso in all zzso zzso zzso of zzso rendered cells sensitive to zzso but not to zzso zzso expression of zzso induced resistance to zzso but not to zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso is a novel and specific zzso for zzso resistance in human zzso
