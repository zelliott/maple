zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is frequent in human zzso However, while classical, zzso zzso are an established therapeutic target, the relevance of zzso zzso zzso in leukemia treatment remains zzso Here, we assessed the zzso activity of zzso zzso and of the zzso drug zzso alone and in combination with traditional zzso zzso zzso leukemia cells, leukemia cell lines, healthy zzso and zzso zzso were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and with zzso with or without addition of the zzso zzso zzso acid, sodium zzso and zzso Cell death was zzso by zzso zzso cell zzso and subsequent zzso zzso induction was monitored by cell zzso with zzso zzso or with zzso followed by zzso analysis, and by measuring zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected by zzso and western zzso Cellular zzso levels were measured by zzso cycling zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso were silenced by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso enhanced zzso inhibitor activity in leukemia cells, but not in healthy zzso and zzso zzso In leukemia cells, zzso zzso were found to induce zzso of zzso a zzso zzso zzso whose zzso to zzso is normally prevented by zzso As a result, leukemia cells become zzso to zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso and zzso cooperate in leukemia cells to avoid zzso Combining zzso with zzso zzso results in synergistic zzso activity that could be zzso zzso
