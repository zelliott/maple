zzso signaling is a critical regulator of cell zzso zzso expression of calcium channels and pumps is a characteristic of some zzso including breast zzso We show that the plasma membrane calcium channel zzso which is highly selective for zzso is zzso in some breast cancer cell zzso zzso of zzso expression in a breast cancer cell line with increased zzso zzso expression leads to a reduction in zzso calcium influx and cellular proliferation associated with a reduction in DNA zzso zzso gene amplification was identified as one mechanism of zzso zzso in a subset of breast cancer cell lines and breast tumor zzso Analysis of two independent zzso expression zzso from breast tumor samples showed that increased zzso expression is a feature of zzso zzso zzso breast tumors encompassing the zzso molecular zzso as well as zzso zzso Breast cancer patients with high zzso levels had decreased survival compared with patients with low or intermediate zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso of zzso may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of zzso breast zzso
