zzso zzso group F zzso is an important participant in the zzso zzso repair zzso This study aimed to investigate the expression of DNA repair gene zzso zzso group F zzso in zzso cancer and its clinical zzso 

Total zzso and protein were extracted from 45 zzso zzso cancer zzso and 21 zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso were used to detect the zzso and protein levels of zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso was used to knock down the zzso expression in zzso cells and zzso cells, and the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso was zzso 

The zzso expressions in the zzso cancer zzso was significantly higher than those in the zzso cancer zzso at both zzso and protein zzso zzso the enhanced zzso expression decreased the sensitivity of zzso cells and zzso cells to zzso Furthermore, the zzso treatment significantly increased the zzso of zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso after the zzso gene zzso the zzso resistance of zzso cancer cells was significantly zzso 

Our results show the increased expression of zzso is involved in the zzso resistance of zzso cancer, and decreasing zzso expression may become a promising therapeutic strategy for zzso zzso
