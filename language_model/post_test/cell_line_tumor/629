Human zzso cancer is caused by zzso and is thought to be maintained by a population of cancer stem zzso Further zzso changes occurring at the invasive edge suggest that colon cancer cells are also regulated by their zzso Type I zzso a promoter of the zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso cells, is highly expressed at the invasive front of human zzso zzso 

This study investigates the role of type I collagen in specifying the zzso cancer cell zzso The effect of type I collagen on zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso differentiation and stem zzso characteristics was examined in a panel of human zzso zzso cell zzso 

Human zzso zzso cells grown on type I collagen in zzso medium show an zzso transition zzso assuming a more flattened less cohesive zzso Type I collagen zzso zzso and zzso at zzso zzso Furthermore, type I collagen zzso zzso increases zzso and promotes expression of stem cell markers zzso and zzso Type I collagen effects were partially zzso by a zzso zzso to zzso zzso 

Together, these results indicate that type I collagen promotes expression of a stem zzso zzso in human zzso cancer cells likely through zzso zzso
