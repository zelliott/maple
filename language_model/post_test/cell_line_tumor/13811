The zzso protein zzso is essential for efficient recognition and subsequent removal of ultraviolet zzso DNA zzso by zzso zzso repair zzso However, how zzso promotes zzso in zzso is poorly zzso Here, we identify zzso zzso 1 zzso as a novel zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso facilitated zzso of zzso zzso through the activity of zzso resulting in the recruitment of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso rendered cells sensitive to zzso and impaired repair of zzso DNA zzso Additionally, zzso itself was targeted by zzso resulting in increased protein stability and a prolonged zzso retention zzso Our in zzso and in zzso data support a model in which zzso of zzso suppresses zzso zzso and outline a molecular mechanism for zzso regulation of zzso through zzso stabilization and recruitment of the zzso remodeler zzso
