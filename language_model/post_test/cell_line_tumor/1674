zzso have been explored as potential drug and zzso zzso In recent years, zzso zzso have been developed to improve the efficacy of zzso zzso The zzso zzso is a modified zzso zzso which is derived from the zzso zzso chain, and binds to zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso In this study, we prepared zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to enhance the zzso zzso of drugs and genes specifically into tumor zzso The selectivity of zzso for zzso cells and cancer cells, which strongly express zzso zzso and zzso was assessed by flow zzso and zzso zzso The cellular zzso of zzso by both cell types was higher than zzso of the zzso and scramble zzso zzso Next, to ascertain the involvement of zzso zzso in the process, these cells were treated with zzso for zzso at zzso or at zzso We found that zzso was also dependent on the zzso Moreover, to evaluate whether the zzso depended on an zzso interaction, we examined the zzso of zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso and found that the cellular zzso of zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso This result suggests that zzso can selectively target cells that highly express zzso zzso Thus, the modification of the zzso zzso on a Drug zzso System zzso carrier may be a feasible approach for drug or gene delivery into zzso
