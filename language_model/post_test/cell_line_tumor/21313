Treatment of obesity is still a large zzso medical zzso zzso Y is the most potent zzso zzso in the animal zzso Its five cloned zzso couple receptors are all implicated in the regulation of energy zzso evidenced by zzso or deletion of zzso Y or its zzso zzso Y most likely exerts its zzso activity via the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso although the involvement of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors are also gaining zzso The lack of zzso selective, and brain zzso zzso agents at these receptors made our understanding of the zzso of food intake by zzso zzso agents zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso is a potent and selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso affinity at the zzso zzso zzso acting competitively at the zzso Y binding zzso zzso increased the zzso of zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso without changing the zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells that zzso express the zzso zzso zzso It is also found to be a full zzso with an apparent zzso of zzso zzso measured by reversal of zzso zzso zzso of zzso production by zzso zzso zzso profiling showed that zzso has no appreciable affinity at the other zzso Y zzso and is also zzso less potent at the zzso zzso zzso Testing the compound in a panel of 70 zzso coupled receptors and zzso channels resulted in at least zzso or greater zzso with the exception of the zzso zzso where the selectivity was zzso When administered zzso or directly into the zzso nucleus of the zzso it blocked zzso zzso food intake in zzso zzso administration of zzso (10 zzso also reduced one-hour zzso zzso food intake in zzso rats, as well as spontaneous overnight food zzso zzso administration of zzso (10 zzso zzso for 44 days significantly reduced food intake and the rate of body weight gain compared to vehicle treated control without developing tolerance or affecting water zzso These results provide supporting evidence that zzso reduces food intake and body weight via zzso of the central zzso zzso zzso zzso has no significant effect of locomotor activity up to 20 zzso dose after 1 h of zzso It also showed no activity in the elevated plus maze when tested after zzso and zzso administration, indicating that reduction of food intake is unrelated to anxious zzso zzso has good systemic zzso and brain zzso but lacks oral zzso The compound had no serious cardiovascular adverse effect in rats and dogs up to 30 and 10 zzso dose, respectively, when zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso is a zzso selective, brain zzso zzso zzso zzso that reduces food intake and body weight in animal models of obesity both after acute and chronic zzso Taken together the data suggest that a potent and selective zzso zzso zzso zzso might be an zzso treatment for obesity in zzso
