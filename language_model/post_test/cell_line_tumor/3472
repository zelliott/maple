zzso C zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that is expressed predominantly in the central nervous system zzso zzso dramatically changed its structure from a zzso to a zzso form with zzso development, whereas a small portion of zzso molecules existed in a zzso form in the other areas of the mature zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso of zzso is zzso regulated in the whole zzso As primary cultured zzso and zzso from cerebral zzso expressed zzso in a zzso form and in a zzso form, respectively, zzso zzso seems to be regulated differently depending on cell zzso To investigate the zzso process, cell lines expressing a zzso form of zzso would be favorable experimental zzso When a mouse zzso zzso was zzso into zzso 1, zzso and zzso zzso cells, only zzso zzso cells, a mouse zzso cell line, expressed zzso bearing zzso zzso In zzso cells, although three intrinsic zzso zzso were zzso zzso expressed zzso did not bear any short zzso chains just like zzso in the mature zzso This suggests that the addition of zzso chains to the zzso core protein is regulated in a manner different from that of other zzso zzso As the first step in investigating the zzso zzso mechanism using zzso zzso cells, we determined the zzso attachment site as zzso on the zzso core protein by zzso zzso The zzso zzso was not necessary for zzso trafficking of zzso to the cell surface at least in zzso zzso zzso
