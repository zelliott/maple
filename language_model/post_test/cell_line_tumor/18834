Human zzso 16 zzso zzso zzso is zzso and has an zzso in the E6 coding region with one zzso zzso site and two alternative 3' zzso sites, which produce zzso and zzso zzso If this zzso remains zzso the resulting zzso zzso expresses zzso zzso We found for the first time that the zzso zzso was efficiently spliced in zzso only when capped and that cellular zzso factors were involved in the zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was extremely efficient in cervical zzso cells, producing mostly zzso but inefficient in cells zzso with a common zzso expression zzso zzso due to the large size of this zzso zzso zzso Further studies showed that efficient zzso of the zzso zzso depends on the distance of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso cap, with an optimal distance of less than zzso in order to facilitate better association of zzso small nuclear zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso The same was true for zzso of human zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso provided more zzso zzso templates and promoted zzso translation, whereas a lack of zzso zzso produced a low level of zzso zzso Together, our data indicate that the distance between the zzso zzso cap and zzso zzso is rate limiting for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso takes advantage of its small zzso zzso to zzso efficient zzso for better zzso zzso
