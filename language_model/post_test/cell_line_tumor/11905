In this study, the effects of zzso on the expression of zzso phase zzso genes in human zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso revealed that the levels of zzso and zzso proteins and the level of zzso zzso were increased while the levels of zzso and zzso D1 proteins and zzso zzso were decreased in the cells treated with zzso These results showed that zzso could zzso the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the activity of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso gene which were necessary for cells entering into S phase, and so arrest the cells in zzso phase, and induce the differentiation of human zzso zzso zzso
