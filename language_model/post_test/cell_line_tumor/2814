zzso zzso zzso zzso the growth of a variety of cancer cells including human prostate zzso zzso substance zzso also exhibits zzso and zzso actions on multiple cancer cells including human prostate zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso regulated zzso expression in prostate cancer, an action that might contribute to its zzso zzso We identified a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso promoter that was highly similar to direct repeat zzso vitamin D response elements zzso The human zzso promoter containing the putative zzso was cloned into a zzso reporter zzso In zzso cells zzso with the vitamin D zzso zzso zzso promoter activity was zzso by zzso zzso of zzso factor 1, a key regulator of zzso increased zzso zzso promoter activity that was further zzso by zzso zzso or deletion of the zzso reduced zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso zzso responsiveness to a zzso zzso In gel shift zzso zzso and zzso X zzso bound to the zzso zzso and the binding was increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso and zzso X zzso were present on the zzso promoter in prostate cancer zzso In conclusion, we demonstrated that zzso is a target of zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso via a functional zzso that binds the zzso zzso of zzso by zzso may be an important component of the zzso actions of zzso in some zzso
