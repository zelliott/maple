zzso zzso of zzso zzso signaling zzso is commonly found in pancreatic zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso a highly specific inhibitor for zzso and zzso exerted growth zzso effects on three human zzso cell zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso but zzso genes implicated in zzso zzso zzso zzso and pancreatic cancer cell invasion and zzso Moreover, zzso enhanced invasion in zzso zzso cell lines that harbor a zzso zzso gene zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso cells that harbor a zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso transition zzso in zzso and zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso of zzso using zzso zzso the effects of zzso on zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso increased zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso and activated zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso completely blocked zzso induction by zzso When combined with zzso zzso inhibited the growth of zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso therapy could induce zzso and enhance pancreatic cancer cell invasion by zzso zzso zzso zzso and that combining zzso and zzso may represent a novel therapeutic strategy in zzso
