Lung cancer is 1 of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide, and the high mortality from this disease is caused mainly by the lack of efficient diagnostic strategies for zzso lung zzso The objective of the current study was to investigate the expression pattern and zzso significance of zzso protein H zzso in patients with zzso cell lung cancer zzso 

The expression profile of zzso in normal lung zzso cells, zzso cell lines, zzso zzso and adjacent zzso lung zzso were detected by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso real-time zzso and Western zzso zzso The expression level of zzso in 223 zzso zzso was measured by zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed to evaluate the zzso significance of zzso 

The expression level of zzso was much higher in cancer cell lines and lung cancer zzso than that in normal cells and adjacent zzso lung zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed positive zzso expression in 118 of 223 zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso expression was correlated strongly with clinical stage zzso tumor zzso zzso and zzso expression zzso zzso zzso Patients with lower zzso expression had better overall survival than patients with higher zzso zzso Further analysis suggested that zzso could predict prognosis only in patients with zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that zzso expression was an independent zzso marker for survival in patients with zzso 

The current results demonstrated that high zzso protein expression was related to poor outcome in patients with zzso zzso may be used as a zzso zzso for patients lung patients, especially those with zzso zzso
