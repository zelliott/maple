zzso zzso zzso is a widely used medicinal herb in several Asian countries including zzso The various medicinal properties attributed to zzso zzso include zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The present study investigated the zzso of zzso zzso water extract zzso on zzso zzso cancer cells and the zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the effects of zzso on cell cycle zzso especially the zzso phase, and on cell zzso 

zzso zzso was assessed by a standard zzso zzso utilizing zzso zzso zzso and expression of zzso D1 and zzso protein in zzso zzso cells was assessed by Western zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed to determine the effect of zzso on zzso cell cycle zzso zzso cell zzso activity was examined by zzso Cell zzso and migration was assessed by a scratch wound healing zzso 

zzso was not zzso The production of zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity were significantly decreased in a zzso zzso manner, with maximum zzso occurring at zzso zzso of 250 zzso and 500 zzso zzso inhibited cell cycle progression in the zzso phase and significantly inhibited the zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso D1 protein may be associated with zzso activity and cell zzso Thus, zzso promotes a strong protective effect against zzso zzso zzso and cell proliferation through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso may be a useful zzso agent for lung zzso
