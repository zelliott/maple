zzso is a zzso tumor and causes majority of deaths related to skin zzso zzso growth factor 2 zzso greatly contributes to melanoma growth and zzso In this paper, we attempt to evaluate the therapeutic potential of zzso zzso (named zzso using as a potent zzso zzso via exploration of its zzso effect on melanoma in zzso and in zzso 

Cell viability was measured by zzso Cell cycle progression was determined by zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso Western zzso was carried out to detect the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the expression of zzso zzso The influence of zzso on zzso zzso was assessed by separation of nuclear and zzso protein zzso followed by Western zzso Female zzso mice bearing zzso melanoma were established and used to evaluate the zzso effect of zzso in zzso 

In this study, we first proved that zzso peptides significantly inhibited proliferation of zzso melanoma cell line zzso Further investigations revealed that the mechanisms of zzso peptides zzso cell proliferation of melanoma cells zzso with zzso in zzso involved cell cycle arrest at the zzso phase, blockade of the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Finally, treatment of zzso peptides in a zzso melanoma model resulted in significant zzso of tumor growth and zzso in zzso which was associated with blockade of zzso protein zzso signal zzso and suppression of the expressions of zzso zzso protein and zzso factor in the melanoma zzso 

The zzso zzso with potent zzso and zzso activity may have therapeutic potential in zzso
