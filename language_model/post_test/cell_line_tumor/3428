zzso chewing is a widespread habit that has a zzso zzso tradition in Africa and the Middle zzso The biological effects of zzso are zzso investigated and zzso For the first time, we show that an organic extract of zzso zzso a selective type of cell death having all zzso and zzso features of zzso cell zzso zzso extract was shown to contain the major zzso compounds zzso and zzso The compounds alone and in combination also induced zzso zzso zzso occurred zzso in various human cell lines zzso zzso zzso within 8 h of zzso It was partially reversed after removal of zzso and the effect was dependent on de zzso protein zzso as demonstrated by zzso with zzso The cell death was blocked by the zzso inhibitor zzso and also by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The 50% zzso constant zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso was 8 zzso zzso M as compared to 2 zzso zzso M and 8 zzso zzso M, zzso Western zzso analysis showed a specific zzso of zzso in zzso cells, which was inhibited by zzso The cell death by zzso was more sensitively induced in zzso cell lines than in human peripheral blood zzso It is concluded that zzso zzso a rather swift and sensitive cell death by zzso through mechanisms involving zzso of zzso zzso and zzso
