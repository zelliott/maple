zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso and distinct entity among the aggressive zzso B cell zzso that occurs predominantly in patients with advanced zzso It shows zzso zzso zzso in body zzso and is resistant to conventional chemotherapy with a poor zzso Thus, the optimal treatment for zzso is not well defined and there is a need for novel zzso zzso has been recognized as the tumor caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear factor zzso zzso plays a critical role in the survival and growth of zzso zzso In this study, we assessed the zzso effect of zzso a naturally occurring zzso zzso on this zzso The zzso zzso showed that cell proliferation in the zzso cell lines was inhibited by zzso zzso also induced zzso zzso and suppressed zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso degradation, upstream targets of the zzso pathway, in zzso zzso In a zzso mouse model that showed zzso and diffuse organ invasion of zzso cells, treatment with zzso inhibited the growth and invasion of zzso cells significantly compared with zzso zzso These results show that the suppression of zzso is a molecular target for treating zzso and zzso is a potential zzso agent for zzso
