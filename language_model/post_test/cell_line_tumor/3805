zzso is a member of the zzso family of proteins that regulates the activity of zzso factors to suppress cellular differentiation and to promote cell zzso zzso of zzso in tumor cells zzso with increased zzso and resistance to chemotherapy and zzso zzso is an zzso generated by alternative zzso that differs from the classical zzso in the zzso zzso zzso whose function is at present zzso We have studied the role of zzso in cancer and its expression in zzso lung zzso zzso of zzso in zzso lung and zzso prostate cancer cells reduced zzso and independent proliferation and zzso zzso Moreover, it increased the proportion of cells in the zzso phase of the cell cycle and zzso levels, while reduced zzso and zzso A zzso Through zzso analysis, we identified genes involved in cell growth and proliferation that are specifically zzso as a consequence of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells that were treated with zzso zzso dose were significantly less resistant to cell zzso In zzso zzso demonstrated that tumors with high zzso levels exhibited less growth ( zzso zzso activity zzso zzso and zzso ( zzso compared to tumors with low zzso zzso mice survival was significantly extended ( zzso zzso by zzso revealed that expression of zzso was significantly lower ( zzso in human lung tumors compared to their matched zzso zzso In conclusion, our results demonstrate that zzso decreases the zzso of lung and prostate cancer cells, zzso them to zzso cell death, and zzso the zzso role of the classical form of zzso
