To combat threats posed by DNA damage, cells have evolved mechanisms, collectively termed DNA damage response zzso These mechanisms detect DNA zzso signal their presence, and promote their zzso zzso integrate zzso checkpoint control and repair signals in response to zzso stress, acting as an efficient control mechanism when zzso checkpoint function fails and zzso begins in the presence of damaged zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso protein involved in the regulation of gene transcription, induction of cell zzso and zzso Here we provide evidence that in addition to its nuclear zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso where it accumulates following DNA damage or zzso zzso We show that zzso depletion generates zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso depletion zzso the ability of zzso to bind zzso and to zzso at zzso which, in its turn, zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and advances entry into zzso Our results reinforce the notion that zzso plays an important role in zzso and that its contribution seems to be relevant for the zzso assembly zzso
