Lung cancer remains number one cause of cancer related deaths zzso Cell cycle deregulation plays a major role in the zzso of zzso Cell Lung Cancer zzso zzso represents a critical cell cycle regulator that enhances cell cycle zzso In this study we aimed to investigate the role of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso on the regulation of the zzso zzso and its impact on prognosis of zzso zzso 

Here we report a novel zzso transcript zzso with zzso 110 zzso zzso that we termed zzso in zzso zzso In 9 zzso of the 12 zzso cell lines, zzso expression accounted for more than zzso of the zzso zzso Biological effects of zzso were investigated in zzso and zzso cells using zzso radiation, zzso zzso treatment, and zzso zzso Compared to zzso zzso protein had longer zzso cells expressing zzso were more resistant to zzso zzso and showed more zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso zzso expression levels in 88 primary zzso zzso tissue zzso In patients with zzso Kaplan zzso zzso showed tumors expressing higher levels of zzso relative to the adjacent lung zzso to have significantly inferior overall survival zzso zzso zzso 

Here we identified zzso as a novel zzso zzso of zzso in zzso The zzso nature of the zzso could be a zzso indicator in zzso patients as well as a candidate target for future therapeutic zzso
