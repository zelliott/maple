zzso the spread and growth of tumor cells to distant organ sites, represents the most devastating attribute and plays a major role in the morbidity and mortality of zzso zzso is crucial for zzso tumor transformation and zzso Thus, blocking inflammation is expected to serve as an effective cancer zzso Among zzso therapies, zzso zzso is now beginning to emerge from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction and the resulting cell signaling cascade have emerged as highly relevant targets since they play zzso roles in zzso zzso The unique function of zzso is to promote the zzso of tumor cells to their zzso at the distant organ zzso 

We describe the actions of zzso zzso zzso a novel small zzso and partial zzso zzso with properties quite unlike that of any other reported zzso antagonists, which was prepared in a single chemical step using a reductive zzso zzso Its specificity toward zzso was tested in a binding affinity zzso and a zzso competition zzso using zzso zzso The potency of the compound was determined in two functional zzso zzso invasion zzso and zzso zzso The therapeutic potential of zzso was evaluated in three different zzso models for inflammation including an experimental zzso zzso induced paw zzso and zzso induced lung zzso and three different animal models for zzso including breast cancer zzso in zzso head and neck cancer zzso in zzso and zzso melanoma zzso in liver in which zzso was reported to play crucial zzso 

We developed a novel small zzso zzso that is a partial zzso zzso without zzso stem cells, which can be safer for long-term blockade of zzso than other reported zzso zzso
