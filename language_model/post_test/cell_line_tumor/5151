It has been proposed that zzso zzso disengagement at zzso licenses zzso for zzso in the next cell zzso Here we test whether such a mechanism exists in intact human zzso Loss of zzso blocked zzso disengagement during zzso exit and delayed assembly of new zzso during the following S zzso however, most engagements were eventually zzso We identified zzso zzso 1 zzso as a parallel zzso of zzso zzso Timed zzso of zzso mapped its critical period of action to late zzso or early M phase, zzso prior to zzso destruction and zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso when cells exited zzso after zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso disengagement failed completely, and subsequent zzso zzso in zzso was also zzso Our results indicate that zzso and zzso act at different times during M phase to license zzso duplication, reminiscent of their roles in removing zzso from zzso
