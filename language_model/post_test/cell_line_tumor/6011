zzso is a zzso cause of death in patients with zzso It is a complex zzso process that needs to be better understood if we are to develop new approaches to managing tumor zzso zzso cell invasion of the local zzso is suppressed by zzso response zzso zzso zzso Recently, we identified a long zzso of zzso zzso expression of which zzso with cancer cell zzso and poor clinical outcome in patients with zzso lung cancer zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso in zzso human cell lines enhanced zzso formation, cancer cell migration, and invasion via stabilization of zzso This effect required a highly zzso zzso region of zzso as well as the zzso family zzso zzso nucleation zzso zzso nucleation zzso Furthermore, zzso appeared to act downstream of zzso a zzso family protein known to be involved in zzso zzso In addition, zzso associated with zzso which zzso cancer cell zzso by interrupting the association of zzso and zzso Finally, we found that high-level expression of zzso and low-level expression of zzso were associated with zzso zzso zzso and poor survival in patients with zzso In sum, we show that zzso and zzso have opposing functions in regulating cancer cell invasion and zzso and propose that this zzso may serve as a potential zzso zzso
