The members of the zzso growth factor zzso family are prime targets for cancer zzso However, the therapeutic efficiency of the existing zzso agents is zzso Thus, identifying new molecules that zzso the zzso receptors through novel strategies is an important goal on cancer zzso In this study we have developed a shorter form of human zzso zzso with a truncated zzso as a novel zzso zzso zzso was designed based on the zzso of the three-dimensional structures of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso blocker previously described by our zzso The zzso was produced in zzso coli with a high yield of the correctly folded zzso zzso showed specificity and high affinity for zzso but induced poor zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso promoted zzso zzso and zzso to the cell nucleus although it did not stimulate the cell zzso In addition, zzso zzso with zzso native zzso zzso the proliferation of cancer zzso These data indicate that zzso may be a potential zzso blocker for cancer zzso In addition, the lack of zzso zzso activity makes zzso an excellent delivery agent to target toxins to zzso zzso zzso
