zzso zzso delivery of small interfering zzso zzso is regarded as one of the most important technologies for the development of zzso zzso In this work, a zzso modified gold zzso zzso zzso acid zzso complex was successfully developed using a zzso method for zzso zzso delivery of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso Atomic force microscopic and zzso potential analyses confirmed the formation of a zzso complex having a particle size of zzso zzso zzso and a negative surface charge of zzso zzso zzso With a negligible zzso zzso complex showed an excellent zzso gene zzso efficiency of zzso zzso in the presence of 50 zzso % serum, which was statistically much higher than that of zzso 2000 zzso In the competitive binding tests with free zzso zzso zzso and zzso coupled zzso zzso zzso confirmed the zzso zzso delivery of zzso complex to zzso cells with zzso zzso Moreover, the systemic delivery of zzso complex using zzso B zzso zzso as a model drug resulted in a significantly reduced zzso zzso level in the liver zzso Taken together, zzso complex was thought to be developed as zzso zzso zzso for the systemic treatment of various liver zzso
