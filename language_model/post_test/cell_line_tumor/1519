zzso human bone zzso proteins zzso are zzso for specific spinal fusion procedures, but their use is zzso in spine tumor zzso beds because of an unclear interaction between tumor tissue and such growth zzso Interestingly, a number of studies have suggested that zzso may slow the growth of zzso in zzso and these zzso represent the majority of zzso spine zzso In this study, the authors hypothesized that zzso placed in an zzso spine tumor in the rat could suppress tumor and delay the onset of zzso in such zzso 

Twenty-six female nude zzso rats were zzso into an experimental group zzso 1) or a positive control group zzso zzso Group 1 zzso + 15 zzso zzso zzso 13 zzso underwent zzso exposure and zzso of breast zzso zzso into the zzso spine segment, followed by the zzso of a bovine collagen sponge impregnated with 15 zzso of zzso Group 2 zzso + zzso zzso zzso 13 zzso underwent zzso exposure and tumor zzso in the zzso spine but no local treatment with zzso An additional 8 animals were zzso into 2 negative control groups zzso 3 and zzso Group 3 (15 zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso and Group 4 zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso underwent zzso exposure of the zzso spine along with the zzso of zzso and zzso bovine collagen zzso zzso Neither of the negative control groups was implanted with zzso The zzso zzso scale was used to monitor daily motor function zzso and the time to zzso zzso score zzso zzso 

In comparison with the positive control animals zzso zzso the experimental animals zzso 1) had statistically significant longer mean zzso zzso zzso vs 13 zzso zzso days, p zzso zzso and median (20 vs 13 zzso times to zzso In addition, the median survival time was significantly longer in the experimental animals (20 vs zzso days, p zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated bone growth and tumor zzso in the experimental animals, whereas bone destruction and zzso zzso were observed in the positive control zzso Neither of the negative control groups zzso 3 and 4) demonstrated any evidence of neurological zzso zzso or zzso compromise on either gross or zzso zzso 

This study shows that the local administration of zzso (15 zzso 10 zzso of zzso zzso in a rat spine tumor model of breast cancer not only fails to stimulate local tumor growth, but also decreases local tumor growth and delays the onset of zzso in zzso This zzso experiment is the first to show that the local placement of zzso in a spine tumor bed may slow tumor progression and delay associated neurological zzso
