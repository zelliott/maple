Previously we have shown that zzso zzso that bind to LDL receptors have the ability to concentrate in acute zzso leukemia cells and in zzso and breast zzso Thus, zzso may be used as a vehicle for drugs directed against zzso zzso Indeed, we subsequently showed that when zzso is associated with zzso the toxicity of the drug is significantly reduced in patients with advanced zzso The aim of the present study was to verify whether zzso may be taken up by multiple myeloma cells and whether patients with multiple myeloma respond to treatment with zzso associated with zzso 

A total of 131 consecutive volunteer patients with recently diagnosed multiple myeloma classified as clinical stage zzso had their plasma zzso profile zzso zzso plasma zzso were performed in 14 of zzso Cell zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso associated with the emulsion were evaluated in a multiple myeloma cell zzso A zzso study of zzso was performed in three zzso Finally, an exploratory clinical study of zzso zzso dose 180 zzso body surface every 4 weeks) was performed in seven zzso multiple myeloma zzso 

LDL cholesterol was lower in the 131 multiple myeloma patients than in healthy controls and the fractional clearance rate zzso in units per zzso in the 14 multiple myeloma patients was twice that in 14 paired healthy control zzso Moreover, entry of zzso into multiple myeloma cells was shown to be zzso by LDL zzso Taken together, these findings indicate that zzso may target multiple zzso The exploratory clinical study showed that zzso decreased by zzso zzso zzso after three cycles and by zzso zzso zzso after six zzso Furthermore, there was zzso of symptoms in all zzso zzso zzso increased after treatment, suggesting that the treatment resulted in at least partial destruction of zzso cells with zzso zzso Side effects of the treatment were zzso 

Because it targets multiple myeloma and, when associated with an zzso agent, produces therapeutic responses in patients with fewer side effects, zzso has the potential for use as a drug vehicle in the treatment of the zzso
