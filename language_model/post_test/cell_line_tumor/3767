Mouse double minute 2 zzso is zzso in many zzso tumors, and zzso levels are associated with poor prognosis of several human zzso including breast zzso In the present study, we investigated the function of zzso in vascular zzso growth factor zzso tumor zzso of breast cancer and the potential value of zzso as an zzso therapy target for cancer therapy by zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso or other zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated for their in zzso and in zzso zzso activities in different human breast cancer models with a different zzso zzso zzso cell line containing zzso zzso and zzso cell line containing zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were incubated with different zzso of zzso or zzso for various periods of zzso zzso gene and protein expression in tumor cells was measured by zzso and Western zzso The level of zzso protein zzso in the culture zzso of treated cells was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso models were further established to determine their effects on tumor growth and zzso zzso levels of zzso were measured by zzso zzso expression and zzso density in tumor zzso were studied by zzso Both zzso and tumor growth were digitally zzso 

In both zzso and zzso cells, zzso expression and zzso were reduced, resulting from specific zzso of zzso expression by zzso In zzso zzso after administration of zzso zzso production reduced and zzso activity occurred in nude mice bearing zzso or zzso zzso However, in both models treated with zzso zzso production was not changed and zzso activity was not zzso 

In zzso the zzso construct targeting zzso specifically suppresses zzso expression in zzso and zzso tumor zzso in zzso in breast zzso Furthermore, the suppression of zzso expression subsequent to zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells suggests that zzso has a regulatory role on zzso expression through a zzso zzso
