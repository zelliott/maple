zzso for good candidate zzso for zzso of acute zzso leukemia are high expression on zzso stem cells in the majority of patients with acute zzso leukemia and low or no expression in vital zzso It was shown in vaccination trials that zzso for zzso Acid zzso zzso zzso generates cellular immune responses in patients with acute zzso leukemia and that these responses correlate with clinical zzso It is not clear however whether this response actually targets the zzso stem cell, especially since it was reported that zzso is expressed zzso during the zzso phase of the cell zzso In addition, tumor specificity of zzso expression remains relatively zzso 

zzso zzso and bone zzso samples were collected from both acute zzso leukemia patients and healthy zzso zzso expression was assessed at protein and zzso levels on various sorted zzso either fresh or after zzso 

High levels of zzso were expressed by zzso and zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso However, only baseline expression of zzso was measured in zzso zzso stem cells, and was not different from that in zzso zzso stem cells from healthy zzso zzso was significantly zzso in zzso cells from healthy donors during in zzso expansion and during in zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrated an explicit increase in the expression level of zzso after in zzso zzso of T zzso 

zzso does not fulfill the criteria of an ideal target zzso for zzso of acute zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso stem cells does not differ significantly from the expression in zzso stem cells from healthy zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso cells of healthy donors and activated T cells further compromises zzso zzso zzso
