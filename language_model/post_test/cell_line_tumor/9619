The zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been used in China to treat benign zzso zzso zzso for over zzso In this study, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso was extracted successively with zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso extract showed strong activity in decreasing the zzso of prostate specific zzso zzso in zzso cells as compared to two other zzso measured by zzso with zzso as positive control in the zzso Five zzso were subsequently isolated from the active extract using zzso zzso They were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso All these compounds inhibited zzso zzso significantly, with zzso values in the range of zzso zzso zzso 2, 4 and 5 showed moderate zzso to zzso cells within the active concentration range, while compounds 1 and 3 showed no zzso Further studies on the mechanism action of these compounds were performed by evaluating their zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities on zzso zzso zzso in zzso reporter gene zzso All compounds described here were first isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
