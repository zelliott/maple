zzso is a zzso factor whose expression is lost in more than zzso of breast zzso Our previous work demonstrated that the zzso of zzso in zzso cells resulted in cell death through a zzso zzso zzso To determine whether zzso zzso pathways are involved in zzso cell death, we engineered a zzso breast cancer cell line, zzso to zzso express zzso zzso of zzso expression led to cell death with features typical of zzso within 24 zzso and the expression levels of zzso zzso and its target genes either decreased or remained zzso To decipher zzso zzso the zzso cells were treated with a variety of zzso zzso Besides a general zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso largely abolished zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso had no significant zzso Western zzso analysis further confirmed that zzso 2 and 8 were activated after the induction of zzso zzso Further, several small interfering zzso which specifically silenced zzso 2 and zzso 8 expression significantly blocked zzso zzso zzso expression could also sensitize cells to tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso by at least zzso These results indicate that expression of zzso can induce zzso through an zzso mechanism zzso by zzso 2 and zzso
