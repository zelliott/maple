We previously characterized zzso a zzso zzso cell zzso zzso cells exhibit lower expression of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso binding protein 5 zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso compared with zzso cells after treatment with the synthetic zzso zzso confirming that the cells have low sensitivity to zzso To understand the mechanism underlying low zzso sensitivity of zzso cells, we examined the activities of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso signaling zzso all of which are known to be linked to zzso zzso zzso We found that the zzso of zzso at zzso was markedly lower in zzso cells than in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso resulted in reduction of zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by serum zzso led to the induction of zzso expression in zzso zzso These results suggest that the impaired zzso zzso in zzso cells is associated with low zzso zzso
