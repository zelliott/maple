Liver zzso zzso is zzso positioned to control access of zzso zzso and cells to the liver zzso and to serve clearance functions upstream of the zzso While clearance of zzso debris from the peripheral blood is performed by liver zzso zzso cells zzso using a delicate zzso zzso system featuring zzso and zzso the zzso zzso and zzso vascular zzso and cell trafficking are controlled by zzso zzso zzso the zzso and by zzso zzso zzso In contrast to blood vascular and zzso zzso cells in other zzso the zzso complexes of zzso have not yet been consistently characterized in molecular zzso In a comprehensive analysis, we here show that zzso express the typical proteins found in zzso zzso junctions zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso and zzso Tight junction zzso zzso proteins typical of zzso cells, zzso zzso and zzso were not expressed by rat zzso while zzso zzso for zzso was detected in human zzso In contrast, zzso molecules zzso zzso with zzso such as zzso B and C and zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso were readily detected in zzso zzso among the zzso zzso was considerably zzso in zzso as compared to lung zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, we show here that zzso form a special kind of zzso zzso junctions characterized by zzso of zzso zzso zzso and of zzso and zzso and zzso The distinct molecular architecture of the zzso zzso complexes of zzso corroborates previous zzso findings and provides the molecular basis for further analyses of the zzso barrier function of liver zzso under zzso conditions ranging from zzso inflammation to formation of liver zzso
