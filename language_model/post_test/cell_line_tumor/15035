zzso zzso is an approach to study selective cell killing based on zzso Previous work in our laboratory has shown that loss of zzso is zzso lethal with zzso zzso while exhibiting no impact on cell growth and viability in zzso zzso We now show that this same zzso lethal relationship is evident in cells with deficiencies in zzso or zzso which implicates zzso zzso and zzso in an zzso relationship with one zzso When zzso was depleted in zzso or zzso cells, a severe reduction in zzso efficiency was observed, with many zzso attempts at cell division apparent in the zzso zzso In contrast, when zzso was depleted in a zzso or zzso background, a negligible decrease in colony survival was zzso The frequency of zzso zzso zzso zzso formation and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was decreased by 3- and zzso respectively, when zzso was knocked down in zzso or zzso cells, with minimal effect in zzso or zzso zzso zzso function was independent of zzso status, as evidenced by the lack of any zzso in zzso zzso formation in zzso zzso zzso these findings suggest that zzso is an alternative repair zzso of zzso HR, and a target for therapy in cells deficient in the zzso repair zzso
