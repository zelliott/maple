It has been previously shown that zzso gamma zzso induce zzso cell death in a variety of cancer zzso Given the evidence that these zzso have a zzso function, we further examined the specific role of zzso gamma zzso in this biological zzso Surprisingly, we failed to demonstrate that zzso breast cancer cells undergo zzso when treated with zzso doses of zzso and zzso which are synthetic zzso gamma zzso zzso orange zzso zzso showed zzso zzso formation within zzso cells, indicative of zzso zzso This was confirmed by zzso formation as indicated by zzso of zzso an zzso zzso and the appearance of zzso zzso zzso by electron zzso following exposure to zzso To determine the mechanism by which zzso gamma zzso zzso we zzso primary zzso zzso cells with a zzso active zzso of zzso gamma and screened gene expression associated with zzso gamma zzso by zzso array zzso zzso alpha and zzso were among 42 genes zzso by active zzso zzso zzso of zzso gamma induced zzso alpha and zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso by zzso abolished the zzso formation induced by zzso gamma zzso In zzso our data shows a specific induction of zzso by zzso gamma zzso in breast cancer cells providing an understanding of distinct roles of zzso gamma in zzso
