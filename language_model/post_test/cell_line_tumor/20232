The zzso zzso are thought to play an important biological role in zzso and zzso zzso in cell signaling and in modulating biological properties of cancer zzso zzso a zzso zzso is zzso in pancreatic tumors, while remaining zzso in the normal zzso thus indicating a potential role in pancreatic cancer zzso The molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of zzso gene are not yet fully zzso Smoking is strongly correlated with pancreatic cancer and in the present study; we zzso the molecular mechanisms by which nicotine as well as agents like zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso induce the expression of zzso in pancreatic cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and real-time zzso showed that zzso factors zzso and zzso can positively regulate zzso expression at the zzso zzso zzso and zzso could collaborate with nicotine in zzso the expression of zzso utilizing zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso the induction of zzso zzso induction of zzso appeared to require zzso zzso zzso zzso Further, zzso and zzso family zzso also zzso the induction of zzso since zzso these signaling molecules prevented the induction of zzso zzso was also found to be necessary for the zzso invasion of pancreatic cancer cells, suggesting that induction of zzso by nicotine and other agents might contribute to the genesis and progression of pancreatic zzso 

Our studies show that agents that can promote the growth and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells induce the zzso gene through multiple pathways and this induction requires the zzso activity of zzso and zzso Further, the zzso as well as zzso signaling pathways appear to be involved in the induction of this zzso It appears that targeting these signaling pathways might inhibit the expression of zzso and prevent the proliferation and invasion of pancreatic cancer zzso
