zzso zzso are used against human cancer, but their mechanisms of action are not entirely zzso For example, the role of the tumor zzso zzso is zzso We reevaluated the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso by using zzso human cancer cell lines with different zzso zzso We found that well-known zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso as well as the recently discovered zzso inhibitor zzso induced zzso zzso in human cancer cell lines that correlated with zzso induction of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso In addition, these drugs inhibited growth of several cancer cell lines independently of zzso zzso zzso zzso induced more potent zzso in zzso cells with zzso zzso than in parental cells with zzso zzso Our data confirm that zzso zzso generally induce zzso zzso in human cancer zzso
