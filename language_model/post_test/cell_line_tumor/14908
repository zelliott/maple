zzso behavior refers to the emergence of complex migration patterns over scales larger than those of the individual elements zzso a zzso It plays a pivotal role in biological systems in regulating various processes such as zzso zzso and tissue zzso Here, by combining experimental approaches and zzso zzso we explore the role of cell density zzso strength of zzso zzso zzso and boundary conditions imposed by zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso in regulating the emergence of collective behavior within zzso cell zzso Our results show that the geometrical confinement of cells into zzso circles zzso a persistent, coordinated and synchronized rotation of cells that depends on cell zzso The speed of such rotating large-scale movements slows down as the density zzso Furthermore, such collective rotation behavior depends on the size of the zzso zzso we observe a rotating motion of the overall cell population in the same direction for sizes of up to 200 zzso The rotating cells move as a solid body, with a uniform angular zzso Interestingly, this upper limit leads to length scales that are similar to the natural correlation length observed for zzso zzso cell zzso This behavior is strongly altered in cells that present a zzso of zzso junctions and in zzso cell zzso We anticipate that our system provides a simple and easy approach to investigate collective cell behavior in a zzso and systematic zzso
