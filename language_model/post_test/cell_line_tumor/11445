zzso zzso zzso can be a useful treatment for aggressive forms of chronic zzso leukemia zzso However, their mechanism of action is not well zzso and resistance to zzso is zzso In a zzso zzso culture system, the synthetic zzso zzso zzso was found to decrease the zzso activity of zzso cells, indicated by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and activity, decreased levels of zzso and its zzso and loss of zzso membrane zzso This zzso restriction was associated with decreased size and death of some of the tumor cells in the zzso zzso plasma membrane damage increased killing of zzso cells by zzso However, the nuclear zzso zzso zzso activated zzso zzso zzso which regulates fatty acid zzso was also increased by zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid protected zzso cells from zzso zzso and fatty acid zzso zzso zzso increased zzso killing of zzso cells in zzso and clearance of zzso zzso in zzso These findings suggest that zzso prevent tumor cells from generating the energy needed to repair membrane damage, fatty acid zzso is a mechanism of resistance to zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of zzso
