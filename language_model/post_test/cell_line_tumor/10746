zzso zzso zzso zzso is the most prevalent viral pathogen associated with acute zzso conjunctivitis zzso zzso Sixteen years after its first outbreak in Brazil, this agent zzso in 2003 in Brazil, spread to nearly all states and caused outbreaks until zzso In 2009, a new outbreak occurred in the northeast region of the zzso In this study, we performed a viral isolation in cell culture and characterized clinical samples collected from patients presenting symptoms during the outbreak of 2005 in zzso zzso Santo State zzso and the outbreak of 2009 in zzso zzso State zzso We also performed a zzso analysis of worldwide strains and all meaningful Brazilian zzso since zzso 

zzso cotton zzso were used to collect eye zzso and all 210 clinical samples were used to inoculate cell zzso zzso effects in zzso cells were seen in 58 of 180 zzso samples from zzso and 3 of 30 zzso samples from zzso zzso analysis based on a zzso of the zzso and zzso gene revealed that the zzso causing outbreaks in Brazil during the years 2003, 2004 and 2005 evolved from Asian zzso that had caused the South Korean outbreak of zzso during the summer of zzso However, the 2009 outbreak of zzso in zzso was originated from the zzso of a new zzso strain that was circulating during 2007 in Asia, where zzso outbreaks has been continuously reported since zzso 

This study is the first zzso analysis of zzso outbreaks caused by zzso in zzso The results showed that Asian strains of zzso were responsible for the outbreaks since 1987 and were independently introduced to Brazil in 2003 and zzso zzso analysis of complete zzso gene is a useful tool for studying the epidemiology of zzso associated with zzso
