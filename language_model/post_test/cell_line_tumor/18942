zzso zzso zzso is rare, yet lethal despite aggressive zzso zzso targeting may be beneficial using the zzso zzso a zzso X zzso zzso as a novel zzso In this report, we describe the efficacy of zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso and assess the in zzso treatment effects on a responsive zzso Additionally, we explore potential zzso of the zzso effect on a responsive zzso zzso cancer using comparative zzso zzso 

zzso zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso were treated with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors were treated with control zzso or zzso containing a low dose (30 zzso or a high dose zzso zzso of zzso Comparative zzso analysis of zzso cells treated with zzso compared with zzso control was assessed after 24 h of treatment to evaluate early gene expression zzso 

zzso zzso tumor growth was inhibited by zzso treatment in a zzso zzso Comparative zzso analysis showed that 80 genes had a significant increase in expression and 29 genes had a decrease in expression after 24 h of treatment with zzso zzso of zzso 4 zzso zzso was increased zzso A trend towards an increase in zzso zzso (not statistically zzso was seen in treated tumors in zzso and this correlated with decreased tumor zzso and increased zzso 

zzso therapy decreases proliferation in an zzso zzso cancer cell line that expresses zzso X zzso and this effect is confirmed with decreased tumor size in zzso in a nude mouse zzso zzso is increased in zzso in response to zzso and may be a potential zzso of the effects of zzso zzso
