We previously showed that prolonged and strong zzso zzso induced by zzso 5 zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso was involved in its mechanism of cell growth zzso To study the relationship between zzso zzso and cell growth zzso we used zzso 5 as a tool to investigate zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso caused by zzso 5 induced zzso zzso but suppressed zzso expression at the zzso and protein zzso Furthermore, zzso 5 inhibited zzso zzso activity and DNA binding ability, and this zzso was antagonized by zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso that the zzso zzso was involved in regulating zzso zzso Since the participation of zzso protein in zzso requires its zzso with Max zzso we examined the zzso association in zzso zzso cells and found that zzso 5 suppressed zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso which has lost its zzso sites, attenuated the actions of zzso 5 on zzso zzso To further demonstrate whether zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to directly regulate zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to examine the binding of zzso to the zzso promoter zzso We found that zzso induced by zzso 5 had lost its ability to bind to the zzso promoter, whereas zzso inhibitor zzso antagonized this zzso zzso These data suggest that an increase in zzso zzso in response to prolonged zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso leading to the suppression of its target gene expression and cell cycle zzso
