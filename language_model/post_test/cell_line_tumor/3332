The expression of zzso genes was evaluated in rat zzso cell lines in order to establish an in zzso model for investigating the regulation of zzso zzso expression in this zzso Two rat zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso and three zzso rat zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso were zzso The zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes was studied by zzso zzso real-time zzso and zzso zzso zzso were correlated with zzso expression of rat gastric and zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso was examined by zzso zzso zzso We showed that zzso of zzso and zzso were zzso expressed in all zzso cell populations but periodic acid Schiff zzso of these cells did not reveal the presence of zzso zzso cells expressed zzso zzso and zzso expressed the same zzso but the level of zzso was much zzso zzso zzso expression also differed in relation with the length of zzso zzso studies revealed the presence of gastric and zzso zzso in the two zzso cell zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso release of zzso in zzso but not in zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso but decreased zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the expression of zzso and zzso genes was reduced by more than tenfold after 24 zzso The increased expression of zzso gene was confirmed by Northern zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso cells provide a valuable cellular model for research on rat zzso zzso and zzso
