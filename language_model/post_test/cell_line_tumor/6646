Human melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer and is extremely resistant to radiation and zzso One of the critical parameters of this resistance is zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso normal human zzso and human melanoma cell lines, we investigated zzso regulation of zzso a regulator of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with human zzso protein and prevents its export from the zzso to the cell zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso protein zzso from the zzso apparatus via the zzso network to the cell zzso zzso of zzso functions by dominant negative zzso zzso blocks zzso export, whereas the zzso of zzso expression by specific zzso interference restores zzso export (a phenomenon that could still be zzso in the presence of zzso zzso Based on the zzso and zzso regulation of zzso zzso we have created human melanoma lines with different levels of surface expression of zzso Treatment of these melanoma lines with soluble zzso zzso resulted in programmed cell death that was zzso to the pre-existing levels of surface zzso Taking into consideration the well known observations that zzso expression is often zzso in zzso tumors, we have established a zzso connection between high zzso zzso zzso factor activity (which is a hallmark of many types of zzso zzso and zzso zzso regulation of zzso gene expression that finally restricts zzso protein trafficking, zzso zzso the survival of cancer zzso
