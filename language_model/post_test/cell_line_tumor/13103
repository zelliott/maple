Early detection of zzso cancer is difficult zzso to the lack of specific and sensitive tests zzso Previously, we found expression of zzso 4 to be increased in zzso cancer compared with normal zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and quantitative zzso validated the zzso of zzso 4 zzso zzso in zzso cancer compared with normal zzso cell lines and zzso zzso levels of zzso 4 were elevated in zzso cancer cell lines and tissue compared with normal zzso cell lines as demonstrated by Western zzso flow zzso and zzso zzso of tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 was zzso in a number of patient serum samples by zzso zzso zzso In patients with benign zzso diseases with high serum zzso levels, zzso 4 was not detected in the majority of cases, suggesting that zzso 4 may serve as a potential zzso that helps discriminate benign zzso diseases from zzso cancer in a panel with zzso
