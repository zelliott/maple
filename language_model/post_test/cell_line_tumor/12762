This study zzso a developed surface zzso zzso zzso phase zzso to observe zzso zzso The developed zzso phase zzso is highly sensitive to cell membrane contact with zzso and also provides long-term phase stability to achieve zzso living cell zzso As such, an zzso intensity and phase sensitivity comparison demonstrates that the sensitivity of the phase measurement can be zzso greater than that of the intensity zzso Also, a more than zzso cell zzso observation via the zzso phase zzso is zzso To implement the incident angle from zzso to zzso zzso contact images corresponding to the surface zzso resonance zzso angles are obtained by utilizing the zzso phase zzso According to the information of the corresponding zzso angle image and a zzso zzso the contact distances between a living melanoma cell and a bovine serum zzso zzso at four different locations have been zzso
