A series of potential zzso zzso agents, zzso zzso zzso derivatives of zzso has been prepared by zzso of zzso zzso with the appropriate zzso in zzso zzso 6 was obtained by heating at 100 degrees C in zzso yielded by the zzso of zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso properties of 2 have been examined using a zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso of these derivatives against human zzso prostate zzso cell line zzso are described and compared to that of parent drug zzso We selected the most zzso target derivatives zzso the in zzso inactive zzso and reference compound zzso to investigate whether in zzso treatment with these drugs was able to induce zzso and/or zzso cell zzso To this purpose, we evaluated the percentage of zzso cells in zzso treated with the target compounds zzso and reference compound zzso by zzso V zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso flow zzso analysis and zzso gel zzso
