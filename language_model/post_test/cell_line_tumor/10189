zzso expression in zzso zzso cells is zzso correlated with the zzso potential of zzso to the zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether loss of zzso expression in zzso zzso cells is secondary to DNA zzso of zzso islands in the zzso zzso zzso cells have high levels of zzso expression and do not form lung zzso when injected zzso whereas zzso cells have low levels of zzso expression and do produce lung zzso Using the zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso chain zzso zzso zzso we found that all four zzso sites in the zzso sequence in the zzso promoter region were zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso We performed detailed analysis of the 28 and 46 zzso sites in the zzso promoter and first zzso region, respectively, using zzso zzso DNA zzso More than zzso of the examined zzso sites were zzso and there was no difference of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells as well as zzso zzso lung tumor tissue zzso Treatment of zzso cells and another zzso cell line, zzso with low levels of zzso zzso with zzso agent, zzso zzso did not change the zzso expression and did not increase sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, our data indicate that decreased zzso expression in zzso cells is not secondary to DNA zzso of zzso islands in the zzso gene and that zzso expression cannot be increased by using zzso zzso
