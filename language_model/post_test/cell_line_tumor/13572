This study evaluated the effects of a zzso target of zzso inhibitor zzso alone or in combination with zzso on stem cells from zzso primary breast cancer cells and the zzso breast cancer cell line in zzso and in zzso For the in zzso studies, we sorted zzso cells as stem cells from primary breast cancer cells and zzso cells using flow zzso The zzso zzso was used to zzso the zzso effect of the drugs on total cells and stem cells zzso Stem cell zzso cell cycle zzso and their zzso after treatment were investigated by flow zzso or soft zzso colony formation zzso For the in zzso studies, zzso mice were injected with zzso stem cells, and the different treatments were zzso After zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was analyzed by zzso For the in zzso studies, Treatment with zzso resulted in stem cell growth zzso in a zzso zzso The combination of zzso with zzso was more effective at zzso cell growth zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso In addition, an increase in zzso cell cycle arrest and an increased population of cells in early zzso were seen in the combination treatment group compared with either of the zzso groups zzso zzso zzso For the in zzso studies, zzso plus zzso therapy was much more effective at reducing tumor volume in mice compared with either single agent alone zzso zzso zzso Compared with zzso alone, the combination of zzso and zzso reduced the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso has effective zzso effects on zzso stem cells in zzso and zzso zzso plus zzso is a rational combination treatment that may be promising in human clinical zzso
