An efficient modified route based on the targeting mechanism of zzso zzso for the shift from the zzso activity to the zzso one was further zzso Using a fused zzso ring, zzso as a zzso zzso of zzso the title compounds, zzso 2, zzso zzso 3, zzso zzso and their corresponding zzso products zzso were designed and zzso zzso zzso a zzso of fused zzso zzso occurred by a sulfur zzso reaction gave new zzso fused zzso related to zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso zzso The in zzso zzso activity against zzso zzso and zzso cell lines was also evaluated for the zzso zzso zzso compared to parent zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the results displayed that zzso fused zzso compounds showed more significant growth zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than that of parent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the active order decreased from zzso to zzso to zzso zzso
