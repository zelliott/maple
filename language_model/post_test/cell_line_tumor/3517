zzso cells are known to play an active role as zzso cells in allergic inflammation and in diverse zzso and pathological zzso zzso mast zzso zzso zzso are important zzso factors of progression of allergic zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso zzso zzso and zzso can be induced by calcium stimulation in zzso cells, and high molecular weight zzso zzso zzso can inhibit the production of these zzso We provided evidence that the zzso of zzso and zzso from zzso cells was induced by zzso zzso or zzso inhibitor zzso Treatment of zzso (10 zzso prior to stimulation with calcium zzso significantly blocked the zzso of zzso by zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso or zzso was inhibited by zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso respectively, compared to absence of zzso These results suggest that zzso has potential regulatory effects on allergic inflammatory diseases by zzso zzso mast cell zzso
