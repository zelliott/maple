zzso zzso as an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso through interaction with the zzso zzso has been used in the treatment of zzso Recently, therapeutic strategies in zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso In order to study the effect of zzso on zzso infected zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso in medium containing 50 zzso zzso for more than 2 zzso zzso DNA was eliminated in about zzso of the cells in the zzso zzso The cells were cloned from such cultures, and only zzso clones could be isolated in 102 examined zzso No differences were observed in the zzso state, zzso zzso or cell growth between zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso However, relative to parental zzso cells, the zzso zzso clones were almost eight times resistant to growth zzso by zzso according to the zzso value, and the expression of the zzso component of zzso increased more than two to three zzso These results indicate that zzso not only efficiently eliminates the zzso zzso from zzso cells but also zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance was accompanied by zzso of the zzso component of zzso However, the zzso clones were sensitive to zzso another inhibitor of zzso and this seems highly relevant to zzso combination in the use of these zzso
