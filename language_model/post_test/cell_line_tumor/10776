The synthesis and characterization of a number of zzso zzso complexes containing a series of zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso is zzso The structure of compounds have been confirmed by zzso analysis zzso and zzso as well as X-ray zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso is zzso The interaction of the complexes zzso zzso zzso is zzso and 4 with calf zzso DNA, human serum zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA were studied by zzso gel zzso and zzso zzso The apparent binding constant for the interaction with DNA was determined to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso K for 3 and 4 zzso The complexes bind strongly to zzso with binding zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso at 296 K for 3 and 4 zzso The in zzso zzso activity of 3 and 4 has been evaluated against two human colon cancer cell line zzso and zzso with zzso values in the range of zzso zzso Both 3 and 4 show good activity as a zzso inhibitor of human zzso II at zzso as low as 20 zzso The proficiency of 3 and 4 to act as zzso agents was also evaluated against six zzso bacterial strains with the best activity seen against zzso zzso
