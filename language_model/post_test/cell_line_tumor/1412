The discovery and zzso of a series of zzso zzso as novel zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso exploration of hit compound zzso identified the optimal structure of zzso as a potent zzso zzso zzso lead compounds zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso position, respectively, were shown to induce zzso arrest at the zzso zzso phase and lead to an zzso of zzso cells in the zzso zzso More significantly, these lead compounds zzso zzso and zzso exhibit impressive zzso against a panel of cancer cells including zzso zzso cells, with potency greater than or equal to clinically studied zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated that derivatives of zzso disrupt zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and induce zzso via induction of zzso zzso in tumor zzso The zzso leads zzso and zzso strongly inhibited the growth of human zzso zzso cells in a mouse zzso zzso
