The zzso has been recognized as a zzso target in cancer cells, and this has led to searches for zzso agents that target this cellular zzso for cancer therapeutic zzso zzso are a group of microbial zzso consisting of two related families, the zzso and the zzso Some members of this group have revealed zzso efficacy in tumor cells, and more recently it was discovered that they exert zzso zzso Based on this therapeutic promise and to gain further understanding of their molecular modes of action, we chemically zzso zzso three novel zzso zzso and characterized their zzso and in zzso zzso activity in human cell lines representing multiple zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results show that two of these novel compounds are able to inhibit zzso activity in the zzso range, reduce the expression of zzso proteins zzso and zzso and cause severe zzso zzso zzso stress, resulting in pronounced tumor cell zzso These zzso effects can be zzso enhanced when the agents are combined with zzso which further zzso zzso stress by a different zzso Taken together, our findings support the notion that zzso zzso may provide a structural platform for the development of novel cancer zzso and that their efficacy may be further increased when zzso with other agents that trigger zzso zzso
