Breast cancer zzso resistance 4 zzso was identified in a search for genes involved in zzso resistance in breast zzso We explored whether zzso is zzso for tamoxifen resistance and zzso for zzso zzso and studied its zzso 

zzso zzso levels were measured in primary breast zzso and evaluated for association with zzso survival zzso and clinical benefit in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso receiving tamoxifen as zzso zzso for advanced zzso In a separate cohort of patients with zzso zzso zzso cancer, and not receiving systemic zzso therapy, zzso levels were evaluated for association with distant zzso survival zzso The function of zzso was studied with zzso and zzso interference in a cell zzso 

zzso analyses established high zzso zzso levels as an independent zzso factor for poor zzso after start of tamoxifen therapy for zzso zzso High zzso zzso levels were associated with poor MFS and overall survival, reflecting zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso of zzso zzso zzso viral zzso zzso zzso zzso and their downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 and zzso zzso zzso viral zzso zzso zzso 1/2, was zzso Selective zzso of zzso or zzso inhibited zzso confirming their role in zzso tamoxifen zzso 

zzso may have clinical relevance for zzso aggressiveness and tamoxifen zzso Our cell model suggests that zzso breast zzso are driven by zzso zzso Patients with such zzso may benefit from zzso zzso
