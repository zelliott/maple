When cells zzso zzso and genetic profiles can be dramatically zzso Nevertheless, a recent report identifying zzso in breast cancer cells was unexpected, revealing differentiation features normally associated with B zzso To extend these findings, we focused on zzso variable zzso region gene analysis using zzso breast cancer cell lines expressing the zzso marker, zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso gene transcripts were identifiable by zzso reverse zzso either as single or dual zzso diversity zzso and joining zzso zzso in four of six lines, most being potentially zzso zzso transcripts were observed in sequential cultures, indicating stable zzso To exclude zzso zzso each cell line was shown to be zzso negative, with zzso and zzso zzso also absent by flow zzso zzso zzso transcripts were then sought in individual tumor cells, isolated as zzso single cells by flow zzso zzso in three of three selected cell lines, zzso genes were identifiable in a significant fraction zzso zzso of single zzso In five of six identified zzso zzso zzso zzso were apparent with no zzso variation, indicating zzso of zzso zzso zzso transcripts were zzso and zzso switch, with zzso of switch events evident from expressed zzso switch transcripts in two of six zzso zzso six of six cell lines expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso essential for zzso and switch zzso These data suggest either a de zzso zzso and modification of zzso genes in zzso tumor cells or zzso of zzso zzso zzso AID zzso in zzso zzso cells further raises a potential for inducing zzso zzso zzso
