zzso is used for several decades to treat zzso illness zzso affective zzso Recently, it was found that zzso zzso zzso thereby promoting the clearance of zzso zzso and zzso in experimental zzso We show here for the first time that zzso significantly reduces the amount of pathological prion protein zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cultured cells by inducing zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso the zzso effect of lithium, demonstrating that induction of zzso mediates degradation of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso a drug widely used to induce zzso had an additive effect on zzso clearance compared to treatment with either drug zzso In addition, we provide evidence that the ability to reduce zzso and to induce zzso is common for diverse zzso compounds, not only for the drug zzso zzso usually administered in clinical zzso Furthermore, we show here that besides reduction of zzso zzso zzso also slightly reduces the levels of cellular prion zzso zzso the zzso available for conversion of cellular prion protein into zzso may provide an additional mechanism for reduction of zzso by zzso zzso
