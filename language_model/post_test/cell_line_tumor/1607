zzso zzso using zzso virus zzso has shown some encouraging zzso responses in mouse models and patients, but the breadth of efficacy in clinical trials has been somewhat zzso Given that zzso effects have correlated with increased host immune responses, we hypothesized that improved therapeutic outcomes may be achieved by using zzso virus zzso in combination with a potent immune zzso zzso In this study, we carried out a zzso evaluation of a genetically engineered strain of zzso zzso virus zzso for its capacity to induce zzso responses when combined with an zzso zzso zzso specific for the zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso mouse models of cancer, this combination therapy significantly reduced the growth of established subcutaneous tumors relative to either treatment zzso zzso the development of pulmonary zzso zzso was also zzso zzso growth zzso was associated with increased numbers of zzso and zzso zzso cells in the tumor draining zzso zzso greater zzso of zzso zzso T and natural killer zzso cells, and a more sustained presence of zzso at the tumor zzso zzso of T or zzso cells or zzso reduced zzso confirming their contribution to an effective therapeutic zzso We further extended this conclusion through results from zzso zzso In zzso our findings offered a zzso for a zzso approach to enhance the zzso efficacy of an zzso suggesting a strategy to improve their use as an zzso treatment for zzso
