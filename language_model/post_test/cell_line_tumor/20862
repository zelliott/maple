zzso zzso displays strong zzso and zzso properties, suggesting that zzso zzso could increase sensitivity of melanoma to zzso zzso We tested this concept in human melanoma cells cultured in either zzso zzso medium to maintain zzso zzso or zzso to zzso zzso production, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used as an inhibitor of zzso zzso activity was evaluated by visual inspection zzso of cell zzso or by measurement of zzso zzso zzso activity zzso zzso cells or cells with various zzso content were exposed to gamma radiation and tested for viability and colony forming zzso zzso radiation at doses of zzso zzso inhibited cell viability and colony forming efficiency in zzso and zzso manner, but pigmented melanoma cells were significantly more resistant to gamma radiation than zzso cells zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso inhibited strongly zzso activity and zzso production in melanoma cells zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso by zzso or zzso resulted in enhancement of melanoma cells sensitivity to killing by gamma zzso In conclusion, the results of these cell culture experiments give support to a clinical trial of zzso induced decrease in zzso synthesis to enhance the efficacy of zzso in advanced zzso
