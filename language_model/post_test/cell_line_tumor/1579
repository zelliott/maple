The zzso signaling zzso plays important roles in the progression of colon zzso zzso has been identified as a zzso of zzso signaling through its interaction with zzso zzso a central zzso of both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, the functions of zzso in the zzso signaling zzso remain zzso Here, we present evidence that zzso is an important positive regulator in colon cancer through regulating the stability and zzso of zzso We have shown that zzso promotes cancer cell proliferation in zzso and tumor growth in zzso and enhances the migratory and invasive potential of colon cancer zzso Furthermore, the higher expression of zzso not only increases the nuclear and zzso zzso of zzso but also increases its zzso zzso The zzso of zzso leads to the increased zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso and particularly in the zzso We have demonstrated that zzso interacts with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso effects on zzso and directly interacts with zzso zzso The level of zzso zzso at zzso is significantly increased following the elevated expression of zzso zzso mediates the zzso zzso of zzso via increasing the level of zzso zzso at zzso to inhibit the activity of zzso Taken together, our study identifies zzso as an important positive regulator in colon cancer and suggests a potential strategy for the therapeutic control of the zzso zzso
