The zzso changes that occur in zzso zzso three-dimensional tumor zzso exposed to 2 zzso of zzso radiation, a dose that is comparable to radiation therapy, were studied using high-resolution zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso Specifically, the zzso zzso of control and exposed zzso zzso were zzso Small zzso (about zzso zzso in zzso with no hypoxic center were zzso The zzso of whole zzso zzso as well as the zzso acid extracts of these systems were zzso Cell damage was also examined by zzso zzso release and changes in cell zzso No cell damage was observed, but numerous zzso changes took place in zzso after exposure to zzso zzso In particular, significant increases in both zzso and zzso mobile zzso considered by many authors as markers of zzso and also present in zzso zzso undergoing overt zzso were observed in zzso zzso with 2 zzso However, the zzso dye zzso zzso and DNA fragmentation zzso showed no overt zzso up to 7 days after zzso with this low zzso Thus it is evident that increases in mobile lipids do not always indicate actual cell zzso A detailed analysis of the other zzso changes observed appears to suggest that the cell death program was initiated but not zzso In fact, the completely different behavior of two important cellular defense mechanisms, reduced zzso and zzso in zzso zzso with 2 zzso and in those undergoing overt zzso seems to indicate that these systems are protecting zzso from actual cell zzso In addition, these data also suggest that zzso can be used to examine the effects of low doses of zzso radiation in zzso a cell model of great complexity that closely resembles tumors in zzso The importance of this possibility in relation to reaching the ultimate goal of a better evaluation of the outcome of zzso protocols should not be zzso
