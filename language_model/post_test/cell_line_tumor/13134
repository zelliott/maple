zzso zzso gene 2 zzso has been studied for its zzso effects against growth and zzso of many tumor cell zzso In this study, we showed zzso expression was correlated with favorable recurrence-free survival of patients with breast cancer and inhibited zzso of breast cancer cells zzso zzso expression was examined in 189 breast zzso zzso and paired normal breast zzso using zzso zzso and zzso data were correlated using zzso zzso test of zzso zzso expression in human breast cancer zzso was zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, patients with breast cancer with a high level of zzso expression showed favorable recurrence-free survival zzso zzso zzso To study the effect of zzso on zzso in zzso we established an zzso mouse breast cancer cell line zzso and measured the zzso and survival of zzso zzso zzso To test whether transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso element zzso activity and/or measurement of active zzso were performed in cell or tumor tissue zzso zzso cells grew gradually and showed less zzso activity in zzso and low zzso in zzso zzso cells showed lower zzso activity and lower level of active zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso our data show that zzso significantly suppress tumor zzso by attenuating active zzso zzso production, and the zzso might be typically associated with the favorable recurrence-free survival of patients zzso
