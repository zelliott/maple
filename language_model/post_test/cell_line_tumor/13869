In the present study, we evidence how in breast cancer cells low doses of zzso for 18 h determined the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso expression zzso with a decrease of the zzso zzso zzso and its gene product, the zzso zzso in treated cells exhibits a prevalent nuclear zzso thus zzso zzso zzso zzso Indeed, the most important finding of this study consists with the evidence that zzso at lower zzso is able to produce the zzso of zzso promoter via zzso zzso exposure of zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso resulted in an increased zzso between zzso and zzso compared to control and this well fits with the simultaneous block of cell cycle into the zzso zzso
