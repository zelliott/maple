zzso of the B cell zzso complex in B zzso causes zzso release from zzso stores, which, in turn, activates zzso channels known as zzso We investigated the mechanisms that link zzso store release to channel gating in zzso B zzso cell lines genetically manipulated to suppress the expression of several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The simultaneous but not the independent suppression of Lyn and zzso expression prevents the zzso of zzso without interfering with zzso zzso store zzso zzso zzso by zzso is reversed in zzso cells by the zzso expression of the missing zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity by zzso and zzso cause the same functional deficit as the genetic suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso activity is required as a zzso zzso targets must be zzso to link zzso store release to zzso zzso The action of zzso on zzso zzso does not arise from control of the expression level of the zzso interaction zzso 1 and zzso zzso
