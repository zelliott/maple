zzso research effort has focused on the discovery of zzso that block the toxicity of the zzso zzso zzso by targeting a specific step involved in zzso zzso and subsequent zzso Given that zzso zzso are hypothesized to be responsible for zzso zzso such compounds could likely prevent or mitigate zzso or alternatively cause further association of toxic zzso into larger nontoxic zzso zzso we investigate the effect of modifications of the zzso zzso core of zzso by replacing zzso and zzso groups with various polar zzso Several of these terminal modifications were found to disrupt the formation of zzso zzso and in some cases induced the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso that incorporate zzso polar groups were found to be effective against zzso zzso Previously, we have shown that zzso incorporating zzso zzso acids zzso were effective in zzso zzso formation as well as inducing zzso zzso In this work, we further disclose that the number of polar zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the original zzso can be reduced without dramatically changing the ability to disrupt zzso zzso in zzso
