Despite extensive studies on the role of tumor zzso zzso protein and its zzso zzso and zzso following their zzso or cellular stress, very little is known about the regulation of the three proteins in cells during zzso cell cycle zzso We report a role for zzso and zzso in supporting cellular proliferation through the zzso zzso of the genes involved in zzso and zzso zzso We found that in zzso cells, zzso and zzso but not zzso are modulated during the cell cycle with a peak in S phase, and their zzso determines a significant suppression of proliferation compared with the zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that in cycling cells, zzso and zzso are bound to the zzso elements zzso present in the regulatory region of cell cycle progression zzso On the contrary, when the cells are arrested in zzso zzso zzso from the zzso and it is replaced by zzso which zzso the expression of these zzso When the cells move in S phase, zzso is recruited again and zzso is displaced or is zzso bound to the zzso These data open new possibilities for understanding the involvement of zzso and zzso in zzso The elevated zzso of zzso and zzso found in many zzso could cause the zzso zzso of cell growth progression genes and therefore contribute to cancer initiation or progression under certain zzso
