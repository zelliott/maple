The purpose of this study was to develop a zzso zzso containing an zzso synergistic ingredient zzso zzso zzso and to investigate the characteristics of the zzso zzso zzso oil contains zzso acid and zzso acids that have been shown by animal and human studies to inhibit tumor zzso The zzso containing zzso zzso oil, zzso zzso soybean zzso zzso 15, zzso 400, and water was developed for zzso intravenous zzso A zzso with higher drug content, lower zzso and smaller particle size was zzso The zzso size distribution of the dispersed phase of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso determined using a dynamic light scattering zzso The small zzso size enabled the zzso droplets to escape from zzso and zzso by the zzso system and increased the circulation time of the zzso The zzso potential was zzso zzso The zzso zzso was pale yellow, transparent, and zzso in zzso The value of the combination index was zzso showing that there was a synergistic effect when zzso was combined with zzso zzso zzso After a single intravenous infusion dose (10 zzso in male Sprague zzso rats, the area under the curve of the zzso was higher and the zzso was longer compared with that of zzso solution alone, and showed superior zzso zzso These results indicate that this preparation of zzso in emulsion is likely to provide an excellent prospect for clinical tumor zzso
