zzso we describe in zzso and in zzso zzso to investigate the suspected zzso activity of two zzso zzso and zzso A zzso zzso zzso cell line, zzso was used to determine the zzso zzso zzso zzso effects of zzso and zzso in zzso and the zzso zzso was zzso to detect the zzso potential of the two zzso in zzso Moreover, we also compared the zzso activities of zzso and zzso to four structurally related zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our results show that zzso and zzso can block zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso at doses of 18 and 54 zzso and zzso at a dose of 36 zzso caused significant decrease in the weight of seminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso though not significant in zzso zzso zzso at dose of 12 zzso decreased only the weight of seminal zzso and had no effect on the other accessory sex zzso The increase rank of zzso activity was: zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso are moderate zzso chemicals in our experiments, and they elicit zzso effects at least partly by zzso zzso
