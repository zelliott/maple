zzso an zzso protein zzso the zzso recognition zzso of the zzso zzso zzso complex, is implicated in zzso degradation of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Our earlier studies revealed zzso as a target gene within the zzso zzso that is often seen in zzso lung zzso In the present study we examined amplification status and expression levels of zzso in zzso lung cancer zzso and investigated its zzso significance in this type of tumor because amplification of DNA at zzso is observed frequently in zzso as well as in zzso lung zzso zzso exhibited amplification in 5 zzso of 25 cell lines derived from zzso and the transcript was zzso in 11 zzso of the 25 zzso Moreover, expression of zzso was zzso significantly in 60 primary zzso tumors as compared to zzso lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso correlated significantly with positive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with stage II or higher of the international zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with poor or moderate differentiation zzso zzso zzso and with the presence of zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso Reduction of zzso expression by zzso of an zzso zzso inhibited invasion and migration of zzso cells in zzso Our results suggest that zzso may be involved in progression of zzso and that targeting this zzso could represent a promising therapeutic zzso
