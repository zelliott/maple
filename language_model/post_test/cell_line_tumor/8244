To study the effect of zzso on invasion and zzso of human colon cancer cell line zzso in zzso and zzso zzso its zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was used to test zzso the effect of cell growth zzso The zzso effects of zzso on movement, zzso and zzso of zzso cells were evaluated by the migratory test, zzso test and zzso chamber zzso zzso real-time reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed to zzso the zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso had zzso effects on growth of zzso cells in a dose and zzso zzso zzso at zzso concentration (3 and 6 zzso could obviously suppress the movement, zzso and invasive capability of zzso zzso In the zzso group (3 and 6 zzso after 24 hours, the zzso rates of migratory time were zzso and 50% zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso the zzso rates of zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso the zzso rates of migration were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both P zzso zzso and the zzso rates of invasion were zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso both P zzso zzso zzso at zzso concentration could zzso the zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso manner in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso while the zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso remained basically unchanged with the same treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso had not been detected in zzso zzso 

zzso in zzso zzso invasion and zzso of human colon zzso cell zzso at zzso concentration through zzso the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
