This study investigated the potential synergistic effects of two zzso of zzso the small zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Human gastric zzso cell lines zzso and zzso were used to determine the effects of zzso and zzso zzso or in zzso on cell proliferation and zzso in zzso In zzso effects of these drugs were investigated in zzso solid zzso grown in zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso inhibited proliferation and induced zzso in zzso and zzso cells in zzso and zzso manners, and showed a synergistic zzso zzso disturbed the binding of B cell zzso zzso zzso zzso killer and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso the short zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly suppressed zzso zzso growth, zzso inhibited zzso growth and induced zzso in zzso 

This study provides zzso evidence that zzso and zzso zzso to induce zzso of gastric zzso cells, suggesting that further investigation of these agents (as potential treatments for gastric zzso is zzso
