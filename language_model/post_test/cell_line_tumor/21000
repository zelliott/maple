Most virus infections induce zzso zzso expression and subsequent zzso zzso zzso production in cells, an inflammatory response that might be zzso to virus replication and zzso This response in dengue virus infection remains to be zzso zzso and zzso compounds derived from two commonly used Chinese herbs, both demonstrate zzso and zzso effects partly through zzso of zzso expression and, zzso may have zzso zzso In this study, we zzso zzso the immune response to dengue virus infection with respect to zzso expression and zzso production in human lung cells zzso liver cells zzso and zzso zzso zzso we assessed the potential zzso effects of zzso and zzso on dengue virus infection zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso factors, as well as virus zzso We found that dengue virus infection enhanced zzso expression and zzso production in zzso cells, similarly to the response in zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso In dengue zzso zzso cells, nuclear factor zzso zzso and zzso protein 1 zzso were also zzso and both were zzso inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had no similar zzso effects and, moreover, at higher zzso enhanced zzso and zzso activity, zzso expression and zzso zzso However, unexpectedly, zzso but not zzso zzso suppressed dengue virus production in zzso cells, independent of zzso zzso Our findings imply that zzso and zzso may zzso dengue virus infection in human lung cells, but through distinct zzso
