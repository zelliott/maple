The combination of gene therapy and chemotherapy is a promising treatment strategy for brain zzso In this paper, we designed a zzso system zzso loading zzso drug zzso and gene agent zzso and with functions of zzso and cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was chosen as the zzso to target the zzso system to the tumor cells expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso system showed higher zzso in cellular zzso and gene expression than zzso zzso system in zzso zzso cells, and accumulated in tumor more zzso in zzso zzso was zzso zzso to carrier though zzso zzso zzso In zzso incubation of the zzso in buffers led to a fast zzso release at pH zzso zzso zzso while at pH zzso (blood) the zzso are relatively zzso The combination treatment resulted in a synergistic growth zzso zzso index, zzso zzso 1) in zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was verified in zzso and in zzso In zzso zzso zzso study confirmed that zzso displayed zzso activity but was less zzso
