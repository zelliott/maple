zzso are currently receiving attention for their role in zzso and tumor zzso Currently, most zzso expression studies are performed on zzso and not much is known about the situation in zzso 

We have investigated the zzso expression profiles and zzso zzso in clones from different spontaneous canine zzso zzso zzso cell tumor and zzso clones expressed high levels of zzso in particular zzso zzso and zzso zzso from a zzso zzso expressed much lower zzso zzso The various clones formed different tumor types in nude mice but only clones that expressed high levels of zzso gave bone zzso zzso zzso located in the nucleus, was detected in tumors derived from clones expressing high levels of zzso indicating an active zzso signaling zzso and zzso stimulation of zzso tumor cell clones in zzso resulted in zzso of the zzso zzso In contrast zzso stimulation did not induce zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, an increased level of the zzso zzso 1 was detected after zzso stimulation of zzso forming zzso 

We conclude that the specific zzso expression repertoire differs substantially between different types of zzso tumors and that zzso expression most probably has a biological role in bone formation of canine zzso zzso
