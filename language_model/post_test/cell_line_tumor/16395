To establish zzso mouse model by non-obese zzso combined zzso zzso mice with primary myeloma zzso 

The model of zzso was established in zzso mice by tail vein injection of zzso cells from two end stage multiple myeloma patients, three mice were zzso for each zzso Mice were monitored weekly for body zzso Two weeks later, the human zzso cells from peripheral blood of mice were evaluated by flow zzso zzso The experiment zzso was body weight loss up to zzso or had pale, vertical hair and zzso then zzso and liver were studied by zzso analysis, the human zzso cells from zzso zzso zzso peripheral blood and bone zzso were evaluated by zzso 

Body weight of mice in group patient 1 and group patient 2 decreased seven and five weeks after zzso zzso the human zzso cells appeared in the peripheral blood zzso zzso 4) and (16 zzso 4) days after zzso in group patient 1 and group patient 2 respectively, and increased by time, reaching zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively at the zzso the zzso liver and zzso zzso of both groups zzso the typical zzso plasma cells were observed in zzso The human zzso cells were detected in zzso zzso zzso and bone zzso by zzso 

Our study successfully established a zzso mouse model zzso with human primary myeloma zzso
