In this study we demonstrated that zzso A, one of the zzso compounds isolated from wheat bran, induced zzso and inhibited proliferation of human breast cancer zzso zzso A inhibited the proliferation of human breast cancer cells zzso and zzso in a zzso manner but barely showed zzso to the normal human zzso zzso zzso zzso was accompanied by a significant decrease of zzso and zzso proteins and by an increase of zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A also suppressed the level of zzso and its downstream targets, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso significantly enhanced the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso not only zzso the level of zzso but also enhanced the zzso of zzso expression when combined with zzso zzso Our results demonstrate for the first time the specific zzso activity of zzso A in tumor cells and involvement of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso Thus, zzso A may be a potentially useful wheat zzso component that can be used for prevention or treatment of breast zzso
