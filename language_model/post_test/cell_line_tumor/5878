zzso is a recently identified zzso zzso whose functions include scavenging zzso oxygen and zzso zzso In tumor cells, zzso may function as a tumor zzso zzso Here we show that zzso of zzso expression can sensitize human zzso cells to zzso stress induced by chemical zzso of the electron transport chain and as well can increase cellular zzso When treated with zzso A, an inhibitor of the zzso electron transport chain, zzso cells showed significantly higher zzso levels, whereas zzso levels were significantly reduced in zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso significantly decreased the doubling time of zzso cell lines, consistent with a putative tumor zzso zzso These finding suggest that modulating zzso levels may be a promising treatment strategy for zzso human zzso cells to zzso stress that is induced by zzso radiation, certain zzso and zzso
