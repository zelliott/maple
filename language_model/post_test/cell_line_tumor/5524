We have coupled zzso and infusion zzso with zzso assignment to profile zzso of zzso zzso directly in crude cell zzso resulting in very high information zzso of zzso zzso molecules in a few zzso A mass accuracy of better than 1 zzso combined with a resolution of 100,000 at the measured zzso was required to distinguish zzso from other zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso extracted from zzso breast cancer cells grown on zzso provided a rich trove of information about the zzso and turnover of the zzso The zzso intensity ratios from the zzso were accurate to approximately zzso or better based on natural abundance background, and depended on the zzso zzso The time course of incorporation of zzso from zzso into a particular zzso was analyzed in detail, to provide a quantitative measure of the sizes of zzso zzso zzso and total zzso pools in growing zzso zzso Independent and complementary analysis of the zzso zzso enrichment in the zzso and fatty zzso chains obtained from high resolution zzso zzso was used to verify key aspects of the zzso This technology enables simple and rapid sample preparation, has rapid analysis, and is generally zzso to zzso zzso of almost any head group, and to zzso of other classes of zzso
