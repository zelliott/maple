The zzso zzso mediates cellular entry into zzso in zzso zzso zzso activates zzso for entry into zzso by zzso zzso and zzso at the site of zzso zzso The zzso gene contains tumor zzso zzso binding sites and is demonstrated to contribute to the zzso cell cycle arrest upon DNA zzso Here we show that both zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso zzso cells but not in zzso zzso or zzso zzso cells, upon zzso stabilization following zzso DNA zzso Furthermore, zzso a drug that selectively traps and zzso nuclear zzso and zzso relieved zzso repression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of the zzso and zzso promoter displayed internal zzso zzso zzso to the zzso binding site upon DNA damage in a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso treated zzso zzso cells showed the presence of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso on the zzso and zzso zzso suggesting their involvement as repressive complexes in zzso and zzso gene zzso Thus, the general mechanism of zzso gene repression may involve recruitment of other repressive zzso
