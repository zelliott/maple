zzso zzso zzso the most potent of a series of zzso zzso zzso developed in this laboratory, is currently undergoing combination clinical trials as an zzso agent for cancer zzso zzso have a complex mode of action, and in zzso zzso that are zzso of in zzso zzso activity have been difficult to zzso In this study, we have zzso a series including zzso zzso and zzso zzso derivatives to determine zzso whether in zzso zzso zzso of mouse cell lines predicts for the in zzso zzso potential of this class of agents, and zzso whether the relative activity of these zzso is similar in zzso and human cell zzso zzso shift zzso were used to measure zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells, and in human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A significant correlation was obtained between zzso zzso in zzso cells by a series of zzso zzso at 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and at 300 zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and the amount of zzso necrosis induced in zzso 38 zzso Different zzso relationships were observed in human and zzso cell zzso zzso which was inactive in zzso and zzso zzso cell lines, showed similar zzso zzso to zzso in human zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso in human cells that mediate the human response may have a lower stringency to that for zzso zzso We also noted differences in the zzso relationships for zzso zzso between zzso and zzso lines that were species zzso With increasing zzso of zzso zzso zzso in both zzso and human zzso lines showed a zzso zzso while in zzso lines, the intensity of zzso zzso was relatively constant above a threshold zzso The results demonstrate zzso differences in the zzso response to zzso zzso and may also reflect the complex nature of zzso zzso
