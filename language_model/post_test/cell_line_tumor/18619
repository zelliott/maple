zzso is a molecular zzso that is important for the stability and activity of several protein zzso including zzso and zzso We first determined, using in zzso zzso that zzso binds to the zzso lobe of zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso were critical for zzso complex zzso zzso and zzso of zzso are within the zzso zzso motif that is required for zzso binding to the zzso zzso of either zzso at the equivalent positions of zzso zzso and zzso also inhibited zzso binding to zzso zzso another zzso zzso critical for zzso binding and zzso activity, zzso zzso reduced zzso complex formation but to a lesser zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso in zzso was not sensitive to changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso and zzso were present at the same level as wild type zzso zzso amounts of zzso bound to zzso and zzso relative to wild type zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso adopt significant zzso zzso However, in contrast to wild type zzso zzso and zzso had greatly reduced binding of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso not only zzso zzso D1 binding to wild type zzso but also restored its binding to zzso Under the same conditions, zzso binding to wild type zzso was zzso Our findings show that the interaction of zzso with its client protein zzso requires zzso acid zzso within a motif that is present in many protein zzso
