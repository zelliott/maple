A novel method of delivering zzso poorly zzso drugs such as zzso was zzso zzso was first incorporated into zzso derived from zzso charged zzso The zzso charged zzso were then zzso in zzso of zzso layered double zzso zzso by an zzso exchange zzso The resulting zzso released zzso rapidly with complete release within 10 zzso at both pH zzso and zzso The zzso complex with zzso released zzso within 30 zzso at pH zzso but took over 70 days at pH zzso When administered to zzso cells in zzso the zzso containing zzso resulted in significantly lower survival times compared to zzso cells, or to cells incubated with the zzso the pristine zzso or water zzso zzso The zzso method allowed for an approximately zzso increase in zzso of zzso In addition, the modification of the surface of the zzso provided potential zzso of the zzso These enhancements to the delivery scheme suggest the potential use of these hybrids for a variety of drug zzso
