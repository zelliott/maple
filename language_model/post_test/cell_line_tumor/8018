zzso zzso zzso is zzso on various human cancer cells and has been the target of zzso using zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso or zzso by zzso zzso or zzso zzso Because activated zzso do not zzso soluble protein zzso efficiently and pure immature zzso are not obtained easily ex zzso an zzso whole zzso zzso DC vaccine has not been zzso To improve the zzso delivery into zzso we zzso zzso zzso to a zzso domain, human zzso virus zzso zzso Furthermore, we zzso the truncated zzso zzso from zzso coli to overcome the safety concerns and zzso functions associated with the native zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso analysis, we demonstrated that the zzso protein entered the zzso of zzso efficiently within 10 zzso of zzso compared with the negligible amount of zzso into zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso T cell proliferation and zzso T cell responses were enhanced significantly in mice zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with those zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso T helper type 1 responses were more prominent in the DC zzso zzso mice whose zzso zzso more zzso and less zzso than those from DC zzso zzso zzso In zzso the DC zzso vaccine delayed zzso growth significantly and prolonged survival of zzso zzso These results suggest that protective zzso are well preserved on zzso zzso zzso This strategy may provide a basic platform for zzso zzso vaccines that could be zzso in combination with advanced zzso zzso
