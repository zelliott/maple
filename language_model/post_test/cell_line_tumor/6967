The type II alpha zzso of zzso zzso has recently been shown to function in the recruitment of zzso zzso complexes to the zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso is also a component of highly dynamic zzso of the zzso system where it zzso with protein markers of the late zzso and with zzso zzso growth zzso When zzso zzso zzso activity was inhibited in zzso using the zzso zzso zzso or by depression of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein levels using zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso failed to traffic to late zzso and instead accumulated in zzso in a zzso membrane zzso Furthermore, zzso degradation of activated zzso growth factor zzso was dramatically impaired in small zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso is necessary for the correct zzso traffic and zzso of activated zzso growth factor zzso
