zzso proteins catalyze zzso of zzso in zzso DNA zzso providing innate protection against zzso replication by inducing deleterious zzso zzso zzso zzso of replication zzso zzso expression is induced in zzso zzso however, no zzso role related to zzso cell proliferation has yet to be zzso Moreover, whether zzso zzso zzso activity transcends to processing cellular zzso DNA is zzso Here we show that zzso cells expressing high zzso levels display efficient repair of zzso DNA zzso breaks zzso induced by zzso radiation and enhanced survival of zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulated in the nucleus in response to zzso radiation and was recruited to zzso repair zzso zzso with a direct role in zzso repair, zzso of zzso expression or zzso activity resulted in deficient zzso repair, whereas zzso of zzso expression in leukemia cells enhanced zzso zzso zzso activity involved processing of DNA zzso a zzso in an integrated reporter zzso Atomic force zzso indicated that zzso zzso associate with zzso zzso triggering zzso zzso to multiple zzso zzso These results identify zzso as a zzso factor in zzso cells, marking zzso as a potential target for zzso zzso to radiation zzso
