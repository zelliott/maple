zzso has emerged as an attractive cancer therapeutic target with a central role in cell survival, growth, proliferation and zzso key to the clinical success of zzso zzso is the zzso possible zzso efficacy achievable without intolerable side zzso In our recent work, we show that although zzso zzso does not always induce a clear zzso response, zzso is a more readily zzso response to zzso zzso or selective small zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso process of bulk zzso degradation and recycling of zzso material and zzso which can provide a temporary survival mechanism for cells under stress conditions, but can also make cells vulnerable to several forms of cell death under specific zzso We zzso that zzso induced by zzso zzso may sensitize tumor cells to agents targeting the later steps of this zzso degradation zzso Indeed, agents that interfere with the zzso degradation function could zzso cell death when combined with zzso zzso and promote complete tumor zzso in zzso zzso These findings suggest that manipulating the zzso response may be a promising strategy to increase the therapeutic efficacy of zzso zzso
