The zzso zzso zzso a member of the nuclear zzso family, is a zzso factor involved in prostate cell growth, zzso and zzso zzso is a key protein in growth and development of both normal and zzso zzso making it a common therapeutic target in prostate zzso zzso is regulated by an interplay of multiple zzso modifications including zzso We and others have shown that the zzso is zzso by a number of zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso which can result in its zzso degradation or enhanced zzso zzso As zzso of zzso causes a change in zzso activity or stability and impacts both survival and growth of prostate cancer cells, zzso of these sites has an equally important zzso zzso zzso zzso could offer novel therapeutic zzso We performed an zzso screen to identify zzso zzso that regulate zzso in that screen zzso zzso 12 zzso was identified as a novel positive regulator of zzso zzso is a poorly characterized protein with few known functions and requires the interaction with two zzso zzso and zzso for its zzso zzso In this report we demonstrate that zzso in complex with zzso and zzso zzso the zzso to enhance zzso stability and zzso zzso Our data show that zzso acts in a zzso manner by stabilizing zzso and enhancing its cellular zzso
