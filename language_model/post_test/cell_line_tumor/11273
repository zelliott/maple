zzso is a crucial factor in tumor aggressiveness and resistance to therapy, especially in zzso Our previous results have shown that zzso exerts zzso and zzso action in zzso cells under zzso However, the effect of zzso on migration and invasion of zzso cells under hypoxic condition remains poorly zzso Here, we show that zzso strongly reduced zzso invasion and migration of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, we found that zzso significantly blocked zzso protein expression and suppressed the expression of downstream target zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso protein via its zzso activity against zzso produced by zzso cells in response to zzso Along with this, zzso zzso by small interfering zzso markedly inhibited zzso cell migration and invasion, and this appeared to be associated with zzso and zzso under zzso Taken together, our findings suggest that zzso suppresses zzso zzso cell migration and invasion via zzso of zzso Considering the fact that zzso of the zzso protein is often detected in zzso zzso zzso may prove to be a potent therapeutic agent for this zzso
