To investigate the mechanisms underlying the zzso effect of zzso acid zzso on zzso zzso of human prostate cancer zzso cells in zzso 

zzso migration and invasion of zzso cells was examined using migration and invasion zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and nuclear zzso were analyzed with zzso reporter gene zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso The ability of zzso to bind the promoter of zzso an important zzso molecular marker, was detected using a zzso zzso zzso zzso After treatment with zzso zzso the expression of zzso genes was measured using quantitative real-time zzso and Western zzso 

zzso significantly inhibited the viability of zzso cells at zzso zzso but did not produce zzso effect at the zzso below zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the migration and invasion of zzso cells induced by zzso (10 zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso B zzso and zzso pathways was suppressed by zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, this zzso effect of zzso was associated with regulation of zzso Snail expression was significantly zzso by treatment with zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso invasion of zzso cells via zzso of the zzso and zzso signaling zzso which may offer a novel approach for the treatment of human prostate zzso
