zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a well recognized characteristic of several zzso including zzso zzso and liver zzso and is a potential target for development of zzso zzso Here, we used zzso small zzso screening to identify zzso as an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso promoted protein zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso at zzso marking it for zzso zzso This reduced zzso zzso levels and consequently antagonized zzso response zzso zzso zzso zzso or depletion of zzso zzso zzso zzso and degradation of zzso In addition, zzso zzso the expression of the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso target zzso and thus inhibited the growth of zzso cancer zzso Furthermore, treatment of nude mice bearing zzso zzso tumors with zzso at doses of 50 zzso and 100 zzso zzso significantly suppressed tumor zzso Our findings suggest that zzso exerts its zzso activity by promoting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has significant therapeutic potential for the treatment of zzso zzso
