This study investigated the mechanism of action of a zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso on proliferation of the zzso prostate cancer cell line zzso zzso with short hairpin zzso zzso to reduce expression of the zzso gene (which encodes the zzso type 1 zzso zzso cell proliferation in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso or control medium was measured before and after zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and Western zzso analysis were used to measure the degree of zzso zzso zzso cells treated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed significant growth zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso significantly decreased zzso expression at 48 zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso showed normal growth zzso however, there was no significant zzso of proliferation of zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso compared with cells zzso with zzso in response to zzso These data demonstrated that the zzso effect of zzso was zzso by the zzso
