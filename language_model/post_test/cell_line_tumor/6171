zzso zzso play an essential role in the maintenance of zzso zzso In humans, loss of zzso zzso function is linked with predisposition to cancer and/or premature zzso Current data show that the specific depletion of the human zzso zzso leads to zzso catastrophe in cancer cells and zzso of tumor growth in zzso 

Here, we show that zzso is highly expressed in various types of solid zzso However, only in the case of brain zzso the high expression of zzso in zzso zzso is paralleled by a lower expression in the control samples due to the poor expression of zzso in zzso zzso This conclusion is validated by zzso analysis of a tissue zzso containing 63 primary zzso and 19 zzso tissue samples, as zzso We also show that acute depletion of zzso by zzso results in a significant reduction of cellular zzso zzso of zzso zzso and spontaneous zzso zzso formation in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso depleted zzso and zzso cells are hypersensitive to zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso these results indicate that zzso has a unique and important role in the maintenance of zzso zzso Our results also suggest that zzso might represent a new suitable target for anti cancer therapies aimed to arrest cell proliferation in brain zzso
