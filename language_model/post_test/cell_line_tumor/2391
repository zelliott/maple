The zzso gene plays a zzso role in zzso cell death and its protein product is zzso regulated by zzso We investigated whether zzso modified zzso gene transfer, which blocks zzso zzso is effective for zzso cell death in zzso zzso zzso at different zzso cellular zzso Human zzso zzso cell lines expressing zzso at low levels zzso and high levels zzso were zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso containing human zzso or modified zzso zzso The zzso effect was highest for zzso + zzso zzso in the low-level zzso cells, whereas this effect was highest for zzso + zzso in the zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso + zzso decreased cell viability zzso in zzso and inhibited tumor growth zzso factor, zzso in zzso Additionally, zzso expression and zzso were zzso In contrast, in zzso cells, zzso + zzso showed decreased cell viability zzso in zzso and zzso of tumor growth zzso factor, zzso in zzso zzso expression and zzso were also zzso zzso modified zzso which blocks zzso zzso was effective in killing tumor cells zzso zzso Furthermore, the combination strategy for disruption of the zzso interaction with zzso demonstrated enhanced zzso effects both in zzso and in zzso
