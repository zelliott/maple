The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso agents that interfere with DNA repair and induce zzso in zzso zzso zzso Although both drugs are clinically used for the treatment of zzso zzso diseases, the pathways of zzso induction remain largely zzso In the present work, we demonstrate that both drugs induce zzso independently of death zzso signaling but activate the zzso cell death zzso To dissect the signaling zzso we employed zzso cells either deficient for zzso or zzso or zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso and zzso c release were blocked whereas processing of zzso zzso and zzso was partially zzso In contrast, neither the zzso of zzso or zzso nor the interference with death zzso signaling by zzso zzso zzso affected cell zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso is processed by zzso zzso Moreover, zzso c release and processing of zzso and zzso occurred to an equal extent in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Likewise, zzso induction by zzso or zzso was not hampered upon zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso cells or zzso of a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Thus, we conclude that zzso induced by zzso zzso is independent from death zzso signaling as well as from a proposed direct effect on zzso but rather follows the zzso signaling zzso of zzso c release and subsequent processing of zzso and zzso
