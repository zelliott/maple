Human zzso L along with zzso zzso K, and V are collectively known as zzso zzso zzso due to their high zzso The zzso and zzso activity of each of these zzso has been implicated in zzso These zzso contain zzso zzso that can zzso inhibit both their zzso zzso and other zzso within the zzso zzso zzso In this investigation, we have produced the zzso S zzso zzso and have shown that it is a potent inhibitor of the zzso zzso and zzso activities of the zzso zzso zzso In addition, we show that this zzso is capable of significantly attenuating tumor cell invasion in a panel of human cancer cell zzso Furthermore, fusion of an zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of the zzso resulted in a zzso protein with significantly enhanced ability to block tumor cell zzso This zzso fusion protein exhibited enhanced stability in zzso zzso in comparison with the unmodified zzso zzso This approach for the combined zzso of the zzso zzso zzso may prove useful for the further study in cancer and other conditions where their zzso activity has been zzso Furthermore, this strategy for simultaneous zzso of multiple zzso zzso may represent the basis for novel zzso to zzso zzso
