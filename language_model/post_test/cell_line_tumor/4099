zzso cell death 4 zzso tumor zzso is frequently lost in tumors of various origins including lung cancer, and its loss contributes to tumor zzso However molecular mechanisms underlying zzso suppression in lung cancer cells remain largely zzso Here we investigated molecular mechanisms of zzso suppression in lung cancer zzso Besides enhanced zzso zzso degradation of zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso is zzso regulated by zzso zzso and localized zzso element in zzso promoter responsible for this zzso In conclusion, we described a novel molecular mechanism of zzso suppression in cancer cells consisting from zzso zzso zzso repression of zzso
