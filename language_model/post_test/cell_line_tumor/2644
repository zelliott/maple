zzso zzso virus type 1 is one of the most common viruses among human zzso Studies demonstrate the essential role of cell zzso zzso especially zzso T cells, in prevention and clearance of zzso 

It is of great importance to improve our knowledge about the zzso of zzso responses to primary and secondary zzso zzso 

Using a sensitive technique for detection and analysis of zzso T cells, zzso B zzso the zzso activity in the zzso of zzso mice at various time points after zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso in primary and secondary infections were zzso 

During acute zzso infection, virus specific zzso T cells were detected at day 5 post virus zzso and peaked at day zzso Six hours after secondary infection the activity of memory zzso T cells was detected and peaked at 12 hours post zzso 

The peak of zzso activity was found to be day 7 post infection in primary zzso infections which decreased with zzso In secondary infections, the activity of zzso reached the highest level at 12 hours post zzso
