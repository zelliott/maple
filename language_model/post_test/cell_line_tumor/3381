We have used zzso zzso zzso zzso to follow zzso factor loading and monitor changes in zzso zzso modifications associated with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes in response to zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The dynamics of testosterone zzso loading of zzso zzso zzso onto the zzso promoters of the genes differed significantly from that onto the zzso zzso zzso more zzso was loaded onto the enhancers than the zzso but the zzso residence time was more transient on the zzso Even though zzso recruited some zzso zzso II zzso zzso onto the zzso the principal Pol II zzso complex was assembled on the zzso The pure zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso occupancy of the zzso zzso promoter, but not that of the zzso whereas the partial zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were capable of promoting zzso loading also onto the zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso recruited Pol II and zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein 1 zzso onto the promoter and zzso However, zzso and zzso also brought about a simultaneous recruitment of the nuclear zzso zzso zzso onto the promoter as efficiently as zzso There were dynamic changes in zzso modifications of zzso zzso zzso of zzso 9 and 14, zzso of zzso 17, zzso of zzso 10 as well as zzso and zzso at zzso 4 of the zzso zzso tail were enhanced in response to zzso but not after zzso zzso zzso these results indicate that zzso zzso by zzso is accompanied by a cascade of distinct zzso zzso modifications and that the pure zzso zzso and the partial zzso zzso and zzso exhibit clear differences in their ability to promote recruitment of zzso and zzso complexes in human prostate cancer zzso
