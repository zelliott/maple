Recent advances in zzso staging, and therapy for pancreatic cancer have not resulted in significant improvements in long-term survival, and development of new approaches is particularly zzso The use of zzso genes is a possible approach for cancer gene zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso on pancreatic zzso zzso activates the zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso which is highly toxic to dividing and zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso was constructed and used to establish pancreatic cancer cells expressing zzso zzso zzso The zzso system effects were tested in zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso pancreatic cancer cell lines and then in zzso on tumors established in nude mice with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso treatment of zzso tumor cells induced zzso and zzso effects in a zzso manner with a zzso cell death since 5 zzso 10 zzso zzso effect was strong in zzso as more than 50% of tumor cells were killed by zzso with only zzso of zzso zzso In zzso tumor growth was completely abolished with a zzso treatment initiated 2 days after tumor cell zzso and mice remained tumor zzso In addition, even if zzso treatment was applied to large tumors, tumors significantly zzso 

These preliminary results support the therapeutic potential of the zzso system, which zzso a highly zzso effect with a potent bystander effect on pancreatic zzso
