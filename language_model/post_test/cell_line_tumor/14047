This study was aimed to develop zzso and zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso as a zzso and evaluate their potential use to assess tumor zzso 

zzso was labeled with zzso in the presence of tin zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso was achieved by adding zzso (2 zzso with zzso zzso cold zzso In zzso cellular zzso of zzso and zzso were obtained in various types of tumor cells at zzso zzso zzso distribution and PET imaging of zzso and zzso were evaluated in breast zzso rats at zzso zzso zzso oxygen tension was measured using an oxygen zzso 

There were similar cellular zzso zzso between zzso and zzso at zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in breast zzso rats showed increased zzso and zzso count density ratios as a function of zzso zzso zzso zzso images confirmed that the tumors could be zzso clearly with zzso zzso tension in tumor tissue was determined to be 6-10 zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso in normal muscle zzso 

The results indicated that it is feasible to use zzso and zzso for assessment of tumor zzso These agents may be useful in selecting and evaluating cancer zzso
