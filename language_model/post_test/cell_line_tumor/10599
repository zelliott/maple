zzso has been proven to be an important target for breast cancer zzso zzso is a dual zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso inhibitor belonging to an zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate zzso that along with the zzso zzso zzso has the ability to induce zzso zzso and degradation of zzso in several human breast cancer cell lines at zzso relatively higher than those required for zzso zzso Another irreversible zzso zzso showed similar activity, while the zzso compounds were zzso suggesting a crucial role of zzso bonding functionality in these zzso In zzso cells, zzso depleted not only zzso but also zzso zzso zzso and to some extent, affected zzso while zzso activated zzso zzso Moreover, we observed that zzso increased zzso of zzso with zzso and zzso with simultaneous induction of zzso of these client zzso Furthermore, in combination with zzso zzso zzso resulted in the noticeable zzso of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso fraction of cell zzso These results suggest that zzso acts as an inhibitor of zzso function, whereas zzso did not bind directly to zzso site of zzso unlike zzso We also found that new protein synthesis was involved in the activity of zzso on zzso zzso Since zzso of zzso and zzso by accelerating the zzso system will become an attractive approach for breast cancer therapy, we expect zzso to be a lead compound for the drug design and the development of such zzso
