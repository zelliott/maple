This present article demonstrates the strategy to prepare zzso reduced zzso oxide with zzso inspired adhesive material zzso zzso and zzso dye zzso zzso zzso to the backbone of the targeting zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso was reduced by prepared zzso accepting the advantages of zzso chemistry under mildly alkaline condition enabling to achieve zzso zzso zzso as fluorescent zzso Due to containing zzso zzso can bind to the zzso cell zzso The prepared zzso is able to retain its zzso features and can be converted to zzso zzso form upon zzso with zzso light zzso 365 zzso displaying purple zzso zzso behavior of zzso was monitored by zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso behavior, examined by zzso laser scanning microscope zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cell lines assured that efficient delivery of zzso was gained due to zzso as targeting zzso In this work, we have shown that in zzso zzso image of zzso is possible by zzso zzso form solution of zzso using zzso mice as in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in tumor tissue from zzso analysis strongly supports the specific delivery of prepared zzso to the target zzso The well tuned drug release manner from the surface of zzso strongly recommends the developed material not only as fluorescent probe for diagnosis but also as a drug carrier in drug delivery zzso
