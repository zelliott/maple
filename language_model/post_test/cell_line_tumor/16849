zzso zzso protein zzso can enhance the zzso effects of zzso and zzso Recent evidence disclosed a role of zzso in zzso cell proliferation and survival, zzso that zzso zzso could also be effective as single agents in tumors with a specific genetic zzso To identify genes in synthetic zzso with zzso we did a zzso screening using a zzso library directed against zzso human protein zzso in the human zzso cancer cell line zzso resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was the most significant gene in synthetic zzso with zzso Treatment with zzso zzso of a zzso inhibitor zzso and a zzso inhibitor zzso confirmed the marked synergistic effect in various human cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso independently of the zzso zzso zzso molecular analysis showed that the combination caused cancer cells to undergo premature zzso before the end of DNA zzso with damaged DNA leading to cell death partly by zzso In zzso treatment of mice bearing zzso zzso with the combination of zzso and zzso zzso led to greater tumor growth zzso than with the zzso used as single agents with no zzso These data provide a strong rationale for the clinical investigation of the combination of a zzso and a zzso zzso
