zzso compounds zzso and zzso are the most important hormones released during zzso Several different receptors are associated with their action in different zzso However, zzso have not yet been described in either normal or zzso human breast zzso The aim of this work was to describe and characterize these receptors in several zzso and zzso human cell zzso The expression of zzso was analyzed at the zzso zzso and protein zzso binding and zzso levels in different human breast cell lines, and the biological activity assessed by zzso zzso The cancer zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso cells line, expressed both zzso and zzso A single zzso was expressed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso All cell lines exhibited significant binding for the specific zzso zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso with known affinity for zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso significantly with binding in zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso and zzso cells showed significant zzso with specific zzso against zzso and zzso when tested by zzso In all cell lines, the specific zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values were in the range of zzso fM for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso cells, and a zzso zzso with a maximum value at zzso zzso was observed for zzso zzso The specific zzso zzso zzso always reversed this stimulation at zzso zzso In conclusion, this study describes for the first time, the presence of zzso in human zzso breast cell zzso Moreover, zzso of these receptors was associated with an enhancement of cell zzso
