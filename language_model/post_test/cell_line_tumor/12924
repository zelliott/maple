Research on quantitative control of targeting effect for the drug delivery system of zzso zzso of zzso zzso is at the cutting edge in the design of drug delivery zzso In this work, we developed a zzso strategy, which makes the zzso zzso after the preparation of the zzso zzso of two zzso zzso We zzso the zzso zzso with zzso functioning as the zzso zzso needed for zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso blend were prepared by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which targets the breast cancer cells of zzso zzso zzso was zzso on the zzso zzso zzso for zzso controlled and targeted delivery of zzso We demonstrated that the targeting effect can be zzso controlled by two ways, zzso zzso adjusting the zzso blend ratio of the zzso zzso which showed within the range of zzso zzso in the zzso blend a linear relation with the zzso density on the zzso surface, and zzso adjusting the zzso feed zzso ratio to zzso in the zzso molecules appearing on the zzso surface, which also showed a linear zzso Compared with the zzso strategy developed recently in the literature, in which the zzso was zzso zzso onto the zzso zzso before preparation of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso strategy provides more efficient use of the zzso and protects its zzso in the zzso preparation process, thus resulting in much better performance in drug zzso which was assessed in zzso with zzso breast cancer cells of zzso zzso zzso and zzso breast cancer cells of zzso receptors moderate zzso
