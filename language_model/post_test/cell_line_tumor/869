zzso zzso is a member of the zzso gene family that is involved in zzso which can be induced in cultured zzso zzso zzso Previously, this zzso has been shown to be zzso in human zzso zzso in zzso and invasive breast zzso This current study examine the levels of expression of this zzso in a group of human breast zzso with particular emphasis on the relationship with the clinical outcomes using quantitative zzso and the distribution in zzso using zzso zzso is primarily expressed in breast cancer cells, and at very low level in normal breast zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso has shown that breast zzso zzso exhibited a significantly high level of zzso compared with normal zzso zzso The levels do not correlate with zzso status of breast zzso however levels in grade 2 and grade 3 zzso were significantly higher compared with that in grade 1 zzso zzso and zzso vs grade 1 zzso zzso zzso also had higher levels of zzso compared with zzso zzso The most interesting observation is that levels of zzso were significantly higher in patients who developed zzso disease and in patients who died of breast cancer zzso and zzso vs zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso expression of zzso is commonly seen in human breast cancer and that excessively high levels are correlated with the clinical zzso
