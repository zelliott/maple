Single zzso zzso zzso are increasingly used to tag genetic zzso associated with zzso such as risk of complex zzso zzso this is done zzso without prior restriction or knowledge of biological feasibility in scans referred to as zzso association studies zzso Depending on the linkage zzso zzso structure at a particular zzso such zzso may be surrogates for many thousands of other zzso and it is difficult to distinguish those that may play a functional role in the zzso from those simply genetically zzso Because a large proportion of zzso have been identified within zzso regions of the zzso distinguishing functional from zzso zzso has been an even greater zzso A strategy was recently proposed that zzso surrogate zzso based on zzso zzso and zzso mapping techniques that have become feasible with the advent of zzso parallel zzso Here, we introduce an zzso software package that enables the identification of candidate functional zzso by zzso information from zzso locations, lists of linked zzso from the 1000 zzso project and locations of zzso features which may have functional zzso
