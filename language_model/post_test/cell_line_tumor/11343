The unfolded protein response zzso and the zzso signaling zzso share several regulatory functions and have the capacity to determine cell outcome under specific zzso However, both pathways have largely been studied zzso Here, we asked whether the zzso zzso regulates the zzso To this end, we used a series of chemical compounds that zzso zzso zzso and monitored the activity of the three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso drug zzso strongly and persistently activated all three branches of the zzso We present evidence that zzso of zzso requires zzso and that zzso is a direct zzso zzso Chemical zzso of this novel zzso zzso by zzso leads to cell death, which was largely dependent on the presence of zzso and zzso Finally, we show that zzso zzso of zzso requires zzso providing a zzso relevant condition for the interaction between zzso and the zzso branch of the zzso These data suggest the zzso and the zzso zzso signal to one another as a means of controlling cell zzso
