During zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso AID zzso zzso breaks into zzso repetitive DNA elements called switch zzso The mechanism that promotes the binding of AID specifically to switch regions remains to be zzso Here we used a zzso screen with in zzso zzso of AID to identify the zzso regulator zzso as a protein that interacts with zzso zzso of zzso zzso by short hairpin zzso in B cells led to a decrease in binding of AID to transcribed switch regions, which resulted in considerable impairment of zzso zzso is thus an zzso of zzso that promotes the binding of AID to zzso zzso
