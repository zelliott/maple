zzso zzso are successfully used for delivery of zzso DNA in zzso especially to the zzso although low systemic stability and circulation have been zzso To achieve the aim of discovering the best method for systemic delivery of DNA to zzso tumors we evaluated the potential of zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso giving the benefit of the shielding and stabilizing properties of zzso in the zzso 

A direct comparison of properties in zzso and in zzso of 4 different zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was performed using reporter gene activity and radioactive zzso zzso markers to monitor zzso 

We found that zzso zzso of zzso caused reduced retention in lung and heart zzso of nude mice compared to zzso zzso however no significant delivery to zzso flank tumors was zzso Although zzso and zzso zzso were delivered to cells the ability to mediate successful zzso is hampered upon zzso presumably due to a changed zzso mechanism and zzso zzso 

The eminent in zzso zzso potency of zzso zzso is well established for expression in lung tumors, but it is zzso for expression in non first pass zzso such as zzso flank tumors in mice even after addition of a zzso in the zzso
