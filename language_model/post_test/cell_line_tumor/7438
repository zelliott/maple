zzso is an inhibitor of vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso with additional activity against zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and growth of a wide range of tumor models in zzso zzso zzso is a selective zzso zzso zzso inhibitor that blocks signal zzso pathways implicated in cancer cell zzso Here, the ability of zzso and zzso to inhibit tumor cell proliferation was examined directly in eight cancer cell lines in zzso and a strong correlation was noted between the zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso No correlation was observed between the sensitivity to zzso and the level of zzso or zzso zzso The zzso cell line zzso was seen to be hypersensitive to zzso and zzso and a small zzso zzso deletion of an zzso site zzso zzso in the zzso was detected zzso zzso To clarify the involvement of the zzso zzso of zzso in the cellular sensitivity to zzso we examined the effect of this agent on zzso stable zzso expressing zzso zzso that designed as the same deletion site observed in zzso cells zzso These cells exhibited a zzso higher sensitivity to zzso compared with zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso compared with cells with zzso zzso In conclusion, the findings suggested that a small zzso deletion in the zzso increased the cellular sensitivity to zzso
