The goal of this study was to characterize interactions between the zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso in chronic zzso leukemia zzso zzso 

zzso and cultured zzso and zzso zzso cells were exposed to agents alone or in zzso after which cell death was determined by zzso D zzso zzso zzso of target zzso zzso of zzso zzso and expression of zzso proteins were monitored by Western zzso zzso Nuclear zzso zzso activity was determined by zzso reporter zzso zzso were zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and assessed for zzso zzso 

Combined exposure to very low zzso of zzso or zzso zzso low zzso and zzso zzso in combination with low zzso zzso of zzso zzso induced cell death in primary and cultured zzso zzso These events were likely associated with prevention of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso of the zzso protein zzso resulting in zzso of zzso zzso Finally, zzso cells zzso with inactive zzso displayed a significant increase in zzso zzso 

zzso of the clinically relevant zzso zzso or zzso with zzso zzso zzso cell death in zzso cells, likely through mechanisms zzso among other factors, zzso zzso and zzso in the expression of zzso and zzso zzso A strategy combining zzso with zzso zzso warrants further attention in zzso
