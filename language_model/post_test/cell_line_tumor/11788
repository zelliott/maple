zzso is known to be involved in many cellular events, such as those related to zzso and zzso zzso We investigated whether zzso mediates these effects through multiple mechanisms, including zzso of cell cycle arrest and zzso zzso as well as by blocking nuclear zzso zzso zzso and by zzso the activities of the zzso protein zzso zzso pathway, in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited cell proliferation in a zzso and zzso manner and it increased the zzso fraction in the cell cycle and the number of zzso zzso zzso Exposure of the cells to zzso also increased zzso activity in these zzso Furthermore, zzso of cells with zzso and the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso increased zzso cell zzso zzso treatment resulted in a significant decrease in zzso expression levels in genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and an increase in those zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso not only inhibited zzso zzso but also activated zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results show that zzso zzso the growth of zzso cells by inducing zzso through zzso zzso and the mechanism involves zzso zzso and the zzso zzso
