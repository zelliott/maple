The inability to sensitively detect zzso cells in zzso models of cancer has created challenges for studying zzso in experimental zzso We previously developed a flow zzso zzso method for zzso circulating tumor cells zzso in mouse models of breast zzso We have adapted this methodology for analysis of tumor dissemination to bone zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and for analysis of these samples by laser scanning zzso zzso Our objective was to implement these zzso for characterization of tumor cell dissemination in zzso models of cancer zzso Human cancer cells were injected into mice via zzso fat pad zzso spontaneous zzso tail vein zzso targets zzso or zzso zzso targets zzso zzso At several time points zzso (4 h to 8 weeks), mice were sacrificed and blood, zzso and zzso were zzso zzso were zzso enriched and labeled with human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso prior to quantitative zzso Following zzso injection, zzso increased over time, as did zzso cells to the zzso Interestingly, tumor cells also spontaneously zzso to zzso zzso at 2 weeks zzso Following TV injection, zzso were initially high but decreased rapidly by 1 week before increasing to peak at zzso Combined with an observed concurrent increase in zzso cells to zzso and zzso this suggests that tumor cells may shed into the circulation from lung zzso that establish following initial cell zzso Following zzso injection, zzso increased over time, zzso at 4 zzso zzso cells in the zzso (most prevalent site of zzso after zzso zzso remained at moderate levels until zzso at zzso Combined use of zzso and zzso allows sensitive zzso of zzso tumor cells in zzso models of zzso These methods will be valuable for future studies aimed at testing new zzso in the zzso zzso
