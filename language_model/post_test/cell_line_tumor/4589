The zzso is the site of zzso synthesis in the nucleus, whose integrity is zzso zzso mechanisms are thought to regulate the activity of the zzso zzso zzso gene copies, which are part of the zzso Here we show that human cells lacking DNA zzso 1 zzso but not zzso have a loss of DNA zzso and an increase in the zzso level of zzso 16 zzso zzso at the zzso zzso Interestingly, we observed that zzso a zzso zzso zzso with a preference for zzso 16 zzso interacts with zzso and zzso recruitment to the zzso genes is zzso in zzso knockout zzso The DNA zzso and zzso changes at zzso DNA observed are associated with a structurally zzso zzso which is fragmented into small nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso and the zzso genes are scattered throughout the nucleus in zzso deficient zzso These findings suggest a role for zzso as an zzso caretaker for the maintenance of zzso zzso
