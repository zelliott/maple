zzso is an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso 4 and 6, and was evaluated to determine its zzso effects in 25 zzso cell zzso zzso cell zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso were determined with cell line proliferation zzso as were its effects on the cell cycle, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso markers for response zzso including zzso zzso zzso D1 zzso zzso E1 zzso zzso zzso factor 1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso were studied using array comparative zzso zzso zzso and gene zzso 

zzso values for zzso ranged from zzso zzso to 700 zzso and the agent demonstrated zzso zzso arrest, induction of late zzso and blockade of RB zzso Through zzso and expression data zzso zzso and zzso were identified as having significant association between loss and sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso has zzso activity in zzso cell lines, and molecular markers predict for sensitivity to this zzso
