Cellular zzso of the zzso zzso zzso an essential component of many zzso and pathological zzso is dependent on the trafficking and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso attachment protein zzso zzso membrane traffic has documented roles in zzso interactions and the present study specifically examines zzso function in the trafficking of zzso during zzso zzso Using the invasive human zzso cell line zzso we demonstrate that a plasma membrane zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso (also known as zzso partly zzso with zzso and zzso and that zzso of these zzso using zzso zzso zzso impaired zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso using zzso zzso zzso interference or zzso toxin impaired trafficking of membrane type 1 zzso to the cell zzso zzso with these zzso we found that blocking the function of these zzso reduced the ability of zzso cells to degrade a gelatin zzso in zzso and impaired invasion of zzso cells in zzso The results reveal the importance of zzso zzso and zzso in the trafficking of zzso during degradation of zzso zzso and subsequent cellular zzso
