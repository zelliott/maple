zzso of the zzso tumor zzso zzso the most common genetic zzso in human zzso results in more aggressive disease and increased resistance to conventional zzso zzso may be related to the increased zzso activity of cancer cells containing zzso zzso To restore zzso zzso function in cancer cells, we developed zzso zzso zzso for zzso gene zzso Previous in zzso and in zzso studies demonstrated the ability of these zzso to provide sustained zzso release of DNA, thus sustained gene zzso and decreased tumor cell zzso We investigated in zzso mechanisms involved in zzso zzso tumor zzso with focus on zzso We zzso that sustained zzso gene delivery will help decrease tumor zzso activity and thus reduce tumor growth and improve animal zzso zzso of zzso zzso tumors were treated with a single zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso We observed zzso zzso gene expression corresponding to tumor growth zzso over 5 zzso zzso tumors showed zzso of zzso a potent zzso factor, and a decrease in zzso density vs controls zzso zzso DNA alone, and control zzso Greater levels of zzso were also observed in zzso zzso Overall, this led to significantly improved survival in zzso zzso zzso zzso gene delivery slowed cancer progression and improved survival in an in zzso cancer zzso One mechanism by which this was accomplished was disruption of tumor zzso We conclude that the zzso sustained tumor zzso gene therapy can effectively be used for tumor growth zzso
