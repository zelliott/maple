The zzso protein of human zzso type 16 zzso causes zzso reorganization in the middle and upper zzso layers and is thought to contribute to multiple zzso of the virus life zzso Although little is known as to how zzso zzso zzso functions are controlled following the first expression of this zzso the finding that low-risk zzso proteins can be zzso in zzso suggests an important role for zzso Here, we show that zzso is zzso by zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso A zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso 32 and zzso zzso 57 zzso representing the two primary events seen in cells in zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso was found to trigger a structural change in the zzso protein that zzso the central fold region, leading to an increase in zzso stability and overall abundance in the zzso When compared to zzso zzso a zzso zzso was found to have greatly enhanced zzso ability and an ability to zzso the binding of the zzso form, with zzso binding protecting the zzso form of zzso from zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso form was specifically detected in the intermediate cell zzso where productive infection occurs, suggesting that zzso zzso may have a functional role at this stage of the viral life zzso Interestingly, zzso with zzso and zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso may work together in zzso Our data suggest a model in which the expression of zzso from the major zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with zzso occurring following the switch to late zzso zzso Other forms of zzso with alternative functional roles, may then increase in prevalence in the upper layers of the zzso
