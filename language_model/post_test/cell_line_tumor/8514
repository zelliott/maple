Acute pulmonary infection by zzso zzso is characterized by high bacterial numbers in the zzso a robust zzso influx of zzso cells zzso and a risk of systemic spread of the zzso We investigated host zzso of zzso zzso zzso migration and the role of inflammation in zzso following zzso lung zzso zzso A3 zzso is a zzso zzso and a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We observed that zzso zzso infection induced the production of zzso in cultured pulmonary zzso and in the lungs of infected zzso zzso of the zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso migration in zzso and dramatically reduced lung inflammation upon high-dose pulmonary challenge with zzso zzso in zzso thus implicating zzso in zzso pulmonary zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso significantly increased zzso zzso migration of zzso Mice suppressed in the expression of zzso exhibited little or no zzso and survived an otherwise lethal pulmonary zzso Our data suggest that zzso pulmonary inflammation is required for high-level zzso and systemic infection, partly by zzso lung zzso through zzso zzso production and subsequent zzso zzso zzso
