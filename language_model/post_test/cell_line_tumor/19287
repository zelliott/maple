zzso of zzso is the most frequent genetic zzso in human zzso zzso zzso being detected in zzso of primary zzso cases by comparative zzso zzso Recently, we isolated a candidate zzso zzso in Liver Cancer 1 zzso from zzso by hybrid zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso was frequently amplified and zzso in zzso zzso cells possessed a strong zzso ability, increasing the colony formation in soft zzso and increasing the zzso in nude mice, which could be effectively suppressed by small interfering zzso against zzso zzso studies showed that zzso of zzso could promote zzso phase transition and inhibit zzso zzso studies revealed that the zzso function of zzso might be associated with its roles in promoting cell proliferation by zzso zzso zzso 

These results suggest that zzso is the target zzso within the zzso zzso and plays a pivotal role in zzso zzso
