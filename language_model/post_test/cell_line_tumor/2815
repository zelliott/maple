Each of the three members of the zzso steroid zzso zzso zzso family of zzso zzso zzso and zzso stimulates zzso zzso zzso function in zzso zzso zzso we sought to zzso their contributions to the zzso processes of cell zzso zzso and the expression of zzso target genes in zzso breast cancer zzso The small interfering zzso depletion of zzso or zzso but not zzso inhibited growth of zzso cells, and this was reflected in decreased cell cycle progression and increased zzso in zzso or zzso cells as well as a reduction in zzso zzso activity measured on a synthetic reporter zzso However, only zzso depletion blocked zzso zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso did not affect these events, and together this reveals functional differences between each of the three zzso family zzso zzso of the zzso zzso target zzso zzso was not affected by depletion of any of the zzso zzso although depletion of each of them decreased zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso and zzso D1 gene expression were decreased in zzso small interfering zzso zzso zzso of zzso and protein levels for the zzso zzso zzso was dependent on zzso zzso whereas zzso protein but not zzso expression also was sensitive to zzso zzso Together these data indicate that the closely related zzso zzso are not functionally redundant in breast cancer cells because they play zzso roles in regulating zzso and protein zzso and they therefore are likely to make unique contributions to breast zzso
