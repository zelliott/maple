The zzso growth factor zzso zzso plays a major role in cell proliferation of zzso zzso and its zzso frequently contribute to zzso Several common zzso of the zzso gene have been zzso at the level of both coding and regulatory zzso Some of these zzso are associated with zzso of zzso expression and/or activity and may have an impact on the activity of zzso zzso This study aims to analyze the relationships between specific zzso functional zzso and zzso drug zzso 

We investigated, in the panel of 60 human tumor cell lines established by the National Cancer Institute zzso whether the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso 1 zzso repeat were associated with zzso gene expression and the in zzso zzso of zzso agents using data extracted from the zzso zzso We also looked for zzso of zzso zzso known to enhance the activity of zzso zzso zzso and the deletion of zzso zzso associated to the zzso of zzso 

In the zzso cell lines, only two zzso were observed, both in zzso 19, in a leukemia and melanoma cell zzso These zzso have not been described previously in clinical samples and their functional role is zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso single zzso zzso zzso in the zzso panel were zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso were not found in any zzso cell zzso The zzso 1 CA repeat was highly variable in the cell zzso 32 cell lines having a total number of repeats below 35, and 27 having a total number of repeats above zzso The zzso and zzso zzso cell lines for the zzso zzso presented a significantly higher expression of the zzso gene than the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, there was no association between the zzso or zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso No association could be detected between the number of CA repeats in zzso 1 and the expression of zzso The cell lines having at least one zzso T zzso at the zzso zzso were more sensitive to zzso and less sensitive to zzso zzso I and II zzso and zzso agents than those without a zzso zzso No relationship was detected between zzso drug sensitivity and the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was associated to lower sensitivity to zzso zzso The number of CA repeats was associated with significant differences in zzso drug activity: a high total number of CA repeats zzso per zzso zzso was associated to increased sensitivity to zzso agents and zzso I and II zzso 

We provide evidence in this work that zzso zzso are associated with significant differences in the in zzso zzso of several types of zzso zzso Studies attempting a clinical validation of these clues are zzso
