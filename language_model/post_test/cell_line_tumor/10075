zzso is the most common primary zzso of bone in children and young zzso There is a paucity of zzso and highly zzso human zzso cell lines that have not been further transformed by zzso zzso Here we establish and characterize a highly zzso human zzso cell line that is derived from a poorly zzso zzso line through serial passage in nude mice via zzso zzso The occasional pulmonary zzso developed from zzso were harvested and zzso in mice until a highly zzso zzso zzso was zzso The parental zzso and highly zzso zzso cells were further characterized in zzso and in zzso zzso cells demonstrated increased cell migration and invasion compared to the parental zzso zzso zzso cell zzso was significantly greater in zzso cells when compared to the zzso zzso zzso cells grew at a slightly slower rate than that of the parental zzso When injected into nude mice, zzso cells had a greater than zzso increase in developing pulmonary zzso compared to the parental zzso zzso zzso cells also formed larger primary tumors when compared to the parental zzso zzso Further analysis revealed that zzso expression was zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, expressions of zzso and zzso were zzso and expression of zzso was zzso in the zzso zzso Taken together, we have established and characterized a highly zzso human zzso cell line that should serve as a valuable tool for future investigations on the zzso zzso and potential treatments of human zzso
