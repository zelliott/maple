The purpose of this study was to establish whether a zzso dose rate zzso treatment of zzso zzso given every 3 h in combination with 41 degrees C mild zzso or a continuous low dose rate zzso treatment with mild zzso could zzso two zzso human breast zzso cell lines in comparison to zzso dose rate or low dose rate zzso zzso The radiation resistant cell line was derived from the parental cell line and was zzso to zzso DNA zzso zzso The zzso assessed were the survival of the cells using the zzso zzso the amount of residual zzso using the comet zzso and gene expression of zzso beta using zzso zzso showed that the zzso and zzso treatments combined with mild zzso caused significant zzso when compared to zzso and zzso zzso alone in terms of the zzso and comet zzso with both cell zzso zzso results showed that zzso beta levels of expression were not elevated in response to these treatments, zzso that this zzso may not be involved in zzso damage repair or zzso zzso These results suggest a potential clinical advantage when combining zzso or zzso with zzso since they indicate that zzso is an effective zzso
