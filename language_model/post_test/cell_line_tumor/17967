zzso weak zzso of zzso zzso a relatively new member of the zzso zzso is an important zzso regulator that has different functional properties from that of other members of this zzso We report zzso that zzso zzso cellular insulin resistance in both human zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso and primary rat zzso by zzso both early insulin zzso zzso signaling events and the downstream actions of zzso zzso profoundly inhibited zzso zzso zzso in both a zzso and zzso zzso This zzso effect occurred via mechanisms that involved the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso and zzso nuclear zzso signaling zzso Furthermore, zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso increases in zzso zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso reduction of zzso zzso gene expression and increases in zzso synthesis in zzso were significantly attenuated by zzso zzso zzso these findings not only reveal a novel zzso function of zzso but also uncover a new player that may contribute to the development of cellular insulin resistance in zzso
