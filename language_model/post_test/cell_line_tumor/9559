The expression of zzso and zzso zzso was studied in two zzso cell lines in a mouse zzso zzso 

Human cell lines zzso and zzso were implanted in zzso mice via intramuscular zzso or subcutaneous zzso zzso After eight weeks, liver, lung and primary zzso sites were zzso Sections were stained using two zzso a) zzso and zzso to detect zzso at zzso site, liver and zzso b) zzso using zzso zzso to detect expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Both cell lines had similar zzso rates via either route but zzso had a higher zzso rate than zzso The zzso cells exhibited greater expression of zzso and zzso zzso than the zzso zzso 

The expression of zzso and zzso zzso is associated with a cell line of greater zzso zzso The zzso route does not affect primary zzso zzso or zzso zzso
