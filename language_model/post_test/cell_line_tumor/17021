The discovery of new and more potent zzso agents constitutes one of the most active fields of research in zzso zzso cancer zzso is one of the most studied zzso because of its high prevalence and number of zzso In the current pharmaceutical design of more efficient zzso drugs, the use of zzso based on zzso has played a decisive role, including zzso zzso zzso zzso However, until now, there is no methodology able to predict zzso activity of compounds against more than one zzso cell line, which should constitute the principal zzso In an attempt to overcome this problem we develop here the first zzso zzso approach for the virtual screening and rational in zzso discovery of zzso agents against ten cell zzso Here, two zzso zzso models were constructed using a large and zzso database of zzso The first model was based on linear zzso analysis zzso employing zzso zzso while the second model was obtained using artificial neural networks zzso with global zzso zzso Both models correctly classified more than zzso of active and inactive compounds in training and prediction zzso Some fragments were extracted from the molecules and their contributions to zzso activity were calculated using zzso zzso Several fragments were identified as potential zzso features responsible for the zzso activity and new molecules designed from those fragments with positive contributions were suggested and correctly predicted by the two models as possible potent and versatile zzso zzso
