zzso zzso zzso is a zzso tumor with poor long-term prognosis due to development of zzso despite aggressive zzso The zzso zzso target of zzso zzso zzso is involved in its zzso zzso however, it remains unknown how this zzso plays a role in canine zzso Here, we characterized new canine zzso cell lines derived from nude zzso canine zzso and investigated the deregulation of the signaling pathways in these cell zzso 

Seven canine zzso cell lines were established from 3 zzso canine zzso and showed characteristics of zzso cells zzso that is, zzso of zzso zzso zzso and expression of zzso zzso zzso They showed varied zzso and zzso expression levels for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso Cell proliferation was zzso by these growth factors and fetal bovine serum zzso in 1 cell line and by zzso alone in 3 cell zzso However, cell proliferation was not zzso by growth factors and zzso in the remaining 3 cell zzso zzso zzso zzso was increased by zzso stimulation in 4 cell zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso at zzso zzso complex 1 zzso at zzso and zzso translation initiation factor zzso protein 1 zzso at zzso was high in zzso condition and not altered by zzso stimulation in 6 cell lines, despite increased zzso of these zzso in normal canine zzso This suggested that the zzso zzso was zzso activated in these 6 canine zzso cell zzso After cell zzso into nude mice, canine zzso tumors were formed from 4 cell lines and showed zzso and zzso zzso identical to the parental cell zzso 

Our findings suggest that the present cell lines may be useful tools for investigating the role of the zzso zzso in canine zzso formation both in zzso and in zzso
