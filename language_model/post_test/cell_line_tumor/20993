zzso attached to cell surface can form at least two very different zzso a zzso coat close to plasma membrane and zzso chains coalesced into zzso that can span several cell zzso The zzso in cables, induced by many inflammatory agents, can bind zzso whereas that in the zzso coat does not contribute to zzso zzso zzso this structural change seems to have a major role in zzso In the present study we checked whether cells of zzso zzso like zzso zzso can form zzso cables and bind zzso In addition, we checked whether zzso synthesis is affected during the induction of zzso Control zzso expressed zzso zzso as small patches on plasma zzso But when treated with inflammatory agents or stressful conditions zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso and high zzso zzso zzso organization changed into zzso structures that avidly bound zzso zzso the total amount of zzso zzso was slightly zzso and the expression levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not significantly zzso The results show that zzso zzso can form cables and bind zzso under inflammatory provocation and that these effects are not dependent on stimulation of zzso zzso
