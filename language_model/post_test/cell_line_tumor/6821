zzso zzso zzso is a neurodegenerative disorder due to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso the closest zzso of zzso has been shown to have partial functional zzso with zzso and, when zzso can compensate for the zzso of zzso In order to characterize the function of zzso and to understand the phenomenon of gene zzso we have developed a novel system that allows the controlled expression of the zzso fusion protein zzso or zzso zzso zzso using the zzso system in zzso rat zzso zzso The generated stable cell lines express negligible levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels of normal or zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein is targeted correctly to zzso and is zzso The obtained cell lines will be an indispensable tool in our further studies aimed at the resolution of the function of zzso to characterize its potential zzso in a natural zzso
