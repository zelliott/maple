The purpose of this study was to further characterize cell zzso effects of a recently identified zzso zzso zzso signaling inhibitor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was more potent than zzso in induction of zzso arrest and reduction of zzso cell cycle protein expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso moderately inhibited growth of zzso zzso cells independent of zzso zzso The data indicated that zzso inhibit cell growth in both zzso and zzso manners and is potentially a potent therapeutic agent for the management of advanced human prostate zzso
