zzso virus zzso infection in tumor cells is generally restricted to the zzso forms of viral zzso Switching the zzso form of viral infection into the zzso form may induce tumor cell zzso An important nuclear factor, nuclear factor zzso is thought to play an essential role in zzso zzso zzso high levels of zzso can inhibit zzso zzso zzso In this study, we tested the effect of inducing zzso zzso replication using two zzso zzso zzso and zzso to reveal the possibility of targeting zzso cancer therapy with these two zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner, thus resulting in zzso zzso cell zzso In contrast, there was no significant effect on zzso zzso zzso When zzso was used in combination with either zzso or zzso to treat zzso cells, the zzso effect of the zzso inhibitor was zzso The finding indicates that zzso the zzso activity of zzso cells can induce zzso replication of zzso and cause zzso zzso against these zzso
