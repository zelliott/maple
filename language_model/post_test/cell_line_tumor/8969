zzso zzso zzso is one of the major zzso components isolated from the root of zzso zzso zzso We explored the mechanisms of cell death induced by zzso treatment in prostate cancer cells in zzso and in zzso 

zzso were treated with zzso and growth zzso was zzso Cell cycle profiles after zzso treatment were determined by flow zzso zzso levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins and zzso proteins were determined after zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso genes were determined to investigate their role in zzso cell zzso zzso expression was knocked down by small interfering zzso zzso zzso Rate of cell death and proliferation was obtained by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso was performed in zzso zzso zzso 

Our results showed that zzso caused prostate cancer cell death in a zzso manner, and cell cycle arrest at zzso phase was noted, in zzso zzso The zzso phase arrest correlated with increase levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and decrease of the checkpoint zzso zzso also induced zzso stress in prostate cancer zzso zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso were identified, and increased expression of the downstream molecules zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso reduced zzso cell death in zzso zzso zzso also suppressed zzso zzso tumor growth, causing zzso reduction in tumor volume after 13 days of zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso causes zzso cell cycle arrest in zzso cells and its zzso is zzso at least partly by zzso stress zzso These data provide evidence supporting zzso as a potential zzso agent by inducing zzso stress in prostate zzso
