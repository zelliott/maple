Over the last few years, significant research has been conducted in the construction of artificial bone zzso In the present study, different types of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso were developed by a zzso method, and each was characterized as a bone graft zzso The zzso water zzso and retention ability of the prepared scaffolds showed similar zzso The pore size of the zzso and zzso scaffolds were measured from scanning electron zzso and found to be zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso studies using the zzso cell line revealed profound zzso increased cell proliferation and enhanced alkaline zzso zzso in the zzso scaffold compared to the zzso zzso Further, protein zzso and zzso were about two times greater in the zzso scaffold than the zzso zzso zzso we suggest that zzso will be a promising zzso for bone tissue zzso
