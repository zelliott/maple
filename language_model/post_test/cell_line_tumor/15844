We discovered that an inverse relationship exists in the expression of zzso and zzso protein zzso with zzso zzso and prostate tumor cell zzso zzso zzso cells expressed low levels of zzso and elevated zzso zzso whereas the reverse occurred in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso and zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas the levels of zzso zzso dropped to near zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso increased whereas zzso zzso and zzso dropped greater than zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that zzso specifically binds zzso to block zzso zzso zzso studies and Northern blots confirmed that zzso complexes with zzso zzso in zzso zzso to block processing to zzso indicating zzso may prevent zzso zzso expression to indirectly promote zzso zzso zzso studies further showed that the zzso ability zzso and invasive activities of zzso cells were significantly enhanced in zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso there was both a loss of these functions and a loss of zzso in zzso zzso Likewise, with the zzso of zzso in zzso clones (and zzso zzso zzso invasive activities in zzso and zzso in zzso were significantly zzso These results show for the first time that zzso blocks zzso processing to enable zzso and zzso expression and the transformation of primary tumor zzso
