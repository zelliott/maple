Solid zzso comprise various cells, including cancer cells, resident zzso cells, migratory zzso cells and zzso These cells regulate zzso growth and zzso zzso constitute probably the most important element of all interactions within the zzso zzso However, the molecular zzso that guides zzso environment, still remains zzso zzso the underlying molecular mechanisms that orchestrate these phenomena has been the aim of our zzso zzso of canine zzso cancer cells and zzso was established and maintained for 72 zzso Having sorted the cells, gene expression in cancer cells and zzso using DNA zzso was zzso The results were confirmed using real-time zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, their ability for migration and invasion has been zzso 

zzso analysis showed that the zzso genes in the cancer cell lines are involved in 15 highly zzso zzso The pathways that drew our diligent attention zzso the inflammation zzso zzso by zzso and zzso the Toll zzso zzso zzso and the B cell zzso The zzso genes in the zzso were involved in only 18 significantly zzso zzso the zzso the zzso zzso feedback zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso analysis revealed that zzso of cancer cells with zzso initiated the zzso zzso expression in cancer cells, as well as zzso genes zzso This finding was confirmed at zzso and protein zzso Moreover, we showed that zzso increase cancer migration and zzso 

The presence of zzso in the cancer environment zzso acquisition of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in cancer zzso We presumed that cancer cells also acquire other zzso features, such zzso capabilities of cell rolling, zzso migration and zzso invasion (what has also been confirmed by our zzso It may, perhaps, be the result of zzso cell hybrid formation, or cancer cells mimicking zzso zzso zzso to various proteins zzso by zzso
