The zzso inhibitor zzso has revolutionized the treatment of chronic zzso zzso However, drug resistance caused by zzso domain zzso has necessitated the development of new zzso zzso most recently against the zzso gatekeeper zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both native and zzso zzso including zzso acting as a zzso zzso Here, we undertook a combined zzso and zzso relationship analysis on zzso to understand this unique zzso While the zzso zzso is a key inhibitor functionality that interacts with the zzso virtually all other components of zzso play an essential role in its zzso zzso zzso The extensive network of zzso molecular contacts found in the zzso binding mode leads to high potency and renders binding less susceptible to disruption by single point zzso The zzso mechanism exemplified by zzso may have broad relevance to designing zzso against other zzso with zzso gatekeeper zzso
