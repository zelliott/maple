The zzso hydrocarbon zzso nuclear zzso zzso is a basic zzso zzso protein that also contains a zzso zzso zzso In addition to forming zzso with many other zzso zzso including the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso and zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso zzso can also form zzso when expressed from its zzso in zzso or in zzso However, target genes of the zzso zzso remain to be zzso In this study, we have zzso the profile of genes responsive to the zzso of zzso expression in an zzso mouse zzso cell line zzso using DNA zzso zzso The expression of 27 genes was zzso by zzso or more in zzso cells infected with a zzso zzso expressing mouse zzso while no genes were found to be zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso zzso 19 zzso protein 1 zzso zzso (or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso member 1 zzso and zzso downstream zzso zzso were confirmed to be induced by zzso using real-time zzso We also found that the zzso promoter region of 15 out of 20 zzso genes contain the type 2 zzso zzso zzso binding zzso consistent with the notion that they represent target genes for zzso
