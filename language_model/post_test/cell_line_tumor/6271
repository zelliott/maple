zzso cavity zzso cell zzso zzso is a devastating disease that accounts for zzso of all cancer cases diagnosed zzso zzso is usually diagnosed at advanced clinical zzso resulting in poor zzso To identify effective zzso for improved zzso diagnosis and/or management, we simultaneously analyzed the zzso cell zzso and tissue zzso Among the 19 candidates isolated, zzso protein 1 zzso was selected for further validation using serum samples from zzso patients and healthy zzso zzso the serum level of zzso was higher in zzso patients, compared to that in healthy zzso zzso analysis further revealed zzso zzso in zzso zzso compared with adjacent zzso zzso zzso the higher zzso level in zzso tissue was associated with higher overall pathological stage, positive zzso invasion, and poorer zzso Moreover, zzso modulated the migration and invasion of zzso cells in zzso Our results collectively indicate that integrated analysis of the cancer zzso and zzso is a feasible strategy for the efficient identification of novel zzso zzso
