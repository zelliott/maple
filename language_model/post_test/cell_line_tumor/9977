zzso and zzso monitoring of tumor zzso status using quantitative diffuse zzso zzso is used to test whether a final treatment outcome could be estimated from early optical signatures in a zzso model of head and neck cancer when treated with zzso zzso tumors in the flank of 23 nude mice are exposed to 39 zzso of radiation, while 11 animals exposed to sham zzso serve as zzso zzso optical zzso is measured from the tumors at baseline zzso to zzso and then serially until 17 days zzso The fastest and greatest increase in zzso blood oxygen zzso levels are observed from the animals that show complete tumor zzso with no recurrence 90 days zzso relative to both zzso and treated animals with local zzso These increases in zzso are observed starting 5 days zzso and last up to 17 days zzso This zzso study demonstrates that diffuse zzso zzso could provide a practical method far more effective than the growth delay zzso to zzso treatment outcome in solid tumors and may hold significant zzso zzso
