The nuclear zzso zzso amplified in breast cancer 1 zzso and its more active zzso zzso are zzso in breast cancer and zzso breast zzso However, the impact of these proteins on the zzso activity of natural zzso or selective zzso zzso zzso zzso has not been zzso Here we show that zzso causes a significant increase in the efficacy of zzso at both zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso breast and zzso cancer cell zzso zzso also significantly increased the efficacy of the natural zzso zzso at both zzso and zzso whereas zzso had no effect on either the potency or efficacy of zzso at either zzso The zzso efficacy of the partial zzso tamoxifen was significantly increased in all cell lines at zzso by zzso of zzso both on zzso and zzso zzso responsive zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso or zzso had no effect on the potency or efficacy of the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso of the zzso zzso will increase the zzso of a variety of natural and zzso compounds in zzso that develop zzso zzso and zzso of these zzso may be a contributing factor to the zzso development of zzso and to zzso resistance of breast zzso
