Previously, we reported that zzso zzso is zzso in zzso prostate cancer and that virulent prostate cancer cells zzso biologically active zzso We also showed that zzso expression leads to zzso activities through maintenance of activated zzso and that zzso is taken up by other zzso tumor cells and/or zzso cells, leading to stimulation of zzso activities through zzso zzso To analyze the functional consequences of zzso zzso on the development and progression of prostate cancer in zzso we generated zzso transgenic zzso Adult male zzso mice showed significantly increased zzso wet weight and higher zzso of zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso Increased zzso for zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso and reduced nuclear zzso zzso occurred in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice showed increased resistance to zzso zzso zzso and elevated serum zzso levels compared with zzso zzso zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso mouse prostate cancer cells resulted in tumors that were larger in zzso mice than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Tail vein zzso of zzso cells produced significantly more experimental lung zzso in zzso males than in zzso male zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso mice than in zzso mice zzso zzso zzso Combination treatment with surgical zzso and systemic zzso zzso dramatically reduced the number of experimental zzso These experimental data suggest a zzso association of zzso zzso and prostate cancer growth and zzso
