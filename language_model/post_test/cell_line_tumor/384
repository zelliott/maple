zzso a critical regulator of kidney development, is a tumor zzso for zzso but in some contexts functions as an zzso A limited number of direct zzso targets of zzso have been identified to explain its complex roles in zzso and zzso In this study we performed zzso screening for direct zzso targets, using a combination of zzso and expression zzso zzso regions bound by zzso were highly zzso and resembled the sites for a number of other widely expressed zzso factors such as zzso zzso and zzso Genes directly regulated by zzso were implicated in zzso zzso zzso guidance, and zzso zzso Among directly bound and regulated genes by zzso nine were identified in the zzso signaling pathway, suggesting that zzso zzso a subset of zzso components and responsive genes by direct zzso To prove the biological importance of the interplay between zzso and zzso zzso we showed that zzso blocked the ability of zzso to induce a secondary body axis during zzso embryonic zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso activated by zzso zzso wild type and zzso stabilized zzso by preventing zzso loading onto a zzso This was neither due to direct binding of zzso to the zzso binding site nor to interaction between zzso and zzso but by competition of zzso and zzso for zzso zzso interference with zzso signaling represents an important mode of its action relevant to the suppression of tumor growth and guidance of zzso
