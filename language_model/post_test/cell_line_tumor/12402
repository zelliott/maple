This study evaluated whether omega-3 zzso fatty acids zzso could enhance the zzso of three different human zzso zzso cell zzso To understand the underlying mechanisms, the effects of omega-3 zzso on the cell growth, survival, and zzso were evaluated alone or in combination with an zzso zzso zzso and compared with the effects of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso cell survival was assessed by zzso zzso after a zzso zzso with zzso zzso and/or vitamin E before a single X-ray exposure to 4 zzso Cell growth and viability were measured by double zzso cell zzso analyses using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso test or multivariable linear zzso analyses were used for zzso 

zzso with 30 to 100 zzso of omega-3 zzso induced a zzso additive decrease in cell survival after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the underlying mechanisms indicated that omega-3 zzso mainly decreased the cell number via zzso zzso Moreover, formation of zzso zzso products and zzso of zzso II activity seemed to be involved, because zzso with 10 zzso vitamin E abolished the effect of 50 zzso of omega-3 zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso could partly mimic omega-3 zzso zzso 

These observations suggest that omega-3 zzso may be potential candidates as nutritional zzso to enhance the efficacy of human zzso cancer zzso
