zzso proteins form zzso and act as zzso factors that activate a number of genes related to cell growth and zzso zzso and zzso are localized in the zzso when zzso expressed in cultured cells, but zzso into the nucleus after forming zzso with zzso which is a zzso zzso of zzso with an intrinsic nuclear zzso signal zzso Here, we report that zzso showed potent zzso activity, and that forcibly expressed zzso and zzso in the nucleus essentially exhibited very little or no zzso zzso zzso in the zzso that abolished the zzso activity of zzso also zzso the zzso zzso We have found that zzso proteins contain a putative sterile alpha motif domain indispensable for their zzso capability in the zzso zzso To demonstrate whether zzso and zzso composed of zzso and/or zzso are generated in the nucleus, we applied the zzso zzso resonance energy transfer imaging technique to living zzso It revealed that zzso composed of zzso and zzso were zzso probably by a zzso of zzso zzso
