zzso molecular profiles for human breast zzso have enabled the identification of features that can predict therapeutic zzso however, little is known about how the various data types can best be combined to yield optimal zzso zzso of breast cancer cell lines mirror many aspects of breast cancer molecular zzso and zzso of their zzso and biological therapeutic responses are zzso for development of strategies to identify the most zzso molecular feature zzso 

We used least zzso zzso machines and random forest zzso to identify molecular features associated with responses of a collection of 70 breast cancer cell lines to 90 experimental or approved therapeutic zzso The zzso analyzed included zzso of copy number zzso zzso gene and zzso zzso promoter zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso contributed strongly to response zzso for zzso of compounds, and adding other molecular data types improved prediction for zzso No single molecular zzso consistently zzso the others, suggesting that therapeutic response is zzso at multiple levels in the zzso Response zzso were developed and applied to zzso data, and were found to be present in zzso of those patient zzso 

These results suggest that matching patients to treatments based on zzso zzso will improve response rates, and inclusion of additional features from other profiling data types may provide additional zzso Further, we suggest a systems biology strategy for guiding clinical trials so that patient zzso most likely to respond to new therapies may be more efficiently zzso
