zzso obtained from cancer patients have been identified as useful tools for cancer zzso zzso and as potential targets for zzso zzso zzso analysis in combination with zzso is a classic strategy for identification of zzso zzso in the serum of cancer zzso However, zzso zzso analysis cannot always indicate the true zzso out of a complex zzso identified from a single protein spot because the most abundant protein is not always the most zzso To address this problem, we zzso multiple parallel separation zzso for zzso zzso The common identities present in the zzso obtained using different separation methods were regarded as the true zzso The merit of our zzso technique was validated using zzso and zzso zzso Next, we applied the zzso technique for the identification of zzso zzso as the zzso zzso for an zzso that was zzso in the plasma of breast cancer zzso These results reveal that zzso can zzso identify an zzso zzso zzso by reducing zzso zzso zzso could be used for the characterization of diagnostic zzso raised in laboratory animals as well as zzso isolated from diseased zzso
