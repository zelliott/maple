Early onset generalized zzso zzso is an zzso dominant neurological disorder caused by deletion of a single zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region of the zzso zzso associated with a variety of cellular zzso protein zzso The zzso mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso leads to zzso remains zzso Here we report the identification and characterization of a zzso acid novel zzso zzso that interacts with zzso zzso zzso with zzso in multiple brain regions and zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso selectively binds to the zzso form but not to the zzso form of zzso supporting a role for zzso as a zzso rather than a zzso of zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso is completely abolished by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso is a new component of the zzso zzso zzso and provide a potential molecular target for therapeutic intervention in zzso
