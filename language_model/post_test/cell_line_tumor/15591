We have previously shown that zzso zzso interfere with the zzso regulation of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso promoter activity by zzso in invasive zzso breast cancer zzso By examining zzso expression in a variety of breast cancer cell lines, the protein level of zzso was found to be much higher in zzso zzso and zzso breast cancer cells than in zzso zzso and zzso zzso No correlation of zzso expression with the expression of other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso could be zzso In contrast to zzso cells, zzso zzso cells do not support zzso zzso of the zzso zzso promoter suggesting that zzso may be important for zzso zzso A zzso active form of zzso was found to zzso the zzso promoter zzso by zzso alone and in zzso with zzso zzso but not zzso also induced zzso of the zzso zzso Both zzso effects on zzso depended on the zzso zzso domain of zzso Using zzso and zzso we could show that zzso zzso zzso zzso independent of calcium zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso may regulate zzso activity in invasive breast cancer zzso
