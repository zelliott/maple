The zzso precursor protein zzso gives rise zzso zzso zzso which are the main constituents of senile plaques in brains of Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso processing of the zzso can be zzso by zzso zzso zzso and by zzso zzso zzso zzso This led to the hypothesis that classical and novel protein zzso zzso zzso which are activated by zzso regulate zzso zzso However, in addition to zzso there are other zzso receptors present in zzso that may participate in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein with an essential role in synaptic zzso zzso represents such an alternative target of the zzso second zzso zzso Using zzso zzso mice and zzso mice expressing a zzso zzso deficient in zzso zzso we determined the relative contributions of zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso We establish that, in addition to zzso zzso significantly contributes to the regulation of zzso zzso zzso
