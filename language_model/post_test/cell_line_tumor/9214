The zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso can mediate the zzso of zzso resistance zzso a major obstacle in the clinical management of cancer zzso It was hypothesized that zzso is a fundamental regulatory factor of the zzso gene in tumor cells and can zzso enhance drug zzso To analyze the potential impact of zzso in zzso cancer cells, two specific zzso small interfering zzso zzso were designed for transient triggering the zzso zzso interference zzso zzso in the zzso cell lines zzso and zzso as well as in their zzso counterparts zzso and zzso Since both zzso showed biological activity, for stable zzso of zzso corresponding zzso short hairpin zzso zzso expression zzso were zzso By treatment of the cancer cells with these zzso the expression of the targeted zzso zzso zzso and protein was completely inhibited following zzso zzso These zzso effects were not accompanied by zzso of the zzso expression or by reversal of the drug-resistant zzso In conclusion, the data demonstrate the utility of the analyzed zzso as powerful laboratory tools and indicate that zzso is not involved in the regulation of the zzso gene or the development of the drug-resistant zzso in zzso cancer zzso
