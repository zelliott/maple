zzso scaffolds can be used to mimic the zzso zzso zzso of soft zzso and provide support during tissue zzso To better match the native zzso composition and mechanical properties as well as tailor the degradation resistance and available cell binding zzso other proteins or different collagen types may be zzso The present study has explored the use of components such as gelatin or zzso and investigated their effect on the bulk physical properties of the resulting scaffolds compared to those made from pure collagen type zzso The effect of altering the composition and zzso was evaluated in terms of the scaffold structure, mechanical properties, zzso degradation and cell zzso zzso demonstrate that scaffolds based on gelatin had reduced zzso zzso and degradation time compared with zzso The addition of zzso reduced the overall strength and zzso of the zzso with electron zzso results suggesting that zzso zzso interacts best with collagen and soluble zzso interacts best with zzso zzso zzso was essential for structural stability, strength and degradation resistance for scaffolds of all zzso In addition, preliminary cell zzso studies showed these highly porous structures zzso size zzso to be able to support zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso this study suggests that the use of gelatin in place of zzso with additions of zzso can tailor the physical properties of scaffolds and could be a design strategy for reducing the overall material zzso
