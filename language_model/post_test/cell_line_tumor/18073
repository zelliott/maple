zzso gene expression profiling is well suited for parallel quantitative analysis of large numbers of zzso but its application to cancer zzso particularly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is limited by the poor quality of the zzso zzso This represents a serious zzso as zzso tumor tissue banks are available with clinical and zzso zzso which could be exploited for molecular profiling studies, provided that reliable zzso technologies are zzso We applied and evaluated here a zzso zzso zzso selection, extension and zzso zzso zzso for analysis of 502 zzso in highly zzso total zzso extracted from cultured cells or zzso breast cancer zzso zzso The study included quantitative and qualitative comparison of data obtained by analysis of the same zzso with zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso and, by zzso before and after extensive in zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression profiling zzso applied to zzso extracted from zzso cells, before or after 24 h stimulation with a zzso dose of zzso consistently allowed to detect zzso gene expression changes following extensive zzso degradation in zzso zzso results where obtained with tumor zzso extracted from zzso zzso zzso (6 to 19 years zzso The method proved itself sensitive, zzso and accurate, when compared to results obtained by zzso analysis of zzso extracted from zzso tissue of the same zzso
