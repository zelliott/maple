Isolation and expansion tumor spheres from zzso cancer cell line zzso cultured in zzso zzso supplemented with human zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso cells were cultivated in zzso cells cultivated in zzso zzso served as the zzso zzso zzso were observed by optical zzso and expression of zzso stem cells marker zzso was detected by zzso To induce cell zzso zzso spheres were cultivated without zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso zzso Then we zzso expressions of stem cell surface markers zzso and zzso among zzso cell, zzso cells and routine zzso cells under zzso culture condition by flow zzso At last we compared cell cycle and spectral zzso between two zzso 

In zzso consisting of zzso and zzso a minority of zzso cells could survive, zzso and form the suspended tumor zzso We detected high zzso expression in these zzso Compared with the zzso group and the zzso zzso group, the expressions of zzso and zzso were significantly increased in the zzso zzso group ( zzso There was no statistical difference in the expression of zzso and zzso between the zzso zzso group and the zzso group zzso Cell cycle analysis indicated that tumor spheres were of a high proliferation zzso could not find any noticeable difference in the number of zzso between the zzso group and the zzso zzso 

zzso spheres in which enriched cancer stem cells can be generated under zzso culture condition with zzso and zzso
