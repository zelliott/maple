The deregulation of zzso protein expression has been shown to lead to tumor development and zzso Both zzso and protein expression analyses using clinical samples have demonstrated that zzso is zzso in various zzso and positively zzso with a poor prognosis for cancer zzso The prognosis of cancer patients depends on zzso to distant zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso enhanced vascular zzso by degrading zzso and the zzso zzso at the plasma zzso An increase of soluble zzso levels in the serum facilitated tumor cell recruitment to the zzso which resulted in lung zzso We also found that zzso was zzso in zzso tumors, a highly zzso zzso in mice and zzso an authentic positive regulator of zzso was not elevated in the tumors, whereas zzso zzso Moreover, zzso induced zzso expression zzso by the zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso is known to be an zzso zzso for zzso and its expression was shown to be increased in the lungs at the zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso contribute to lung zzso zzso zzso the regulation mechanism of zzso zzso is of importance and may lead to the development of therapeutic drugs against tumor growth and zzso
