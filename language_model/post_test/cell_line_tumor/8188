The zzso zzso zzso plays important roles in the development of male zzso and in different human diseases including prostate zzso The zzso can act either as a promoter or a tumor zzso depending on cell zzso The zzso zzso response program has been well zzso but its prohibitive response program has not yet been thoroughly zzso 

Previous studies found that zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso inhibit growth and suppress zzso We applied expression profiling to identify the response program of zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso under different growth conditions zzso with or without zzso and at different concentration of zzso and then applied the newly developed zzso technology to identify the zzso binding regions in the zzso cancer zzso A surprising finding was that the comparison of zzso zzso cells with zzso cells identified zzso zzso expressed genes zzso fold zzso even without the addition of zzso zzso in ethanol zzso suggesting that a zzso independent zzso or extremely low-level zzso zzso of the zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso zzso binding regions in the cancer zzso of zzso cells with an zzso zzso discovery zzso cut off of zzso About zzso zzso of zzso can be mapped to within 2 zzso of the zzso start site zzso Three novel zzso binding motifs were identified in the zzso binding regions of zzso cells, and two of them share a core consensus sequence zzso which together mapped to zzso of zzso binding regions zzso In contrast, only about zzso zzso of zzso binding sites contains the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (from the zzso zzso which is derived mostly from zzso zzso responsive genes in zzso dependent zzso In addition, we identified four top ranking zzso zzso factors in the zzso binding regions, which include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our data provide a valuable data set in understanding the molecular basis for growth zzso response program of the zzso in prostate cancer cells, which can be exploited for developing novel prostate cancer therapeutic zzso
