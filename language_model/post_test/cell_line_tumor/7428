zzso regulate gene zzso through zzso zzso acid receptors zzso X receptors zzso Of the three zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been considered a tumor zzso zzso Here, we identified a novel zzso zzso in breast zzso cells, which could play a negative role in zzso zzso Similar to zzso the first zzso zzso zzso of zzso is zzso zzso specific, whereas the other zzso are common to all of the zzso zzso The first zzso of zzso does not contain any translation start zzso and therefore its protein translation begins at an internal zzso zzso of zzso lacking the A, B, and part of C domain of zzso zzso protein was zzso expressed in zzso zzso breast cancer cells and normal breast zzso cells that are relatively resistant to zzso whereas zzso zzso cells that did not express zzso zzso protein were sensitive to zzso treatment, suggesting that this zzso may affect the cellular response to zzso zzso zzso is unique among all of the zzso because a corresponding zzso was not zzso for either zzso or zzso zzso zzso was zzso expressed in normal and zzso breast zzso zzso Its zzso was under the control of a distinct promoter zzso which can be activated by zzso acid zzso and other zzso selective zzso in zzso and zzso breast cancer zzso We mapped the zzso promoter and found a region zzso to be the target region of zzso In conclusion, we identified and initially characterized zzso in normal, zzso and zzso breast zzso zzso zzso may serve as a potential target of zzso in prevention and therapy zzso
