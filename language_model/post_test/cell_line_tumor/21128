To generate a zzso zzso zzso against cell surface zzso zzso zzso zzso and observe its zzso activity on both human zzso vein zzso cells zzso and tumor zzso 

zzso cells zzso zzso against zzso were produced by zzso zzso zzso and screened by zzso The specificity of zzso was demonstrated by zzso and zzso imaging, as well as flow zzso zzso After the blockade of surface zzso with zzso on zzso and human breast zzso zzso cells, an zzso determination kit and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to detect the effect of the zzso on zzso zzso modification and cell zzso A cellular zzso zzso in combination with zzso and a cell migration zzso on zzso cells were used to determine the zzso zzso Finally, a zzso tube formation zzso was used to detect the zzso effect of zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso against the zzso of zzso was generated, and its zzso toward zzso and tumor cells was zzso We demonstrate that zzso binds to zzso at the cell surface, where it is able to inhibit zzso zzso This zzso also prevents the proliferation of zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso enhances the zzso effects of zzso ( zzso zzso the migration of zzso 231 in zzso zzso ( zzso and zzso zzso tube formation on zzso ( zzso 

zzso binds zzso to cell surface zzso blocks zzso zzso and exhibits both zzso and zzso zzso
