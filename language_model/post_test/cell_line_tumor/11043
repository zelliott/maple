zzso zzso zzso the product of zzso zzso zzso action plays an important role in various pathological conditions like inflammation and zzso In this study, we show that in the human breast cancer cell line zzso zzso growth factor zzso stimulates zzso activity in a zzso manner with a first peak after 15 zzso and a second delayed zzso occurring after 1 h up to 18 h and thereafter declining zzso This delayed zzso is accompanied by increased zzso and protein expression of zzso but not zzso zzso the zzso zzso is dependent on the classical zzso protein zzso protein zzso C zzso and the zzso zzso since specific zzso of these zzso all abolish the zzso zzso zzso and activity of zzso Moreover, zzso also suppressed zzso zzso zzso expression and activity which is reversed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso To see whether zzso zzso of zzso is of relevance for tumor zzso we investigated two hallmarks of zzso zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso of cells with zzso leads to enhanced zzso incorporation into DNA and also to zzso migration in a modified zzso chamber zzso When cells are depleted of zzso but not zzso by zzso zzso or by zzso treatment, zzso proliferation and migration are drastically zzso In zzso these data show that zzso causes an acute stimulation of zzso activity and, moreover, triggers a delayed SK zzso which is due to increased gene zzso and de zzso synthesis of zzso which in turn directs cells towards growth and increased zzso Thus, the zzso zzso may represent a novel attractive target for cancer zzso
