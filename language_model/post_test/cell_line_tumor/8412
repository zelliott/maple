In the present paper, we report on the zzso and in zzso zzso and zzso activities of a series of novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 12 and zzso zzso These new type of chemical entities showed no significant activity on the broad spectrum of DNA and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso performed on a panel of selected human tumor cell lines revealed that only compounds 1 and 5 showed moderate and selective zzso effect against zzso cells zzso zzso 24 and 32 zzso with no zzso zzso effects on human normal zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso linked via an zzso zzso zzso showed a selective zzso effect toward cervical zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso with no apparent zzso on human normal zzso zzso This compound can be therefore considered as a potential zzso lead compound for further synthetic structure zzso
