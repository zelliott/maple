To construct a zzso zzso zzso containing zzso and zzso and to investigate the influence of the zzso zzso on the cultured human lung cancer cell line zzso 

zzso was applied to amplify zzso from zzso cell, the zzso zzso of zzso was derived from zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were inserted into the multiple cloning sites of zzso to generate the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was confirmed by restriction zzso treatment and zzso and zzso into zzso zzso The expression of genes in zzso were identified by zzso zzso and Western zzso The function of zzso inducing the zzso of lung cancer was identified by zzso and flow zzso 

The restriction zzso zzso and sequencing suggested that zzso zzso zzso was constructed zzso the expression of zzso and zzso could be detected in zzso zzso The expressions of the two genes in zzso were not zzso The zzso cells zzso with zzso exhibited significant cell zzso 

The zzso zzso expression zzso zzso was constructed and expressed in zzso cell zzso which would contribute to a novel and effective treatment strategies for combined gene therapy for lung zzso
