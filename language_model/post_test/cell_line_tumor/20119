zzso zzso by zzso zzso plays essential roles in modulating protein function in both normal and disease zzso As such, there is a growing need to develop chemical reporters to examine the zzso and pathological roles of protein zzso Several zzso bulky SAM zzso have previously been used to label zzso of specific protein zzso However, broad application of these compounds has been limited by their general zzso with native zzso Here we report a SAM zzso zzso zzso zzso as a reporter of zzso zzso can be processed by multiple protein zzso for zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso SAM zzso rapid decomposition at zzso zzso likely via an zzso zzso In conjunction with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chemistry, zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis, we further demonstrated zzso utility to profile zzso of zzso zzso in diverse cellular zzso These results thus feature zzso as a convenient probe to study the activities of zzso protein zzso
