zzso B zzso is a zzso zzso agent with a mode of action similar to that of zzso but with the advantage of being active in zzso zzso zzso regarding other mechanisms of zzso action is zzso The purpose of this study was to identify gene expression profiles associated with the biological response to zzso in an zzso cancer cell line zzso 

zzso cells were maintained in zzso zzso zzso Equal zzso cells were treated with or without zzso and were evaluated for cell growth arrest and zzso zzso expression was evaluated by zzso zzso and zzso real time reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso 

zzso (10 zzso led to cell cycle arrest and zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis, comparing zzso to zzso cells, revealed altered expression of 41 zzso There was a predominance of sequences related to the zzso stress response zzso zzso expression of selected genes was confirmed by zzso 

We demonstrated that zzso zzso are a useful tool to rapidly screen for patterns of gene expression that characterize drug zzso The zzso data suggest that the zzso agent, zzso triggers stress-related signal zzso pathways related to zzso These pathways may contribute to mechanisms of zzso action and potential mechanisms of resistance in zzso zzso
