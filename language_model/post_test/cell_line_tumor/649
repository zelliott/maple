zzso possesses zzso effects on zzso zzso expressing zzso breast cancer cells in culture by reducing cell cycle progression and cell zzso There is increasing agreement that on a cellular level the effects of zzso are primarily induced by the zzso zzso zzso The participation of a second, nuclear zzso of the group of zzso zzso factors, called zzso is under zzso In this study we used a number of breast cancer cell lines differing in their expression of the zzso zzso and the two known zzso zzso In zzso breast cancer cells zzso with a zzso carrying the zzso gene zzso binding of zzso to the zzso element of the breast cancer suppressing gene zzso was more strongly reduced by treatment with zzso than in the parental zzso zzso of zzso responsive genes was determined in zzso cells, cells zzso for 16 zzso with zzso and cells subsequently treated with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso Treatment of the zzso cells with zzso zzso the increase induced by zzso almost zzso The more zzso a cell line zzso the stronger was the reduction of the expression of the zzso zzso There was no correlation between the expression of the nuclear zzso zzso and the effects of zzso on these zzso
