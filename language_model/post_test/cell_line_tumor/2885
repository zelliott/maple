zzso is an intermediate filament protein and a marker of zzso stem cells indicating zzso and zzso zzso In melanoma zzso zzso zzso was correlated with tumor zzso zzso of the zzso neural zzso was shown to be dependent on the binding of class III zzso zzso factors, with zzso zzso suggested to play a key zzso We found both zzso and zzso zzso in almost all of 13 analyzed melanoma cell lines of different progression zzso but expression levels did not zzso zzso protein was detected in 11 of 13 and zzso protein in 7 of 13 melanoma cell lines independent of progression zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso did not alter zzso expression in melanoma zzso However, zzso zzso such as zzso commonly cooperate with zzso factors of the zzso zzso family by binding to a nearby DNA site necessary for their zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to be expressed in zzso zzso with zzso zzso upon zzso We now demonstrate zzso and zzso protein expression in melanoma zzso and cell zzso zzso of zzso and of zzso markedly decreased zzso levels in melanoma cells in a cooperative zzso Thus, zzso and zzso but not zzso seem to be required for zzso expression in human zzso
