Two zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mediate the actions of zzso and although zzso of human breast zzso express zzso along with zzso little is known about the possible zzso effects of these two zzso To investigate this, we have used zzso gene delivery to produce human breast cancer zzso cells expressing different levels of zzso along with their zzso zzso and have examined the effects of zzso and zzso occupancy, using zzso zzso selective zzso on zzso gene expression by zzso and zzso network zzso zzso had diverse effects on gene zzso enhancing or zzso zzso regulation for distinct zzso of zzso target zzso zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso zzso the stimulation or suppression of many genes that were normally only regulated by zzso with zzso In addition, zzso plus zzso zzso the expression of a unique group of genes that were not regulated by zzso plus zzso zzso The expression of genes in many functional categories were modulated by zzso with the greatest numbers associated with zzso factors and signal zzso zzso zzso of multiple components in the zzso and zzso zzso and of genes controlling cell cycle progression and zzso may contribute to the suppression of cell proliferation observed with zzso Our observations suggest that the relative levels of zzso and zzso in breast zzso are likely to impact cell proliferation and the activities of diverse signaling pathways and their response to zzso zzso and zzso zzso
