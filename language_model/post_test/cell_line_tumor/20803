zzso zzso a synthetic analogue of zzso B in phase III clinical trials for breast cancer, binds to zzso and zzso At low zzso it suppresses the growth phase of zzso dynamic instability in zzso cells, arrests zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that suppression of zzso zzso dynamics zzso zzso zzso To further test this hypothesis, we measured the effects of zzso on dynamics of zzso and their attached zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso in living zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso Green fluorescent zzso zzso protein B marked zzso and zzso zzso In control cells, sister zzso zzso pairs zzso under tension between increasing and decreasing separation zzso and zzso zzso suppressed zzso dynamics at zzso that arrest zzso At 60 zzso zzso (2 zzso zzso zzso the relaxation rate was suppressed zzso the time spent paused increased zzso and zzso decreased zzso (but without reduction in mean zzso zzso indicating that zzso decreased normal zzso zzso tension at the zzso preventing the signal for zzso checkpoint zzso We also examined a more zzso but in tumors less zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At 2 zzso zzso (4 zzso zzso arrest also occurred in concert with suppressed zzso zzso Although media zzso values differed zzso between the two compounds, the zzso zzso were similar, indicating more extensive relative zzso of zzso into cells compared with zzso The strong correlation between suppression of zzso dynamics and zzso arrest indicates that the primary mechanism by which zzso blocks zzso is suppression of zzso zzso zzso
