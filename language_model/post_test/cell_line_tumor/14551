zzso is an zzso element binding protein that is involved in zzso metabolism and definitive zzso Although disruption of genes related to zzso often leads to the development of leukemia and lymphoma, the involvement of zzso in zzso zzso remains to be zzso In the present study, we identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso gene in zzso cells from a patient with acute zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of the zzso gene resulting from a zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in the zzso zzso cell line zzso In zzso cells, zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso induced growth zzso and an S phase checkpoint response, while the zzso protein zzso showed a diminished zzso Interestingly, this response was accompanied by zzso zzso which is frequently seen in the cellular response to ultraviolet zzso These data suggest that the zzso of zzso function is associated with the zzso of certain types of zzso
