The zzso tumor zzso and its related zzso zzso share a zzso DNA binding domain, and mouse zzso studies have suggested that they have overlapping as well as distinct biological zzso Both zzso and zzso are activated by zzso stress to regulate an array of cellular zzso Previous studies have suggested that zzso and zzso independently activate the cellular zzso program in response to zzso zzso The goal of this study was to compare the zzso activity of zzso and zzso at steady state and after zzso stress induced by zzso 

We employed zzso zzso the zzso promoter zzso and a zzso zzso for promoter zzso to identify promoter sequences enriched in zzso or zzso zzso either before or after treatment with zzso which increased the expression of both zzso and zzso in the human colon cancer cell line zzso We calculated a zzso zzso for promoter array score for each promoter and found a significant correlation between the promoter occupancy profiles of zzso and zzso We also found that after zzso treatment, the zzso promoters were still bound by zzso but zzso became associated with additional promoters that that did not bind zzso In particular, we showed that zzso zzso the binding of zzso but not zzso to the promoter of zzso which encodes a mismatch repair zzso and causes an zzso of the zzso zzso 

These results suggest that zzso exerts differential effects on the zzso functions of zzso and zzso and illustrate the power of zzso zzso for promoter array in the analyses of promoter occupancy profiles of highly zzso zzso zzso
