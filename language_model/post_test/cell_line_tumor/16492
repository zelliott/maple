In zzso the type II melanoma zzso zzso protein family is constituted by at least ten closely related members, but our understanding of their function in the developing nervous system remains zzso To systematically study the expression pattern of type II zzso genes during zzso we employed mouse embryonic zzso zzso cells as an in zzso model for neural differentiation by zzso acid zzso zzso The expression of type II zzso genes was investigated under distinct steps of differentiation by a comparative zzso zzso paradigm of real-time quantitative zzso zzso zzso The relative levels of each gene expression at various steps of differentiation were expressed as a fold change compared with that in zzso zzso zzso The results revealed that: zzso the expression of zzso zzso and zzso transcripts was steadily increased, and the relative levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso elevated after the zzso at zzso body and neural zzso zzso during zzso and subsequent zzso the expression of zzso zzso was zzso zzso our results suggested that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso might be involved in the early process of zzso and zzso connected with maintenance of zzso of stem zzso These studies may present some clues for a better understanding of the fundamental aspects of type II zzso genes during zzso
