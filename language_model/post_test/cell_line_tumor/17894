zzso are expressed as zzso or zzso zzso Plasma cells produce little or no membrane zzso but zzso zzso molecules in large zzso zzso zzso of zzso B cells are zzso zzso that may be targeted for zzso Thus, zzso vaccination is being evaluated in clinical trials to control residual disease in multiple myeloma and zzso zzso It is traditionally considered that zzso zzso are not effective against plasma cell tumors, because the large amounts of zzso molecules zzso by the tumors block zzso zzso and because the absence of membrane zzso on the surface of these tumor cells renders them resistant to the effect of zzso zzso While the obstacle of abundant circulating zzso may be zzso by reducing tumor burden to minimal residual disease, the absence of membrane zzso has been considered as a limiting factor that prevents tumor zzso by zzso zzso We demonstrate here that zzso zzso cells can produce small amounts of membrane zzso M zzso heavy zzso However, the latter are precursor molecules that do not reach the cell zzso Although zzso zzso is zzso the cells stain positively for surface zzso reflecting molecules of the zzso form in the process of zzso In spite of the relatively low levels of zzso zzso on the cell surface, zzso zzso are effective in zzso of tumor growth in zzso Thus, while there is no doubt that zzso zzso responses are very important, myeloma patients in complete zzso may additionally benefit from zzso zzso zzso
