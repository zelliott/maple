Recent zzso studies demonstrate that both active and zzso exposure to tobacco smoke increase the risk of breast zzso Little is known, however, about the molecular mechanisms by which zzso long term exposure to tobacco smoke contributes to breast zzso because most previous studies have focused on short term treatment zzso In this work we have set out to investigate the progressive transforming effects of tobacco smoke on zzso zzso zzso cells and breast cancer cells using in zzso and in zzso models of chronic cigarette smoke zzso 

We show that both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso breast zzso cells exposed to cigarette smoke acquire zzso properties such as zzso zzso increased zzso growth, and increased zzso and zzso Moreover, transplantation experiments in mice demonstrate that treatment with cigarette smoke extract renders zzso zzso cells more capable to survive and colonize the zzso ducts and zzso cells more prone to zzso from a subcutaneous injection site, independent of cigarette smoke effects on the host and zzso zzso The extent of transformation and the resulting zzso thus appear to be associated with the differentiation state of the cells at the time of zzso Analysis by flow zzso showed that treatment with zzso leads to the emergence of a zzso population in zzso zzso cells and of zzso and zzso + zzso cells, indicating that cigarette smoke causes the emergence of cell populations bearing markers of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso induced by cigarette smoke are accompanied by numerous changes in gene expression that are associated with zzso to zzso transition and zzso 

Our results indicate that exposure to cigarette smoke leads to a more aggressive and transformed zzso in human zzso zzso cells and that the differentiation state of the cell at the time of exposure may be an important zzso in the zzso of the final transformed zzso
