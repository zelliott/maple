zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso have shown only modest clinical activity when used as single agents to treat zzso They decrease tumor cell expression of zzso factor zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso that this might zzso tumor zzso we examined the effects of the zzso inhibitor zzso on tumor vascular function, tumor zzso zzso and chemotherapy and zzso zzso 

zzso treatment of human tumor cells in zzso and mice bearing zzso in zzso led to decreased zzso and zzso zzso Treatment altered zzso vessel zzso assessed by zzso zzso zzso tomato zzso zzso and decreased vessel zzso zzso by Evan's blue zzso suggesting vascular zzso zzso increased tumor blood flow measured by Power zzso ultrasound and decreased zzso measured by zzso zzso and tumor zzso zzso measured by optical zzso zzso that these changes would improve drug delivery and increase response to chemotherapy and radiation, we performed tumor regrowth studies in nude mice with zzso treated with zzso and either zzso or the zzso agent zzso zzso therapy followed by zzso led to synergistic zzso of tumor growth compared with either treatment by itself ( zzso Treatment with zzso before zzso led to greater tumor growth zzso than did treatment with zzso before zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by radiation inhibited tumor regrowth to a greater degree than did radiation alone, although the interaction between zzso and radiation was not zzso 

zzso zzso have shown clinical benefit when used in combination with conventional zzso zzso Our studies show that targeting tumor cells with zzso zzso may zzso the zzso via vascular zzso to increase response to chemotherapy and zzso These studies suggest ways to assess the response of tumors to zzso zzso using zzso imaging of the zzso
