The active zzso of vitamin D, zzso zzso zzso reduces the growth of several prostate cancer cell lines, most commonly by inducing a zzso arrest in zzso This is zzso in part, through zzso of zzso a positive regulator of the zzso factor, zzso There is evidence that prostate cancer cells lacking functional zzso protein zzso a negative regulator of zzso activity, are poorly responsive to zzso zzso Since up to zzso of prostate zzso demonstrate a loss of zzso for zzso we sought to determine whether zzso is required for the growth zzso effects of zzso 

Using zzso zzso was reduced in zzso prostate cancer cells, and the response of cells to zzso treatment or depletion of zzso measured by zzso incorporation and flow zzso The effects of zzso treatment on zzso levels and activity, and zzso target gene expression were also zzso 

zzso treatment and zzso depletion both cause a zzso arrest zzso zzso cell proliferation independently of zzso zzso reduces zzso expression and causes a decrease in zzso and zzso target zzso zzso an zzso target and positive regulator of zzso cell growth, also is zzso by zzso independently of zzso 

zzso growth zzso pathways compensate for the loss of zzso and tumors lacking functional zzso may be responsive to zzso
