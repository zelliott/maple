zzso of the zzso zzso plays an essential role in tumor growth and zzso zzso a natural zzso isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine zzso zzso zzso has been reported to possess tumor zzso activity, and results from a clinical study using a zzso mixture demonstrated its safety and efficacy for the treatment of late-stage lung zzso In this study, we reported that zzso is an inhibitor of tumor zzso activity in zzso and in zzso Our zzso modeling predicts that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso potentially interact with the zzso site of beta 5 zzso zzso of the zzso Indeed, zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor cellular zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso of the zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso leukemia zzso and human prostate cancer zzso cultures resulted in zzso of zzso proteins and several zzso target zzso proteins (I zzso zzso and zzso followed by induction of cell zzso zzso treatment resulted in tumor growth zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso associated with suppression of the zzso activity and induction of cell death in zzso Finally, zzso treatment significantly prolonged the survival period of mice bearing zzso zzso Our results indicate that the tumor zzso is one of the cellular targets of zzso and zzso of the zzso activity by zzso contributes to its zzso zzso
