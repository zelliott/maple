Fish zzso diets rich in zzso acid zzso provide protection against zzso The mechanisms of the zzso effects of zzso include the production of zzso oxygen species zzso zzso has zzso property and binds fatty zzso it may protect the cells against the zzso zzso In this study, we compared the zzso of three human zzso zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso to the zzso effects of zzso and examined the changes in the zzso following zzso zzso using zzso zzso or zzso zzso using small interfering zzso zzso zzso cells were the most susceptible to zzso zzso and increased zzso activities by zzso compared to zzso and zzso zzso The zzso effects of zzso were zzso zzso by typical zzso a radical scavenger, an iron zzso and incubation with zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells markedly attenuated zzso zzso activities and zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso in both zzso and zzso cells significantly enhanced the effects of zzso The results of our in zzso experiments indicate that the zzso effects of zzso on zzso cell lines are modulated by zzso
