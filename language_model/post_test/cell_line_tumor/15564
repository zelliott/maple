zzso have clearly molded the structure of the human zzso The reverse zzso coded for by long zzso nuclear elements zzso accounts for zzso of the human zzso with zzso zzso zzso copies of the most common human LINE element, zzso zzso cycle through an zzso intermediate with zzso as the rate limiting zzso Because various zzso have been demonstrated to be induced by environmental zzso we investigated the response of the zzso promoter to various zzso zzso promoter activity was analyzed by zzso an zzso cell line with plasmids containing one of two zzso promoters fused to the zzso reporter zzso zzso promoter activity was then monitored with a zzso zzso Treatment with zzso light and heat shock resulted in a small increase in zzso activity from one promoter, while treatment with zzso zzso resulted in small increases in zzso activity from both zzso No increase in zzso activity was observed after exposure to zzso or hydrogen zzso
