We zzso the involvement of zzso during zzso cell death of human zzso zzso lung zzso cells using a zzso approach that specifically targets protein N zzso and further detects newly formed N zzso that are the result of protein zzso Our analysis revealed 27 zzso zzso which we divided in sites zzso to zzso acid zzso and sites zzso to zzso zzso as the result of zzso and zzso zzso activities, zzso zzso some of the former were insensitive to potent zzso zzso and we therefore suggest that previous zzso studies that report on the zzso nature of zzso cell death should be judged with zzso Furthermore, many of the sites zzso to zzso zzso were also uniquely observed in a model of zzso zzso cell death and/or found by in zzso cataloging human zzso zzso using a similar zzso zzso This thus raises the hypothesis that killing tumor cells by chemotherapy or by immune cells holds similar zzso zzso components with strong indications to zzso zzso
