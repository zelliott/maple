We have previously shown that when zzso against zzso zzso was used, zzso factor zzso zzso activity was stabilized even under zzso conditions, and the expression of several zzso factors was zzso In zzso zzso the mechanism underlying zzso remains largely zzso In the current study, we investigate the role of the tumor zzso zzso in the regulation of the expression of zzso factors in zzso zzso In addition, we test whether zzso reduces zzso brain damage in zzso We used human zzso zzso cells zzso with either zzso or a negative control zzso zzso zzso and zzso multiplex zzso were used to detect gene and protein expression of several zzso factors after zzso For the animal studies, zzso rats were subjected to brain damage by cold injury, and 50 zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso or negative control was zzso At day 7 zzso brain sections were stained and image analysis system was used to determine the damaged zzso Our experiments using zzso cells revealed a significant effect of zzso on the expression of zzso but not zzso both at 8 and zzso after zzso The zzso led to significant zzso of zzso factors, including vascular zzso growth factor and zzso growth zzso both at the zzso and protein zzso Furthermore, our animal studies revealed significantly reduced area of zzso damage in rats receiving zzso compared to negative zzso Our findings indicate that zzso act as a zzso master switch of zzso in zzso cells, and that zzso of zzso by zzso may be an effective therapeutic strategy in treating zzso diseases such as brain zzso and zzso
