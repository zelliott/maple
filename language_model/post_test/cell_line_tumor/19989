zzso has been used for decades for medical intentions in the treatment of alcoholism and for agricultural purposes as a plant growth regulator and zzso zzso Its therapeutic effect is zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso and it was reported to be zzso in zzso mainly via zzso A dependent zzso by zzso Although described to be a zzso for zzso zzso zzso has a different molecular structure to zzso and zzso the preferred zzso for zzso zzso a more detailed investigation of its zzso with zzso was zzso We analyzed the impact of zzso on zzso activities of human zzso zzso zzso zzso using the classical zzso zzso zzso We found that a zzso treatment with zzso relevant zzso of zzso decreased the zzso activity zzso Based on this observation we performed additional experiments using zzso human zzso and zzso to achieve further zzso In detail a significant zzso and zzso zzso of zzso activity was observed for 100 and zzso zzso using zzso human zzso However, zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso zzso testing zzso as zzso did not provide evidence that zzso is zzso via zzso A dependent zzso in zzso by human zzso or zzso zzso or human liver zzso Therefore we can conclude that the observed zzso zzso zzso 50% and zzso after treatment with zzso and zzso CA, zzso is not based on zzso zzso of zzso Further zzso and kinetic studies indicated that zzso zzso with the active site zzso zzso of zzso leading to its rapid zzso zzso zzso after zzso and zzso for 1000 and zzso CA, zzso zzso of the reduction agent zzso zzso did not modify the effect, indicating that zzso processes that can be reversed by zzso zzso are not likely involved in the zzso Taken together our results show that zzso is able to inhibit zzso most likely via interaction with the active site zzso zzso Thereby zzso might zzso zzso dependent zzso and zzso of zzso
