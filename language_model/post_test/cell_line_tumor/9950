zzso E was isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso which has been previously demonstrated to possess zzso action on gastric cancer zzso The zzso value of zzso E on gastric cancer cells for 24 h was zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso was further zzso through western zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell cycle zzso Cell cycle arrest was induced by zzso E in S phase at a lower concentration (30 zzso and zzso phase at higher zzso zzso and 90 zzso zzso E zzso zzso through the induction of the zzso cascade for both the zzso and intrinsic zzso These findings suggest that zzso E may be an effective zzso agent against zzso
