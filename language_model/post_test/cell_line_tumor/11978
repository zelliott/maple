zzso zzso A is an zzso zzso isolated from red zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso This study examined the action of zzso A with the zzso zzso zzso that is zzso by the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso in zzso breast zzso zzso Treating the cells with zzso A alone caused the zzso of zzso zzso and an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in a dose dependent zzso A zzso treatment with zzso zzso and zzso A markedly reduced the zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso A treatment alone activated the zzso capacity of the zzso for the zzso element zzso of zzso as measured by the zzso shift zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso A reduced the level of the zzso zzso binding zzso Furthermore, zzso A zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for binding to the zzso in an isolated rat zzso The zzso A competitively inhibited the zzso zzso of zzso as measured by the formation of the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso A may thus be a natural zzso to bind on zzso zzso zzso A may be due to act an zzso of the zzso zzso
