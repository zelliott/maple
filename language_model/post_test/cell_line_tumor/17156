The difficulty in zzso zzso C virus zzso infection is attributable to the limited treatment options against the zzso Recently, zzso A zzso a widely used zzso drug, has been reported to be effective against zzso infection zzso zzso 38 zzso zzso although little is understood about the mechanism of its action against zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso effects of zzso using an zzso zzso zzso Human zzso zzso cells were zzso with an zzso zzso expressing a zzso gene zzso a zzso reporter and zzso zzso zzso Treatment of the zzso cells with zzso resulted in suppression of the replication of the zzso zzso in a zzso manner, with an zzso of approximately zzso zzso There were no changes in the rate of cell growth or zzso suggesting that the effect of zzso against zzso is specific and not due to zzso In contrast, zzso another zzso drug, did not suppress zzso zzso zzso did not activate zzso gene responses, suggesting that its action is independent of that of zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso replication in zzso specifically at clinical zzso Further defining its mode of action against zzso replication potentially may be important for identifying novel molecular targets to treat zzso zzso
