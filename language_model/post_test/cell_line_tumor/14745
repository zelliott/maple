To clarify the properties of clinical zzso zzso by comparing with clinical zzso zzso 

Human tumor cell lines, zzso and zzso were zzso with 200 zzso zzso or 10 zzso zzso In zzso DNA zzso breaks zzso induction was evaluated by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured by zzso after zzso with zzso zzso The relative biological effectiveness zzso was obtained by zzso survival zzso 

zzso induction was significantly higher for zzso than zzso with average ratios of zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso after zzso However the differences became insignificant at zzso Also, zzso induction in zzso cells was significantly higher for zzso than zzso with an average ratio of zzso at zzso However, the difference became insignificant at zzso zzso values of zzso to zzso at zzso survival were zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso 

Cell zzso may differ according to different zzso and/or zzso zzso beams demonstrated higher cell zzso than zzso in the early zzso These data may facilitate the understanding of the biological properties of clinical zzso zzso
