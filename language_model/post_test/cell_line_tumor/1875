It has been shown that regulation of zzso expression in prostate cancer cells is mostly at the zzso zzso zzso zzso has long been recognized as a zzso zzso which may regulate zzso differentiation and participate in many zzso zzso Recently, it has been reported that zzso is also involved in other tumors, such as zzso cancer, zzso cancer and may regulate cell zzso in these cancer zzso In the present study, we examined the expression and effects of zzso in two zzso prostate cancer cell zzso The expression of zzso and zzso were analyzed by quantitative zzso After zzso of zzso and zzso cell viability zzso zzso zzso western zzso analysis, cell migration and invasion zzso were conducted in zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we showed that zzso and zzso are expressed at the detection limit in two zzso prostate cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso inhibited cell zzso migration and invasion in these zzso We also provide the first evidence that zzso may target zzso Our study provided the first glimpse of the functional role of zzso in two zzso prostate cancer cell zzso These results may add to our knowledge on the molecular basis of prostate cancer zzso
