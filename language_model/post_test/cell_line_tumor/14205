To investigate the immune response of the zzso of zzso zzso cells to zzso cell zzso zzso with zzso zzso gene in zzso 

zzso human zzso zzso colony stimulating factor and zzso human tumor necrosis factor alpha were used to generate DC from zzso blood in zzso zzso fusion gene was cloned into a zzso zzso zzso DC were zzso with zzso zzso using zzso zzso method and electric zzso method zzso Then zzso zzso zzso the fusion of zzso DC and zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso zzso zzso test was carried out to observe the immune zzso 

DC were generated in zzso from zzso blood and expressed high levels of zzso zzso and zzso II molecules zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso had been successfully zzso into zzso zzso and zzso analysis showed that DC were fused with zzso zzso cells zzso Then the fusion cells of zzso zzso cells to zzso DC, and the zzso of zzso zzso cells to DC were zzso with peripheral blood zzso cell zzso zzso test showed that both zzso could induce zzso T cell activity and zzso of zzso zzso cells, and the former effect was zzso 

The zzso T cell activity induced by the zzso of zzso zzso cells to zzso DC is zzso
