A novel class of zzso derivatives characterized by a zzso acid or zzso scaffold was zzso These zzso zzso for zzso zzso activity against a panel of six different tumor cell lines, showed strong zzso activity and selectivity mainly towards zzso cell zzso In particular, compounds zzso and 5 stand out for their cell growth zzso activity and, among them, compound zzso emerged for its selectivity towards zzso with respect to other tested tumor cell zzso zzso treated with zzso of zzso for zzso showed zzso induction and suppression of zzso signaling together with induction of zzso From a zzso point of view, two different approaches were used in order to study zzso and electronic properties of the novel compounds and to shed light on their zzso zzso zzso zzso and electronic features of the compounds endowed with the most relevant biological activity were zzso in zzso some zzso properties like zzso and zzso were zzso
