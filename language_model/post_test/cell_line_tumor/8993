zzso screening zzso is a powerful tool for drug discovery being capable of measuring cellular responses to chemical zzso in a zzso zzso zzso provides an zzso zzso of cellular zzso including features such as shape, intensity, or texture in a highly zzso and quantitative zzso The corresponding feature zzso can be used to characterize zzso and are thus defined as zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso fingerprints allow for objective zzso comparisons of cellular zzso Such comparisons therefore facilitate the detection of different compounds with different zzso outcomes from zzso zzso zzso Feature selection methods and similarity measures, as a basis for zzso identification and zzso are critical for the quality of such zzso zzso We systematically evaluated 16 different similarity measures in combination with linear and zzso feature selection methods for their potential to capture biologically relevant image zzso zzso zzso similarity measures such as Kendall's zzso and zzso zzso perform well in most evaluation scenarios, outperforming other frequently used metrics (such as the zzso zzso We also present four novel modifications of the connectivity map similarity that surpass the original version, in our zzso This study provides a basis for generic zzso analysis in future zzso zzso
