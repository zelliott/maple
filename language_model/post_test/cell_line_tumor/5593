The synthesis and zzso activity of a series of zzso six zzso and zzso zzso acid derivatives of general formula zzso or zzso are zzso The synthesis was carried out by reaction of zzso zzso with sodium hydrogen zzso prepared in zzso and this led to the formation of sodium zzso that subsequently reacted with zzso acid to produce the corresponding zzso acid zzso All of the compounds were tested against a prostate cancer cell line zzso and some of the more active compounds were assessed against a panel of four human cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso Some of the compounds exhibited remarkable zzso and zzso activities against zzso and zzso that were higher than those of the reference compounds zzso and zzso zzso For example, in zzso when zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso the zzso values were zzso zzso and zzso zzso On the other hand, in zzso these compounds showed values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso acid did not provoke zzso nor did it zzso the cell cycle in zzso
