zzso fatty acids zzso are zzso from zzso zzso bacteria that induce zzso in immune cells such as zzso zzso and zzso However, it remains unclear if zzso from pathogens induce zzso in zzso similarly with zzso This study investigated whether zzso zzso is equal among the zzso zzso Cell zzso of the employed human cells was evaluated after treatment with culture zzso from various zzso bacteria or sodium zzso zzso and viability were determined by detection of DNA fragmentation and using an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso culture zzso strongly induced zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso culture zzso failed to induce zzso in the zzso and zzso human zzso and zzso cell zzso Healthy zzso zzso and oral zzso cells were resistant to all the culture zzso zzso zzso detected zzso acid in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in culture zzso zzso only trace levels were seen in zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso acid produced by zzso bacteria severely damages zzso cells in a consistent manner and, likewise, could be involved in zzso zzso chronic zzso
