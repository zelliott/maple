zzso a commonly used drug in the treatment of type II diabetes, may reduce cancer risk and improve cancer zzso We evaluated its effect on zzso zzso cancer cell zzso 

The zzso and zzso cell lines were exposed to zzso with and without zzso zzso zzso were performed in zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso of total and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated by Western zzso following exposure to zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso of zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso the effect of zzso in zzso zzso growth zzso was partly abolished by the zzso zzso compound zzso Western zzso demonstrated that zzso at zzso zzso induced zzso zzso and decreased zzso and zzso zzso suggesting the mechanism for its zzso zzso 

zzso significantly zzso the growth of zzso cancer cell lines and zzso zzso Further zzso studies are being conducted to determine the zzso of zzso in the treatment of zzso zzso
