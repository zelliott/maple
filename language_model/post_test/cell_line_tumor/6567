The zzso family includes three members, of which zzso is frequently zzso in melanoma and other zzso We show that zzso and zzso require zzso for stability, whereas zzso does zzso In contrast, zzso activated zzso binds to an zzso complex, which is required for its stability and zzso Exposure of melanoma cells and tumors to the zzso inhibitor zzso results in the degradation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso and cell zzso induction of zzso and zzso zzso These data suggest that activated zzso zzso proteins are incompetent for folding in the absence of zzso thus suggesting that the zzso is required for the zzso evolution of zzso and other tumors that depend on this zzso zzso zzso represents a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of zzso
