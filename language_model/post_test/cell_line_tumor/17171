An experimental cancer gene therapy model was employed to develop a zzso imaging procedure using zzso zzso zzso zzso as an zzso zzso for monitoring zzso zzso zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso gene ( zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was prepared by a zzso zzso synthesis process and zzso to give zzso zzso The zzso yield was over zzso with a zzso purity of more than zzso The stability of zzso in the form of zzso powder (the hot zzso was much better than that in the normal saline zzso The shelf life of the final zzso hot kit product is as long as 4 zzso Cellular zzso of zzso after different periods of storage was investigated in zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and parental zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines over an zzso incubation zzso The zzso cells accumulated more zzso than zzso cells in all conditions, and zzso increased with time up to 8 zzso The kinetic profile of the cellular zzso of zzso zzso formulated from the zzso hot kit or from the stock solution was zzso zzso For animal model cancer gene therapy studies, zzso mice were zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso cells into the flank to produce zzso zzso studies showed that zzso ratios were 2, zzso zzso and zzso at 1, 4, 8 and 24 h post injection, respectively, for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for the zzso zzso zzso clearance from blood was completed in 24 h and was zzso A significant difference in zzso zzso was revealed among the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and other zzso At 24 h zzso higher activity retention was observed in zzso zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso After seven consecutive daily treatments with the zzso zzso zzso gamma camera imaging showed zzso zzso zzso at day 4, and complete zzso zzso at day zzso These results clearly demonstrate that the simplified zzso synthesis process developed in this study is reliable and that the zzso product is useful for in zzso monitoring of zzso gene transfer, expression and gene zzso
