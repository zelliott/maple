zzso studies show that zzso vegetables play a role in dietary protection against zzso The protective effects of zzso are thought to be associated with secondary zzso termed zzso the zzso products of which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso product of the zzso zzso increases zzso zzso zzso zzso when included in the diet of zzso Here we evaluate the mechanism of zzso of zzso zzso by zzso The regulatory region of the zzso gene contains two response zzso the zzso response element zzso and the zzso response element zzso that respond to zzso zzso zzso We compared zzso of zzso zzso expression by zzso in zzso and zzso zzso mouse zzso cell zzso Both cell lines showed a similar increase in zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is not required for zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with reporter zzso containing portions of the zzso regulatory region of the rat zzso gene confirmed this, revealing that zzso significantly activated zzso but not zzso in a zzso zzso Furthermore, both zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso activated the ARE for zzso gene expression whereas only zzso activated the zzso at the zzso zzso In addition, zzso with zzso and zzso caused synergistic increases in zzso zzso activity and zzso levels in zzso zzso Based on these findings, we propose that synergistic zzso of zzso is due to zzso of the ARE and the zzso by zzso and zzso
