High levels of zzso have been associated with poor outcome in pancreatic cancer zzso The functional role of zzso is, however, poorly zzso 

zzso followed by two-dimensional gel zzso and mass zzso were undertaken to identify zzso interacting proteins in pancreatic cancer zzso zzso and zzso were performed to examine expression or zzso of zzso zzso was used to zzso specific proteins and effects on zzso were measured using zzso Chamber and wound healing zzso 

Our zzso screen to identify zzso interacting proteins revealed zzso 11, zzso 2, zzso beta and a candidate novel zzso zzso zzso Of these, zzso 2 was considered particularly interesting, as, like zzso it is expressed early in the development of pancreatic cancer and zzso occurs with high frequency in invasive zzso zzso zzso confirmed the interaction between zzso 2 and zzso and the proteins zzso particularly in the plasma membrane of cultured pancreatic cancer cells and primary pancreatic zzso zzso Analysis of primary pancreatic cancer specimens zzso revealed a strong association between high levels of zzso zzso and the presence of zzso 2 in the plasma membrane of cancer cells zzso zzso of zzso was accompanied by diminished levels of membrane zzso 2 and caused a pronounced reduction in the zzso of pancreatic cancer zzso 

These findings point towards a functional role for zzso that may help explain the link between zzso expression in pancreatic cancer and aggressive zzso
