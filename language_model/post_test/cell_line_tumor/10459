Conventional therapies to treat prostate cancer zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are deficient in outcome which has necessitated a need to identify those agents that could target zzso for both disease zzso We provide zzso evidence that zzso zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso 

zzso prostate zzso cell zzso zzso zzso functional zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells were used to test the zzso activity of zzso zzso grown under zzso environment and treated with zzso were tested for zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso competitive zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso Furthermore, in zzso molecular modeling for zzso binding was zzso zzso mice bearing zzso and zzso zzso tumors were treated zzso with zzso (40 zzso 3 zzso and tumor growth and surrogate zzso were zzso To assess zzso zzso serum levels were zzso 

zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso activity of zzso and zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso for zzso zzso blocked the binding of zzso to zzso genes including zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso inhibited the recruitment of zzso Pol II to target zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso analysis showed that zzso is zzso to zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of both zzso and zzso cells in zzso zzso and tumor zzso exhibited reduced zzso zzso 

zzso an effective zzso zzso could be developed as a potential agent to treat human zzso
