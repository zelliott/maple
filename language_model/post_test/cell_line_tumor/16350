zzso expression is elevated in gastric cancer and is associated with shorter survival times for zzso However, the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso in gastric cancer remains zzso In the present study, we report that zzso zzso zzso expression by directly targeting its zzso region zzso and that zzso expression was zzso correlated with zzso expression in gastric cancer zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that, similar to the effect of zzso zzso zzso of zzso markedly inhibited proliferation and zzso of gastric cancer cells both in zzso and in zzso This was found to be mechanistically associated with induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso enhancement of the zzso activity of zzso and suppression of zzso zzso Moreover, we showed that the zzso of zzso (without the zzso but not with the zzso could abrogate the zzso induction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as rescue the zzso proliferation zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso has an important role in the suppression of gastric cancer and presents a novel mechanism of zzso zzso expression in cancer zzso
