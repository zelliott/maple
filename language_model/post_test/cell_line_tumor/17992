In zzso zzso therapy zzso an zzso zzso zzso to tumor zzso where it selectively converts a subsequently administered zzso zzso into a zzso zzso zzso is a zzso fusion construct zzso a single chain zzso against the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly and zzso expressed in zzso of all zzso zzso Here we describe the zzso and zzso capacity of zzso labeled zzso zzso labeling of zzso was performed by the zzso method, and the properties of the resulting zzso zzso were determined in zzso and in zzso including zzso studies in nude mice bearing human zzso colon zzso zzso The zzso zzso bound specifically to zzso cancer cells in zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso as determined by a zzso zzso in zzso the tumor zzso of zzso peaked at zzso injected zzso 47 h post zzso zzso tissue zzso was low, and activity in blood was lower than in tumor at all zzso studied zzso zzso The zzso ratio increased over time with a maximum of zzso at 67 h post zzso zzso thus shows a zzso that makes it attractive for both zzso zzso and zzso zzso therapeutic experiments showed a significant reduction of tumor size in mice treated with the zzso zzso zzso This work demonstrates the feasibility of zzso and zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso
