The zzso group zzso proteins are known to be involved in maintaining the silenced state of several zzso regulated zzso zzso of zzso zzso 2 zzso a member of this large protein family, has also been shown to be zzso in different tumor types and its role, both as a potential primary zzso and as a zzso of zzso has become a subject of increased zzso We observed that zzso binds to zzso a member of the zzso family; as such, we were led to consider the possible ability of zzso to zzso cell cycle zzso Both zzso and zzso repress gene expression by recruiting zzso zzso zzso which decreases DNA accessibility for zzso zzso zzso Additionally, we observed that zzso interacts with the zzso region of zzso essential for interaction with zzso We show that zzso is able to reverse zzso repression of the zzso A zzso This indicates a functional role of this complex in regulating zzso A zzso known to be crucial in zzso cell cycle zzso We also detected a significant decrease in the retention of zzso activity associated with zzso when zzso was zzso Finally, zzso shift zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso of zzso caused the zzso of the zzso complex on the zzso A zzso These data, taken together, suggest that zzso competes with zzso in binding to zzso zzso their occupancy on the zzso A zzso In this study, we propose a new mechanism for the functional zzso of zzso that ultimately contributes to cell cycle progression and zzso zzso
