The zzso clearance of zzso cells is essential to prevent chronic inflammation and zzso The zzso protein milk fat zzso factor 8 zzso is a major zzso for zzso cells, and zzso mice spontaneously develop a zzso zzso Similar to human systemic lupus zzso zzso the zzso disease is associated with an impaired clearance of zzso zzso zzso is routinely treated with zzso zzso whose zzso effects are zzso attributed to the zzso of zzso zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso of zzso expression and the zzso enhanced elimination of zzso cells constitute a novel aspect in this zzso Patients with chronic inflammation receiving high-dose prednisone therapy displayed substantially increased zzso zzso levels in circulating zzso zzso induction was dependent on the zzso zzso and several zzso response elements within the zzso zzso Most zzso the zzso of zzso induction by zzso interference or genetic knockout strongly reduced or completely abolished the zzso effect of zzso in zzso and in zzso Thus, zzso promotion of zzso cell clearance is a novel zzso facet of zzso treatment and renders zzso a prospective target for future therapeutic interventions in zzso
