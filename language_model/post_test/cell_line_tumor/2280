Although zzso of clear cell zzso cell zzso zzso is basically observed in late stage tumors, zzso stage zzso of zzso can also be found with no zzso molecular cause resulting inappropriate selection of surgery method and poor zzso zzso signaling is a zzso widely expressed signal zzso that mediates various cellular processes in normal development and zzso This study aims to explore the potential role and mechanism of zzso signaling in the zzso of zzso stage zzso 

The expression of zzso and zzso were analyzed in tumor zzso and matched normal adjacent zzso obtained from 51 zzso zzso Compared to zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression was significantly elevated both in zzso and protein levels in zzso zzso samples of localized and zzso tumors were divided into three groups based on their tumor stages and the relative zzso expression of zzso and zzso were zzso Compared to localized tumors, zzso expression was significantly elevated in zzso tumors in zzso stage while zzso expression was not statistically different between localized and zzso tumors of all zzso The average size of zzso tumors was significantly larger than localized tumors in zzso stage zzso and the elevated expression of zzso was significantly positive correlated with the tumor zzso The functional significance of zzso signaling was studied by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso cell lines with full-length expression plasmids of zzso and zzso Compared to the corresponding controls, all cell lines demonstrated significant promotion in cell proliferation and migration while cell cycle remained zzso 

zzso expression of zzso signaling increased the risk of zzso in zzso stage zzso by stimulating the proliferation and migration of tumor cells, which may be helpful for the selection of suitable operation method and prognosis of zzso
