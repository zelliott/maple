zzso of mast cells in response to zzso or the calcium zzso agent, zzso is dependent on zzso of zzso stores of zzso and the ensuing influx of external zzso also referred to as zzso calcium zzso However, it is unlikely that the calcium zzso calcium channel is the sole mechanism for the entry of zzso because zzso and other zzso zzso also zzso and support zzso in zzso mast zzso In this study we show that influx of zzso and zzso as well as zzso are dependent on the presence of the zzso transient zzso potential zzso channel protein zzso in addition to zzso and zzso as demonstrated by knock down of each of these proteins by zzso zzso in a rat mast cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso which are known to be essential components of calcium zzso calcium channel, allows entry of zzso but not zzso whereas zzso of zzso and zzso allows entry of both zzso and zzso These and other observations suggest that the zzso zzso associates with zzso and zzso in a zzso manner to enhance entry of zzso to generate a signal for zzso
