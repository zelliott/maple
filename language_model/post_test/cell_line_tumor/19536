zzso is the most common and aggressive primary brain zzso Recent isolation and characterization of brain zzso cells supports the concept that transformed neural stem cells may seed zzso We previously identified a wide array of zzso tissue transcripts zzso in a broad set of primary zzso zzso zzso tumors but not in secondary zzso zzso from zzso tumors, zzso zzso or normal brain zzso Here, we extend this observation and show that a subset of primary zzso tumors and their derived tumor lines express cellular and molecular markers that are associated with zzso stem cells zzso and that zzso cell cultures can be induced to differentiate into multiple zzso zzso cell zzso These findings suggest either that a subset of primary zzso derive from transformed stem cells containing zzso properties and retain partial zzso aspects of a zzso nature in tumors or that zzso activate a series of genes that result in zzso properties of the cancer cells to effect sustained tumor growth and zzso zzso
