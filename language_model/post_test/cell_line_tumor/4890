The study was aimed to investigate the possible mechanism of vitamin zzso zzso on zzso syndrome zzso cell line zzso in zzso The flow zzso was used to analyze zzso rate and the change of cell zzso The expression of zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso were detected by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso The activity of zzso was detected by zzso zzso The results indicated that the zzso peak on zzso and positive zzso zzso on cell membrane showed that zzso induced zzso of zzso cells in a zzso manner, S and zzso cell zzso zzso cell arrest, zzso significantly zzso the expression of zzso and zzso but had no effect on the expression of zzso the activity of zzso was significantly zzso It is concluded that zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells through zzso zzso pathways and the zzso genes zzso and zzso may play important roles in the process of zzso zzso
