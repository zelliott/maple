In order to compare the efficacy of zzso zzso and zzso zzso for monitoring early responses to zzso two human zzso cancer zzso cell lines zzso and zzso which were derived from the primary zzso and the zzso zzso zzso underwent X-ray zzso of 0, 10, or 20 zzso and were examined at 0, 24 and 72 h After zzso reduced proliferation of both zzso and zzso cells was observed in a zzso manner ( zzso zzso arrest was also noted in both cell types after 72 h in the 20 zzso group ( zzso Although increased zzso was observed in both cell lines after zzso ( zzso a greater percentage of zzso cells underwent zzso in response to zzso than zzso zzso Increased zzso and decreased zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression was observed over time via zzso and Western zzso analysis ( zzso however, no significant changes were noted in response to zzso Finally, reduced zzso of zzso by zzso or zzso cells was observed at zzso zzso however, reduced zzso zzso was only observed after 72 zzso zzso we conclude that zzso is a more suitable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for monitoring early responses to zzso in primary and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
