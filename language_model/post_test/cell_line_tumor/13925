zzso acid zzso the most biologically active zzso of vitamin A, controls cell zzso zzso and differentiation depending on the cellular zzso These activities point to zzso as a candidate for cancer zzso A pivotal effect of the zzso is the zzso of zzso a zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Here, we investigate the mechanisms by which zzso regulates zzso level in zzso a zzso cell zzso When added to the cells, zzso causes a rapid nuclear increase of zzso which clearly precedes growth zzso The early buildup is not due to impairment of the zzso degradation, in contrast to previous zzso zzso we did not detect the zzso of zzso and zzso two proteins involved in the nuclear zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso does not impair the zzso nuclear export and does not cause zzso zzso The characterization of zzso zzso by two-dimensional zzso showed that zzso zzso an early nuclear zzso of zzso zzso zzso studies established that this zzso zzso to zzso zzso on zzso The buildup of zzso precedes the zzso zzso and increases its zzso Finally, zzso nuclear zzso extracts showed an enhanced capability of zzso zzso on zzso thus explaining the nuclear zzso of the zzso In conclusion, our data suggest a novel mechanism of zzso zzso activity, in which the zzso rapidly zzso a nuclear zzso activity that zzso zzso on zzso In turn, this event causes the stabilization of zzso and its zzso in the nuclear zzso
