B cells and plasma cells possess distinct zzso processing environments that respectively promote the expression of zzso zzso by B cells versus the zzso of zzso by plasma zzso Through a combination of zzso profiling and screening using a zzso zzso zzso interference library, we show that both the zzso factor zzso and the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso the ratio of zzso versus zzso zzso transcripts in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso are both highly expressed in primary plasma cells relative to B cells, but zzso binds zzso zzso transcripts and promotes an increase in levels of the zzso zzso zzso at the expense of the zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso this effect and drives zzso zzso by increasing the frequency of the zzso zzso zzso As in T cells, zzso also alters the zzso pattern of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso promoting zzso zzso and decreasing the overall level of zzso zzso Further characterization of zzso zzso by zzso revealed that zzso of transcripts expressed by plasma cells were zzso processed because of the activities of zzso including zzso maturation zzso zzso a zzso with a defined role in plasma cell zzso Taken together, our data identify zzso and zzso as regulators of zzso processing in plasma zzso
