The maintenance of zzso stability in cells is relentlessly challenged by environmental stresses that induce DNA breaks, which activate the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and its downstream zzso to control zzso zzso checkpoints and DNA zzso Here, we show that zzso interacts with zzso to promote zzso of zzso at zzso 1981 and prompting its downstream zzso to form nuclear zzso in response to DNA zzso zzso zzso in cells abrogates the formation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso after DNA zzso zzso zzso in cells promotes zzso zzso the zzso or zzso zzso zzso and the repair of damaged DNA, whereas cells lacking zzso did not trigger the zzso mechanism after DNA zzso The zzso domain of zzso binds to the FAT domain of zzso thereby contributing to the zzso of zzso These results suggest that zzso may be regulated directly by zzso in the zzso zzso
