Recently, we demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso tumors treated with zzso zzso zzso were less zzso than control tumors, suggesting that AM might be involved in zzso and/or vessel zzso zzso the zzso of new zzso from zzso blood vessels, is a zzso process that involves migration and proliferation of zzso cells, zzso of the zzso zzso and functional maturation of the newly assembled zzso In our study, we analyzed the role of AM on human zzso vein zzso cell zzso zzso related to different stages of zzso Here we report evidence that AM promoted zzso migration and invasion in a zzso zzso The action of AM is specific and is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, AM was able to induce zzso differentiation into zzso structures on zzso zzso zzso of vascular zzso growth factor zzso and AM acted zzso to induce zzso effects on zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso to zzso did not significantly inhibit zzso zzso tube formation by human zzso cells, indicating that AM does not function indirectly through zzso of zzso These findings suggest that the zzso action of AM on cultured zzso cells via zzso and zzso receptors may translate in zzso into enhanced zzso and therefore identify AM and its receptors acting as potential new targets for zzso zzso
