We previously reported that the expression of zzso in human zzso tumors zzso and zzso is markedly higher than that in the normal zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the functions of the protein zzso by this zzso which are thus far zzso zzso studies were used to reveal its zzso zzso and zzso and gene expression experiments were conducted to identify proteins that might interact with zzso and molecular pathways in which it might play zzso Using colon cancer cell lines, we showed that both zzso and zzso expressed zzso is zzso into the zzso zzso In the cells, it was found mainly in the zzso space (probably the zzso and cell zzso Both cellular compartments were also zzso in lists of proteins identified by mass zzso as putative zzso zzso and/or proteins zzso by genes whose zzso was significantly changed by zzso zzso These zzso and zzso zzso zzso link zzso to several zzso and molecular zzso including zzso processes like protein zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso experiments confirmed zzso interaction with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and with the zzso zzso zzso a key player in zzso zzso By modulating zzso zzso zzso could affect different branches of the zzso zzso Our findings suggest it may zzso regulate the zzso zzso and its expression is associated with decreased cell proliferation and zzso
