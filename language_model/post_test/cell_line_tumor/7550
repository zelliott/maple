zzso Factor zzso plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation and other biological processes in zzso However whether or not it is involved in the zzso resistance zzso process of gastric cancer has not been fully zzso zzso To explore the role of zzso in the zzso process of gastric cancer in zzso and in zzso a zzso gastric cancer cell line with stable zzso of zzso was zzso zzso zzso led to zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso It significantly promoted the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso confirmed that the percentage of zzso cells increased after zzso zzso This notion was further supported by the observation that zzso of zzso blocked entry into the zzso of the cell zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso significantly increased zzso zzso of zzso In addition, we determined the in zzso effects of zzso small interfering zzso zzso on tumor size, and zzso cells in tumor zzso were detected by zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling and zzso and zzso zzso In molecular studies, zzso zzso and western zzso revealed that zzso zzso could inhibit expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso may be involved in regulating multiple signaling pathways in reversing zzso suggesting that zzso may represent a novel target for gastric cancer zzso
