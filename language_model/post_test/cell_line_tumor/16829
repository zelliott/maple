To investigate the zzso effect of zzso zzso extraction zzso on growth of zzso bearing zzso and to analyze the mechanism about the zzso zzso 

With zzso zzso bearing mice, zzso mice were zzso with zzso cells by subcutaneous zzso On day 2 after zzso the zzso mice were zzso into 5 groups, they were the control group, the high, middle, low zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso 10 days, the zzso rate of tumor in the treatment groups were analyzed at 11th zzso Meanwhile, zzso with zzso against zzso and zzso were used to investigate the zzso zzso In addition, the effect of zzso on zzso of tumor were investigated on chick zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In contrast to model group, the zzso rate of the high, middle, and low zzso of zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, and zzso could significantly reduced the express of zzso and zzso density zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso g zzso zzso doses of zzso could significantly inhibited the zzso of zzso the zzso rate of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso showed zzso effect, and maybe it is related to zzso zzso and reducing zzso then zzso the zzso zzso
