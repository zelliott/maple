zzso disease treatment is a promising branch for future zzso In this work, we introduce an zzso zzso system zzso based drug delivery device for zzso drug zzso An in zzso study on cancer cell treatment has been conducted to demonstrate a zzso that the engineered device is suitable for individualized disease zzso This is the first study to demonstrate that zzso drug delivery devices can influence the outcome of cancer drug treatment through the use of individualized disease treatment zzso where the strategy for drug zzso is tailored according to different zzso The presented device is zzso zzso through a zzso membrane and made of zzso zzso for zzso using simple and cost-effective zzso zzso zzso disease treatment was investigated using the in zzso programmed delivery of a chemotherapy drug, zzso to pancreatic cancer cell zzso zzso cell colonies of two pancreatic cancer cell lines zzso and zzso were treated with three programmed schedules and monitored for 7 zzso The result shows that the colony growth has been successfully inhibited for both cell lines among all the three treatment zzso Also, the different observations between the two cell lines under different schedules reveal that zzso cells are more sensitive to the drug zzso These results demonstrate that further development on the device will provide a promising novel platform for individualized disease treatment in future medicine as well as for automatic in zzso zzso in drug development zzso
