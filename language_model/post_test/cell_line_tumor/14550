The present study compared the zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso and carbon zzso zzso Despite lower zzso capacity, suspension of zzso zzso sheets exposed to zzso radiation zzso zzso 2 zzso generated more heat than DNA or sodium zzso zzso zzso under the same zzso zzso zzso zzso performed significantly better than zzso in inducing zzso death of zzso human zzso cells in zzso The superior zzso sensitivity of zzso sheets could be largely explained by their better zzso which has been supported by a simple calculation taking into account zzso optical and geometrical properties of the two type of carbon zzso The mechanisms of zzso zzso killing of cancer cells apparently involved zzso stress and zzso membrane zzso resulting in mixed zzso and zzso cell death characterized by zzso zzso fragmentation and cell membrane damage, zzso
