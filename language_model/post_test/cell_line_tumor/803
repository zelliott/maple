zzso zzso is a major component of inclusion bodies in Parkinson's disease zzso and other zzso To clarify the possible roles of zzso in the molecular zzso of neurodegenerative diseases, we have established a novel cellular model based on the differentiation of zzso cells that zzso zzso In the presence of zzso iron, differentiation of the cells led to the formation of large zzso inclusion bodies, which developed from scattered small zzso seen in zzso zzso The zzso zzso inclusions zzso largely with zzso and some of them were positive for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso treatment with zzso a zzso zzso agent, interrupted the zzso formation but led to a zzso increase of zzso zzso zzso it appears that an zzso retrograde transport system via zzso plays a crucial role in the zzso formation and also that the zzso may represent a zzso response against noxious zzso This cellular model will enable better understanding of the molecular zzso of zzso
