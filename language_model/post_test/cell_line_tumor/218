High biological activity of the transforming growth factor zzso zzso characterizes the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso poor prognosis to zzso zzso zzso zzso has become a novel target for the experimental treatment of these zzso zzso is processed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso from cells in a zzso complex with its processed zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso zzso binds to this small zzso zzso complex zzso and regulates its function, presumably via interaction with the zzso zzso zzso We report here that the levels of zzso protein in zzso increase with the grade of zzso in zzso zzso is associated with the zzso as well as zzso into the medium in cultured zzso zzso zzso The release of zzso into the medium is decreased by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cell lines results in an increase zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as an zzso marker of zzso activity is zzso zzso zzso gene zzso reduces zzso activity and zzso zzso without affecting zzso protein zzso zzso we identify zzso as an important zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells, which may contribute to the zzso zzso of these zzso
