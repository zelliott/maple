The zzso zzso zzso zzso protein plays several critical roles in both normal and zzso cells, including phase II zzso zzso stress responses, signaling and zzso zzso of zzso has been observed in many types of cancer, including head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso is not well zzso We investigated the role of zzso in two zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso revealed that cancer cell proliferation was significantly decreased in both cell zzso In addition, the frequency of zzso cells increased following zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cell zzso Growing evidence suggests that zzso zzso zzso regulate gene expression and can function as zzso or tumor zzso in human zzso Based on the results of zzso searches, zzso is a candidate zzso targeting zzso zzso of zzso has been reported in many types of human cancer, including zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the expression of zzso at both the zzso and protein zzso The signal from a zzso reporter was significantly decreased at one zzso target site at the zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso directly regulates zzso Our data indicate that zzso may have an zzso function and may be regulated by zzso a tumor zzso zzso in zzso The identification of a novel zzso zzso could provide new insights into potential mechanisms of zzso zzso
