zzso a zzso zzso although selected for exploratory clinical trials for its potent zzso activity, has long been challenged by its unpredictable side zzso In the present study, a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso was ascribed to its potent effects on zzso zzso Moreover, our investigation indicates that zzso zzso zzso phase growth arrest through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proliferation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, especially zzso proliferation of zzso with an zzso value of zzso zzso zzso can not only induce DNA zzso but also enhance zzso zzso binding of the zzso On the one hand the expression levels of protein zzso zzso zzso changed in response to zzso treatment in zzso zzso On the other hand we observed the zzso of zzso nuclear zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso the zzso zzso -9 activity increase in zzso cells after treated with zzso which indicated that the zzso zzso was involved in the zzso signal zzso Our results showed that the zzso of zzso and zzso decreased following zzso zzso In zzso zzso displayed a significant zzso effect through cell cycle arrest and zzso induction in zzso cells, which suggested that zzso might have therapeutic potential against zzso
