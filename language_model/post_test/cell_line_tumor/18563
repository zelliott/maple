Large doses of zzso zzso could cause zzso stress and tissue damage through production of zzso zzso zzso species and zzso zzso of zzso Although zzso are known to modify DNA, the effect of zzso on DNA modifications has not been studied zzso In this study, we investigate whether large doses of zzso can modify the nuclear DNA in zzso zzso cells used as a model system, because these cells contain zzso zzso zzso responsible for zzso metabolism and subsequent toxicity zzso and zzso zzso Our results revealed that zzso produced zzso and significantly elevated the zzso zzso zzso levels in the nucleus of zzso zzso cells in a time and concentration dependent zzso zzso significantly reduced the 8- zzso incision activity in the nucleus by decreasing the activity and content of a DNA repair zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso in large doses can increase the zzso level partly through significant reduction of zzso DNA repair zzso
