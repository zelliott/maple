zzso is a member of the tumor necrosis factor zzso that provides a zzso signal to zzso and zzso T cells while zzso the effects of zzso zzso zzso regulatory T zzso Because of this dual activity, zzso may provide significant zzso immunity in zzso zzso To study its clinical potential, a fusion protein consisting of zzso linked to the zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso was genetically zzso After demonstrating its potency in zzso several zzso were performed to evaluate its zzso effect in comparison to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies in zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso mice showed that although zzso produced modest tumor regression, zzso produced complete zzso in both tumor zzso Survival studies confirmed these results and showed that zzso treatment produced lasting responses throughout the zzso observation zzso zzso zzso analysis of treated and zzso tumors and zzso zzso zzso identified a qualitative difference in the activity of zzso compared with zzso treatment as evidenced by differences in zzso and zzso zzso These studies reflect the profound therapeutic potential of zzso which substantially exceeds the zzso zzso zzso in ability to produce complete tumor zzso and promote long-term survival in solid tumor zzso
