Human mast cells are often found zzso and at zzso sites and may play crucial roles in the inflammatory zzso Recent studies have suggested a prominent role for mast cells in host zzso In this study, we analyzed the effects of a common airway zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso of human mast zzso Human mast cell leukemia cells zzso were activated with either zzso zzso zzso zzso and calcium zzso or with varying zzso of zzso suspensions of zzso zzso were zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso colony stimulating factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Nuclear proteins were isolated and zzso by zzso mobility shift zzso zzso for nuclear factor zzso zzso nuclear binding zzso In some experiments, zzso zzso zzso was added to determine functional zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced mast cell zzso and selective zzso of two key inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso This was accompanied by zzso zzso Neither spun bacterial zzso nor bacterial zzso induced zzso zzso suggesting need for direct bacterial contact with mast zzso zzso electron zzso revealed active zzso of bacteria over mast cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso inhibited expression of zzso These findings suggest the possibility of direct interactions between human mast cells and common bacteria and provide evidence for a novel role for human mast cells in innate zzso
