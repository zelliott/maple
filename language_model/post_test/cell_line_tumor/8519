A new approach to the surface engineering of zzso iron oxide zzso zzso may encourage their development for clinical zzso In this study, we demonstrated that zzso surface modification of zzso has the potential to be an advanced zzso contrast agent for biomedical applications, including diagnostic imaging in zzso 

zzso zzso zzso which is an innate zzso derived from the body, was coated onto the surface of zzso An in zzso degradation study of zzso zzso zzso was performed for 28 zzso To diminish zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso We next studied the ability of the zzso to serve as a specific targeted contrast agent after zzso of zzso zzso The zzso were zzso with zzso and labeled with zzso for zzso zzso In zzso and in zzso zzso binding studies were performed on zzso cells or a zzso tumor model using animal zzso an optical imaging system, and a zzso clinical MR zzso 

zzso showed rapid degradation in zzso and in zzso compared with zzso zzso modified with zzso acid reduced zzso zzso showed improved zzso and provided good zzso in zzso The zzso zzso zzso when zzso with zzso zzso were successfully zzso on the zzso tumors implanted in mice via zzso zzso 

We suggest that zzso can be used as a zzso to target a region of interest in molecular zzso When we consider the zzso of contrast agents in zzso zzso are superior to zzso zzso zzso
