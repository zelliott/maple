zzso are secondary plant zzso They have a zzso or zzso zzso zzso are attached to one or more points of this structure, forming chains that can be zzso This appearance leads to zzso properties giving zzso the ability to interact with both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso behavior lets them lower the surface tension in zzso solutions and form zzso when reaching the critical zzso concentration zzso It also lets them interact with zzso membrane layers that usually consist of zzso and zzso This action may zzso the membrane and its function leading to membrane zzso or complete zzso Thus zzso are also known for their zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso In our studies we wanted to answer the question if there is a correlation between the unspecific zzso behavior when lowering the surface tension and the ability to zzso cell zzso and to act zzso Do zzso showing a considerable reduction in the surface tension also reveal an evident zzso zzso a marked cell membrane zzso We tested a variety of zzso with distinct zzso The reduction in the surface tension and the zzso were analyzed on a zzso using the zzso plate zzso The general zzso was determined in a cell model by DNA zzso The cell membrane toxicity or membrane zzso was explored in a cell model by zzso of the leakage of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The experiments revealed a correlation between the membrane toxicity and the reduction in surface zzso
