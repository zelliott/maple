zzso acid zzso receptors belong to G zzso zzso receptors and mediate a variety of cellular responses through the binding of zzso So far, six types of zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso to zzso have been zzso Recently, it has been demonstrated that each zzso zzso has opposite effects on zzso property of cancer zzso In this study, to evaluate an involvement of zzso receptors on zzso process in zzso tumor cells, we generated zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells from zzso cells, and investigated the effects on cell proliferation and migration abilities of zzso zzso cells by those zzso In zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells indicated high expression and zzso cells showed low zzso compared with control zzso When zzso cells were cultured with a zzso from zzso cells, the cell growth rate and migration ability of zzso cells was significantly higher than control zzso By contrast, a zzso from zzso cells significantly inhibited those abilities of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso may play opposite roles on the regulation of zzso cells in mouse zzso tumor zzso zzso
