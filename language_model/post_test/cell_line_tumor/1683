In this study, the aim is to investigate the zzso effects of inflammatory bone cells after in zzso low-level laser therapy zzso A human zzso cell line zzso was zzso infected with zzso zzso and exposed to low-level laser treatment at 5 or zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso cell attachment was observed under a zzso and cell viability was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso and the inflammatory markers zzso zzso and zzso were analyzed by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and Western zzso The data were collected and analyzed by one-way analysis of zzso zzso p zzso indicated a statistically significant zzso zzso laser treatment on zzso cells increased their ability to attach and zzso After zzso the expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cells decreased over time zzso zzso 

low-level zzso laser treatment increased the zzso cell zzso ability and decreased the expression of inflammatory zzso in zzso zzso
