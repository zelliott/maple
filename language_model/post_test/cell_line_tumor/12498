In this work we have examined the ability of various zzso to deliver genes into liver cancer zzso We evaluated different parameters such as the protocol of preparation, the zzso zzso ratio, and the molecular weight and type of zzso to zzso the zzso to achieve high zzso zzso Our hypothesis was that the association of zzso with zzso zzso zzso would increase zzso expression compared to zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
