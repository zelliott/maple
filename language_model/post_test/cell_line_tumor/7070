zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso is a ubiquitous zzso zzso that plays a key role in zzso zzso is also a zzso protein that acts in the zzso milieu as a potent zzso Increased expression of zzso and its zzso has been found in a wide spectrum of zzso and is associated with cancer progression and zzso Recent studies indicated that zzso is induced by zzso and enhances the random zzso of pancreatic cancer zzso In the present study, the role and regulation of zzso in the growth and zzso of pancreatic cancer cells were zzso 

In this study, we assessed whether zzso of zzso in human pancreatic cancer cells enhances the liver zzso using an zzso mouse tumor zzso We also investigated the zzso signal zzso pathways of zzso in human pancreatic cancer cell zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso in zzso invasion of zzso zzso zzso In zzso after zzso zzso into the zzso of nude mice, parental and empty zzso zzso zzso cells produced locally relatively small tumors with no evidence of liver zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso cells produced the large tumors and liver zzso In addition, zzso of zzso leads to zzso of zzso expression associated with the zzso of the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso 

The data submitted here show that zzso expression significantly contributes to the aggressive zzso of human pancreatic cancer and thus may provide a novel zzso and therapeutic zzso
