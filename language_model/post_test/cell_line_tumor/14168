zzso zzso zzso that prevent cells from damage zzso by zzso and zzso zzso may be early critical zzso of zzso To explore the zzso promoter zzso island zzso of the zzso gene as a zzso for screening zzso zzso zzso high risk individuals and for the early detection of zzso we analyzed its zzso in the tumor and zzso zzso and serum samples from 26 patients with zzso as well as serum from 8 liver zzso patients by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of 26 zzso tumor zzso and 18 of 26 zzso corresponding zzso zzso displayed zzso promoter zzso island zzso Similarly, zzso promoter zzso was detected for the first time in 16 of 32 zzso of circulating tumor DNA in the peripheral serum from zzso patients and 4 of 8 zzso zzso zzso and 3 of 8 zzso corresponding serum DNA from zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso gene in the serum of patients is in agreement with tumor zzso status zzso zzso zzso None of the 12 normal zzso samples were zzso zzso 

These data indicate that the zzso zzso of promoter zzso island zzso of the zzso gene may contribute to the zzso of zzso and is a potential valuable zzso for zzso disease monitoring and zzso early zzso
