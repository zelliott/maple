zzso and zzso of zzso have been proposed to be responsible for the zzso zzso gating zzso and the zzso gap junction channel zzso zzso To better understand the molecular zzso determining the zzso properties and the zzso of zzso we have replaced part of the zzso of zzso zzso corresponding domain of zzso to engineer a zzso zzso and attached zzso at the zzso of zzso to construct zzso The dual zzso zzso technique was used to test the resulting gap junction channel properties in zzso zzso The zzso gap junction channel lowered the sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso slowed zzso zzso and reduced zzso as compared to zzso zzso zzso gap junction channel showed similar zzso properties and zzso to zzso zzso We further characterized a zzso zzso where the zzso zzso at the ninth position of zzso was replaced by the corresponding zzso zzso at zzso The zzso relationship of zzso channel was significantly changed; most zzso the zzso residual zzso zzso was near zzso Moreover, the single zzso channel only displayed one open state zzso zzso 132 zzso 4 zzso and no zzso could be zzso Our data suggest that the zzso of zzso is critical for both the zzso and the zzso and the introduction of a positively charged zzso at the ninth position reduced the zzso with a correlated disappearance of the zzso at the single channel zzso
