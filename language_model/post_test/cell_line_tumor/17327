We previously reported the zzso differentiation of skeletal muscle cells in a zzso zzso transplanted beneath a kidney zzso zzso observation suggested that the skeletal muscle cells may have differentiated from zzso zzso cells in the anterior zzso zzso However, at that time, we did not confirm this directly with an in zzso zzso To obtain direct evidence, we used the zzso cell zzso The zzso cell line was recently established from the zzso zzso of a zzso T zzso transgenic mouse and has the characters of zzso zzso zzso Using zzso cells, we have found that zzso cells of the zzso are able to differentiate into muscle cells in zzso Additionally, we showed that the cells have some characteristics of zzso zzso cells and also express zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso and can differentiate into zzso muscle zzso The anterior zzso zzso is known to be of zzso origin, so the differentiation of its cells into zzso muscle is completely zzso This is the first report of direct evidence of zzso differentiation of skeletal muscle cells from zzso zzso
