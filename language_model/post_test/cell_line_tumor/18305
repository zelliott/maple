zzso an zzso herbal zzso has been known to exert zzso and zzso zzso However, its molecular mechanism of action is not zzso The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of the water extract of zzso zzso on the growth of zzso human lung cancer zzso Treatment with zzso resulted in a zzso growth zzso coupled with the characteristic zzso features of zzso zzso zzso of zzso induced zzso and zzso zzso accompanied by zzso degradation of zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso in zzso cells was associated with a decreased expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment also inhibited the expression of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso without significant changes in the levels of zzso Taken together, these findings provide important new insights into the possible molecular mechanisms of the zzso activity of zzso
