zzso zzso is a common cause of pediatric zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso is a putative zzso factor that zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso in zzso zzso Cellular cholesterol, a major component of zzso zzso has a pivotal role in regulating signaling zzso and protein trafficking as well as pathogen zzso In this study, we demonstrated that cell intoxication by zzso zzso zzso zzso toxin is through the association of zzso zzso toxin zzso and membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso zzso with zzso zzso while the distribution reduced upon the depletion of cholesterol, suggesting that zzso zzso toxin zzso are associated with zzso zzso The disruption of cholesterol using zzso not only reduced the binding activity of zzso zzso toxin zzso on the cell membrane but also impaired their delivery and attenuated zzso cell cycle zzso zzso cell intoxication by zzso zzso toxin was restored by cholesterol zzso These findings suggest that membrane cholesterol plays a critical role in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of host zzso
