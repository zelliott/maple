In an effort to develop novel zzso or zzso agents, a series of zzso derivatives were prepared by zzso zzso of appropriate zzso with suitable aromatic zzso In zzso screening revealed low zzso activity zzso against several human cancer zzso zzso in zzso cells correlated with the ability to induce zzso zzso zzso following drug treatment by the most potent agent, 8, an observation further reinforced by zzso zzso zzso 3, 8, and 10 showed potent zzso effect on NO production in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The present results demonstrated that 3, 8, and 10 are potential zzso and cancer zzso zzso
