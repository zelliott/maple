zzso zzso complexes have emerged both as promising zzso of DNA structure and as zzso agents because of their unique zzso and zzso zzso A key consideration in the administration of those therapeutic agents is the zzso of their chemical zzso to allow facile attack on the target sites, yet avoid unwanted side zzso Here, we present a drug delivery platform technology, obtained by zzso the surface of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso This hybrid zzso displays enhanced zzso properties relative to that of the zzso zzso complex in a homogeneous zzso Since the coordination between the zzso complex and a zzso zzso linked zzso to the zzso can be zzso under zzso with visible light, the zzso complex can be released from the surface of the zzso by selective substitution of this zzso with a water zzso Indeed, the modified zzso undergo rapid cellular zzso and after zzso with light, the release of an aqua zzso complex is zzso We have delivered, in zzso the zzso complex and zzso loaded in the zzso structure, to breast cancer zzso This hybrid material represents a promising candidate as one of the so-called zzso agents that possess both diagnostic and therapeutic zzso
