In most human zzso zzso zzso have been identified in the zzso however, their significance remains zzso We recently discovered that zzso mouse zzso zzso cells, when deprived of zzso or following zzso of respiratory activity, undergo zzso zzso disruption accompanied with irregular edging of zzso the appearance of zzso stress zzso and an altered gene expression zzso In this study, using the zzso zzso zzso cells obtained from zzso mouse zzso zzso cells, we examined the roles of two zzso zzso zzso factors, zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the disorganization of zzso zzso We found that the expression of zzso zzso and that of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso cells were regulated by zzso and zzso zzso Of note, zzso and pharmacological zzso of zzso ameliorated the disrupted zzso zzso It is interesting to note that the expression of high mobility group zzso 2 zzso a zzso zzso protein implicated in zzso zzso was increased at the protein level through the zzso zzso Here, we reveal how the zzso of the zzso zzso is implicated in the repression of zzso zzso expression in zzso human cancer cells, highlighting the importance of the zzso zzso in zzso transformation associated with zzso dysfunction, thereby raising the possibility that the zzso indirectly interferes with the zzso zzso structure by influencing the zzso zzso zzso zzso Overall, the data suggest that zzso dysfunction potentially contributes to zzso transformation of zzso cells through the zzso of these zzso zzso
