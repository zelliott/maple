zzso of concentrated zzso medium zzso from zzso zzso myeloma cell cultures showed that this cell line produced and zzso several zzso Two zzso activities at zzso and 90 zzso were identified as zzso acid zzso and at least two zzso of the zzso zzso zzso family with molecular masses of zzso zzso were found by gelatin zzso One of these zzso was identified as zzso L by using an zzso zzso exploiting the zzso zzso and the inhibitor zzso The zzso acid and zzso zzso were active only at zzso pH and are therefore not a potential risk for degrading the product or affecting cell growth during zzso zzso zzso of zzso may, however, possess zzso functions, but addition of zzso L zzso to zzso cultures did not influence zzso The zzso zzso product was not zzso in zzso CM incubated at pH 7, but when the pH was decreased to zzso the zzso acid zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso also revealed the presence of several zzso zzso in zzso zzso one at 85 zzso and two at 50 zzso with pH zzso close to culture zzso zzso of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso significantly increased the specific proliferation rate as compared to the zzso In addition to these data, zzso zzso acid sequencing identified two proteins in zzso CM as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor and zzso zzso
