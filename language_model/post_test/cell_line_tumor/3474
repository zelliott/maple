zzso zzso zzso is strongly resistant to conventional chemotherapy by unclear zzso We and others have previously reported that zzso and growth zzso signal zzso is involved in the growth and progression of zzso Here, we identified a zzso that involves stem cell factor zzso in zzso zzso resistance of zzso zzso When we compared gene expression profiles between five zzso cells and their zzso zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso cells expressed both zzso and zzso and had higher zzso levels of zzso zzso of zzso or zzso expression with their respective small interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to the induction of zzso by different zzso agents, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in parental zzso cells in the presence of zzso zzso zzso and increased resistance to the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso cells expressing zzso showed a similar increased resistance to the zzso zzso These results indicate that induction of zzso by zzso production of zzso and zzso zzso plays a key role in zzso a broad spectrum zzso on zzso cells and reveal a novel signal zzso zzso for pharmacological or genetic intervention of zzso zzso
