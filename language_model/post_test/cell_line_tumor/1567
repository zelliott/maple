Many studies which focus on the molecules and mechanisms related to the characteristics of the cancer have been zzso In particular, cell zzso molecules zzso are known to play a central role in the zzso of cancer cells to vascular zzso zzso In this study, the expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cell lines was analyzed and correlated with the characteristics of various zzso cell zzso Eight human zzso cell lines were used in this zzso We analyzed the expression of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso cell lines by western zzso analysis and zzso zzso We estimated the expression of zzso using western zzso analysis and zzso to compare the expression at the gene level with the protein zzso In addition, we determined the expression of zzso as one of the markers for the cellular activity compared to the levels of expression with the expression of zzso and zzso zzso was highly expressed in all of the cell lines except zzso and zzso which exhibit a more aggressive nature among the studied zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso varied in all zzso cell zzso In particular, zzso was highly expressed on all zzso cell zzso In conclusion, the levels of expression of the zzso may not affect cellular activity, zzso or zzso However, most zzso cell lines show various expressions of zzso suggesting that zzso cell lines expressing the major zzso remain candidates for molecular targeted therapy, which may need to be zzso for therapy according to the molecular zzso
