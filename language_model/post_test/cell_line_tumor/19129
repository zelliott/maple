The purpose of this study was to investigate the zzso effects and mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso a new zzso of zzso The results showed that zzso inhibited proliferation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells in a zzso and zzso manner as determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells treated with zzso for 24 h showed cell cycle arrest at zzso and a parallel decrease in zzso and S phase as detected by flow zzso zzso Meanwhile, a fraction of cells with zzso DNA content representing zzso were detected by zzso zzso observation also revealed typical zzso features, including shrinkage of cellular and nuclear zzso condensed zzso around the nuclear periphery and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Under a zzso laser scanning zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were greatly increased whereas the pH value, zzso membrane potential zzso and zzso oxygen species zzso were markedly reduced in zzso cells after treatment with zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the zzso mechanisms of zzso are attributed to zzso through increasing zzso zzso and zzso zzso and reducing pH value, zzso and zzso
