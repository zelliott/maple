zzso complexes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were prepared to examine sugar and heavy atom effects on in zzso zzso Cellular zzso into zzso cells was enhanced by introducing sugar units regardless of other features, such as the central zzso zzso base or zzso zzso and the ring structure zzso or zzso The zzso complex of zzso zzso zzso zzso exerted an excellent degree of zzso not only on zzso cells, but also on zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also exerted similar or much higher zzso rather than zzso zzso the zzso zzso did not improve the in zzso zzso of zzso The enhanced zzso oxygen generation of zzso complexes zzso the heavy atom zzso was confirmed at least in zzso zzso In addition, the formation of hydrogen zzso and zzso radical were also detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso oxygen species zzso generation efficiency, which is the product of the zzso quantum yield of each zzso and the light absorbing ability, did not fit the trends of zzso seen for the zzso In our zzso zzso tested, the best indicator of the zzso was found to be the light absorbing ability zzso the zzso strength in the wavelength region applied in the zzso zzso These results indicated that zzso characteristics of zzso zzso were notably susceptible to the zzso The biological zzso such as the sugar effect, were a much more reliable approach to improving the zzso of zzso
