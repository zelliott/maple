zzso agents delivered to cancer cells often show zzso resistance zzso due to expulsion of the zzso One way to address this problem is to increase the zzso of zzso agents in cells via zzso acid zzso Thus, zzso and zzso were newly zzso by adding zzso and zzso zzso respectively, to the parent zzso agent zzso without stability issues in rat zzso zzso and zzso showed enhanced zzso effects versus the parent zzso in various cancer cell lines, including human breast cancer cells zzso zzso and lung cancer cells zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso study revealed that both zzso and zzso but not the parent zzso inhibited zzso transport in zzso and zzso cells, suggesting the involvement of zzso acid zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso have enhanced zzso effects, likely due to an increased zzso of the agents into cancer cells via zzso acid zzso The present data suggest that zzso acid zzso may be an effective drug delivery target to increase the zzso of zzso agents, leading to one method of overcoming zzso in cancer zzso
