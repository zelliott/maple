The zzso and zzso zzso protein is a focal zzso protein that has been linked to zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic use of the detection of zzso in tumor specimens and in urine for zzso detection of transitional cell zzso zzso 

zzso zzso for zzso was performed on 72 zzso zzso tumor zzso and zzso content was measured in 132 spontaneous urine sample sediments by Western zzso zzso 

In the zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso showed abundant expression throughout the zzso of the zzso and zzso However, modest zzso of zzso was observed in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso in urinary cell zzso from healthy donors and zzso cancer patients was highly sensitive for the presence of zzso The zzso value was determined by receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso When a zzso value of 1 zzso zzso zzso of urine was used, the sensitivity, zzso and positive and negative zzso values of the zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased urinary zzso content in zzso patients was attributable in part to a specific increase in cell shedding presumably caused by changes in cell zzso as confirmed by zzso zzso zzso with zzso above 250 zzso and urinary infection gave false positive results and are therefore sample exclusion zzso 

In the absence of urinary infection or gross zzso urinary zzso level is a promising marker for transitional cell zzso
