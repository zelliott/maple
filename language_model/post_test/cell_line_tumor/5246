The identification of zzso pathways zzso activated by genetic zzso in multiple myeloma zzso or sustained by the bone zzso zzso zzso provides novel opportunities for the development of targeted zzso The zzso function of protein zzso zzso plays a critical role in driving zzso zzso zzso We investigated the effects of the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso in a panel of human zzso cell lines, including zzso positive cell lines expressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso harboring zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso displayed the highest sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso The stimulating effect of the zzso zzso was zzso in cells harboring a zzso active zzso Drug treatment inhibited zzso and expression of the zzso zzso as well as zzso signaling involving zzso and zzso zzso of zzso an additional zzso target, resulted in zzso zzso zzso of these zzso pathways was associated with zzso zzso Moreover, drug treatment zzso zzso and zzso stimuli provided by zzso medium from zzso zzso zzso Gene expression profile of zzso cells showed 22 zzso and 52 zzso genes upon zzso treatment, with an early zzso of genes implicated in zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and the growth factor zzso zzso maturation zzso zzso Thus, zzso blockade of zzso and zzso results in zzso of several zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso These data may have therapeutic implications in the design of treatment strategies resulting in the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso signaling pathways in zzso zzso
