zzso invasion of zzso cells is the main obstacle to successful therapy of these zzso After identifying zzso zzso transport zzso zzso as being zzso in invasive human zzso we study its possible function in zzso cell zzso 

Based on data obtained from previous zzso zzso we investigated expression of zzso in zzso tissue and cell lines on zzso levels using reverse zzso zzso Furthermore, we examined the amount and zzso of zzso protein using zzso and zzso Using small interfering zzso technology we zzso zzso expression in human zzso cell lines and zzso their migration using wound healing and zzso migration zzso 

Increased zzso zzso and protein levels were found in zzso zzso and cell lines compared with normal human zzso Small interfering zzso zzso zzso led to significantly reduced migration of human zzso zzso 

zzso is zzso in zzso and functionally involved in zzso cell migration, representing a new component involved in zzso invasion
