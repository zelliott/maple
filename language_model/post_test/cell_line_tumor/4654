zzso zzso zzso and its active zzso zzso zzso zzso display no binding affinity for the zzso zzso yet exert zzso effects by altering steroid zzso However, the mechanisms underlying this observed effect are not zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the site of zzso action on zzso in zzso using mouse zzso tumor cells zzso Various zzso of zzso zzso 50, 100, zzso 400, or 800 zzso were added to the medium for 24 h followed by stimulation with some compounds such as human zzso zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso zzso analog zzso zzso zzso and zzso Data showed that zzso inhibited the increases in zzso production induced by zzso and zzso In contrast, the levels of zzso zzso remained zzso In addition, zzso zzso production was also suppressed by zzso These results suggested that the site in the steroid zzso zzso affected by zzso occurs downstream of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, incubation with zzso and zzso as zzso precursors for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively resulted in no marked change in zzso production, indicating that zzso did not influence zzso and zzso but did exert an effect on cholesterol transportation into zzso the zzso zzso These results were supported by the zzso zzso expression seen with zzso administration, as zzso is a key factor in this zzso Data indicate that zzso zzso with steroid hormone production by affecting zzso expression in zzso zzso
