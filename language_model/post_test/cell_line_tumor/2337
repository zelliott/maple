zzso zzso of clear cell zzso cell zzso cases contain regions of radically different zzso demonstrating a zzso appearance zzso resembling zzso These zzso zzso are called zzso clear cell zzso cell zzso Patients diagnosed with zzso clear cell zzso cell zzso face a considerably worse prognosis due to an increased propensity for zzso In the present study we investigate whether the zzso conversion of clear cell zzso cell zzso could be interpreted as linked to the process of zzso zzso Using 6 zzso clear cell zzso cell zzso cases we show that zzso clear cell zzso cell zzso shares characteristic markers associated with loss of von zzso tumor zzso with conventional clear cell zzso cell zzso and also exhibits a markedly higher zzso zzso zzso the zzso elements demonstrate an enhanced expression of zzso transition related zzso markers as compared with the clear cell zzso cell zzso zzso We further selected a representative case, clinically demonstrating direct overgrowth of the zzso component into the liver and zzso for extended zzso zzso resulting in a further set of positive and negative zzso transition markers as well as pronounced transforming growth factor zzso zzso indicating that zzso clear cell zzso cell zzso may be associated to zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso exposure of in zzso cultured primary clear cell zzso cell zzso cells resulted in cells adopting a zzso zzso similar to zzso clear cell zzso cell zzso zzso changes in zzso levels for key zzso transition markers were also zzso We therefore suggest that zzso clear cell zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso may represent a completed zzso transition and that transforming growth factor zzso could be an important driving force during the zzso zzso of clear cell zzso cell zzso
