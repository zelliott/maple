zzso motions and properties of water and zzso change when confined in zzso zzso zzso and melting points of water are depressed, and generally, the activity of zzso and stability of proteins are zzso We performed temperature ramp zzso analyses of zzso zzso confined water and proteins to identify the kinetic and zzso transitions of water at zzso temperatures and to understand the zzso interactions in zzso In our studies, confined water did not freeze at temperatures as low as zzso degrees C but underwent zzso and zzso transitions during zzso During warming from zzso temperatures, the zzso of cubic and zzso ice were zzso Additionally, the changes in the secondary structures of proteins correlated to the changes in the zzso characteristics of the confined zzso Our results showed that the kinetic and zzso transitions of water dictate the structural transitions of zzso zzso Evidence was obtained for the universal behavior of water in close proximity to surfaces and in the zzso shells of isolated and zzso proteins (in intact zzso bacteria and zzso zzso
