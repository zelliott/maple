zzso is a ubiquitous feature of zzso wet zzso surfaces, where it zzso and forms a selective barrier that excludes a range of zzso including zzso while hosting a diverse zzso zzso The major zzso component of zzso is zzso a large zzso formed by several zzso gene products, with zzso expression dominating zzso zzso A satisfactory answer to the question of how these molecules build a dynamic structure capable of playing such a complex role has yet to be found, as recent reports of distinct layers of chemically identical zzso in the colon and zzso rapid transport of zzso through zzso have zzso Here we use atomic force zzso zzso to image a zzso zzso fraction isolated from pig zzso In the freshly isolated zzso zzso we find direct evidence for zzso linked structures, and their assembly into zzso networks with a distribution of pore sizes from 20 to 200 zzso The networks are zzso with little interaction between zzso The existence of persistent zzso between individual zzso zzso is consistent with a zzso zzso model for zzso zzso structure, rather than a physically zzso zzso zzso We only observe collapsed zzso structures in zzso zzso that has been stored in zzso zzso
