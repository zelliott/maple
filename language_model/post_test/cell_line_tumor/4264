The poor overall prognosis of zzso zzso zzso patients and the limited therapeutic regimens for these patients demonstrates the need for better therapeutic zzso while the growing zzso have indicated that those genes contributed to zzso regulation may serve as therapeutic zzso The function of zzso zzso on growth and survival of zzso cells remains zzso In present study, an zzso screening of 16 genes involving zzso zzso zzso was applied to zzso cells and we found that zzso zzso specifically zzso the proliferation of zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso data analysis showed that zzso zzso may result in zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso expression level of zzso was significantly zzso in zzso zzso than in the adjacent normal zzso In zzso with the zzso level, the protein expression of zzso was markedly increased in zzso from patients with poor prognosis than those with good zzso These findings strongly indicated that zzso was implicated in zzso zzso and that its expression level was associated with the zzso Our work may also provide a potential therapeutic target for treatment of zzso zzso
