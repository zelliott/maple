We describe a novel translation inhibitor that has zzso virus zzso activity in zzso and in zzso The inhibitor was identified through a zzso screening using a zzso infection zzso The compound contains a zzso core zzso zzso analysis indicated that the compound zzso protein translation in a viral zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso demonstrated that only one zzso of the zzso compound zzso viral zzso zzso zzso chemistry was performed to eliminate a metabolically zzso zzso site of the compound to improve its in zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that upon a single subcutaneous dosing of 25 zzso of body weight in mice, plasma levels of the compound reached a zzso zzso plasma drug zzso above the zzso zzso effective concentration zzso value of zzso zzso In agreement with the in zzso zzso results, treatment of zzso mice with 25 zzso of compound once per day reduced peak zzso by about zzso However, mice treated with 75 zzso of compound per day exhibited adverse zzso zzso our results demonstrate that the zzso compounds inhibit zzso through suppression of zzso zzso The therapeutic window of the current compounds needs to be improved for further zzso
