The high-risk zzso E6 proteins have been shown to direct the degradation of a variety of cellular proteins that contain zzso zzso Although some of these proteins are involved in regulating processes of cell growth and polarity in zzso little is known about their function in higher zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells derived from cervical zzso we find that the patterns of expression of the E6 targets zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are consistent with their being zzso for zzso zzso It is also clear that, in the case of zzso E6 is specifically targeting nuclear pools of the protein rather than zzso zzso We have also zzso the activity of a subset of E6 target proteins in the suppression of zzso cell zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso and zzso efficiently suppressed cell zzso while zzso and zzso were ineffective in this zzso These results suggest that in the context of zzso transformation zzso zzso and zzso can function as zzso zzso
