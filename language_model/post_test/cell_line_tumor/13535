Cell zzso to the zzso zzso is a key event in cell migration and invasion and zzso trafficking of zzso receptors and signaling proteins plays a major role in regulating these zzso zzso is a zzso of the zzso complex and is involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso is shown to bind to the focal zzso protein zzso and zzso to focal zzso during cells spreading in an zzso dependent zzso Furthermore, zzso is enriched in zzso at the leading edge of zzso cells and depletion of zzso by zzso increases cell spreading and zzso directional cell migration via a loss of cellular zzso zzso of zzso in both zzso zzso cells and zzso normal breast zzso cells promotes the formation of zzso degrading zzso zzso structures linked to invasive migration in cancer zzso These data therefore suggest that zzso recruitment of the zzso complex, via an interaction with zzso to focal zzso mediates cell polarity and migration and that zzso may control the balance between the formation of normal cell zzso and invasive zzso zzso
