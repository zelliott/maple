A number of derivatives of zzso with a zzso chain linked to position 7 of zzso via an zzso zzso or zzso group were zzso and tested for their biological zzso All compounds showed marked growth zzso activity against the zzso human lung zzso cell zzso In particular, the zzso derivatives where the zzso groups of the chain were protected with zzso groups exhibited a high zzso with zzso values of approximately zzso zzso The pattern of DNA zzso in zzso and the persistence of the zzso zzso complex zzso I observed with zzso zzso containing free zzso groups support a contribution of specific drug interaction with DNA as a zzso of zzso Modeling of compound zzso in the complex with zzso 1 and DNA is consistent with this zzso The lack of a specific correlation between stabilization of the zzso complex and growth zzso likely reflects multiple factors including the cellular zzso behavior related to the variable zzso of the zzso and the nature and linkage of the zzso zzso
