Cancer progression is commonly zzso into processes of primary zzso growth and secondary zzso Recent evidence suggests that a zzso of cancer cells, cancer stem cells zzso is responsible for zzso growth in zzso However, the role of zzso in cancer zzso is zzso In this study, we found that the C zzso of zzso contributes to sphere formation and survival in zzso via the zzso zzso In addition, nuclear zzso is required for zzso formation in zzso and zzso in zzso Nuclear zzso binds to various promoters identified by zzso zzso including that of zzso and zzso leading to cell fate change through zzso zzso We propose that nuclear zzso performs an unexpected zzso function by enhancing cell outgrowth into structures where cells with properties of zzso can be generated from differentiated zzso cells in suspension culture, and then exhibit attributes of cells that have undergone an zzso transition, leading to zzso zzso and a resulting worse zzso
