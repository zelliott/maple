The tumor zzso gene zzso plays an important role in the response to DNA zzso zzso function is regulated by a variety of mechanisms including zzso control, zzso and zzso zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso is a zzso shuttle zzso Its zzso zzso is controlled by a nuclear zzso zzso nuclear import via the zzso zzso zzso and a nuclear export zzso nuclear export through a zzso zzso Using the human breast cancer cell line, zzso the zzso distribution of zzso was assessed by zzso zzso and Western zzso analyses of zzso zzso zzso zzso radiation zzso zzso nuclear export in a zzso zzso This DNA zzso zzso nuclear export zzso a zzso mechanism and also required zzso zzso whose function was zzso by the E6 protein in zzso zzso In addition, the dependence on zzso was confirmed using a second cell type operating a zzso zzso The effect of zzso radiation on zzso export was observed in every phase of the cell cycle, although zzso zzso did vary between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results imply that, in addition to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein is a mechanism zzso zzso function is regulated in response to DNA zzso
