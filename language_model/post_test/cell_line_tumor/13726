The aim of the present study was to explore the effect of zzso a intravenous zzso agent used widely in inducing and maintaining zzso on zzso zzso zzso expression in a human zzso cell zzso zzso human zzso cells were treated with various zzso of zzso zzso 5, 10 or zzso for different lengths of time zzso 12 or zzso zzso quantitative zzso showed that at a concentration range of zzso zzso increased zzso zzso levels in a statistically significant zzso and zzso manner within zzso of zzso Western zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso treatment for zzso zzso increased the zzso protein zzso In the zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso increased zzso density zzso in the cell zzso In addition, in the presence of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso had no significant effect on the zzso zzso levels over zzso The results suggested that zzso zzso and zzso enhances zzso expression in zzso human zzso cells at the zzso level, leading to an increased density of zzso zzso in the cell zzso This study demonstrated for the first time a link between zzso and the zzso system, thereby providing new insights into zzso mechanism of action and potential for zzso
