The regulation of zzso zzso the primary targets for zzso zzso drugs like zzso has implications for drug response and drug zzso Over the past 15 years, zzso have been studied widely as regulators of zzso zzso For example, the tumor zzso zzso was shown in cell culture to target zzso zzso including zzso zzso Cochrane ( 2009 ) zzso Cancer zzso 8 ( 5 ), zzso - zzso zzso In that work, zzso zzso was also shown to reduce zzso class III, one of its predicted zzso Furthermore, decreased zzso and increased zzso class III were associated with poor outcomes for zzso cancer patients zzso zzso , zzso ( 2012 ) zzso Cancer zzso 11 ( 12 ), zzso - zzso zzso Because zzso targets the zzso zzso zzso we wanted to know whether changes in zzso parallel zzso zzso changes, implicating zzso zzso in zzso cell survival zzso We found coordinated positive feedback regulation of zzso for zzso and zzso zzso classes I, III, and zzso in zzso breast cancer cells, commonly used as a model for zzso breast zzso Low levels of zzso (40 zzso were found to significantly reduce zzso levels for these zzso genes along with a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso also reduced zzso zzso classes I, III, and zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso was associated with increases in these zzso zzso Our work indicates that zzso reduction of zzso and zzso zzso are, in part, due to increased activity of zzso These results suggest that in aggressive breast zzso as modeled by zzso cells, zzso class III is a zzso for cell survival zzso through zzso tumor progression zzso
