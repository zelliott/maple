Since zzso human zzso zzso factor zzso donor zzso infusion zzso has been shown to zzso zzso immunity in a heart transplant model, we examined influences of zzso on tumor growth in zzso zzso zzso rats were treated with zzso (8 zzso zzso and zzso colon zzso zzso cells (3 zzso zzso were zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso rats were zzso with zzso zzso zzso days -5 to zzso and isolated zzso or sorted zzso cells were injected zzso to the hosts on day zzso zzso in zzso hosts continuously grew over 5 zzso zzso of 100 zzso zzso zzso attenuated tumor growth rate while direct host zzso with zzso did zzso zzso zzso of 10 zzso zzso zzso cells blocked tumor expansion after day zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso into tumors was recovered by the zzso zzso zzso showed no zzso zzso T cells in the tumor and zzso zzso of zzso zzso levels using reverse zzso zzso chain reaction showed recovery from zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso cells demonstrate potent zzso effects by restoring zzso immunity of zzso zzso
