zzso binding to the B cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and the formation of signaling zzso triggering B cell zzso Although the zzso pathways governing early B cell signaling have been well zzso the role of the physical properties of zzso such as zzso mobility, has not been fully zzso We study the interaction of B cells with zzso zzso coated on glass or zzso to zzso zzso zzso surfaces to investigate the differences in B cell response to immobile and mobile zzso Using high-resolution total internal reflection zzso zzso zzso of live cells, we followed the movement and spatial organization of zzso clusters and the associated zzso Although zzso on either surface were able to zzso zzso and induce zzso B cells interacting with mobile zzso displayed greater signaling than those interacting with immobile zzso zzso analysis revealed that mobile zzso enabled zzso clusters to move farther and merge more efficiently than immobile zzso These differences in physical reorganization of zzso clusters were associated with differences in zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that a dynamic zzso zzso actively reorganized zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso mobility is an important zzso for regulating B cell zzso
