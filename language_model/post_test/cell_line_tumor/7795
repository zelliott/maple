The zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso sequence of zzso chain, is known to inhibit tumor growth and zzso In the present study, we observed that zzso not only inhibited the growth and migration of prostate cancer cells in a zzso manner but also decreased zzso membrane potential, inhibited zzso synthesis and increased zzso zzso Investigation into the interaction of zzso with zzso the zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso employing zzso zzso zzso zzso an integrated platform for predicting protein zzso zzso revealed that the binding site of zzso was the same as that of zzso that explains as to why zzso is able to inhibit the zzso of zzso against zzso zzso
