Recent studies have demonstrated that zzso fragments zzso can be engineered to form zzso sites with zzso zzso Thus they may serve as an attractive alternative to conventional zzso in therapeutic zzso The critical influence of zzso zzso on zzso functions of zzso is well zzso however, whether this applies to zzso is not zzso Here we used human cells, wild type, and zzso plants to generate four different zzso of zzso an zzso with engineered zzso zzso zzso zzso differed in the zzso of single zzso zzso zzso core zzso and zzso and terminal zzso All of the zzso had similar binding to zzso expressed on human tumor zzso By contrast, zzso that lacked core zzso modifications zzso core zzso and zzso showed significantly enhanced binding to the zzso zzso zzso irrespective of whether plant or human expression systems were zzso zzso with this finding, zzso zzso zzso lacking core zzso zzso zzso higher zzso cellular zzso against human tumor zzso No zzso in zzso binding and zzso cellular zzso activity was observed upon decoration of zzso by terminal zzso The results point to a significant impact of distinct zzso zzso on zzso functions of zzso Moreover, the outcomes imply that the zzso functions zzso by zzso can be zzso by altering the zzso zzso zzso zzso immune responses toward optimal zzso zzso patterns could result in improved vaccine zzso
