DNA vaccines contribute to a promising new approach for the generation of zzso T zzso zzso DNA vaccines do have several zzso including poor zzso and zzso zzso We used the natural killer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as an zzso to prime initial DNA zzso and used the potent zzso tumor zzso zzso cells zzso as a booster zzso A DNA vaccine expressing human zzso zzso type 16 zzso zzso was combined with zzso at the prime phase, and generated a higher number of zzso zzso zzso in vaccinated mice than vaccine used at boost zzso zzso zzso with a DNA vaccine in the presence of zzso and boosting with zzso zzso led to a significant enhancement of zzso zzso zzso and memory zzso as well as significantly improved therapeutic and preventive effects against an zzso tumor model zzso in vaccinated zzso Our findings suggested that the potency of a DNA vaccine combined with zzso could be further enhanced by boosting with an zzso zzso vaccine to generate zzso zzso
