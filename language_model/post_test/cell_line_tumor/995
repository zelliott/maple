Cellular zzso through killer zzso receptors zzso may allow zzso cells to evade host natural killer zzso zzso zzso Recently, zzso zzso cells were shown to mediate zzso effects against acute zzso leukemia zzso after mismatched zzso when zzso zzso zzso existed in the direction of zzso disease zzso zzso we investigated whether solid tumor cells would have similar enhanced zzso to zzso zzso zzso cells compared with their zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso populations enriched and cloned from the blood of cancer patients or healthy donors zzso for zzso zzso in group 1 zzso or group 2 zzso were tested in zzso for zzso against zzso zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and melanoma zzso cells with or without a matching zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were more zzso to tumor targets mismatched for zzso zzso than their zzso zzso zzso Bulk zzso populations zzso expanded zzso from patients zzso for zzso or zzso had enhanced zzso against zzso zzso tumor cells but only minimal zzso against zzso zzso zzso Further, zzso cell lines from zzso or zzso zzso cancer patients or healthy donors expanded but failed to kill zzso or zzso zzso and zzso cells yet had significant zzso (more than 50% zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso tumor zzso These data suggest zzso strategies that use zzso zzso zzso cells might have superior zzso effects against solid tumors compared with approaches using zzso zzso zzso
