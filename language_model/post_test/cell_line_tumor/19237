zzso c zzso zzso is one of only four zzso proteins in zzso cells, having ten zzso zzso in the nuclear zzso and three in the zzso zzso The mechanism of its zzso control is not well zzso The ten nuclear zzso are on different zzso and the possibility of their coordinate regulation by the same zzso zzso deserves serious zzso The present study tested our hypothesis that nuclear respiratory factor 1 zzso serves such a role in zzso zzso Following in zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility shift and zzso zzso indicated zzso binding to all ten zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso also showed zzso binding to all ten promoters in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of putative zzso binding sites confirmed the functionality of zzso binding on all ten zzso zzso These sites are highly zzso among mice, rats, and zzso zzso of zzso with zzso interference reduced all ten zzso zzso zzso and zzso of other genes involved in zzso zzso We conclude that zzso plays a significant role in zzso the zzso regulation of all ten zzso zzso zzso in zzso Moreover, zzso is known to activate zzso zzso factors A and B, thereby indirectly regulating the expressions of the three zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso and our previously described zzso prove to be the two key zzso coordinators for zzso regulation of all zzso c zzso zzso in zzso zzso interactions between the zzso will be investigated in the zzso
