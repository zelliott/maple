zzso copper is implicated in the zzso of zzso disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso complexes have been identified in zzso and zzso zzso cholesterol and zzso to generate zzso and zzso zzso The site and mechanism of this zzso is not zzso Growing evidence suggests that zzso processing of the zzso precursor protein zzso occurs in zzso zzso membrane zzso enriched in zzso zzso and zzso and zzso have been identified in zzso zzso in cultured cells, human and zzso zzso but the role of copper in zzso raft zzso processing is presently zzso In this study, we found that copper zzso zzso association with zzso zzso raft zzso and consequently zzso synthesis is attenuated via zzso zzso of zzso zzso We also found that total cellular copper is associated zzso with zzso raft copper levels, so that under zzso copper zzso conditions, zzso complexes are more likely to zzso This explains the paradoxical zzso of zzso with copper under tissue copper zzso conditions in zzso
