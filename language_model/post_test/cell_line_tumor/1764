zzso zzso zzso zzso elicit high response rates among individuals with zzso zzso including chronic zzso leukemia zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso lung cancer zzso zzso However, the extent and duration of these responses are heterogeneous, suggesting the existence of genetic zzso affecting an zzso response to zzso Using zzso DNA sequencing, we discovered a common zzso deletion zzso in the gene zzso zzso 11 zzso zzso is a zzso member of the zzso zzso 2 zzso family of zzso and its zzso is required for zzso to induce zzso in zzso zzso The zzso switched zzso zzso from zzso 4 to zzso 3, which resulted in expression of zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso domain 3 zzso The zzso was sufficient to zzso intrinsic zzso resistance in zzso and zzso zzso cell lines, but this resistance could be overcome with zzso zzso zzso individuals with zzso and zzso zzso harboring the zzso experienced significantly inferior responses to zzso than did individuals without the zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and P zzso zzso for zzso zzso Our results offer an explanation for the zzso of zzso responses across individuals and suggest the possibility of zzso therapy with zzso zzso to overcome zzso zzso zzso
