Previously, we have shown the loss of zzso function in zzso zzso disease zzso prion protein zzso zzso that are unable to generate zzso zzso zzso To determine if the zzso function of zzso zzso the manifestation of prion diseases, we further investigated the zzso function of eight familial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso contained their respective zzso zzso or zzso zzso at zzso zzso All of the zzso lost their ability to prevent zzso zzso zzso or DNA fragmentation in primary human zzso In the breast zzso zzso cells, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso lost their ability to inhibit zzso condensed zzso The zzso of zzso condensed zzso depended on the ability of the zzso to generate zzso zzso However, except for the zzso none of the zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso These results show that the zzso zzso generated from the zzso zzso is not as efficient as wild type zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso Furthermore, these results indicate that the zzso function is also disrupted in zzso zzso zzso and is not associated with the difference between zzso and zzso
