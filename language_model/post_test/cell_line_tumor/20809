zzso radiation is commonly used in the treatment of zzso cell zzso of the oral cavity and zzso Despite the proven efficacy of this form of zzso therapy, high-dose radiation treatment is invariably associated with numerous unwanted side zzso This is particularly true for bone, in which radiation treatment often leads to zzso The aim of this study was to investigate if treatment with zzso zzso zzso could enhance the zzso effect of zzso whereas minimizing the destructive effects of radiation on zzso zzso treatment induced a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and tumor cell zzso and zzso survival and significantly enhanced zzso zzso cell and tumor cell zzso In contrast, zzso treatment zzso zzso induced the proliferation of zzso and also protected zzso against zzso cell zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment was able to significantly enhance zzso zzso of zzso cell tube formation and tumor cell colony zzso To test the effectiveness of zzso and radiation treatment in zzso we used a severe combined zzso mouse model that has a bone zzso and tumor growing side by side zzso Animals treated with zzso and radiation showed a significant zzso of tumor growth, tumor zzso and tumor zzso to the lungs as compared with zzso treatment or radiation treatment zzso In contrast, zzso treatment protected bone zzso from zzso bone zzso These results suggest a novel strategy to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of radiation treatment while protecting bone from the adverse effects of therapeutic zzso
