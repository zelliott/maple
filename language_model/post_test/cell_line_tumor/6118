zzso is a potent zzso zzso drug zzso that has demonstrated great promise in cancer zzso and zzso The goal of this study was to determine the zzso effect and mechanism of zzso on Lewis lung zzso The effect of zzso on viability of Lewis lung zzso cells was assessed with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso membrane potential were detected by flow zzso zzso The protein expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso were determined by Western zzso zzso The zzso of zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso in culture zzso were measured by the methods of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation of Lewis lung zzso and induced zzso in a zzso manner by breakdown of zzso membrane zzso The protein expressions of zzso and zzso were zzso but zzso protein expression was zzso in the Lewis lung zzso cells exposed to zzso The amount of AA was increased and zzso was decreased in the culture zzso zzso The ratio of AA to zzso was increased in a zzso zzso The major findings in this study are that zzso could inhibit the viability of Lewis lung zzso cells by interference of the AA zzso and zzso of zzso zzso which are novel and important since the molecular mechanisms of zzso underlying the zzso effects remain zzso
