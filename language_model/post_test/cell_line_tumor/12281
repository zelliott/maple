zzso presentation by zzso cells zzso is essential to effective zzso T cell responses in cancer zzso Depending on their origin, maturation state, and the ambient zzso zzso DC can differentiate into distinct zzso which zzso either induce zzso cell zzso zzso zzso DC zzso or zzso T cell development zzso zzso DC zzso The present study was undertaken to characterize the effects of pancreatic zzso zzso zzso on immature zzso DC zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso by human pancreatic zzso cells inhibited zzso zzso expression of zzso molecules zzso and zzso and of zzso and functional activity as assessed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso generated from pancreatic zzso patients in advanced stages of the disease similarly showed decreased levels of zzso expression and reduced ability to stimulate zzso in response to zzso and zzso Moreover, in zzso peripheral blood, the ratio of zzso to zzso cells was lower than in healthy controls due to reduced numbers of zzso zzso zzso zzso rather than a single zzso a combination of zzso zzso was responsible for these zzso these were primarily zzso zzso and zzso but not vascular zzso growth zzso In zzso we have identified an array of pancreatic zzso zzso that zzso affect zzso zzso in a manner consistent with ineffective zzso immune zzso
