zzso a zzso zzso has zzso effects against some zzso but its effects on zzso are zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso on the growth and zzso of rat zzso zzso We treated zzso zzso cells with zzso and then measured zzso zzso and expression of vascular zzso growth factor zzso We also examined the zzso effect of zzso on the zzso human zzso vein zzso cells and the effects of zzso on the in zzso zzso zzso size and animal survival were followed in zzso rats with subcutaneous or zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso was followed to study its effect on zzso zzso zzso had zzso effects and induced zzso of zzso cells in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso also inhibited the expression of zzso in zzso cells, induced zzso effect on the zzso cells and suppressed the in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had significant zzso effects on subcutaneous tumors and led to slower tumor growth rate, longer animal survival time and higher animal survival zzso zzso zzso zzso also affected zzso tumors and prolonged animal survival zzso zzso zzso without affecting survival zzso zzso analyses showed that the subcutaneous zzso from zzso rats had fewer zzso zzso than control rats zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrate that zzso is zzso to zzso zzso cells, has zzso effects on subcutaneous and zzso zzso and zzso zzso in subcutaneous zzso zzso has potential as a treatment for zzso
