The zzso of bone zzso in advanced breast cancer zzso exceeds zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor used for the treatment of multiple zzso also promotes bone zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso can zzso zzso zzso zzso 

To address the potentially beneficial effect of zzso in reducing tumor growth in the skeleton and zzso bone zzso human zzso zzso cells were injected into the zzso of mice to model bone tumor growth for in zzso assessment of treatment regimens before and after tumor zzso 

zzso exhibited tumor growth, destroying zzso and cortical bone and invading zzso zzso treatment initiated following zzso of tumor cells zzso reduced tumor growth, restricted tumor cells mainly to the zzso zzso and almost completely inhibited zzso in the bone zzso over a 3- to zzso period as shown by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thus, zzso zzso is effective in killing tumor cells within the zzso zzso with zzso for 3 weeks before zzso of tumor cells was also effective in reducing zzso Our in zzso and in zzso studies indicate that mechanisms by which zzso zzso tumor growth and reduces zzso result from inhibited cell zzso zzso and decreased expression of factors that promote zzso tumor progression in zzso 

These findings provide a basis for a novel strategy to treat patients with zzso zzso zzso and represent an approach for protecting the entire skeleton from zzso bone zzso
