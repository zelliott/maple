zzso flame zzso zzso and zzso zzso are emerging persistent organic pollutants that are ubiquitous in the environment and can be accumulated by wildlife and zzso These chemicals can disturb zzso zzso Recent studies have demonstrated that one of the mechanisms of zzso disruption by chemicals is zzso of zzso gene expression or zzso zzso In this study, an in zzso zzso based on the zzso human zzso zzso cell line, which possesses most key genes or zzso involved in zzso was used to examine the effects of five zzso two zzso zzso zzso 77 and zzso zzso and zzso on the expression of 10 key zzso zzso The zzso cells were exposed to various zzso zzso for 48 zzso and the expression of specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acute regulatory protein zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso measured using real-time zzso chain zzso Cell viability was not affected at the doses zzso Most of the genes were either zzso or zzso to some extent, by zzso zzso Among the genes tested, zzso was the most markedly zzso with a range of magnitude from zzso to zzso The results demonstrate that zzso zzso and zzso are able to zzso zzso gene zzso which may lead to zzso zzso
