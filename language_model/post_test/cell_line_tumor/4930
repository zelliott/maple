zzso stress plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative zzso zzso a zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso shows potent zzso zzso In this paper, the zzso effects of zzso on hydrogen zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells were zzso zzso with zzso markedly attenuated zzso cell viability loss and zzso cell death in a zzso zzso The mechanisms by which zzso protected zzso cells from zzso stress included the induction of several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso gene zzso and the zzso of zzso genes zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso restored zzso loss of zzso membrane potential as well as the zzso of zzso calcium zzso These results suggest that zzso has protective effects against zzso zzso cell zzso which might be a potential therapeutic agent for treating or preventing neurodegenerative diseases implicated with zzso zzso
