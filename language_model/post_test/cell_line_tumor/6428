A new class of zinc oxide quantum dots zzso zzso was investigated as zzso for targeting cancer cells in zzso zzso zzso were zzso using conventional zzso method and zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso targeting the cancer cells, was zzso to the zzso zzso In zzso imaging studies using zzso showed the zzso zzso zzso selectively binding to the cell surface zzso and zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicate the zzso zzso to be resistant to zzso making them suitable for long term imaging zzso Investigation of the zzso zzso as a platform for sensitive zzso indicates that it can be used as an alternative zzso for cancer cell targeting and sensing zzso
