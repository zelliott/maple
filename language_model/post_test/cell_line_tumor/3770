zzso zzso is essential for tumor invasive growth and zzso and generates abnormal vascular structures unlike zzso zzso zzso To reduce tumor vascular abnormalities such as leakage and zzso cell coverage zzso that limit cancer therapy effectiveness, novel therapeutic approaches focus on vessel zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso in normal zzso In the present study, we investigated the effects of zzso and zzso on tumor growth and zzso Treatment of zzso zzso mice with zzso expressing zzso significantly reduced tumor growth but zzso increased growth compared with zzso Similar pattern of tumor growth was observed in zzso zzso and zzso transgenic zzso Interestingly, tumor vascular density and zzso were significantly decreased by zzso but increased by zzso Moreover, coverage of blood vessels by zzso was reduced by zzso while zzso increased zzso We further observed that zzso diminished retinal vessel density and increased avascular area in an in zzso zzso model of zzso zzso whereas zzso showed opposite zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso and zzso have differential roles in zzso and functionality of tumor blood vessels, in addition to zzso
