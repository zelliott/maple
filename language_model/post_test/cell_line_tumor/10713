The wide surgical zzso zzso is the only effective treatment in zzso However, a major problem remains the high rate of local zzso and zzso due to the lack of zzso zzso In this study the zzso effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in different zzso on two zzso cell lines zzso and zzso has been zzso After an incubation period of 48, 72 and 96 hours the zzso cell viability was measured as the zzso zzso In zzso of zzso zzso zzso the cell activity was reduced by up to zzso for the zzso zzso Further, zzso has been more effective in lower zzso than zzso in the reduction of cell viability for both cell zzso However, zzso showed significant zzso effects in high zzso and after longer incubation zzso Further research is necessary, but in the light of these results zzso may also play a role in the treatment of zzso
