zzso in zzso zzso and zzso have been proposed in the zzso of schizophrenia and bipolar zzso We have previously shown that several antipsychotic and zzso drugs increase zzso zzso through zzso of the zzso Regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso factors, which control the expression of numerous genes involved in fatty acid and cholesterol zzso The aim of the present zzso study was to investigate whether such drugs also affect zzso transport and export pathways in cultured human zzso and liver zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso were used to determine the level of zzso transport genes in human zzso zzso exposed to zzso olanzapine, zzso or zzso The effect of some of these drugs was also investigated in human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We found significant zzso changes of cholesterol transport genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which are predominantly controlled by the Liver X zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was observed after 24 to 48 hours of drug exposure, which is markedly delayed as compared to the drug-induced zzso stimulation of zzso zzso seen after 6 zzso 

Our data show that stimulation of cellular zzso zzso by zzso zzso drugs is followed by a zzso zzso of cholesterol transport and zzso zzso Such effects may be relevant for both therapeutic effects and zzso adverse effects of zzso zzso
