zzso are zzso zzso zzso released by numerous cell types and are thought to have a variety of roles depending on their zzso zzso derived from zzso presenting cells have been shown to be capable of initiating immune responses in zzso and zzso established zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso can be zzso as a source of zzso zzso for zzso to zzso and are thus of interest for use in zzso zzso Further exploration into the protein composition of zzso may increase our understanding of their potential roles in zzso and this study has examined the zzso of zzso zzso from cell zzso of the melanoma cell lines zzso and zzso The zzso nature and size zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was confirmed by electron zzso and zzso density zzso zzso Western zzso demonstrated the absence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the purity of the zzso zzso as well as enrichment of zzso class I and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The two-dimensional zzso gel zzso zzso zzso protein profiles of zzso from the two cell lines were highly comparable and zzso different from the profiles of the total cell zzso Mass zzso sequencing identified proteins present in 49 protein spots in the zzso zzso Several of these have been identified previously in zzso but some are novel, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso member 8 zzso zzso present in zzso zzso that were significantly reduced or excluded from zzso were also identified and included several zzso and zzso zzso again confirming the proposed zzso origin of zzso This study presents a starting point for future more in-depth protein studies of zzso zzso which will aid the understanding of their zzso and targeting for use in zzso zzso zzso
