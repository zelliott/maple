The administration of new zzso drugs in animal models is the first step from in zzso to in zzso zzso zzso At this stage it is crucial to ensure that cells are in the zzso phase of growth and to avoid vascular zzso which can cause zzso distribution of the drug within the zzso and thus lead to bias in the final analysis of zzso In subcutaneous zzso zzso models, zzso for cancer is visually zzso 2-3 weeks after zzso when a certain amount of necrosis is usually already zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of zzso small animal PET for the early detection of zzso masses in a zzso zzso model of human zzso A second goal was to zzso the zzso zzso of this zzso zzso over zzso 

We studied 23 nude mice, in which 7 zzso zzso zzso cells zzso cell line) were injected in the zzso subcutaneous zzso Each animal underwent four zzso PET scans zzso zzso Vista zzso under gas zzso The animals were studied 2, 5, 14 and 20 days after zzso We administered 20 zzso of zzso via the tail zzso zzso time was 60 zzso and acquisition time, 20 zzso Images were reconstructed with zzso zzso zzso reconstruction and the target to background ratio zzso was calculated for each zzso zzso subcutaneous tissue had a TBR of zzso zzso was diagnosed when one or more cold areas were present within the zzso All the animals were sacrificed and zzso was available to verify PET zzso PET results were zzso with the findings of zzso and zzso in all zzso 

The zzso of the zzso was zzso zzso zzso seven animals did not develop a zzso zzso Ten of the 23 animals had a positive PET scan 2 days after zzso Nine of these ten animals developed a zzso the remaining animal became negative, at the third zzso The positive zzso value of the early PET scan was zzso zzso zzso while the negative zzso value was zzso zzso zzso In the whole group of animals, mean TBR increased scan by zzso There was a statistically significant difference in TBR between 2 and 20 days after zzso zzso was present at the second scan in two animals, at the third scan in six animals and at the fourth scan in 11 zzso 

The high positive zzso value of zzso PET 2 days after zzso means that an animal with a first positive scan has a very high likelihood of developing a mass and can be treated at an early stage with an experimental zzso Animals negative at this point in time will never develop a mass or will eventually do so at a late zzso As 2 of the 16 zzso positive animals had necrosis at the second zzso indicating a vascular zzso it may be argued that animals should be treated 2 days after zzso to guarantee homogeneous zzso zzso ensuring a good drug supply within the zzso in all zzso
