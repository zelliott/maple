To observe the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso combined zzso on the growth of subcutaneous tumor in nude mice with zzso zzso cancer, and to explore its possible zzso 

The model of zzso cancer subcutaneous tumor was established in nude mice using zzso zzso cancer line zzso The mice were randomly divided into six groups, zzso zzso the high Chinese zzso zzso zzso group, the medium zzso group, the low zzso group, the zzso group zzso the combined treatment group (with zzso combined zzso and the control group (with normal zzso The medication lasted for 3 successive zzso The tumor weight and the tumor zzso rate were zzso The expressions of zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso were detected using quantitative zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of tumor cells was observed by electron zzso 

The tumor zzso rate was the highest in the combined treatment group, being zzso 26 zzso zzso zzso showing statistical difference when compared with the rest groups zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso showed the zzso zzso expression was the highest in the combined treatment group and the lowest in the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso expression was the highest in the control group and the lowest in the high zzso group zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso expression was lower in the combined treatment group than in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso results showed the zzso protein expression was the highest and the expression of zzso was the lowest in the combined treatment group, showing statistical difference when compared with the rest groups zzso zzso zzso The middle- and late-stage manifestations of zzso could be seen in each zzso group and the combined treatment group under electron zzso 

zzso combined with chemotherapy could reverse the zzso of resistant zzso cancer nude mice, and enhance its tumor zzso zzso Its mechanisms were correlated with zzso the expression of zzso zzso the expression of zzso and promoting zzso resistant zzso cancer cell zzso
