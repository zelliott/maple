To identify novel therapeutic targets for aggressive and zzso pancreatic cancer, we had previously performed expression profile analysis of pancreatic zzso using zzso and found dozens of genes zzso in pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso Among them, this study focused on the characterization of a novel gene zzso whose zzso in zzso cells was validated by Northern zzso and zzso zzso Its zzso was observed in other aggressive and zzso zzso as zzso zzso of zzso by zzso in zzso cells significantly suppressed their zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso protein could directly interact with zzso zzso zzso one of the essential proteins in the repair of DNA damage, and positively regulate the zzso activity of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells to agents causing DNA damage and also enhanced DNA zzso zzso arrest through reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso our findings zzso zzso termed zzso binding protein zzso or its interaction with zzso to be a potential molecular target for development of selective therapy for pancreatic zzso
