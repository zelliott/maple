The role of tumor zzso and cell cycle factors in gastric zzso are well understood; however, the zzso changes that affect gene expression in gastric cancer are poorly zzso zzso has been shown to play a role in zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and role of zzso in gastric zzso zzso real-time zzso demonstrated that zzso expression is zzso in the majority of human primary gastric cancer zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso adjacent zzso zzso Furthermore, compared with the zzso gastric cell line, zzso zzso expression was substantially zzso in gastric cancer cell lines of various degrees of zzso Target analysis indicated zzso directly regulates zzso zzso 2 zzso a zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso significantly zzso the expression of zzso protein and also reduced gastric cancer cell proliferation and colony formation in zzso zzso zzso zzso also reduced zzso zzso and zzso D1 and zzso protein zzso This study suggests that zzso may function as a tumor zzso via targeting zzso to repress zzso zzso reduce zzso D1 and zzso expression and inhibit gastric cancer cell zzso These results imply that novel treatment approaches targeting zzso may potentially benefit patients with gastric zzso
