zzso zzso acid zzso as a zzso zzso zzso inhibitor has various cellular effects such as cell growth and zzso In the present study, we evaluated the effects of zzso on the growth and death of zzso lung cancer zzso zzso inhibited the growth of zzso cells with an zzso of approximately 50 zzso at 72 h in a zzso zzso DNA flow zzso analysis indicated that zzso induced a zzso phase arrest of the cell zzso This agent also induced zzso as evidenced by zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was accompanied by the loss of zzso membrane potential zzso zzso zzso decrease, zzso increase, and the zzso of zzso All of the tested zzso zzso significantly rescued some cells from zzso zzso cell zzso However, none of the zzso zzso prevented the loss of zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso oxygen species zzso levels including zzso were increased in 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso None of the zzso zzso attenuated zzso levels in these zzso zzso also elevated the number of zzso zzso cells in zzso cells, which was reduced by treatment with zzso zzso In conclusion, this is the first report that zzso inhibited the growth of zzso lung cancer cells via zzso zzso which was related to zzso depletion rather than changes in zzso zzso
