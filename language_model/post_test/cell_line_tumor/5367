Human vitamin D3 zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso D3 zzso which exerts zzso zzso zzso has been reported to be zzso in various zzso in which zzso levels are zzso In zzso analysis identified a potential zzso recognition element zzso in the zzso region of human zzso zzso We investigated whether zzso is regulated by zzso In zzso zzso using a reporter zzso containing zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso for zzso increased the reporter activity in zzso cells, and zzso of precursor zzso decreased the reporter activity in zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein level was also increased by zzso for zzso in zzso cells and was decreased by precursor zzso in zzso zzso These results suggested that human zzso is regulated by zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso protein levels in human breast cancer were higher than in adjacent normal zzso without an accompanying zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, the expression levels of zzso in cancer zzso were significantly zzso zzso zzso lower than those in normal zzso It is noteworthy that the zzso protein levels in cancer zzso were zzso associated with the zzso ratios of the zzso levels, indicating that the decreased zzso levels in breast cancer zzso would be one of the causes of the high zzso protein zzso In conclusion, this study clearly demonstrates that zzso zzso regulates the zzso which serves as a possible mechanism for the high zzso expression in cancer zzso
