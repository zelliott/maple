A zzso approach has been used to screen plants growing in Guyana zzso as an indicator of production of biologically active secondary zzso zzso of leaves from 19 species, most of them endemic in this area, and collected at the top of zzso zzso zzso zzso were screened in zzso at different zzso for their potential zzso activity against three zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was employed as zzso zzso zzso of nine species caused less than zzso growth in at least one cell zzso From these species, high zzso activity was detected in zzso zzso zzso lingua and zzso zzso zzso medium activity was found in zzso zzso Two other species, zzso zzso and zzso minor showed lower but significant zzso Further zzso zzso of these extracts would be zzso to isolate and identify the active principles of these zzso
