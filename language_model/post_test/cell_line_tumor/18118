Recent zzso and clinical evidence suggests the use of zzso tumor as a source of zzso for zzso zzso against zzso We hypothesized that addition of zzso tumor zzso to zzso DC culture could serve a dual purpose: zzso zzso source and zzso protein supplementation of DC culture zzso zzso supplementation whether of known origin zzso zzso fetal bovine serum, human serum zzso or zzso origin zzso media) is a source of zzso and zzso We addressed the question whether protein supplementation can be omitted in the presence of zzso tumor zzso 

Human DC cultured in the presence of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso and DC zzso with the same zzso but cultured in the presence of zzso zzso were assessed for zzso zzso maturation and functional zzso 

In comparison of zzso no significant differences in zzso zzso and maturation could be zzso Both culture conditions produced zzso zzso DC with high expression of zzso molecules and zzso upon zzso zzso gave significantly better yields and produced more zzso DC showed high zzso capacity toward zzso zzso induced more zzso zzso in zzso of vaccinated zzso zzso Both types of DC induced killing of zzso after short in zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso can substitute for further protein supplementation in DC zzso zzso tumor zzso should be taken into consideration as both source of zzso and protein supplementation in zzso DC zzso
