zzso is a zzso zzso zzso inhibitor that binds with high affinity to zzso to induce zzso in zzso cells and has shown promise as an effective zzso agent in pediatric zzso zzso This study focuses on the effects of zzso on leukemia cells with zzso zzso and identifies some of the biological zzso of its zzso 

zzso were cultured in the presence of increasing zzso of zzso alone or in combination with other zzso After 4 days in culture, cell growth zzso was measured by zzso blue zzso The expression and zzso of potential zzso targets of zzso activity were determined by Western zzso zzso 

zzso zzso expression was detected in all infant leukemia cells zzso zzso induced cell death in all cell lines studied although the zzso values differed somewhat between cell zzso Western zzso analysis identified the effects of zzso on survival and zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso Drug combination studies indicated zzso with distinct zzso agents, including the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso This effective drug zzso appears to be zzso by the combined zzso of zzso and zzso signaling zzso 

We describe the in zzso studies to demonstrate the activity and drug zzso of zzso against zzso rearranged leukemia zzso In addition, identification of the molecular changes that occur in the presence of zzso provides information regarding effective target validation and target zzso analyses in future clinical zzso
