zzso zzso an orally zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso has been approved for the treatment of advanced zzso cell lung zzso We have found that the proliferation of zzso zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of zzso alone or in combination with zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso 

zzso growing zzso cells were prepared into cell suspension (1 zzso zzso zzso zzso of 200 zzso of zzso cells was injected zzso into the right flank area of the zzso After 7 zzso well-established tumors of zzso zzso were zzso were zzso into five groups: control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso was administered by oral zzso on days zzso of each week for 4 zzso zzso was administered zzso once a week for 4 zzso zzso volume was determined by direct measurement with zzso and calculated by the formula zzso zzso zzso The mice were sacrificed at two days after the treatment zzso tumor masses were removed and zzso The tumor zzso rates were zzso The student's test was used to evaluated the statistical significance of the zzso 

Growth zzso showed that tumor masses of control group grew more rapidly than ones of every treatment zzso The average tumor volume was significantly smaller in zzso zzso zzso group than in control group zzso The average tumor volume had no significant difference between zzso zzso zzso group and control zzso The average tumor volume of zzso or zzso zzso zzso plus zzso group was smaller than that of control zzso and zzso The average tumor volume had no significant difference between zzso and zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso The tumor zzso rates of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso group were zzso zzso zzso and zzso The average tumor weight after treatment had no significant difference between zzso zzso zzso group and control zzso The average tumor weights of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso group were all smaller than that of control zzso The average tumor weight had no significant difference between zzso group and zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso 

zzso could inhibit the growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso did not significantly zzso the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso
