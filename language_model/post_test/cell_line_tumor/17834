The aim of this study was to determine the role of zzso membrane zzso zzso as a zzso marker in zzso zzso zzso and to explore whether its zzso could be due to zzso zzso First, we examined the expression and the zzso value of zzso by zzso reverse zzso and zzso in zzso tissue zzso Second, to explore the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso we evaluated zzso zzso island zzso using zzso zzso in cells lines and in a subset of patients' zzso Furthermore, association of the status of tumor zzso to the clinical and zzso variables was also zzso Higher zzso zzso levels were associated with stage I zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein intensity by zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis, loss of zzso expression was associated with a worse zzso survival zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in prostate cell lines zzso and zzso and zzso cell zzso In addition, zzso was zzso in 5 of 18 samples (all 5 had low zzso zzso zzso There was a significant association between zzso zzso and loss of protein expression by zzso and zzso level with P value of zzso and zzso zzso In addition, there was an association between zzso zzso and tumor size zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso is zzso in advanced stage zzso zzso loss of zzso expression can be considered as a zzso marker in patients with zzso and zzso loss of zzso expression in a subset of zzso cases could be due to zzso zzso
