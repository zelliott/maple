The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are part of the chemical structure of a variety of naturally occurring compounds zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso some of which have shown zzso activity and/or DNA damaging zzso Here we report that zzso and zzso induce cellular DNA damage zzso by the comet zzso and the zzso focus zzso and the formation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso complexes in cells zzso and zzso in zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso were significantly hypersensitive to the zzso activity of zzso therefore suggesting that zzso plays an important role in the repair of DNA damage induced by this zzso Both zzso were zzso in zzso lung cancer cells at lower zzso than in zzso zzso lung zzso The possible involvement of zzso and zzso in the zzso and zzso activities of compounds containing these zzso is zzso
