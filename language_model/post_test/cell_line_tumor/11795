Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in zzso In these studies, a zzso zzso zzso zzso and its truncated fragment, were zzso in the breast cancer cell line zzso In addition, zzso expression was zzso in zzso cell line using a zzso zzso The effects of zzso on breast cancer cells both in zzso and in zzso were then zzso Our results indicate that zzso can induce zzso and inhibit mobility of breast cancer zzso Moreover, the expression of zzso in established zzso tumors was associated with a decrease in tumor size and zzso zzso the survival rate of these mice was significantly higher compared to that of mice bearing tumors that did not express zzso We also confirm that zzso could decrease the number of circulating tumor cells zzso The plasma levels of zzso and the number of zzso were significantly positively zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso can zzso zzso and zzso Overall, these studies demonstrate the zzso activity of zzso in the breast cancer cell lines and provide insight into relevant mechanisms that may lead to novel treatments for breast zzso
