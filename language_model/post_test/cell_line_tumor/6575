Among zzso zzso mantle cell zzso zzso has the worst zzso By using a combination of zzso and expression profiling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we zzso 26 zzso samples to identify genes relevant to zzso zzso and that could represent new therapeutic zzso zzso zzso deletions and gains were zzso Genes were identified as zzso in regions of DNA gain on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso including the cancer genes zzso and zzso Among the transcripts with high correlation between DNA and zzso we identified zzso a zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso was amplified at DNA level, as validated by zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis, and zzso at both zzso and protein levels in the zzso cell zzso zzso amplification, with protein zzso of zzso was demonstrated by FISH in a small subset of clinical zzso After treatment with low doses of the zzso inhibitor zzso cell proliferation arrest and zzso were induced in the cell line zzso zzso while cells expressing low levels of zzso were much less zzso A combination of zzso and expression profiling suggested zzso zzso as a new therapeutic strategy to be explored in zzso
