zzso zzso double minute 2) is well-documented to play a key role in radiation response and tumor zzso thus offering an attractive clinic drug target to enhance tumor sensitivity to zzso zzso In this study, we designed and tested two zzso fragments against human zzso in zzso cell human lung cancer zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression zzso zzso containing either zzso zzso or zzso zzso was shown to reduce zzso zzso levels by zzso and zzso zzso Western zzso detected a similar zzso of zzso protein levels in cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with the expression zzso for zzso significantly decreased cell proliferation and rendered cells more sensitive to zzso The zzso zzso and zzso cells, zzso and zzso respectively, detected among zzso cells were increased to zzso and zzso after zzso with 5 zzso zzso of zzso zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso necrosis while combined treatment of zzso and zzso radiation increased zzso and necrosis to zzso and zzso zzso These data provide the first evidence that specific zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting human zzso zzso is able to enhance lung cancer zzso
