zzso zzso zzso zzso is resistant to conventional zzso zzso targeted treatments are hampered by the relative lack of zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the level of expression and the relevance of zzso as a zzso zzso in zzso zzso expression was assessed by Western zzso flow zzso zzso and zzso in 11 zzso cell lines, 21 zzso zzso and ex zzso zzso cells obtained from the zzso fluid zzso of 10 zzso zzso zzso levels were also determined in the plasma of patients and healthy zzso The zzso of zzso cells to zzso zzso killing was determined using an zzso zzso zzso line, developed against the zzso zzso We report here that cell surface zzso expression was detected in all zzso cell lines and zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso a suggested zzso marker, were zzso with zzso on zzso cells in zzso zzso confirmed zzso of zzso similar to zzso on zzso cells but not on zzso zzso in all tissue sections zzso Median zzso zzso levels were zzso higher in patient than in healthy donor zzso indicating immune zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were able to kill four out of six zzso zzso cell lines but not an zzso cell line, demonstrating immune recognition of zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is a potential new zzso for targeted therapies such as zzso in zzso as it is zzso on zzso cells and zzso by zzso zzso zzso Our findings have been translated into a Phase II clinical trial applying zzso therapies in zzso zzso
