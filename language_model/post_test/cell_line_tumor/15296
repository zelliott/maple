To investigate the effect of small interfering zzso zzso protein zzso 1 zzso zzso on the sensitivity of human oral zzso zzso cells to to zzso zzso zzso and explore a new target for clinical treatment of oral zzso zzso 

The viability of human oral zzso zzso cell line zzso exposed to different zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, 2, 4 zzso of zzso were detected by zzso zzso zzso V zzso was used to observe cell zzso in zzso zzso cells, cell and zzso with zzso or with the empty zzso Western zzso was used to detect zzso expression in zzso cells exposed to zzso and in cells zzso with zzso 

Exposure to zzso zzso for 24, 48, 72 h resulted in zzso cell survival rates of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, but the cell zzso rate was only zzso following a zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso showed an zzso rate of zzso which increased to zzso following zzso zzso zzso expression was first zzso and then zzso in zzso cells treated with zzso and was significantly reduced after cell zzso with zzso 

zzso of zzso expression increases the zzso rate of human oral zzso zzso cells, suggesting the potential of zzso as a new candidate target for clinical treatment of oral zzso zzso
