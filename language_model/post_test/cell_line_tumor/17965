Most zzso hormone genes are, in addition to zzso cells, also expressed in zzso The zzso hormone zzso zzso is expressed in different molecular forms in cerebral zzso and zzso zzso zzso To understand this difference, we examined the roles of the neuroendocrine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by measurement of zzso processing zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso peptides in cerebral and zzso extracts of zzso mice, controls, and in the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso mice, the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso in the gut was reduced to zzso of the zzso product, all of which was in the form of zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso synthesis in the brain was largely zzso This is opposite to the zzso zzso mice in which only the cerebral synthesis was zzso zzso cells, which express neither zzso nor zzso zzso alone the processing zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso mice express zzso but not zzso In contrast, cerebral zzso zzso contain zzso and only little, if any, zzso Taken together, the data indicate that zzso zzso the zzso and zzso the zzso processing of zzso whereas zzso contributes only to a modest zzso synthesis of zzso The results suggest that the different zzso patterns in the brain and the gut are due to different expression of zzso
