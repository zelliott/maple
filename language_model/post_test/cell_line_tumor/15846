The zzso zzso zzso is zzso in various human zzso although the precise regulatory mechanism underlying this zzso is zzso We previously reported that a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso plays an important role in controlling the cell transformation that is induced by the zzso of zzso To zzso the in zzso role of zzso we examined the function of zzso in lung cancer cell lines and zzso In this study, we found that zzso was markedly zzso in human zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso suppressed the zzso growth of the zzso cell lines zzso and zzso that had zzso zzso whereas the zzso expression had little effect on other zzso cell lines zzso and zzso that express normal levels of zzso The expression of zzso suppressed the zzso activity of zzso in zzso cells by recruiting zzso and its negative regulator, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso The treatment with zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso also suppressed the growth of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso expression attenuated the ability of zzso cells to form tumors in nude mice, invade in zzso and zzso in zzso In addition, we found a significant inverse correlation between the level of zzso expression and the extent of zzso zzso zzso in human lung zzso These results indicate that zzso is required for the zzso zzso of zzso and may control the promotion of zzso in zzso tumors that are characterized by zzso zzso
