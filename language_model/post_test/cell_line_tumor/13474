Members of the zzso family are zzso zzso zzso proteins that can associate with and zzso the activities of many zzso In our efforts to isolate the genes regulated by zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso we previously found that zzso is one of the genes zzso by zzso In this study, we demonstrated by quantitative zzso zzso western zzso zzso and zzso that zzso zzso and protein levels were increased in the rat zzso after zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso indicated that zzso increased zzso zzso levels in human zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso cells zzso Western zzso and zzso analyses revealed that in zzso zzso using zzso and zzso zzso increased levels of zzso zzso and protein in zzso We have shown by zzso and western zzso analyses that zzso increased the zzso and protein levels of zzso in zzso cells that zzso express zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso with zzso and zzso from the zzso to the nucleus in response to zzso Moreover, by zzso reporter zzso we demonstrated that zzso enhances the zzso activity of zzso Taken together, we propose that zzso is a zzso gene in zzso cells that zzso zzso zzso
