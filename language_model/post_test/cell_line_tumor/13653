zzso of zzso derived from stem cells is a promising option for cardiac zzso However, how to obtain efficient zzso from stem cells is still a great zzso zzso of the mechanism that regulates the cardiac differentiation of stem cells is necessary for the effective induction of zzso A zzso zzso named zzso cells can easily differentiate into zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment, which offers a valuable model to study zzso differentiation in zzso In this study, the zzso tags for relative and absolute zzso zzso zzso were performed to identify proteins associated with zzso differentiation of zzso cells induced by zzso Out of zzso zzso proteins identified, zzso proteins showed significant changes during differentiation with zzso or zzso changes zzso Nine proteins were confirmed by the quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction zzso and Western zzso analysis zzso zzso broad consistency was well showed between zzso and protein expression for zzso of zzso assembly protein zzso 1 zzso Further study revealed that zzso of zzso by stable zzso of zzso zzso significantly accelerated zzso zzso differentiation of zzso cells characterized by increases in expression of cardiac specific zzso factors, zzso and proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a novel protein that regulates zzso differentiation of zzso cells induced by zzso
