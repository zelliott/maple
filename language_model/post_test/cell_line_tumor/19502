The zzso hormone zzso zzso D3 zzso has been shown to regulate the growth and differentiation of human prostate cancer zzso cells, although the precise molecular mechanisms zzso these effects have not been zzso Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated that the zzso effects of zzso on zzso cells are zzso through the nuclear vitamin D zzso zzso In the present study, we performed gene profiling of zzso human zzso cells following zzso treatment and identified the zzso zzso prostate derived factor zzso as being highly induced by zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso and has been implicated in a variety of functions directly related zzso including zzso and zzso zzso Gene expression studies using zzso zzso and a zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso induction of zzso message and protein in zzso cells is dependent on zzso zzso zzso is a zzso target of the tumor zzso zzso Here we show that the expression of zzso in nine zzso cell lines is dependent on functional zzso Additionally, zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells with a zzso expression zzso and expression of dominant negative zzso in zzso zzso cells, show that the ability of zzso to induce zzso requires functional zzso zzso forced zzso expression in zzso cells results in decreased cell zzso soft zzso zzso and zzso tumor zzso These data demonstrate that zzso exerts zzso properties on zzso cells and its regulation by zzso may provide insights into the action of zzso in zzso
