zzso of the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso by zzso zzso is required for zzso dependent zzso zzso and zzso zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso exposed to sunlight through window glass zzso contains multiple zzso including the well characterized zzso zzso capable of zzso the zzso and inducing zzso and zzso zzso zzso We report here the isolation from zzso and chemical characterization and synthesis of zzso zzso a compound previously identified as a natural product of marine zzso and now shown to be a zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso produced zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in chick zzso primary zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso induction by zzso was markedly curtailed in zzso zzso cells, supporting the zzso dependence of the zzso zzso Although zzso had a higher zzso for zzso induction than zzso the much larger amount of zzso than zzso in zzso makes zzso a prominent contributor to zzso induction in zzso zzso was detected in zzso culture medium under ambient laboratory conditions but not in zzso zzso consistent with its production from zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso doses of zzso and zzso or zzso produced additive increases in zzso without synergistic or zzso zzso zzso and zzso were readily zzso by cultured zzso In addition to increasing zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso biological effects associated with zzso zzso zzso The findings underscore a role for sunlight in generating zzso zzso zzso
