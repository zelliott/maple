zzso of zzso zzso expressing zzso cancer cells to the zzso double minute 2 inhibitor zzso causes de zzso zzso zzso at high frequency zzso and zzso zzso Here, we show that the same cells respond very differently when adapted to zzso a drug that, like zzso also zzso the zzso zzso All of the 11 zzso zzso adapted to zzso that we established retained functional zzso zzso although zzso induced a substantial zzso zzso Moreover, all zzso cell lines remained sensitive to zzso whereas only five out of 10 zzso cell lines retained their sensitivity to zzso In addition, repeated adaptation of the zzso zzso zzso to zzso resulted in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso displayed no or less pronounced resistance to zzso zzso and zzso than zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, adaptation to zzso was associated with fewer changes at the expression level of zzso factors than observed with adaptation to zzso zzso analyses indicated the zzso zzso to be more similar at the gene expression level to the parental zzso cells than zzso zzso zzso which zzso with the observed chemotherapy and zzso sensitivity zzso In conclusion, zzso cells retain functional zzso remain sensitive to zzso and display a less pronounced resistance zzso than zzso zzso
