The zzso zzso zzso zzso is activated in most invasive zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso in the focal zzso complex, resulting in the zzso of the zzso signaling zzso which regulates zzso zzso However, the mechanisms by which zzso signaling is regulated during conditions of zzso growth, a hallmark of tumor zzso are not clearly zzso Here, an in zzso approach to measure zzso activity was studied using zzso zzso against zzso zzso of zzso zzso an zzso site of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso a known zzso of zzso Using genetic and pharmacological approaches to zzso zzso activity, we showed that the levels of zzso and zzso and the formation of a zzso complex correlated with the zzso state of zzso in adherent zzso Interestingly, both the in zzso level of zzso and in zzso zzso zzso activity were increased in zzso cells following disruption of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the level of zzso and its association with zzso were reduced in suspended zzso The amount of zzso in suspended cells was recovered following attachment of rounded cells to zzso polystyrene zzso indicating that cell spreading was not required for zzso of zzso Moreover, cells expressing activated zzso showed sustained zzso zzso but required zzso cell zzso for zzso of zzso and association of zzso with zzso These findings indicate an important role of zzso zzso zzso in regulating zzso signaling under decreased zzso zzso
