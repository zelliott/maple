The zzso activity of several natural and synthetic zzso and some related compounds was evaluated in zzso against a cell line derived from a human cervical zzso zzso zzso According to their activities, the most potent derivatives were zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso When these compounds were tested in the presence of zzso human zzso zzso a zzso exhibiting an zzso action on zzso cells, an additive effect on cell growth zzso was zzso Time course studies of the zzso action exerted by the active derivatives or the zzso suggested that these compounds induced cell zzso
