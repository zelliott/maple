zzso resistance zzso represents a major obstacle for zzso treatment of a wide variety of human zzso Increased expression of drug zzso pumps, such as the zzso zzso have been linked to development of zzso zzso we have identified protein zzso D zzso 2 zzso as an important regulator of zzso and zzso expression in zzso breast cancer cell zzso zzso was expressed with the highest zzso zzso status in the zzso cell zzso zzso cells were also found to exhibit the highest level of resistance to an array of zzso zzso To further characterize the relationship between zzso zzso and zzso we next focused on the effects of the zzso agent zzso in zzso zzso Treatment with zzso was shown to induce both zzso zzso and zzso expression in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells resulted in a significant decrease in resistance to zzso evident as significant decreases in both the zzso value and the resistance index zzso zzso with the decrease in drug resistance, zzso expression of zzso was also significantly reduced in zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is required for zzso zzso and expression of zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity represents an attractive therapeutic strategy for improvement of the clinical effectiveness of zzso
