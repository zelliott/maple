Little is known about the mechanisms governing zzso growth and maturation of zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso Factor of zzso zzso zzso signaling regulates zzso pancreatic development in mouse and human zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in mouse zzso impaired dense core zzso zzso decreased insulin zzso and reduced cell proliferation and mass, culminating in lethal zzso zzso zzso cells lacking zzso failed to express genes revealed to be direct zzso targets required for zzso insulin storage, and zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of these zzso zzso zzso such as zzso used for human zzso induce zzso zzso exposure reduced zzso expression of factors essential for insulin dense core zzso formation and zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso consistent with our genetic zzso Discovery of zzso pathways regulating zzso cell maturation and proliferation suggests new strategies for controlling zzso cell growth or replacement in human zzso zzso
