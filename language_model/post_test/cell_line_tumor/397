zzso injection zzso was an efficient therapeutic zzso zzso zzso zzso agent generated by labeling zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but human zzso zzso zzso response in some patients after administration limited its clinical zzso To reduce the zzso of zzso zzso we attempted to zzso zzso by variable domain resurfacing based on the three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso Considering the surface accessibility of zzso like framework zzso and the potential to form a molecular hydrogen bond within the context of the zzso modeled zzso of zzso three zzso in a single chain zzso of zzso variable region of zzso zzso were replaced by their human zzso We zzso a humanized version of zzso zzso to the human zzso zzso to form zzso The zzso of zzso to the serum of patients with zzso response was decreased while its specificity and similar binding activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were retained compared with its parental zzso In addition, this zzso is an efficient zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results suggest zzso could be a more efficient zzso zzso with less zzso and additional zzso zzso
