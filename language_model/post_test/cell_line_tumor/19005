zzso zzso clones from a zzso zzso library have been isolated against cancer cell zzso with zzso a novel screening method that indirectly identifies candidate library members via an zzso reporter zzso The first step is the coating of zzso cell surface zzso zzso with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Upon binding to a cell surface zzso the library member generates a linking zzso This zzso magnetic affinity zzso of the zzso cell complexes, detected by the zzso chain reaction zzso using the zzso gene of the cancer cell as the zzso Combining these well-known methods resulted in a higher resolution than a comparable zzso zzso method of zzso We have isolated human zzso zzso against surface zzso of a lung zzso cell zzso These were identified from a zzso mixture of zzso zzso library clones comparing zzso patterns of the zzso cell line with the two negative cell types, zzso and peripheral blood cells zzso The positive clones were zzso and verified by zzso
