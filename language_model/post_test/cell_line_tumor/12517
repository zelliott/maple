The zzso mechanisms involved in zzso zzso especially of zzso zzso zzso zzso remains zzso Various cell cycle zzso have been found to be zzso in zzso zzso however, zzso zzso a nuclear protein that delays zzso and was recently recognized as a tumor zzso zzso has not been previously investigated in zzso zzso 

Our objective was to examine the expression of zzso in zzso tumors and to identify zzso zzso that can regulate its zzso 

zzso of zzso was examined by zzso and quantitative real-time zzso zzso Identification of zzso targeting the zzso zzso region was performed by zzso array followed by expression analysis of identified zzso using zzso zzso zzso and transient zzso of zzso into zzso cells followed by zzso analysis of zzso protein and cell proliferation analysis were carried zzso 

A total of 57 zzso tissue samples including 27 zzso 15 zzso zzso with or without zzso zzso and 15 normal zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso protein expression was decreased in zzso and zzso tumors with or without zzso production, but no change in zzso expression was observed with zzso A specific subset of five zzso revealed by in zzso target prediction was significantly zzso in zzso zzso three zzso zzso zzso and zzso targeted the zzso region of the zzso transcript, and zzso zzso of these zzso inhibited zzso protein expression and zzso cell zzso 

To our knowledge, this is the first report suggesting that regulation of zzso zzso by zzso may be linked to zzso zzso
