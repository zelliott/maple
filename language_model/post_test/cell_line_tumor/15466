Various cues initiate multiple signaling pathways to regulate the highly coordinated process of skeletal zzso zzso differentiation comprises a series of ordered events starting with cell cycle withdrawal and ending with zzso fusion, with each step probably controlled by multiple zzso signals and zzso signaling zzso Here we report the identification of zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso signaling as a novel regulator of skeletal zzso zzso is a zzso zzso in immune cells, but its involvement in skeletal muscle formation has not been zzso We found that zzso is expressed in zzso zzso with levels increasing throughout zzso zzso of zzso or its zzso zzso suppresses zzso zzso which is rescued by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso is not zzso however, by zzso zzso when the zzso is knocked down, or vice versa, suggesting that zzso and zzso function zzso zzso zzso also zzso differentiation in mouse primary zzso Both zzso and zzso are highly expressed in nascent zzso during muscle zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso zzso the zzso significance of zzso function in zzso We have identified a cellular mechanism for the zzso function of zzso as we show that zzso promotes cell cycle exit that is necessary for zzso zzso Furthermore, we identify zzso as a relevant target of zzso signaling during zzso and demonstrate that zzso suppresses zzso signaling through zzso In zzso our work reveals an unexpected role for an zzso zzso in skeletal zzso and a new zzso zzso
