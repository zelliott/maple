zzso zzso is known to be highly expressed and activated in zzso zzso Recently, we demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly decreased tumor growth of zzso and zzso cells, especially in combination with zzso In the present report, we performed gene expression analysis in these cells to reveal genes affected by zzso zzso and combination of zzso and zzso We tested the effect of zzso on gene expression by zzso Human zzso zzso zzso and detected zzso and zzso zzso which were significantly either zzso or zzso by zzso in zzso and zzso cells, respectively ( zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso cells treated with zzso changed expression of zzso and zzso genes more than zzso fold, zzso respectively and had 237 common genes affected by zzso The common genes zzso by zzso included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso and common zzso genes included zzso such as zzso 14, zzso zzso zzso II, zzso zzso zzso cell cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, we detected genes affected by zzso and by combination of zzso and zzso treatment in zzso zzso Among genes zzso by zzso and zzso more significantly than by each agent alone were: zzso zzso zzso transcript: zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thus, zzso gene expression analysis can be effective in establishing genes affected in response to zzso inhibitor alone and in response to combination of zzso with zzso that is important for zzso zzso
