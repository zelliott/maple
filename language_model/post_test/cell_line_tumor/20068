zzso zzso zzso represents an ongoing challenge to the development of novel cancer zzso zzso and therapeutic zzso zzso zzso genes are an important gene family with expression tightly restricted to the zzso in normal individuals but which can also be activated in zzso Here we develop a pipeline to identify new CT zzso We zzso and validated expression profiles of human zzso genes in normal and zzso tissue followed by zzso of clinical data sets from a range of zzso types resulting in the identification of a large cohort of highly specific cancer zzso zzso including the zzso hot spot zzso zzso and the zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso These genes not only provide excellent cancer zzso for zzso and zzso but may serve as zzso and have excellent drug targeting zzso
