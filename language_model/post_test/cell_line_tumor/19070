zzso of the zzso gene are uncommon in zzso zzso a high-grade tumor genetically characterized by the zzso zzso zzso which results in the fusion of zzso with members of zzso gene zzso Although implicated in zzso the mechanisms by which zzso promotes tumor growth and cell survival are poorly zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso regulates the stability of the tumor zzso zzso under zzso zzso zzso of zzso enhanced zzso zzso and degradation in a manner dependent on the zzso zzso activity of zzso The negative effect of zzso expression on zzso was zzso by its ability to promote zzso stabilization through zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso expression altered the induction of zzso genes in response to cellular stress by zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso Our data uncover a novel mechanism zzso zzso can zzso regulate zzso zzso function by increasing the stability of its negative regulator zzso and suggest that chemical compounds that target the zzso regulatory axis may be of therapeutic benefit for the treatment of zzso zzso
