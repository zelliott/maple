zzso zzso is known to be localized in zzso zzso Here we show in two different cell lines that zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and its function as an zzso pump are dependent on cortical zzso zzso B zzso both cortical zzso and zzso stress zzso This results in partial loss of zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso raft zzso partial zzso of zzso zzso and reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso prevents zzso zzso loss of cortical zzso and all effects of zzso B on zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, zzso with zzso zzso does not prevent zzso zzso loss of cortical zzso zzso raft association, and zzso activity, but it does prevent zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso D zzso zzso stress fibers but not cortical zzso and this inhibitor much less affects zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, cortical zzso disruption results in reduced zzso zzso activity zzso with a partial shift of zzso zzso out of zzso raft zzso and partial zzso of the ABC zzso The results suggest that reduced zzso zzso function is correlated to the loss of zzso raft association but not zzso of zzso zzso
