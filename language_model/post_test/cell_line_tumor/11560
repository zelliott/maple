The zzso activity of zzso zzso prevents various therapeutic drugs from reaching lethal zzso in cancer cells, resulting in zzso zzso We investigated whether drug resistant zzso cancer cells could transfer functional zzso to sensitive parental zzso 

Drug sensitive zzso zzso cancer cells were zzso for 48 hours with zzso a zzso resistant zzso of the same cell line, in a zzso system that prevented zzso zzso The presence of zzso in recipient cell zzso was established using zzso zzso laser scanning zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso levels were compared between cell zzso zzso 123 zzso zzso was done to confirm that zzso was biologically zzso 

The amount of zzso protein in zzso cells zzso with zzso was significantly higher than in zzso cells zzso vs zzso and zzso cells zzso vs zzso each p zzso indicating zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly higher in zzso cells than in zzso zzso cells zzso vs zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso each p zzso ruling out a genetic zzso After 30 minutes of zzso zzso 123 zzso intensity was significantly lower in zzso cells zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells than in zzso cells zzso vs zzso p zzso indicating that zzso was zzso 

zzso cancer cells can acquire functional zzso through a zzso mechanism that does not require direct cell zzso This mechanism is consistent with a zzso zzso zzso
