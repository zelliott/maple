The zzso tumor zzso is important in many aspects of cell zzso Tight regulation of zzso is thus imperative for maintaining cell zzso and preventing zzso The stabilization and activity of zzso is primarily regulated by zzso which is zzso for by zzso However, how the expression and activity of zzso is regulated remains largely zzso Here, we report a novel zzso and BEN zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso is a novel zzso zzso binding specific DNA motif via a zzso and interacting with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Genome wide zzso target analysis by zzso sequencing revealed that zzso zzso the zzso of a series of functionally important genes including zzso We showed that zzso recruits the zzso complex to the internal promoter of zzso and zzso the expression of zzso zzso leading to subsequent stabilization of tumor zzso zzso zzso we showed that zzso suppresses cell proliferation and zzso cells to DNA zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso is a novel zzso zzso and an important regulator of zzso zzso
