There is limited available information on the effects of zzso on zzso participating in the folate zzso zzso our aim was to evaluate the effects of sodium zzso on the protein levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and its further relationship with the expression zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso treatment zzso zzso for 4 h decreased zzso levels in a zzso fashion without significant effects on zzso The effects on zzso were observed at zzso zzso not significantly affecting cell zzso We also observed an increase in zzso recruitment at all zzso zzso Lower zzso zzso zzso induced cell zzso showing a high proportion of zzso cells, indicating a higher DNA synthesis zzso However, higher zzso zzso or zzso zzso or longer treatment periods induced zzso zzso also induced zzso increases in zzso and zzso protein zzso The levels of zzso were zzso correlated to zzso and zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso Our findings indicate that breast zzso cells are responsive to zzso and suggest that exposure may pose a risk for breast zzso The reductions in zzso protein levels contribute to understand the mechanisms underlying the induction of genes influencing growth regulation, such as zzso and zzso However, further research is needed to ascertain if the effects here reported following zzso and high-dose exposure are relevant for human populations chronically exposed to low zzso zzso
