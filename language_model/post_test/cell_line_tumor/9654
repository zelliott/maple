The zzso zzso gene encodes a zzso protein enriched in adult and embryonic stem zzso zzso is thought to regulate cancer cell zzso but the mechanisms involved are poorly zzso In this study, we have investigated the role of zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso was determined by quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction in zzso zzso cell lines and in normal zzso cell zzso We used an zzso strategy to investigate the function of zzso in two selected zzso cell zzso 

High zzso expression was found in most zzso zzso cell lines and normal zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression induced a severe decline in cell proliferation in zzso and zzso cell lines, both with zzso zzso zzso was more strongly enhanced in zzso cells lacking zzso than in zzso cells lacking zzso Moreover, zzso zzso cells accumulated mainly in zzso whereas zzso cells arrested in zzso 

Our data indicate that zzso expression is necessary for cell proliferation and evasion of zzso in zzso cancer cells, independent of its effect on zzso Also, we speculate that the precise effect of zzso on cell cycle regulation may relate to functional status of zzso and zzso
