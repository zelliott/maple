zzso of nuclear factor zzso can zzso many zzso cells to zzso zzso including zzso agents, and there are data suggesting that disruption of zzso may be of therapeutic interest in zzso We found that zzso zzso a human melanoma cell line, established from a patient, to the zzso effects of zzso zzso is a striking zzso we therefore investigated if zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso nuclear zzso and found that the zzso agent caused a block of zzso zzso activity that was responsible for a reduced nuclear zzso of zzso zzso Western blots for zzso and zzso showed increased levels of these zzso proteins in cells incubated with zzso in accordance with zzso zzso while zzso clearly zzso these zzso in line with its zzso zzso The effect of the zzso on zzso zzso induction appeared to be independent of the block in the zzso pathway, because it could not be reproduced by the zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso Recently, the zzso zzso has been shown to be essential for the function of zzso zzso We found high expression levels of zzso in melanoma zzso Moreover, we confirmed the involvement of this zzso in the control of zzso zzso Indeed, zzso could not be zzso when zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso These findings provide a possible mechanism for the zzso of zzso by zzso since the zzso agent specifically zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, our study demonstrates that zzso blocked zzso zzso independently of zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso agent could zzso with zzso zzso drugs in zzso zzso
