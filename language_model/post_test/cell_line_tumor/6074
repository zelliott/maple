zzso zzso is the current treatment for patients with high-risk zzso syndrome, but resistance is a common feature of zzso zzso To investigate the mechanisms associated with zzso resistance in zzso we generated zzso zzso zzso cells, called zzso zzso zzso cells exhibit impaired zzso membrane zzso and zzso zzso in response to zzso compared to their zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso B activity in zzso cells, two hallmarks of zzso zzso cells displayed increased zzso zzso but are resistant to zzso zzso zzso of zzso using zzso zzso revealed that zzso is protective in zzso cells and zzso cells in zzso zzso By contrast, zzso cells exhibited impaired zzso in response to zzso zzso our findings indicate that zzso promotes zzso and zzso in zzso cells, and that zzso cells are resistant to both zzso and zzso induced by zzso
