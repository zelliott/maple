zzso zzso and mortality rates continue to increase each zzso Lack of clinically viable agents, drug combinations, effective targeted delivery approaches and success zzso targets in tumor tissue have made this disease one of the most difficult to treat, which makes prevention an important option for decreasing disease zzso and mortality zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an approach currently being explored to more effectively treat melanoma but use for prevention has not been zzso In this study, novel zzso containing derivatives of the zzso approved zzso inhibitor zzso zzso acid zzso called zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were created and efficacy tested for preventing early zzso zzso development in zzso zzso application of zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso development in zzso skin by up to zzso with negligible zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso activity and had new zzso properties by zzso zzso activity to induce cellular zzso as demonstrated by an increase in the zzso cell population, and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso inhibited cell proliferation by zzso zzso D1 expression and increasing zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso are potential melanoma zzso agents with enhanced efficacy compared with zzso due to new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
