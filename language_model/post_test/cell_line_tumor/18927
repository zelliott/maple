zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso programmed cell death pathways is frequently associated with the development of human zzso zzso zzso Here, we integrated zzso zzso and zzso approaches for the identification of zzso mechanisms linked to the zzso of zzso zzso deletion pathways in human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interference screen identified zzso as a key survival zzso linked to zzso zzso Loss of zzso by zzso interference rendered human zzso zzso sensitive to zzso programmed cell zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked programmed cell death on zzso zzso To get insight into the mechanisms of zzso survival and zzso we screened 41 zzso human genes in a zzso gene expression profile analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso gene network reconstruction illustrated zzso of relevant zzso within zzso factor signaling pathways induced by enforced zzso zzso Overall, our findings not only illustrate zzso as an zzso expressed zzso zzso in zzso zzso but also highlight zzso as key therapeutic zzso
