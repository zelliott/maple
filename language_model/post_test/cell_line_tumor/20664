In addition to the primary zzso of cancer stem zzso from tumor zzso zzso are found in established tumor cell zzso However, it is unclear how culture conditions affect zzso zzso Additionally, the differentiation potential of cell zzso zzso has not been well zzso In our study, the zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso were cultured as spheres in zzso medium zzso zzso or zzso medium zzso zzso We found that zzso and zzso cells expressed multiple stem cell markers such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso and their serum spheres expressed even higher levels of zzso zzso and zzso compared to zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells showed higher migration and colony formation potential compared to zzso and zzso cells, which did not express zzso zzso and zzso zzso spheres of zzso and zzso cells also exhibited higher resistance to zzso compared to zzso zzso All tumor cell lines showed zzso zzso zzso Only zzso serum spheres exhibited both zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that sphere culture in zzso medium provides the most efficient enrichment of cancer stem zzso zzso cells are distinguished from other tumor cells due to their potential for zzso zzso
