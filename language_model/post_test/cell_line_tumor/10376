zzso cell death 4 zzso has been described as a tumor zzso with high expression zzso with better outcomes in a number of cancer zzso Yet a substantial number of cancer patients with high zzso in tumors have poor survival, suggesting that zzso pathways may inhibit or change zzso zzso Here, we explore the significance of zzso in breast cancer and identify protein zzso zzso 5 zzso as a zzso that radically alters zzso zzso Specifically, we find that zzso of zzso and zzso in an zzso model of breast cancer causes accelerated tumor growth and that this growth zzso is dependent on both the zzso activity of zzso and a site of zzso within the zzso region of zzso In agreement with the zzso model, elevated zzso expression was found to correlate with worse outcome within the cohort of breast cancer patients whose tumors contain higher levels of zzso These results reveal a new zzso for zzso that alters its tumor zzso functions and point to the utility of zzso status as both a zzso zzso and a potential target for zzso
