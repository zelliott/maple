Despite the clinical success of zzso agents zzso a significant challenge for zzso is the inability to predict the response of individual patients with cancer to these zzso In the present study, six cell lines were compared by zzso zzso zzso to investigate cellular resistance to the class of zzso known as zzso agents zzso The human lung cancer cell line zzso was compared with two drug-resistant daughter cell lines, a zzso cell line zzso and an zzso B zzso cell line zzso The zzso cancer cell line zzso was compared with two drug-resistant daughter cell lines, an zzso cell line zzso and an zzso cell line zzso All zzso zzso results were validated by Western zzso zzso A variety of zzso and zzso proteins were zzso expressed in drug-resistant zzso zzso abundance of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso are worthy of further studies as candidate zzso zzso for zzso This is especially true for zzso a zzso zzso that mediates tumor invasion and zzso zzso was greatly increased in zzso and zzso cells and its suppression caused an increase in drug sensitivity in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the growth medium from resistant zzso cells contained higher levels of zzso suggesting that zzso could play a role in resistance to zzso
