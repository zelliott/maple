zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been found to be effective against lung cancer in zzso but clinical resistance to these agents has developed as their usage has zzso In this study, we determined whether the zzso growth factor I zzso signaling zzso zzso resistance of zzso cell lung cancer zzso cells to the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso 

The effects of zzso and zzso on zzso cells, alone or with an zzso zzso zzso zzso were assessed using the zzso zzso zzso the flow zzso terminal zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso were examined by Western zzso zzso 

zzso inhibited zzso cell proliferation by inducing zzso when zzso signaling was zzso Treatment with zzso but not zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and its downstream signaling zzso resulting in increased zzso expression in zzso cell lines with high levels of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso expression led to increased zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso protected cells with low zzso expression from zzso zzso Most zzso zzso with zzso zzso had associated high levels of zzso zzso 

zzso expression may be useful as a zzso marker for zzso treatment of zzso zzso of zzso signaling pathways may prevent or delay development of zzso resistance in patients with zzso
