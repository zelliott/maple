zzso are one of the most useful zzso targets in zzso We identified a novel zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso action and exhibits potent zzso activity in various zzso zzso 

In zzso cancer cell growth zzso was measured by zzso or zzso zzso in human cancer cell zzso zzso induced by 15 was examined in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of 15 on cell cycle distribution and zzso were investigated via in zzso zzso In zzso toxicity and zzso efficacy studies were conducted in zzso 

zzso 15 inhibited the in zzso growth of a number of human cancer cell lines, including drug-resistant cell lines that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and breast cancer resistance protein with zzso values in the range of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the compound caused zzso of zzso induced zzso zzso and induced zzso in both zzso and zzso prostate cancer cells, as confirmed by zzso zzso and DNA zzso In zzso studies revealed that the compound inhibited zzso of zzso zzso and induced a strong and zzso zzso arrest in zzso zzso In zzso studies in zzso mice bearing zzso tumor zzso showed that the compound effectively inhibited tumor zzso 

The potent in zzso and in zzso zzso activities of this novel zzso suggest that drugs with this novel chemical scaffold might be developed for treatment of drug-resistant prostate zzso
