A growing number of agents targeting zzso zzso signaling are being developed for cancer zzso However, clinical development of these molecules is challenging because of the lack of a genetic strategy to identify human tumors dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ring finger 43 zzso has been suggested as a negative regulator of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso have been identified in various tumors, including zzso pancreatic zzso However, loss of function study of zzso in cell culture has not been conducted, and the functional significance of zzso zzso in cancer is zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso signaling by reducing the membrane level of zzso in pancreatic cancer cells, serving as a negative feedback zzso zzso of zzso zzso signaling increased the cell surface level of zzso A panel of 39 pancreatic cancer cell lines was tested for zzso dependency using zzso a selective zzso inhibitor being examined in a phase 1 clinical zzso zzso all zzso lines carried zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso depletion of zzso or expression of zzso zzso blocked proliferation of zzso zzso but not zzso pancreatic cancer zzso zzso inhibited proliferation and induced differentiation of zzso pancreatic zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso of zzso in pancreatic zzso zzso zzso dependency, and the presence of zzso zzso could be used as a zzso zzso for patient selection supporting the clinical development of zzso zzso in zzso of zzso
