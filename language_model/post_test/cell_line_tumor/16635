zzso expression is a hallmark of plasma cells and multiple myeloma zzso However, decreased expression of zzso is frequently observed in plasma cells of myeloma patients, although the clinical significance of this is zzso To evaluate the significance of low expression of zzso in zzso we examined the zzso of zzso cells expressing low levels of zzso zzso zzso analysis of primary zzso cells revealed a significant decrease in zzso expression in patients with zzso disease compared with zzso zzso zzso Patients with low levels of zzso had a worse overall survival compared with patients with high levels of zzso in newly diagnosed patients and patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy followed by zzso stem-cell zzso Two zzso cell lines, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were established from a single zzso patient with decreased zzso zzso High expression of zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was observed in zzso compared with zzso cells, indicative of the immature zzso of zzso zzso was less sensitive to zzso than zzso while no difference in sensitivity to zzso was zzso zzso cells were further divided in zzso and zzso zzso using zzso magnetic zzso zzso cells sorted from the zzso cell line also showed high zzso low zzso expression and decreased sensitivity to zzso compared with zzso zzso Our observations suggest that low zzso expression relates to zzso poor zzso zzso immature zzso and zzso low sensitivity to zzso The observed distinct characteristics of zzso low zzso cells, suggest this should be recognized as a new clinical zzso zzso of a treatment strategy for zzso cells expressing low levels of zzso is needed to improve their poor zzso
