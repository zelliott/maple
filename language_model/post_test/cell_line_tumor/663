zzso zzso zzso have shown clinical efficacy in a range of cancer zzso However, two major problems associated with these drugs are the low fraction of patients for which these treatments provide initial clinical benefit and the occurrence of resistance during prolonged zzso Several types of zzso zzso have been suggested, such as expression level and zzso status of the major targeted zzso zzso status of the zzso involved and of key components of the downstream signaling zzso and gene expression zzso In this work, we describe the development of a response prediction platform that does not require prior knowledge of the relevant zzso targeted by the zzso instead, a zzso zzso profile using zzso zzso with a kinetic zzso is derived in zzso in the presence and absence of a zzso zzso We show in a range of cell lines and in zzso tumors that this approach allows for the zzso of zzso and zzso to a zzso zzso zzso
