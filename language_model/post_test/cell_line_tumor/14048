To zzso and study the zzso activity of zzso acid zzso zzso 

zzso I was prepared in 6 steps, using zzso as the starting zzso The in zzso selectivity and potency of target compound I, zzso and zzso on human zzso and zzso were determined in reporter gene zzso In zzso zzso and compound I were administered orally to zzso mice for 14 zzso zzso tolerance tests and oral zzso tolerance tests were performed on the 10th and 14th day of treatment, zzso At the end of the treatment, zzso were collected for zzso zzso 

In zzso compound I significantly activated both zzso and zzso In zzso compound I corrected the impaired insulin and zzso tolerance of zzso mice, and produced a significant reduction in plasma zzso levels after 14 d of zzso The effect produced was significant compared with the control zzso 

Both in zzso and in zzso zzso activity studies for compound I were conducted and the data suggest that this compound is a potentially effective zzso zzso
