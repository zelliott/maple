The zzso zzso zzso zzso is frequently activated in human zzso and zzso is a clinically validated zzso zzso forms two distinct zzso complexes, zzso and zzso which regulate cell growth, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and its zzso partially inhibit zzso through zzso binding to zzso but not zzso and have shown clinical utility in certain zzso Here, we report the zzso characterization of zzso a selective and potent dual inhibitor of zzso and zzso with zzso zzso values of 22 zzso and 65 zzso zzso zzso shows more than zzso selectivity for zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso in diverse cancer models in zzso and in zzso zzso and zzso (close analogue of zzso zzso inhibit proliferation of several zzso and zzso zzso and engineered cancer cell lines and also, induce cell death in tumor cell lines with activated zzso zzso zzso shows zzso zzso effects on zzso of zzso and zzso in tumor tissue with resulting tumor growth zzso zzso shows robust zzso activity in several different human zzso models representing various zzso Furthermore, in zzso 205 and zzso colon cancer zzso models, zzso shows superior efficacy compared with zzso Our results further support the important role of zzso as a driver of tumor growth and establish zzso as a potent zzso zzso zzso is currently in phase I clinical trials in cancer zzso
