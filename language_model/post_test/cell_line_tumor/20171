zzso cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among United States zzso However, disease aggressiveness is zzso with zzso disease often being zzso and high-grade cancer accounting for the greatest density of zzso Outcomes are also disparate among men with high-grade prostate cancer, with zzso of zzso having disease recurrence even after primary zzso Identification of men at risk for recurrence and zzso of the molecular processes that drive their disease is paramount, as these men are the most likely to benefit from zzso zzso We previously showed that zzso expression profiles in prostate development are zzso in aggressive prostate zzso zzso we report the zzso of one such zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and rich in zzso zzso family zzso zzso during invasive zzso of prostate development and zzso We further demonstrate a parallel process in prostate cancer, with decreased expression of zzso in zzso prostate zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso loss increases the migratory and invasive properties of prostate cancer cells through Ras zzso gene family, member C zzso a known zzso of zzso zzso By using models incorporating zzso parameters to predict prostate cancer recurrence after treatment, we show that zzso loss is a zzso independent zzso marker of disease zzso Thus, zzso is a potent regulator of cell zzso and its loss is independently associated with prostate cancer zzso
