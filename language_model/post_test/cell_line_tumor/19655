The zzso zzso zzso acid zzso promotes cell zzso survival, and migration by acting on zzso G zzso receptors named zzso zzso and zzso We zzso gene expression of zzso receptors in zzso and zzso prostate cancer cells and found that zzso gene is zzso expressed in zzso and zzso but not zzso and zzso zzso In human prostate zzso expression of zzso gene was significantly higher in the cancer compared with the benign zzso The zzso zzso cells do not express zzso and do not zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell growth zzso zzso stable expression of zzso in zzso cells rendered them responsive to zzso cell proliferation and decreased their doubling time in zzso zzso of zzso cells resulted in increased rate of tumor growth in animals compared with those tumors that developed from the zzso zzso Growth of zzso cells depends on zzso zzso zzso and we show that zzso zzso zzso signals to promote nuclear zzso of zzso zzso and cell zzso In addition, treatment with zzso inhibited zzso cell cycle progression and proliferation of zzso zzso These results suggest the possible utility of zzso as a drug target to interfere with progression of prostate zzso
