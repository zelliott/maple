An zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs in approximately half of zzso Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso potent and selective zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso viral zzso zzso B1 zzso exhibit remarkable activities in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso However, acquired drug resistance invariably develops after the initial zzso Identification of acquired resistance mechanisms may inform the development of new therapies that elicit long-term responses of zzso to zzso zzso Here we report that increased expression of zzso zzso zzso protein 1) zzso acquired resistance to zzso zzso in zzso zzso is shown to be highly zzso in zzso melanoma cells because of the zzso of the zzso response zzso protein zzso signaling zzso This zzso zzso expression and thus leads to the zzso of zzso via accelerating zzso zzso In addition, zzso of the zzso zzso greatly reverses the zzso zzso of melanoma zzso Furthermore, increased expression of zzso is validated in zzso tumors in patients with acquired resistance to zzso zzso zzso these results reveal a novel zzso zzso whose zzso contributes to acquired resistance to zzso zzso and suggest that this pathway, particularly zzso may represent a novel therapeutic target for treating zzso zzso zzso
