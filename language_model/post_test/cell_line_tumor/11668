The understanding of zzso binding interactions is an important component of understanding the fundamental mechanism of zzso zzso In this study, the binding abilities of zzso and zzso to zzso on human zzso cancer zzso cells were investigated by single molecular force zzso zzso based on atomic force zzso zzso By approaching the specifically zzso zzso tips to the zzso cell surface and subsequent zzso specific zzso events of the zzso complexes and zzso complexes were zzso Further, the zzso forces and the kinetic off rate zzso that govern the bond zzso were calculated through varying the external mechanic forces zzso Meanwhile, the distances from the energy minimum to the transition states along the separation paths of the zzso complexes and zzso complexes were zzso This study at zzso level may enrich our understanding of the zzso binding properties of zzso and provide some new information to the development of improved zzso zzso In addition, the results present new insight into the study of the energy landscape of the zzso of zzso zzso
