Previously, we showed that treatment with zzso significantly reduced the number of viable gastric cancer cells, in a zzso and zzso zzso However, the specific zzso effects of zzso on gastric cancer cells have not been zzso The present in zzso study was carried out to investigate the mechanism involved in the zzso cancer effects of zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was carried out after treating zzso cells zzso gastric cancer cell line, zzso zzso zzso with zzso or zzso and the effect of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso was zzso Western zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was carried out at various zzso zzso 5, 10, 25, or 50 zzso of zzso or zzso for 24 or 48 h in zzso zzso 

zzso or zzso cell death was found to occur in a zzso manner in zzso cells, and these decreases were slightly recovered by the addition of zzso zzso or 50 zzso The expression of zzso but not zzso was lower in the zzso zzso cells and the response was dose dependent zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso was also significantly decreased in the zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso was frequently zzso into 37, 35 and 17 zzso fragments in the zzso zzso However, these changes in cell signal zzso were not observed in the zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso effects of zzso on gastric cancer cells might be partly zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
