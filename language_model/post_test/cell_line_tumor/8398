In recent years, zzso drug carriers based on zzso zzso zzso with zzso drug release have shown enhanced zzso in solid tumors and excellent zzso zzso Here, the impact of the structure of the zzso zzso between the drug and the zzso carrier on the zzso of both the drug and the carrier was studied using in zzso zzso zzso optical imaging of dual zzso labeled zzso zzso Five different zzso containing a zzso zzso bond were zzso and used to combine a fluorescent model drug with a zzso zzso zzso with another zzso fluorescent zzso Two zzso differing in zzso chain structure zzso and zzso and molecular weight (30 and zzso were used to distinguish between carriers with molecular weights above and below the limit for zzso zzso The rate of model drug release from the zzso was determined in zzso The zzso of the six most promising zzso were investigated in zzso in zzso nude mice zzso with human colon zzso zzso The structure of the zzso in the vicinity of the zzso bond significantly influenced the release rate of the model zzso The slow release rate of a zzso group bearing zzso resulted in a greater amount of the model drug being transported to the zzso which was independent of the carrier zzso The results of this study emphasize the importance of careful selection of the structure and appropriate zzso when designing zzso zzso intended for passive tumor zzso
