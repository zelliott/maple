zzso growth factor binding zzso zzso a zzso zzso has the intrinsic ability to induce zzso directly without binding zzso growth zzso Previous studies suggested that zzso must be zzso to exert its biological zzso zzso contains a nuclear zzso signal zzso and zzso zzso is zzso into the nucleus, suggesting that both zzso and nuclear zzso may play important roles in zzso zzso To address these questions, we fused yellow fluorescent protein zzso to mature zzso lacking its signal zzso so that it would remain zzso and zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso Following zzso of zzso human prostate cancer cells with these zzso Western blots indicated that zzso lacking a signal zzso was zzso and not present in the zzso zzso Moreover, the fusion protein was not zzso indicating that it had not entered the zzso zzso zzso imaging showed that zzso zzso was predominantly zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso decreased cell zzso as assessed by zzso with zzso V followed by flow zzso zzso of cell death was zzso indicative of zzso zzso also was induced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso alone and when the zzso site also had been zzso These results indicate that zzso can induce zzso in an zzso manner without being zzso or concentrated in the zzso
