zzso zzso zzso is a newly identified member of the tumor necrosis factor zzso family and zzso death zzso zzso Here, we investigated the effect of zzso on cellular characteristics relating to tumor progression in human gastric zzso 

zzso zzso containing zzso zzso was constructed and then infected zzso and zzso gastric cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso colony formation and cell cycle analysis were used to study the effect of zzso zzso on gastric cancer cell zzso 

zzso expression in zzso infected cells was significantly reduced as evidenced by quantitative real-time zzso Cell viability and colony formation of zzso and zzso cells were significantly hampered in zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the cell cycle was arrested at zzso phase, zzso the mechanism underlying the zzso effect of zzso on cell zzso 

Our study indicated that zzso functions in promoting cell growth, and zzso zzso gene zzso might be a promising strategy in the treatment of gastric zzso
