zzso are emerging as critical regulators in zzso and tumor zzso Recently, zzso zzso has been proved to play an important role in zzso zzso but its functions in the context of breast cancer zzso remain zzso In this study, we report that zzso is commonly zzso in BC specimens and BC cell lines with important functional zzso zzso of zzso not only dramatically suppressed cell zzso colony formation by inducing zzso zzso arrest in zzso but also reduced zzso in zzso We then screened and identified a novel zzso target, zzso growth factor 1 zzso zzso and it was further confirmed by zzso zzso zzso of zzso would specifically and markedly reduce its zzso Similar to the restoring zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed cell growth and zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso rescued the zzso effect of zzso To identify the mechanisms, we investigated the zzso zzso and found that the expression of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso whereas zzso of zzso which did not contain the zzso totally reversed the zzso of zzso signal zzso zzso We also identified a novel, putative zzso target zzso zzso a member of zzso family, which further suggests zzso may be a key regulator of the zzso zzso In clinical zzso zzso was widely zzso and its zzso levels were zzso correlated with zzso zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that zzso functions as a tumor zzso and plays an important role in zzso the zzso through targeting zzso and regulating zzso zzso Given these, zzso may serve as a novel therapeutic or zzso for treating zzso
