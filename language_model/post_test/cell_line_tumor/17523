zzso a tumor zzso zzso was found to be zzso by structural abnormalities or zzso changes in several types of human zzso In order to investigate the role of zzso in the zzso of human oral zzso cell zzso the zzso 1 and 3 sequences of the zzso were investigated in 74 oral zzso cell zzso and 15 oral cancer cell zzso In addition, zzso expression was examined in 15 oral cancer cell zzso zzso of the zzso gene were identified in five zzso (1 zzso and 4 silent zzso with all zzso being detected in zzso zzso Among the zzso containing the zzso zzso case 53 zzso a zzso zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso at zzso 141 and two silent zzso at zzso 112 and zzso of the zzso zzso Cases 27, 44, and 84 had two silent zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso at zzso 82, and from zzso zzso to zzso zzso at zzso zzso Case 89 contained three silent zzso at zzso 84, zzso and zzso However, zzso of the zzso gene were not observed in normal human oral zzso the human zzso oral zzso and 15 oral cancer cell zzso Despite the intact zzso zzso one oral cancer cell line, zzso lacked the zzso zzso In contrast, two cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso had an insignificant amount of the zzso zzso These results provide genetic evidence showing that the zzso of zzso by a zzso or by reduced expression may play a role in the zzso of oral zzso
