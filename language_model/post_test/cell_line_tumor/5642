zzso light chain is a zzso zzso After entering its target, the zzso cell, zzso is responsible for zzso zzso zzso This results in reduced neurotransmitter zzso release from synaptic zzso yielding muscular zzso Since the toxin persists in zzso cells for an extended period, zzso of zzso is zzso We evaluated therapeutic targets to overcome zzso persistence because early removal would rescue the zzso zzso The zzso cellular zzso is responsible for removing zzso or zzso zzso zzso we assessed zzso of zzso light chain in zzso and characterized the effects of zzso modulating drugs, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso of zzso light chain in zzso zzso Both drugs altered zzso light chain zzso zzso in zzso and in cells decreased the biological activity of zzso light zzso These results further zzso zzso protein degradation pathways in intoxicated zzso cells and mechanisms to enhance toxin zzso
