The increased expression and zzso activity of tissue zzso zzso have been demonstrated in acute liver injury and zzso We focused on the molecular mechanisms that contribute to zzso zzso expression and investigated the efficacy of zzso components in preventing both the zzso expression in zzso and zzso in zzso We demonstrate zzso that both zzso and zzso pathways can regulate the effects of ethanol on zzso zzso and these signaling pathways may be involved in zzso of zzso zzso zzso We also found that administration of zzso zzso one of the major components of zzso inhibited zzso zzso and significantly prevented the development of zzso zzso liver zzso The present study suggests that zzso may be an important member of the cascade of factors necessary for zzso liver zzso and zzso could serve as an zzso zzso
