Analysis of the correlation between zzso and expression of its related proteins may provide insight into the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso Here, we investigate the effect of short hairpin zzso zzso specific for human zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso on the expression of zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso expression zzso targeting the zzso of zzso were zzso zzso were treated with the constructed expression zzso and zzso activity was measured by zzso repeat amplification zzso zzso Cell viability was examined using the zzso zzso Cell zzso was detected by zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso zzso was determined by Western zzso 

zzso specific for zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso activity, suppressed cell viability and induced zzso in zzso zzso In addition, the expression of zzso was zzso while the expression of zzso was zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso directed against zzso zzso cell viability by regulating zzso activity and its related protein expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso technology may be a promising strategy for the treatment of zzso zzso
