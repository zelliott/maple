zzso tumors are derived from the neural crest and exhibit substantial zzso zzso and various degrees of differentiation and zzso The identification of new cell surface markers in zzso has relevance to disease zzso and zzso As a means to categorize zzso based on cell surface protein zzso we have obtained a comprehensive profile of the cell surface zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso cell surface proteins were captured using an zzso affinity column, zzso by zzso zzso and subjected to in-depth analysis by zzso An extensive list of proteins was established and a subset of surface membrane proteins was assessed by zzso in a set of zzso tissue zzso Among identified proteins tested, zzso and zzso exhibited increased expression in poorly differentiated tumors zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression was previously associated with aggressive zzso but has not been described in zzso This comprehensive zzso cell surface profile has identified novel potential markers for zzso zzso and novel potential targets for zzso
