zzso gastric cancer is resistant to chemotherapy in comparison to other types of gastric zzso and cancer zzso zzso interactions play an important role in progression of zzso gastric zzso We examined the effect of cancer zzso zzso interactions on the sensitivity of an in zzso zzso gastric cancer model to the zzso agent zzso The model consisted of a human zzso gastric cancer cell line, zzso and a human zzso cell line, zzso maintained in collagen gel zzso zzso zzso cell sensitivity to zzso was significantly decreased in zzso with zzso zzso cell sensitivity to zzso was also decreased in zzso with zzso The addition of zzso alone inhibited zzso but not zzso cell zzso In combination with zzso zzso significantly enhanced zzso cell sensitivity to zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso gastric cancer cell sensitivity to zzso is decreased by the interactions between the cancer cells and zzso zzso and zzso zzso enhances the sensitivity of zzso gastric cancer cell to zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso
