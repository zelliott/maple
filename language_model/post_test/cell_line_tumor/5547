A multitasking zzso strategy using the readily available compound 26 as a surrogate for zzso acid represents the key design element of a total synthesis of all known members of the zzso family of zzso zzso This protecting group maneuver allows the zzso acids decorating the zzso zzso of the targets to be attached at an early phase of the zzso prevents their participation in the zzso zzso zzso zzso used to form the zzso ring, and protects them against reduction during the zzso of the resulting zzso over zzso zzso As the zzso group can be zzso removed with the zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso in zzso no separate protecting group zzso were necessary in the final zzso thus contributing to a favorable overall zzso of zzso In addition to the naturally occurring zzso a small set of synthetic zzso has also been prepared by zzso total zzso The zzso of these compounds was zzso with two different cancer cell zzso The recorded data confirm previous findings that the zzso and zzso pattern of these zzso zzso is highly correlated with their biological activity zzso zzso F turned out to be the most promising member of the series, showing zzso values in the low zzso zzso
