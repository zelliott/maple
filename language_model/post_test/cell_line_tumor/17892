Alexander disease is a neurological genetic disorder characterized by progressive zzso zzso with zzso containing zzso zzso called zzso zzso including the intermediate filament zzso zzso zzso protein zzso The age of onset of the disease defines three different forms, zzso juvenile and adult, all due to zzso zzso zzso and characterized by a progressive less severe zzso from infantile to adult zzso In an Italian family with a zzso mild adult onset of Alexander disease, we have identified two zzso zzso coupled on a same zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso studies on this complex zzso revealed less severe zzso patterns compared to those observed with zzso zzso zzso associated with a severe Alexander disease zzso Moreover, in addition to confirming the involvement of the zzso system in cleaning cells from zzso and a dominant effect of the novel zzso zzso in cells expressing the mild zzso zzso zzso we have observed that indirect zzso zzso induced by high zzso zzso zzso could completely rescue the correct filament organization while, under the same experimental conditions, in cells expressing the severe zzso zzso only a partial rescue effect could be zzso
