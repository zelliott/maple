To determine zzso zzso zzso zzso expression patterns in zzso cancer zzso and cell lines and investigate their potential to predict the efficacy of the zzso inhibitor zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso was determined by quantitative zzso in 18 zzso cancer cell lines zzso normal zzso controls zzso 24 zzso cancer zzso and 12 benign zzso zzso were compared with published zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibitor zzso and on zzso were determined by viability and zzso zzso cell cycle analysis, and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, protein expression levels of zzso were investigated in zzso 

zzso changes in zzso were zzso and/or zzso zzso in 11 of 18 cell lines and decreased expression of zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso in 15 of 18 cell zzso In cancer zzso zzso was likewise significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso was detected only in a subset of tumors zzso P zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso did not zzso with the protein zzso zzso induced zzso arrest, an increase in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso in all zzso zzso on zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso of zzso zzso differed between cell zzso zzso between the overall sensitivity to the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were not zzso 

In zzso cancer, zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are common zzso The treatment effect of the zzso inhibitor zzso was variable in zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso was not zzso for treatment zzso Whether selective targeting of zzso zzso or other zzso zzso in zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso and zzso result in a more consistent treatment response needs further zzso
