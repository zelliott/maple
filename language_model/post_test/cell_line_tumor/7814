zzso cells can recognize and kill zzso cells, particularly those of zzso origin, through mechanisms which do not require the recognition of zzso zzso zzso immune zzso This natural ability of zzso cells to kill tumor cells in a tumor zzso manner provides a strong rationale for developing clinical trials designed to exploit the innate zzso properties of zzso zzso 

In zzso studies were carried out to zzso the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells zzso zzso zzso zzso to killing by ex zzso expanded human zzso zzso 

The capacity of zzso cells to bind to as well as to kill pancreatic cancer cells correlated with the degree of surface expression of key zzso zzso molecules zzso present on pancreatic cancer zzso Moreover, pancreatic cancer cells expressing neither zzso nor zzso were bound poorly by zzso cells and were found to be resistant to zzso zzso However, upon zzso of resistant cells with zzso or zzso zzso cells were then able to bind to and subsequently kill these zzso 

In zzso the expression of zzso or zzso on human pancreatic cancer cells is critically important in determining the extent to which these cells are sensitive to killing by human zzso zzso zzso in ongoing and future clinical studies using zzso cells for the treatment of a variety of zzso solid zzso pancreatic zzso intended to zzso zzso expression on tumor cells may become important zzso to zzso zzso
