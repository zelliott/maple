The zzso zzso 3A can efficiently induce zzso in zzso cell lines with amplified zzso However, zzso therapy could be even more important in more common zzso types where this aberration is zzso The zzso and zzso zzso have complex marker zzso consistently including multiple copies of the zzso zzso Since amplification seems to be a primary aberration in these tumors, whereas amplification in zzso generally is a progression marker, the underlying biological mechanisms may be zzso We have therefore investigated the molecular response to zzso treatment in several zzso cell lines with such zzso as well as a panel of other zzso cell zzso We report that zzso efficiently stabilized zzso and induced downstream zzso dependent zzso and zzso in zzso cells with amplified zzso in zzso Some effect of zzso was also observed on cell lines without amplified zzso but with zzso zzso but no zzso was zzso The zzso zzso reported to interfere with the zzso of zzso was zzso in cells with amplified zzso Thus, zzso represents a promising new therapeutic principle for the treatment of an increasing group of zzso
