zzso gained from characterizing zzso interactions have held the promise that directed structural modifications can have predictable functional zzso The ability to manipulate T cell zzso zzso or through genetic engineering might thus be translated into new therapies for common diseases such as cancer and zzso zzso In the current study, we determined the crystal structure of zzso in complex with the zzso dominant zzso zzso zzso associated with many zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were designed to enhance zzso binding and hence T cell recognition of zzso in zzso melanoma zzso Increased zzso binding of several zzso was observed, zzso this approach zzso Nevertheless, zzso preferences of zzso T cells from several zzso melanoma patients for different zzso zzso suggested highly variable zzso zzso even among six patients who had been vaccinated against the zzso zzso zzso This zzso prevented the selection of an zzso candidate for developing an improved generic zzso vaccine in zzso Our results are consistent with the idea that even conservative changes in zzso anchor zzso may result in zzso yet zzso effects on zzso contacts with the zzso or on zzso zzso such that zzso intended to enhance zzso may be unpredictable or zzso They also underscore a critical knowledge gap that needs to be filled before structural and in zzso observations can be used reliably to devise new zzso for cancer and other zzso
