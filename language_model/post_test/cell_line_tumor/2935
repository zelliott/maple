zzso a natural compound extracted from zzso of zzso zzso species, has been shown to possess potent zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the mechanism of action of the compound remains poorly zzso In this report, we have analyzed the effects of zzso on the cell proliferation of zzso zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrated that zzso could effectively inhibit the growth of zzso cells in a zzso and zzso zzso Further studies indicated that zzso treatment resulted in zzso of zzso zzso analysis showed that the expression of zzso Bid and zzso C were zzso while the expression of zzso zzso was down regulated after zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced by the zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso expression was not significantly changed in zzso cells after zzso zzso These results suggested that the mechanism of action of zzso was to induce zzso damage and therefore led to zzso cell zzso We further investigated the in zzso effects of zzso on the growth of zzso tumors in nude zzso The results showed that zzso could effectively inhibit tumor growth in the zzso mouse zzso The overall results showed that zzso could suppress the growth of zzso zzso cells in both in zzso and in zzso zzso
