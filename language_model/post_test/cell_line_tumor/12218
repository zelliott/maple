zzso is an essential trace element necessary for normal growth and zzso During pregnancy, copper is transported from the maternal circulation to the fetus by mechanisms which have not been clearly zzso The copper zzso zzso zzso is predicted to play a role in copper transport in human zzso zzso This study has examined the expression and zzso of zzso in human zzso tissue and zzso zzso In term zzso tissue the zzso protein was detected as a 105 zzso zzso consistent with the size of a zzso which may represent the functional zzso A 95 zzso band, possibly representing the zzso zzso was also zzso zzso was zzso within the zzso layer and the fetal vascular zzso cells in the zzso zzso and interestingly was found to be zzso toward the zzso plasma zzso It did not zzso with either the zzso or the Wilson copper transporting zzso Using the zzso cell line zzso it was shown that the 35 zzso zzso was absent in the extracts of cells exposed to insulin, zzso or zzso and in cells treated with zzso an additional 65 zzso band was detected which may zzso to a zzso form of the zzso The 95 zzso band was not detected in the cultured zzso These results provide novel insights indicating that hormones have a role in the formation of the active zzso zzso Furthermore, insulin altered the zzso zzso of zzso suggesting a previously zzso role of this hormone in regulating copper zzso through the zzso zzso
