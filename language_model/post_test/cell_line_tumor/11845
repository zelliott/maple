The combination of radiation with chemotherapy is the most effective therapy for zzso pancreatic zzso To improve upon this regimen, we combined the selective zzso zzso 1 zzso inhibitor zzso with zzso zzso in zzso pancreatic cancer zzso 

We tested the ability of zzso to sensitize to zzso in zzso zzso repair zzso and zzso pancreatic cancer cells and assessed zzso focus zzso In zzso we investigated the zzso tumor cell zzso and zzso zzso of zzso by zzso 

We found that zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso pancreatic cancer cells to zzso and inhibited zzso focus formation in zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso were significantly zzso to zzso by zzso without significant weight loss or zzso toxicity in the small zzso the zzso organ for zzso therapy in pancreatic zzso We also assessed zzso zzso a zzso zzso of DNA damage in response to zzso zzso in both tumor and small zzso and found that zzso combined with zzso or zzso produced a significantly greater increase in zzso zzso in tumor relative to small zzso suggesting greater DNA damage in tumor than in normal zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated the utility of an ex zzso platform for assessment of zzso zzso of zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso 

Together, our results suggest that zzso selectively zzso zzso pancreatic cancer cells and zzso to zzso and support the clinical investigation of zzso in combination with zzso in locally advanced pancreatic zzso
