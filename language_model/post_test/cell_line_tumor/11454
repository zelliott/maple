zzso zzso factor 4 zzso is a key regulatory gene that maintains the zzso and zzso properties of embryonic stem zzso Although there is emerging evidence that it can function as zzso in several zzso the role in zzso cervical cancer remains zzso Here we found that zzso protein expression showed a pattern of gradual increase from normal zzso to cervical zzso in zzso and then to invasive cervical zzso zzso of zzso in two types of cervical cancer cells promotes the zzso and zzso cancer cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso through directly binding to the promoter of zzso confirmed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso and expression of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso sponge impaired the zzso effect of zzso along with the zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the activity of the zzso zzso zzso region reporter was suppressed and this suppression was diminished when the zzso response element was zzso or zzso In addition, we observed negative correlation between levels of zzso and zzso and positive between zzso and zzso in primary cervical zzso These findings suggest an zzso regulatory zzso in cervical cancer, by which zzso directly zzso expression of zzso which zzso its direct target zzso leading to suppression of cervical cancer cell zzso
