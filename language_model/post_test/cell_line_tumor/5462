Cellular zzso of zzso virus zzso is regulated by host range zzso including zzso zzso and zzso While zzso is known to support viral replication by zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso the exact functions of zzso and zzso are zzso Here, we show that zzso and zzso can also inhibit zzso zzso induced by type I zzso In human zzso and zzso cells, a zzso zzso lacking both zzso and zzso zzso zzso as efficiently as zzso zzso zzso even in the presence of zzso However, zzso the cells with type I zzso while having very little effect on zzso zzso blocked the replication of zzso at the step of intermediate viral gene zzso zzso either zzso or zzso to zzso fully restored the zzso resistance zzso The deletion of zzso and zzso from zzso did not affect the ability of the virus to inhibit zzso signaling or its ability to inhibit the zzso of zzso and the alpha zzso of zzso initiation factor 2, indicating that zzso and zzso function by zzso an zzso zzso but with a mechanism that is different from those of zzso zzso previously identified for zzso zzso of zzso that zzso the host range function also rendered zzso unable to antagonize zzso suggesting that zzso supports zzso replication in zzso cells by zzso the same zzso zzso that is induced by zzso in zzso zzso
