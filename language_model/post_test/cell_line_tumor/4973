Human zzso unlike mouse zzso contains a zzso site at zzso 72 in zzso 4 zzso either an zzso zzso acid zzso or a zzso zzso zzso The zzso form was shown to induce zzso better than the zzso form, partly zzso to its ability to efficiently bind to the zzso protein zzso and zzso to the zzso This zzso has also been associated with cancer predisposition and zzso Further understanding of the in zzso significance of this zzso in zzso requires the generation of mouse zzso We have thus evaluated if the zzso effects of human zzso are retained in mouse zzso Though being zzso active, both the human zzso were found to have lost their ability to zzso suppress growth and bind to zzso or zzso in mouse zzso Moreover, zzso proteins containing mouse zzso 2-3 and human zzso zzso have also lost the zzso effects in human cells, suggesting that human zzso 2-3 are important in regulating the zzso zzso Furthermore, human zzso and the various zzso proteins were generally less effective in zzso growth of mouse cells compared to mouse zzso suggesting that mouse zzso is more potent than human zzso in suppressing growth, partly due to enhanced binding of zzso to human zzso The data together suggest that mouse cells may not provide an appropriate environment for the manifestation of the zzso functional differences of human zzso and zzso cautions against the expression of full-length or zzso zzso proteins in mice to study the effects of the zzso
