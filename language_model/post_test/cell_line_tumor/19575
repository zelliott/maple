The growth rate of zzso cells has been the subject of numerous scientific and diagnostic zzso The study presented here analyses the relationship between zzso activity in zzso zzso bone zzso preparations from three zzso diseases and diagnostic and clinical zzso most zzso the zzso The disorders studied were: Acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso chronic zzso leukemia zzso zzso and zzso anemia in childhood zzso zzso A strict protocol of quantitative zzso of zzso slides was zzso to ensuring zzso both zzso and zzso The samples were studied after short-term incubation without zzso in zzso zzso The most important findings include: zzso zzso zzso zzso can be differentiated according to their proliferation zzso there is a striking difference between childhood and adult ALL in proliferation zzso most zzso initial proliferation is much higher in patients who will zzso than in those with stable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shows proliferation activities quite distinct from zzso zzso however there is only a small change in the zzso activity from the chronic phase to the accelerated phase or blast zzso zzso zzso Very low proliferation scores rise quickly to near normal levels during zzso therapy in most zzso Higher levels at diagnosis are associated with a faster and better response to zzso In conclusion, assessment of the zzso activity in zzso preparations made from bone zzso samples of patients with zzso disease may add valuable information as to diagnostic zzso and clinical course and may contribute to therapeutic zzso
