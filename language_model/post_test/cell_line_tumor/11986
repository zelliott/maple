The zzso zzso zzso and its zzso have been recognized as important zzso of signal zzso processes leading to a variety of cellular responses, including survival and demise via zzso zzso evidence implicates key regulatory roles for zzso generated zzso in zzso dysfunction of the zzso beta zzso We have previously reported zzso of an zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in the zzso beta zzso We have also reported zzso identification of the structural A zzso the regulatory zzso zzso and the zzso C zzso for zzso zzso complex in zzso zzso zzso zzso we provide the first evidence to suggest that zzso zzso of the alpha zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso markedly reduces the zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso Potential significance of the functional zzso of zzso zzso in the context of zzso zzso zzso dysfunction of the zzso beta cell is zzso
