We have previously observed that zzso deprivation enhances tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso death as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in human prostate zzso zzso zzso In this study, we used zzso zzso breast cancer cells to examine the possible role of zzso in zzso zzso TRAIL zzso 

Combined zzso deprivation and 200 zzso TRAIL treatment markedly induced zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells zzso but not in control zzso zzso cells zzso We also observed that the level of zzso an zzso zzso was reduced by treatment with TRAIL in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso The reduction of zzso by TRAIL was promoted in the absence of zzso in zzso zzso However, zzso with 20 zzso M zzso a zzso zzso protected zzso cells from the zzso treatment of TRAIL and zzso zzso zzso This compound also prevented the reduction of zzso level during the zzso zzso Moreover, this zzso reduction was not inhibited by treatment with zzso a zzso zzso Data from zzso zzso show that zzso was zzso at zzso acid zzso but not zzso during treatment with TRAIL and zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso is involved in the reduction of zzso level, and its involvement is zzso through zzso zzso The reduction of zzso level is also due to zzso of zzso rather than degradation of zzso
