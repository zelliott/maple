The zzso zzso factor zzso could bind with the zzso of zzso genes such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and sodium zzso zzso zzso and regulate the expression of these proteins in zzso zzso zzso zzso in tumor cells by zzso of zzso provides a possible strategy for zzso therapy of zzso zzso we investigated the effect of zzso gene transfer on zzso therapy of zzso zzso The human zzso gene was zzso into the human zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells by the zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso was not zzso the expression of zzso and proteins of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cells were activated by zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells was zzso by zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells and zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso promoted zzso zzso and the retention time of zzso in zzso cells apparently prolonged in zzso and in zzso ( zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were selectively killed by zzso The zzso tumors in zzso clearly zzso in scanning images at zzso after administration of zzso These results indicate that zzso can promote zzso zzso and specifically prolong the retention time of zzso in zzso cancer in zzso and in zzso by promoting the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene zzso may lead to effective zzso therapy of zzso
