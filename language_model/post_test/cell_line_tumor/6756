We studied the modulating effects of zzso acid and zzso acid zzso common coffee zzso on the in zzso zzso of synthetic DNA zzso and also on the zzso status of the promoter region of a representative gene in two human cancer cells zzso Under conditions that were suitable for the in zzso zzso zzso of DNA and dietary zzso we found that the presence of zzso acid or zzso acid inhibited in a zzso manner the DNA zzso zzso by zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso and human zzso The zzso values of zzso acid and zzso acid were zzso and zzso zzso respectively, for the zzso of zzso zzso DNA zzso and were zzso and zzso zzso respectively, for the zzso of human zzso DNA zzso The zzso in zzso zzso of DNA zzso was approximately zzso when the highest concentration (20 zzso of zzso acid or zzso acid was zzso zzso analyses showed that DNA zzso zzso by zzso zzso or human zzso followed the zzso curve zzso The presence of zzso acid or zzso acid inhibited DNA zzso predominantly through a zzso zzso and this zzso was largely due to the increased formation of zzso zzso a potent inhibitor of DNA zzso resulting from the zzso zzso zzso of these dietary zzso Using cultured zzso and zzso human breast cancer cells, we also demonstrated that treatment of these cells with zzso acid or zzso acid partially inhibited the zzso of the promoter region of the zzso zzso The findings of our present study provide a general zzso basis for the notion that a variety of dietary zzso can function as zzso of DNA zzso through increased formation of zzso during the zzso zzso of these dietary zzso
