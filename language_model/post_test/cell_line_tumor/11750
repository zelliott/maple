To try to find a correlation between the zzso activity of a series of zzso complexes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso P zzso zzso zzso and their stability at zzso concentration under mass zzso zzso 

zzso complexes were investigated by positive zzso zzso zzso mass zzso with multiple zzso experiments using an zzso trap mass zzso 

The displacement of P from native zzso previously described for the copper zzso is common for the zzso complexes leading to the formation of zzso and zzso zzso Further zzso of zzso depends on the nature of the metal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso More zzso zzso and zzso are more zzso against zzso human colon zzso cells compared to less zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of P zzso from the zzso complexes is the driving force for the triggering of the zzso zzso The more favored is the displacement of P from the zzso active form, the more favored is in turn the possibility for the metal to interact with biological zzso related to cancer zzso
