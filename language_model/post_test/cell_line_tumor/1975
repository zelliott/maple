Combined targeting of zzso and zzso zzso pathways may be necessary for optimal therapeutic activity in zzso This study evaluated the zzso zzso zzso and zzso alone and in combination with the dual zzso inhibitor zzso or the zzso inhibitor zzso in three zzso cancer cell zzso 

Growth zzso survival and signal zzso were measured using the zzso B zzso zzso and western zzso respectively, in zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso 

All zzso inhibitor combinations exhibited marked synergistic growth zzso however, zzso displayed greater zzso in combination with either zzso zzso zzso exhibited stronger zzso of zzso zzso and similar zzso of zzso and zzso zzso compared with zzso Both zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso and with zzso inhibitor combinations zzso of zzso zzso was zzso The reduced zzso exhibited by zzso in combination with zzso zzso compared with zzso may be due to zzso of zzso and the addition of the zzso inhibitor zzso compromised the zzso of zzso zzso 

These studies confirm that dual targeting of zzso and zzso can induce synergistic growth zzso however, the combination of specific zzso zzso rather than dual zzso zzso with zzso zzso results in greater zzso
