Several new zzso zzso zzso were zzso and their binding affinity for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso properties were zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso rings at positions 1 and 3 displayed modest zzso selectivity and variable zzso through zzso while behaving as full zzso zzso through zzso in zzso element zzso gene expression zzso By contrast, the zzso derivatives were zzso and considerably less effective zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso 8, in particular, behaved as full zzso zzso zzso in these zzso zzso zzso revealed the structural zzso possibly accounting for the differential regulation of zzso through the two zzso exhibited by zzso The data also shows that the zzso zzso selectivity and zzso efficacy of the zzso zzso is influenced by the zzso ring fused to the zzso zzso Using 8 we show that, though the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells is required for zzso as well as zzso stimulation of cell growth, zzso responsiveness of the cells depends on zzso and zzso but not on zzso
