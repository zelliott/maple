zzso zzso zzso is being explored for a number of zzso The potential benefit of giving concurrent chemotherapy with zzso is not zzso We sought to predict the effects of combined zzso treatments by using mathematical models derived from laboratory zzso 

Data from 26 published zzso survival zzso for cancer cell lines with and without the use of zzso chemotherapy were zzso The first three data points of the zzso arm of each zzso were used to derive parameters for the linear zzso zzso model, the zzso zzso model, and the generalized linear zzso zzso zzso For each zzso and model, the difference between the predicted and observed surviving zzso at the highest tested zzso dose was zzso The zzso model was fitted to all the data from each zzso cell survival zzso and the biologically equivalent doses in zzso zzso zzso of clinically relevant zzso regimens were zzso The increase in cell kill zzso by the addition of chemotherapy was used to estimate the zzso of zzso along with a zzso zzso For comparison, this was repeated using conventionally zzso zzso zzso 

At a mean zzso dose of zzso zzso the average errors for the zzso zzso and zzso models were zzso zzso and zzso log units, respectively, favoring the zzso model zzso zzso zzso zzso chemotherapy increased the zzso of zzso schedules by an average of zzso to zzso depending on disease zzso This increase was similar to the gains predicted for the addition of chemotherapy to conventionally zzso zzso 

Based on published zzso zzso the zzso equation is superior to the zzso and zzso models in predicting cell kill at high doses of zzso Modeling exercises demonstrate that significant increases in biologically equivalent dose may be achieved with the addition of zzso agents to zzso Clinical study of this approach is zzso
