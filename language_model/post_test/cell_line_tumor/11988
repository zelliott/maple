Lack of effective zzso has become a major limit for extensive application of zzso zzso In this study, the zzso and mode of death induced by a newly developed zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso were investigated in zzso cell line, a highly zzso zzso of poorly differentiated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduction zzso was used to measure zzso in both zzso and zzso after which a flow zzso was used to measure zzso rate and cell cycle, and then zzso zzso -9 were zzso Finally, an animal model was set up to embody the zzso effect and for zzso zzso The zzso of zzso showed both zzso and zzso dependent characteristics and no significant dark zzso was observed in zzso zzso In zzso zzso exhibited an obviously low zzso By other in zzso studies, we found zzso induced zzso mainly via the zzso zzso and could restrain the cell cycle progression from the more sensitive zzso In zzso the zzso growth was significantly inhibited after zzso and many zzso cells could be seen by zzso zzso These results indicate the death way of cells induced by zzso is mainly via mild zzso and the cure effect is obvious, suggesting that zzso is a potential zzso of zzso therapy for prostate zzso
