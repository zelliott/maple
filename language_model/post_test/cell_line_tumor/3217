Increased active transport of zzso observed frequently in zzso cancer cells have been attributed to zzso proteins particularly, zzso We have demonstrated recently that a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso can also mediate zzso transport of zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso We demonstrate zzso zzso in artificial zzso can catalyze zzso transport of zzso which can be modulated by zzso The zzso activity of zzso coli expressed zzso zzso was zzso in a zzso fashion by zzso with half zzso stimulation at 130 zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso temperature and zzso sensitive zzso transport of zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso and 210 zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso for transport was found to be zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso transport to 50% at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and increased its transport activity by zzso zzso zzso prepared from the small zzso and zzso zzso lung cancer cell lines as well as zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines exhibited zzso transport of zzso which was inhibited by zzso zzso The rate of transport of zzso in zzso zzso zzso was half of that observed in zzso cell lines but after zzso with zzso the transport rate of zzso in zzso became comparable to that in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso transport by zzso in all 8 cell lines zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso inhibited transport of zzso by only zzso These results suggest that zzso is the major zzso zzso in cancer cells and that its transport activity is regulated by zzso zzso
