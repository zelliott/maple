zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been shown to stimulate the growth of colon cancer cells both in zzso and in zzso The identity of the zzso zzso these effects is zzso A recent study demonstrated the presence of a low affinity binding site for zzso and zzso on the zzso human colon cancer cell zzso The goal of the current study was to further investigate the role of this zzso in zzso the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso to zzso cell zzso in competition with zzso was zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso cell zzso was also zzso Whole cell binding experiments were carried out using zzso In addition, the ability of zzso and zzso to stimulate cell growth, as determined by cell zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso at both a high and a low affinity site on zzso zzso The zzso values for zzso were zzso zzso zzso M and zzso zzso zzso M while those for zzso were zzso zzso zzso M and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not bind to either zzso zzso also zzso with zzso at both a high and a low affinity site on zzso cells with similar affinities as observed with zzso zzso and zzso significantly zzso the growth of zzso cells in a zzso and zzso zzso The binding profiles of the peptides tested suggest that these sites are different from previously identified zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso
