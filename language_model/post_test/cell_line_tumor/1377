In the forthcoming era of cancer gene therapy, efforts will be devoted to the development of new efficient and zzso gene delivery zzso In this regard, the use of zzso zzso zzso as building blocks for zzso assembly represents a novel promising approach towards fully controlled zzso of effective gene zzso Here we report on the synthesis of defined zzso containing the zzso zzso a zzso DNA zzso binding domain of eight zzso zzso units and two terminal zzso zzso zzso a central zzso zzso zzso chain (with zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso specific peptides for targeting towards cancer zzso zzso B6 and zzso which bind zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, were chosen because of the high expression of these receptors in many zzso zzso This study shows the feasibility of designing these kinds of fully controlled zzso and their success for targeted zzso gene zzso
