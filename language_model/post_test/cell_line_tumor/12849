The vitamin A zzso zzso zzso acid zzso is considered as a potent zzso drug for its capability of regulating cell growth and zzso We aimed to study the effect of zzso on zzso in zzso human breast cancer cells and the probable molecular mechanisms through which zzso exerts its zzso 

Our experimental findings demonstrate that zzso enters into the nucleus and regulates various signaling pathways zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and also zzso and down regulates zzso activity as well as its zzso As a result zzso cell migration on zzso medium gets retarded in presence of zzso zzso up regulates zzso zzso Our study may help to understand the role of zzso as a regulator of zzso and the possible signaling pathways which are involved in this zzso zzso down regulation of zzso
