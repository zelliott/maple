Limited drug penetration in solid tumors is a potential mechanism of resistance for many zzso zzso zzso represent a class of drugs that are currently undergoing a new round of development, but with little known of their ability to penetrate and distribute relative to blood vessels within solid zzso 

We assessed the tissue penetration of zzso and zzso in zzso tumor zzso and in multilayered cell culture zzso a three-dimensional cell culture model of the tumor zzso zzso In zzso zzso were mapped relative to blood vessels to obtain drug profiles as a function of distance from zzso For zzso cultures were exposed to stirred drug reservoirs and zzso measured as a function of depth into zzso 

Both zzso exhibited limited zzso with little drug reaching further than 100 zzso into the zzso Of the two, zzso exhibited up to zzso greater penetration than zzso zzso tumor cell proliferation following treatment allowed the consequences of limited drug penetration to be zzso In tumor zzso where reduced drug exposure to cells far from zzso is one of several factors influencing response to treatment, up to a zzso reduction in zzso cells was achieved in cells nearest the vessels, but only 50% reduction was observed in the tissue 150 zzso zzso In zzso data, where the influence of reduced cell proliferation with depth into tissue was zzso a zzso zzso and zzso zzso increase in zzso drug concentration was required to produce a response in cells 150 zzso into the tissue equivalent to that seen in cells directly exposed to the zzso 

These results indicate that limited distribution is an important mechanism of tumor resistance to zzso
