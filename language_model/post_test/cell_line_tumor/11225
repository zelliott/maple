zzso is a natural compound belonging to zzso family of secondary plant zzso characterized by zzso biological zzso Here we present the results of a study on new zzso and zzso complexes of zzso as potent zzso and cell zzso zzso Most potent were 2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso and 2 complexes zzso zzso and zzso which had higher or similar zzso activity in comparison to zzso However, these 2 zzso decreased the number of cells in zzso phase in contrast to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and also zzso complex decreased zzso membrane potential and induced the zzso of zzso to the zzso membrane site, which indicates the induction of zzso Interestingly, zzso and its zzso induced zzso zzso supporting zzso mechanism of cell death but zzso supported zzso zzso zzso zzso complex probably did not induce cell death through the zzso pathway, as we did not find the zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso After the treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso and zzso formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso In contrast, in the cells that were treated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso AVO formation was not zzso
