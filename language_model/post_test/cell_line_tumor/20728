A previous report zzso zzso zzso and Rotenberg, zzso zzso zzso zzso 46, zzso described the application of the traceable zzso method in identifying zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso human breast zzso zzso Here, a zzso variation of this method compared the zzso profiles of three traceable zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the purpose of identifying novel, zzso zzso Each zzso traceable zzso was expressed and zzso along with zzso zzso The isolated zzso and its associated zzso were subjected to an in zzso zzso reaction with traceable zzso zzso and the resulting zzso were analyzed by Western zzso with an zzso that recognizes the zzso zzso consensus zzso zzso profiles generated by zzso and zzso were similar and differed markedly from that of zzso Mass zzso of selected bands revealed known zzso zzso and several potential zzso that included the small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Of those potential zzso tested, only zzso was zzso by pure zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and by zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells treated with zzso a membrane permeable zzso zzso Under these conditions, the zzso of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso per mole of zzso Following zzso with zzso zzso zzso the level of zzso of zzso was substantially decreased in response to zzso of each of the three zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas testing of zzso zzso supported a role for only zzso and zzso in zzso zzso These findings identify zzso as a novel zzso zzso zzso that is zzso by multiple zzso zzso
