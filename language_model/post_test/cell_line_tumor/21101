The La zzso zzso associates with a wide variety of cellular and viral zzso to affect gene expression in multiple zzso We show that La is the major cellular protein found to be associated with the abundant zzso viral leader zzso zzso early after infection with respiratory zzso virus zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with this, La redistributes from the nucleus to the zzso in zzso zzso Upon zzso interference zzso of zzso zzso is redirected to associate with the zzso protein zzso a known zzso of zzso zzso gene zzso and this is accompanied by the early induction of zzso zzso These results suggest that La shields zzso from zzso zzso the early viral zzso of type I zzso We mapped the zzso binding function to zzso recognition motif 1 of La and showed that while zzso La greatly enhanced zzso growth, a La zzso defective in zzso zzso binding also did not support zzso zzso Comparative studies of zzso and zzso virus and the use of zzso zzso cells indicated that La supports the growth of zzso zzso zzso viruses by both zzso suppression and a potentially novel zzso zzso
