This study aims to identify zzso proteins in the zzso of oral cancer cell zzso We have successfully established four primary cell cultures of normal cells with a limited lifespan without human zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso The zzso of these primary cell cultures were compared with that of oral cancer cell lines using zzso Thirty five protein spots were found to have changed in zzso zzso identification of these proteins was achieved by zzso zzso In zzso analysis predicted that 24 of these proteins were zzso via classical or zzso zzso The zzso expression of six genes was found to correlate with the corresponding protein zzso zzso zzso Analysis zzso core analysis revealed that the identified proteins were relevant in, and related to, cancer development with likely zzso in tumor growth, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso In conclusion, we have demonstrated that a comparative study of the zzso of cancer versus normal cell lines can be used to identify zzso zzso
