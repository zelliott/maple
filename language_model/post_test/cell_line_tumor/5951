zzso cell zzso zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso however, has not been directly shown in zzso but zzso from the requirement for zzso zzso receptors zzso in tumor rejection in zzso Here, we investigated the mechanism of action of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which binds selectively to a wide variety of zzso but not to normal zzso in both humans and zzso zzso zzso showed no direct toxicity against zzso cell lines in zzso but induced the rejection of a zzso breast tumor in zzso to zzso of zzso mice, when associated with zzso zzso rejection was abolished in zzso zzso zzso chain zzso mice, suggesting a role for zzso Indeed, tumor cells formed stable zzso in zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso but not in control zzso zzso The contact zone between tumor cells and zzso zzso accumulated zzso zzso and zzso The in zzso formed zzso zzso were organized in zzso zzso zzso zzso These results show that in zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso during tumor rejection by zzso zzso involves a novel type of zzso immune zzso between zzso of innate immunity and tumor zzso
