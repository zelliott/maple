zzso is a novel zzso zzso zzso platinum zzso therapeutic designed to increase the therapeutic index relative to zzso zzso platinum zzso The zzso construct accumulates in solid zzso on the basis of increased zzso zzso The bound platinum zzso is present as an zzso zzso at the zzso end of a zzso zzso zzso and the zzso molecular weight zzso of the construct is 22 zzso The zzso activity and toxicity of zzso were assessed in the zzso zzso zzso and Lewis lung zzso models, and in the human zzso zzso 2008 and head and neck zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The maximum tolerated dose zzso of zzso was zzso greater than that of zzso zzso in zzso zzso was active in all four zzso models, and it displayed a higher therapeutic index than zzso in each of these zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso given at zzso of its zzso was equivalent to that produced by a zzso of zzso Thus, consistent with the design goal for this drug, and despite being less potent than zzso zzso produced less systemic toxicity relative to its zzso activity and thus has a greater therapeutic zzso On the basis of the improved therapeutic index evidenced in these models, zzso has been advanced into clinical zzso
