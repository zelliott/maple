We previously demonstrated that that the zzso zzso was critical for zzso cell zzso In this study, we examined the effect of blocking this zzso on cell growth in zzso cancer zzso 

zzso The levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso or zzso cancer cell lines were investigated and compared with that in normal cells by Western zzso zzso The effects of zzso and/or zzso and zzso of zzso on cell growth, zzso in nude mice were zzso 

The zzso level was enhanced in cancer cells compared with normal zzso Treatment with zzso zzso resulted in a reduced zzso level, enhanced zzso and zzso levels and inhibited cell growth by the induction of premature zzso The effect of zzso inhibitor on cell growth was affected by zzso levels and zzso Treatment with zzso zzso inhibitor in combination with zzso zzso had a more zzso effect on cell growth compared to treatment with zzso inhibitor or zzso alone in cancer zzso zzso of the zzso level by zzso resulted in the zzso of growth in cancer zzso 

The zzso of the zzso zzso suppress cell proliferation and it is supposed as a new molecular target therapy in zzso zzso zzso such as zzso or zzso zzso
