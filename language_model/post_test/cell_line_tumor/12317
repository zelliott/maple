zzso zzso zzso are expressed by infected and transformed zzso They transmit danger signals to zzso immune cells, leading to zzso of zzso zzso We here report that the zzso zzso class zzso molecules A and B zzso and zzso proteins zzso 1-3 are expressed in human brain zzso in zzso while expression levels are low or zzso in normal zzso zzso and zzso expression decrease with increasing WHO grade of zzso while zzso and zzso are expressed independently of zzso zzso We further delineate two independent mechanisms that can explain these expression zzso zzso transforming growth zzso zzso is zzso during zzso progression and selectively zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso while zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso is reduced by zzso of zzso zzso whereas no changes in the expression levels of other zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is enhanced by depletion of zzso or zzso of zzso Thus, escape from zzso immune surveillance of zzso zzso in zzso may be promoted by the zzso of zzso and zzso expression via an zzso zzso loop and by zzso shedding from the cell zzso Loss of zzso and zzso in contrast to other zzso may be particularly important in zzso immune escape, and differential regulation of human zzso expression is part of the zzso properties of human zzso zzso zzso
