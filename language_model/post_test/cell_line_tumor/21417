zzso zzso is the most commonly occurring solid tumor in zzso The disease usually arises in the adrenal zzso and it is characterized by a remarkable zzso in its zzso Most zzso patients with an advanced disease have massive bone zzso zzso at zzso Lung zzso represents a widely zzso stage and is typically considered to be a terminal zzso Much like other zzso zzso progression is a complex, zzso zzso The zzso function, and significance of the various factors involved in zzso progression must be studied in relevant in zzso and in zzso zzso Currently, models consisting of zzso and zzso cell zzso of the same genetic background exist for several types of zzso however, none exists for zzso In the present study, we describe the generation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso into the adrenal zzso of zzso nude zzso zzso cells zzso to the lungs were isolated from mice bearing adrenal zzso Lung zzso zzso were generated by repeated cycles of in zzso zzso zzso of these zzso included cellular zzso and zzso in zzso aggressiveness in zzso and various zzso parameters in zzso The zzso zzso zzso in each model displayed unique properties, and both zzso zzso demonstrated a zzso zzso in zzso These zzso models of human zzso zzso will serve as an unlimited source of zzso and zzso zzso Such models can facilitate future studies on zzso zzso and the identification of novel zzso zzso and targets for zzso
