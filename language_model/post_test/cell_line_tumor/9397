zzso from Ewing zzso exhibit cellular features and express zzso suggesting that the tumor is of zzso zzso Because zzso signaling regulates the differentiation of zzso cells during development, we examined the role of zzso signaling in Ewing zzso We found that Ewing zzso express zzso zzso zzso and the zzso target gene zzso To determine the functional implications of zzso zzso we expressed zzso zzso active, zzso zzso or zzso zzso receptors in two Ewing zzso cell lines, or we treated the cell lines with a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso active zzso reduced proliferation and expression of the zzso zzso reduced zzso in zzso However, there was only a small difference in the volume of tumors that formed when the cell lines expressing these zzso were implanted in nude zzso zzso tumors derived from the cell lines expressing zzso zzso exhibited a neural zzso Treatment with a zzso inhibitor caused similar changes as expression of the zzso zzso zzso signaling plays a role in cell zzso zzso and zzso in Ewing zzso but its zzso is only associated with a small change in tumor growth zzso
