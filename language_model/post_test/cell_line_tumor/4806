The zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in more than zzso of acute zzso zzso zzso up to zzso of which carry an internal tandem zzso zzso within the zzso zzso Although varying zzso sites exist, most zzso affect a single protein zzso We analyzed the zzso of an zzso patient for zzso zzso class zzso zzso zzso One of the tested peptides zzso induced in zzso zzso zzso responses restricted by zzso that were also zzso ex zzso These zzso T cells recognized targets zzso with the patient's zzso but not zzso zzso and recognized the patient's zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso blasts can in principle process and present zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a potential candidate target zzso for the zzso of zzso
