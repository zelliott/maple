zzso is one of the most highly induced genes following treatment of cells with type I zzso zzso The zzso protein belongs to a family of poorly zzso low molecular weight zzso proteins that includes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our studies demonstrate that the zzso protein associates with or zzso into the zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso led to decreased viable cell numbers and enhanced sensitivity to zzso induced zzso effects that were blocked by zzso zzso or treatment with a zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso induced zzso c release, zzso zzso and loss of zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein expression prevented the zzso to zzso zzso and also decreased the ability of zzso zzso to sensitize cells to zzso thereby demonstrating a role for zzso in this zzso These data suggest that zzso contributes to zzso zzso of normal zzso function, thus adding zzso to a growing list of zzso proteins that impact cellular zzso
