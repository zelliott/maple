zzso are zzso organic molecules that disrupt cellular zzso potential by rendering zzso zzso permeable to specific zzso They include zzso that complex with metal zzso and zzso that insert into the membrane to form zzso zzso Although zzso possess zzso properties, investigations on zzso are zzso Here, we used the zzso zzso zzso A to study its effects on the growth and survival of zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that is highly resistant to conventional zzso We found that zzso A reduced the in zzso viability of several zzso cell lines at zzso zzso (all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A exhibited similar toxicity in zzso cells regardless of zzso zzso or the expression of either the von zzso tumor zzso gene or its downstream target, zzso zzso zzso A decreased cell viability equal to or greater than the zzso zzso depending on the cell zzso zzso examination revealed that zzso A blocks zzso generation by zzso zzso zzso and zzso leading to cellular energy depletion and zzso cell zzso Finally, zzso A effectively reduced the growth of zzso tumor zzso in zzso These results show a novel application of zzso A as a potential therapeutic agent for zzso zzso
