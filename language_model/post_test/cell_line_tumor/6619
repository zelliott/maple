zzso zzso a DNA zzso agent, was recently approved as the first therapeutic agent for the treatment of zzso zzso The present subcutaneous dosing schedule, 75 zzso for zzso days, is based on early clinical studies and may constitute a practical problem for zzso The present in zzso study aimed at evaluating the zzso of zzso thereby providing a rationale for clinical zzso zzso 

zzso cells were incubated with zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso daily for 24, 48, and 72 hours, followed by 48 hours in drug-free zzso The effects of zzso on cell growth, zzso zzso cell cycle status, and promoter zzso of zzso zzso and zzso genes were zzso 

zzso decreased cell growth and zzso increased zzso and affected cell cycle status in a zzso zzso However, the exposure time, 24 to 72 hours, at doses between zzso and 1 zzso did not significantly affect any of these zzso Using zzso exponential zzso model, we found that the effect of 1, 2, or 3 zzso over 24 hours did not differ from that of zzso to 1 zzso given over 48 to 72 zzso zzso of promoter zzso was observed already after 24 hours of exposure with zzso zzso zzso with no clear zzso zzso 

Our results indicate that optimal cellular effects of zzso might be achieved by shorter exposure zzso The model provides information about the relation between zzso dose intensity and exposure time on zzso zzso cells, which could serve as a rationale for further clinical development of practical, safe, and cost-effective dosing zzso
