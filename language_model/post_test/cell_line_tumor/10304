zzso zzso of cancer requires treatment directed against multiple zzso The zzso and nuclear factor zzso zzso pathways are zzso in nearly all tumors, making them attractive targets for therapeutic zzso and zzso zzso We have isolated and structurally zzso small zzso zzso that simultaneously activate zzso and inhibit zzso without causing zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso activity against all tested human tumor zzso grown in zzso We report here that the effects of zzso on zzso and zzso as well as their toxicity to cancer cells, result from zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso leads to zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso 2 and zzso of zzso transcription, which requires zzso activity at the zzso zzso These results identify zzso as a prospective zzso target enabling simultaneous zzso of several pathways frequently zzso in cancer without induction of DNA zzso zzso have the potential to be developed into effective and safe zzso zzso
