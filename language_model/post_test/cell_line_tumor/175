To establish a zzso protein zzso labeled tumor zzso model and to evaluate its biological zzso 

Human gastric zzso cell zzso and zzso cervical zzso cell zzso were zzso with the zzso zzso and the efficiency of zzso was assessed 24 h zzso Limited dilution was employed to screen and establish zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso The two fluorescent tumor cell zzso were transplanted into zzso mice and zzso mice zzso The zzso period of tumor mass appearance and the growth curve in zzso were zzso The tumor growth and zzso were evaluated in zzso by the zzso Fluorescence zzso System zzso Expressions of zzso and zzso in tumor tissue were monitored by zzso 

The efficiency of zzso zzso of zzso cells and zzso cells were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso periods of tumor formation of zzso and zzso were 3-5 days and 2-4 days, zzso Their zzso rates were zzso in zzso The tumor growth of zzso was well defined by the zzso Only one mouse was shown to harbor zzso zzso by zzso 60 days after zzso The zzso process of zzso was depicted through zzso on 27, 37 and 52 days zzso The zzso of pulmonary zzso and zzso zzso of zzso was zzso and zzso respectively when the tumor volume was zzso zzso zzso was positive and zzso was negative in both tumors by zzso 

zzso established two zzso tumor cell strains zzso expressing zzso zzso and zzso zzso of these cells into mice can establish tumor zzso models which could be used for future zzso tumor research in zzso
