Emerging evidence suggests the potential involvement of altered regulation of zzso in the zzso of zzso and these zzso are thought to be functional as tumor zzso or zzso Using zzso zzso we identified an zzso zzso expressed between the zzso cell line and its highly zzso zzso A zzso search revealed a potential target site for zzso within the zzso of zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso the expression of sensor zzso harboring the zzso of zzso in breast cancer cell zzso zzso treatment led to an increase of zzso protein and increased cell invasion in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso significantly reduced zzso protein amounts and inhibited cell invasion in zzso and zzso zzso In an zzso mouse model, zzso significantly inhibited the growth and dissemination of zzso zzso zzso zzso and real-time zzso zzso showed that zzso was a negative regulator of the zzso gene in primary breast zzso Our research reveals that zzso is closely associated with clinical zzso and identifies zzso potentially targets zzso zzso zzso of the zzso pairing may have important roles in the initiation and development of breast zzso
