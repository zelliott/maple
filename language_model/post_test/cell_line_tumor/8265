The zzso 3 zzso protein is implicated in the formation of tight junctions at zzso zzso zzso We investigated DNA copy number aberrations in human zzso zzso cell zzso zzso cell lines using a zzso zzso zzso and found a zzso deletion of zzso (the gene zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells lacking this gene enhanced the recruitment of zzso zzso 1 zzso a marker of tight zzso to sites of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells expressing this gene caused a disruption of zzso zzso at zzso zzso A copy number loss of zzso was observed in zzso of primary zzso zzso zzso of zzso was significantly reduced in primary zzso tumors compared with their zzso counterparts, and this reduced expression was associated with positive zzso zzso zzso and poor zzso Our results suggest that deletion and reduced expression of zzso may be a novel mechanism that drives the progression of zzso
