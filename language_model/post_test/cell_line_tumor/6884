zzso is a newly discovered zzso and an zzso zzso for growth hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso It has been shown to possess various central and peripheral effects, including zzso zzso food zzso and gastric and cardiac zzso zzso and the zzso zzso are expressed also in pancreatic zzso We have identified several zzso genes by zzso zzso methods, among which is a zzso zzso for type 1 diabetes, zzso Administration of zzso increased zzso zzso in mouse brain, zzso and zzso cell lines zzso and zzso However, the expression of zzso another structurally related zzso zzso was not induced by zzso Administration of zzso or zzso of zzso but not zzso of zzso inhibited zzso insulin zzso in zzso zzso cells and, moreover, zzso of zzso expression by the zzso interference technique ameliorated zzso zzso effects on zzso insulin zzso These findings strongly suggest that zzso effects of zzso on zzso insulin zzso are at least partly due to increased expression of zzso induced by zzso Our data demonstrate the link among zzso zzso and zzso insulin zzso
