zzso zzso protein zzso is the hallmark of a group of neurodegenerative diseases, including zzso zzso We hypothesized that a zzso that could cleave zzso stretches would intervene in the initial events leading to zzso in these zzso To prove this concept, we aimed to generate a zzso possessing zzso specificity for zzso zzso 

zzso A virus zzso zzso zzso zzso was subjected to engineering using a zzso method known as the zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso specificity revealed that zzso can cleave zzso containing zzso at positions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso but not zzso containing zzso at the zzso or zzso zzso To accommodate zzso at zzso and zzso key zzso zzso the active sites of the zzso or zzso pockets were separately zzso and zzso The resulting sets of zzso were combined by zzso and further subjected to two rounds of zzso and screening using a zzso containing zzso from positions zzso through zzso One of the selected zzso zzso reduced the expression level and zzso of a zzso zzso fusion protein containing a zzso zzso stretch zzso in the zzso cell line zzso zzso also prevented cell death and zzso 3 zzso induced by zzso These protective effects of zzso were zzso zzso 

These data provide a zzso that zzso zzso of zzso stretches could be an effective zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso
