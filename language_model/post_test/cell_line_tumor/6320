The activated zzso cell zzso zzso zzso is zzso in many zzso tumors, but controversial results about its role and zzso impact in breast cancer have been zzso zzso we evaluated the zzso effects of zzso expression in two breast cancer cell lines and a larger cohort of zzso zzso By stable zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso and zzso cells with reduced zzso levels were generated and analyzed in functional zzso and zzso zzso In addition, an zzso study on 347 patients with breast cancer with long-term follow-up and analysis of zzso tumor cells zzso was zzso In both cell lines, high zzso expression was associated with reduced cell zzso In addition, zzso zzso in zzso cells resulted in lower invasive potential, whereas high zzso expression was associated with increased zzso in both cell zzso Among genes which were zzso expressed in clones with altered zzso zzso there was an overlap of 15 genes between both cell lines, among them zzso D, zzso 7, zzso and zzso whose deregulation was validated by western zzso zzso In zzso cells, we observed a correlation with zzso expression which was validated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our zzso results on primary breast zzso showed that zzso expression was associated with an zzso zzso zzso In addition, strong zzso zzso correlated with zzso involvement and the presence of tumor cells in bone zzso By zzso analysis, strong zzso expression in zzso zzso correlated with shorter recurrence-free intervals zzso and overall survival zzso zzso Our results indicate that the zzso role of zzso in breast cancer is complex, but zzso might be relevant for outcome in zzso zzso
