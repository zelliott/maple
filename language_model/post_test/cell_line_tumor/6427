To develop more zzso for diagnosis and therapy of zzso cancer, a zzso zzso display library was used to isolate peptides that bound specifically to the human zzso tumor cell line zzso After five rounds of in zzso zzso the recovery rate of zzso showed a zzso increase over the first round of zzso and a group of zzso clones capable of binding to zzso cells were zzso A zzso clone named zzso with high affinity and specificity to zzso cells was identified in zzso More importantly, the synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso which corresponded to the sequence of the inserted zzso of zzso demonstrated a high specificity to zzso cells especially when compared to other cell lines zzso and zzso zzso might therefore be a zzso for targeting drug delivery in zzso cancer zzso
