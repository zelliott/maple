Recently, we characterized multiple roles of the zzso zzso stress responsive element zzso in the promotion of a unique head-to-head gene zzso zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso 2 zzso This zzso promoter, which consists of fewer than 400 base pairs, separates the two zzso It has been demonstrated that the zzso promoter shows less zzso activity through zzso but its basic regulatory mechanism has not been zzso In this study, we focused on zzso binding elements for the zzso factors for zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso and zzso families in the zzso region of the mouse zzso zzso We characterized their dominant roles in regulating zzso promoter activities using several deletion and zzso zzso reporter zzso The zzso gene is expressed in three distinct cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The reporter activity in each cell line decreased similarly with serial deletions of the mouse zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and adjacent zzso element slightly affected reporter zzso Each of the zzso in the zzso sequence and zzso element reduced zzso promoter activity, and the combination of these zzso zzso decreased reporter zzso Each zzso in the zzso zzso consensus sequences partially attenuated zzso promoter activity, and zzso of all three zzso elements decreased promoter activity by approximately zzso zzso of the three zzso regulatory elements zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso promoter decreased reporter activity by more than zzso Our results suggest that the promoter activity of the mouse zzso gene is regulated in a similar manner in the three cell lines tested in this zzso The zzso consensus sequences in the promoter of this gene zzso contribute to maintaining zzso gene zzso
