zzso infection is currently restricted to endemic zzso To define the prevalence of zzso infection in patients living in Italy, we first carried out a retrospective zzso analysis in a group of people originating from African countries referred to our hospital from January 2003 to February zzso We subsequently applied a real time zzso on peripheral blood zzso cells from subjects with positive or indeterminate zzso zzso 

All the zzso were first zzso by zzso methods zzso and/or Western zzso and then the peripheral blood zzso cells from subjects with positive or zzso zzso results were analyzed for the presence of zzso DNA by a sensitive zzso Green real time zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso negative samples were zzso by real time zzso approach as negative zzso 

zzso results disclosed serum zzso by zzso zzso values equal or greater than the zzso zzso in 9 out of zzso individuals attending the zzso zzso Diseases Clinic and/or Oncology Department, and 2 out zzso blood donors enrolled as a control zzso zzso of positive or zzso zzso results, all these subjects were analyzed for the presence of zzso DNA in peripheral blood zzso cells by zzso real time zzso A clear-cut positive result for the presence of zzso DNA was obtained in two subjects from endemic zzso 

zzso real time zzso cut short zzso zzso zzso This rapid and inexpensive zzso showed an excellent linear dynamic range, specificity and zzso readily revealing and zzso the presence of virus in zzso Our results highlight the need to monitor the presence of zzso in countries which have seen a large influx of immigrants in recent zzso zzso surveillance and correct diagnosis are recommended to verify the prevalence and zzso of a new zzso zzso
