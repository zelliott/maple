To establish a new therapeutic method to treat zzso zzso we investigated the therapeutic potential of zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso virus of zzso zzso zzso in an zzso mouse zzso cancer zzso 

zzso and/or zzso were instilled into the zzso after zzso of zzso zzso zzso effects of combination therapy were evaluated by zzso analysis of the zzso on day 14 after tumor zzso The survival rate of zzso mice was examined for 60 days after single or double administration of zzso alone or zzso The surviving mice were zzso with zzso injection of zzso cells, and the zzso was observed after 3 zzso 

Combined zzso zzso of zzso and zzso resulted in a significantly higher rate of zzso mice zzso compared with mice treated using zzso alone zzso zzso Median survival was zzso days for zzso zzso of zzso and zzso compared with the 29 days for zzso zzso alone ( zzso After combination therapy, surviving mice formed no tumors in the zzso following zzso zzso of zzso 

zzso increased zzso effects in combination with zzso agent zzso zzso immunity appeared to be enhanced using zzso
