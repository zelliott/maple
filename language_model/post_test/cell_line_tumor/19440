The effects of surface topography on cell zzso are the subject of intense research in cell zzso These effects have so far only been studied using zzso surfaces of zzso different zzso In this paper, we present a new approach to zzso cell growth on porous silicon zzso displaying pore sizes from several thousands to a few zzso This widely zzso format has the potential to significantly reduce sample numbers and hence analysis time and zzso Our zzso format was applied here to the culture of zzso cells in order to determine the effects of topography on cell growth zzso Cell zzso zzso length and area were zzso by zzso and scanning electron zzso We observed a dramatic influence of changes in surface topography on the density and zzso of adherent zzso zzso For example, pore size regimes where cell attachment is strongly discouraged were identified providing cues for the design of zzso zzso On pore size regimes more conducive to cell attachment, lateral zzso interactions zzso the cell layer to the zzso surface, while direct zzso interactions were zzso Finally, our study revealed that cells were sensitive to zzso surface topography with feature sizes of zzso zzso
