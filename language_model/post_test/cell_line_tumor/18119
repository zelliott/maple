In view of the importance of vitamin A in the human immune system and the central role of zzso zzso in the proliferation of zzso we examined the effects of zzso acid zzso on the protein and gene expression of zzso in the human zzso line zzso when zzso with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso enhanced the production of zzso zzso by zzso but suppressed that zzso by zzso These findings were consistent with the results of a reverse zzso chain reaction and quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction examining zzso gene zzso zzso zzso the gene expression of zzso zzso by zzso and restored that suppressed by zzso but to below the control zzso zzso suppressed the zzso gene expression zzso by zzso to a level of zzso of the control whereas it had no effect on the zzso by zzso Since zzso zzso has been suggested to be important for the zzso and gene expression of zzso and since the zzso zzso binding site is present in the promoter of the zzso zzso these findings may explain the differences in zzso effects on zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso affects the production of zzso by zzso in a zzso zzso
