To evaluate the pharmacological characteristics of zzso zzso a new zzso zzso zzso zzso we examined its zzso zzso zzso pressure zzso effect, effects on zzso humor zzso and stimulating effect on zzso The zzso profile for zzso a zzso acid of zzso was determined by measuring muscle zzso in an organ bath, zzso of zzso zzso and competitive binding of a zzso zzso For the zzso study, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso monkeys were used, and zzso was measured using a zzso For the studies of zzso humor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso constant pressure zzso and isotope dilution and zzso techniques were used in zzso zzso zzso The zzso contents in the medium and in the cell bodies of cultured zzso melanoma cells were zzso The affinity for the zzso zzso shown by zzso zzso : zzso zzso was 12 times that of zzso ( Ki : zzso zzso a zzso acid of zzso A single application of zzso at zzso significantly lowered zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso monkeys zzso and zzso zzso respectively, p zzso zzso and zzso at zzso significantly lowered zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso Once daily zzso of zzso at zzso zzso or zzso for 5 days in zzso monkeys significantly reduced zzso not only for a few hours, but also at the zzso time zzso after zzso zzso at zzso also reduced zzso but not at the zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso mainly by increasing zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and, as sometimes seen with other zzso also increased total zzso facility zzso increase, p zzso zzso In cultured zzso melanoma cells, zzso zzso zzso did not stimulate zzso but zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso has a high affinity for the zzso zzso zzso has potent zzso effects in both zzso zzso and zzso monkeys that exceed those of zzso and has less stimulating effect on zzso in melanoma zzso
