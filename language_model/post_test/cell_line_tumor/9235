zzso II zzso the principal hormone of the zzso system, is actively generated in the zzso and has been suggested as a key zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso that plays an important role in the recruitment of zzso cells into the pancreatic zzso In this study, we investigated the potential molecular basis for the role of zzso in zzso inflammation through studying its effect on zzso zzso significantly increased the expression of zzso zzso and protein in the zzso zzso line and activated zzso zzso zzso zzso induction was inhibited by an zzso type 1 zzso zzso but was unchanged by an zzso type 2 zzso zzso zzso induction was inhibited by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso suggesting a zzso signaling zzso zzso activated the zzso of zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso reduced the zzso zzso zzso In zzso diabetic mice zzso the zzso pattern of zzso zzso expression correlated well with progression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of pancreatic serial sections show zzso of zzso zzso with zzso in zzso in the zzso In freshly isolated zzso from zzso mice, zzso alone and in combination with zzso zzso an inflammatory response by stimulation of zzso Our data suggest a positive zzso action for the local pancreatic zzso system during zzso and provide the first insight into an zzso signal zzso zzso that regulates zzso as a possible inflammatory mechanism in the zzso
