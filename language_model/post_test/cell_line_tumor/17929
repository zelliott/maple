The objective of this study was to generate new zzso zzso zzso resistant zzso cell lines by drug zzso Since our previous studies have been carried out with cells infected with a zzso zzso it was important to confirm our findings in cells generated by drug zzso In this report, we describe three zzso cell lines which became drug-resistant by zzso exposure to zzso zzso zzso cells resistant to 18 zzso VCR zzso zzso cells resistant to 21 zzso VCR zzso and zzso cells resistant to 12 zzso VCR zzso zzso zzso zzso and continued to express zzso zzso and zzso all of which are targets for zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso pump in these new cells was functional as determined by the zzso of zzso 123 and zzso and the three cell lines were resistant to several zzso zzso We further determined that their zzso zzso was stable in zzso zzso mice and that the tumors were also resistant to zzso We will now use these new zzso cells to determine whether zzso zzso against zzso and zzso can reverse zzso as we previously demonstrated using zzso cells infected with a human zzso zzso zzso
