zzso zzso zzso virus zzso shows promise for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso but its safety and efficacy when administered in a setting of zzso fibrosis, which occurs in the majority of clinical cases, is zzso We hypothesized that zzso could provide a novel benefit to the underlying fibrosis, due to its ability to replicate and cause cell death specifically in activated zzso zzso zzso In addition to the ability of zzso to produce a significant zzso response in zzso rats in the background of zzso zzso zzso without signs of zzso we observed a significant zzso of zzso stage, a decrease in collagen content in the liver, and zzso of gene expression in favor of zzso zzso Together, this work suggests that zzso is not only safe and effective for the treatment of zzso with underlying fibrosis, but it could potentially be developed for clinical application as a novel zzso zzso
