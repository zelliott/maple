zzso DNA replication system is a very useful tool to understand the mechanism of zzso which is a tightly regulated zzso Many environmental and cellular factors can induce cell cycle arrest or zzso by zzso DNA zzso In the course of our search for zzso zzso from the marine zzso zzso A was found to have some zzso properties, the possible mechanism of which was zzso 

Cell viability was determined by Cell Counting zzso zzso to count living zzso cells by combining zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso A on DNA replication was carried out in zzso DNA replication system in zzso The activities of zzso I and zzso zzso were measured by the relaxation of zzso zzso DNA and the incorporation of zzso to the template zzso The zzso binding activity of zzso was assessed by zzso zzso Shift zzso zzso 

We have found that zzso A delivers significant zzso activity against the zzso cell zzso It was also found that zzso A could substantially inhibit zzso DNA replication in zzso in which zzso zzso is one of its main zzso 

Taken together, we suggest that zzso zzso zzso may correlate with its zzso on DNA zzso zzso A has the potential to be developed as an zzso zzso
