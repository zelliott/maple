zzso zzso the downstream target of zzso is a negative regulator of cell cycle zzso phase checkpoint in response to DNA zzso Our previous comparative zzso study showed that zzso zzso was zzso or lost in zzso zzso zzso tissue compared with zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso In this study, we further investigated for the zzso mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso promoter zzso in zzso of analyzed zzso cell lines zzso but not in immortalized human zzso zzso cell line zzso Treatment of the four zzso cell lines with the zzso inhibitor zzso resulted in the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso occurred at a higher frequency in zzso zzso zzso compared to adjacent zzso zzso zzso and fully zzso zzso zzso promoter was detected in zzso but not in any of adjacent zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso showed that zzso zzso expression was zzso or lost in zzso with zzso and there was a negative correlation between the expression levels and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso In addition, the patients with zzso zzso zzso presented a higher frequency of zzso zzso and distant zzso and an advanced clinical stage, and zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cell line zzso with high zzso potential was able to inhibit its in zzso invasive zzso Our data are the first to show that zzso zzso is frequently zzso by promoter zzso in zzso and this zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and distant zzso
