Development of a zzso functional zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso channels is challenging because of the unique requirement of both zzso and high zzso of zzso for zzso of these zzso Here, we describe a new zzso zzso system that zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was generated by introducing two zzso into the zzso flexible interface between the two zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso channel exhibited a large negative shift in its zzso relationship, which indicates zzso by modest zzso at resting zzso of zzso zzso Unlike the zzso zzso channel, the zzso zzso did not require a zzso increase of zzso zzso for zzso Despite the observed shift in its zzso zzso profile, activity of the zzso channel was further zzso by a known zzso channel zzso When tested in a commercially available zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso channel generated a strong zzso signal under conditions that are typical for zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso channel represent a new zzso zzso system for investigation of zzso channels that can be used to screen for novel zzso of these zzso
