zzso zzso and zzso loss represent key pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease zzso It has been demonstrated that the decrease of total zzso numbers zzso with the presence of zzso zzso in zzso zzso In order to unravel the mechanism leading to the cell death in zzso we developed a zzso zzso human zzso cellular model with zzso expression of zzso truncated zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing the longest zzso zzso zzso 40) were used as a zzso We found that more than zzso of the total amount of AT zzso and zzso 40 were zzso zzso both AT zzso and zzso 40 reduced the zzso activity of the cells in a zzso manner zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso slows down cell zzso However, AT zzso showed significantly higher toxicity than zzso 40 zzso zzso zzso which indicates that zzso leads to a toxic gain of zzso The analysis of the type of the cell death revealed the characteristic features of zzso such as cell zzso zzso and DNA zzso However, we did not find either the zzso of executive zzso zzso or the zzso zzso products zzso and zzso These results show that zzso modified truncated zzso protein zzso zzso zzso programmed cell death, a phenomenon we term zzso
