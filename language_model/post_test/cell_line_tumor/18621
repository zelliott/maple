The zzso zzso involves the degradation of several nuclear zzso Previously we demonstrated that the interaction between the zzso for Gal 1 zzso and nuclear zzso the vitamin D zzso or the zzso X zzso was involved in zzso zzso In our recent experiments, we examined the potential role of zzso in the zzso degradation of zzso receptors zzso and zzso Both zzso zzso with zzso in a zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso inhibited both zzso and zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso expression studies demonstrated that the zzso of zzso zzso generated zzso fragments of both zzso and that these products were blocked by a zzso zzso The zzso of zzso also enhanced the formation of zzso proteins of both zzso in the presence of zzso On the other hand, zzso A zzso which activated zzso transcription, did not enhance the interaction between zzso and zzso Furthermore, the degradation of zzso was much slower in the presence of zzso than in the presence of zzso or zzso which is another zzso zzso Also, zzso had no effect on the formation of zzso fragments of zzso and neither did it have any effect on the zzso of zzso These findings indicate that the zzso degradation of both zzso proteins may involve the interaction of zzso with both zzso Moreover, zzso strongly blocked the zzso and degradation of zzso compared with zzso suggesting that zzso may affect the zzso zzso of target genes by zzso zzso zzso
