zzso between the zzso zzso and its zzso zzso is known to affect various aspects of zzso zzso Less is known about the biological consequences of zzso signaling through tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso and its two zzso We have used Ramos zzso center zzso zzso zzso zzso cells as a model system to compare some of the early signaling events of zzso and zzso on the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have previously found that both zzso and zzso induced enhanced cell zzso adherence and modified cell surface zzso of Ramos zzso In the present report, it was found that treatment with either zzso or zzso resulted in a rapid degradation zzso 15 zzso of zzso followed by a recovery period lasting up to a few zzso The level of zzso another zzso zzso of the zzso pathway, also decreased following treatment with zzso or zzso However, whereas zzso induced a rapid drop without significant recovery within 2 zzso zzso caused a slow and gradual decline of zzso In addition, treatment with zzso resulted in a gradual and modest decline of up to zzso of the level of zzso within 2 zzso whereas a much smaller decline was seen with zzso zzso zzso Our results thus show that in Ramos cells, zzso and zzso have common, as well as zzso signaling effects on the zzso zzso and zzso which form zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso We also found that zzso but not zzso activates the zzso zzso through transient zzso of its zzso zzso As expected, zzso which is known to be a zzso of zzso was also zzso at zzso zzso 73 by treatment with zzso but not by zzso
