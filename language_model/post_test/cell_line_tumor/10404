Alzheimer's disease zzso is characterized by a loss of zzso and zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso in the brain and severe memory zzso Previously, we found that zzso zzso against zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso decreased the number of zzso zzso in the brains of mice and impaired episodic zzso Here we show that zzso capable to bind zzso are present in the blood of both healthy humans and zzso zzso In healthy individuals, their capacity to compete with zzso for the binding to zzso increased with zzso The level of such zzso was significantly elevated in children with severe form of zzso zzso and in mice injected with Lewis lung zzso cells expressing both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were accompanied with decreased surface zzso on the blood zzso of children and of mice zzso with zzso Among zzso patients, the level of zzso zzso zzso was significantly larger in people zzso zzso zzso years old with moderate or severe zzso stages zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to those of 76 zzso zzso years old with the mild zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We concluded that zzso zzso zzso found in the human blood are formed as a result of common infections accompanied with the destruction of respiratory zzso zzso blood plasma levels of zzso zzso zzso are characteristic for the zzso zzso and, therefore, are suggested as one of the risk factors for the development of this form of the zzso
