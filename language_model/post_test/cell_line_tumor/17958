zzso and zzso experiments with multiple zzso and drug zzso provide far more valuable information than experiments with just two zzso zzso zzso zzso as commonly performed in most zzso zzso Analysis of the data from such complex experiments, however, remains a zzso 

Here we present a zzso method for fitting time profiles and zzso patterns, zzso to gene expression zzso The zzso for zzso included exponential increase and decrease models with zzso such as initial expression level, maximum effect, and zzso (or zzso The zzso for zzso was a zzso Hill zzso 

The method was applied to an zzso zzso zzso consisting of 51 zzso The specific study focused on the effects of two platinum drugs, zzso and zzso on zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso were available at most time points and zzso zzso genes were selected, and after selection, zzso and zzso were modeled zzso 

Comparisons of model parameters helped to distinguish genes with different expression patterns between the two drug zzso This overall paradigm can help in understanding the molecular mechanisms of the agents, and the timing of their zzso
