zzso acid is well known to acutely stimulate zzso synthesis in zzso cells, but it has also been shown over several days to increase zzso zzso zzso and zzso synthesis in cultured zzso Since zzso zzso is the zzso step in zzso zzso an effect of zzso to increase zzso zzso protein could contribute to its ability to increase or sustain zzso zzso zzso we evaluated whether zzso zzso protein expression and function is increased in zzso zzso cells by zzso relevant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells did not contain zzso and had only very low levels of zzso in culture with zzso the zzso for zzso zzso However, treatment of cells with zzso for 6 h or more markedly increased zzso zzso such that zzso zzso and zzso increased in parallel with half zzso zzso zzso of about 1 zzso zzso and 150 zzso zzso This increase was enhanced by supplementing zzso but was not zzso by several antioxidants or by zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso protein expression increased at zzso zzso zzso above zzso zzso This contributed to zzso generation, which was decreased zzso by zzso of protein synthesis with zzso at high zzso zzso These results suggest that expected zzso zzso zzso zzso enhance zzso synthesis both by maintaining zzso and increasing zzso zzso zzso
