In human zzso loss of zzso stabilization of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of Ras and zzso zzso to increase the activity of a key regulator of zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is an zzso of zzso a key step of zzso Previously, a weak competitive inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso was found to reduce the zzso metabolism and proliferation of cancer zzso We have zzso 73 derivatives of zzso and screened each compound for activity against zzso zzso One small zzso zzso zzso was selected for further zzso evaluation of its zzso zzso and zzso properties in zzso and in zzso We found that zzso causes a rapid induction of zzso in transformed cells, has adequate zzso properties, suppresses the zzso zzso and growth of Lewis lung zzso in zzso mice, and yields zzso effects in three human zzso models of cancer in zzso mice that are comparable to zzso Food and Drug zzso zzso zzso As a result of this study, a synthetic zzso and zzso of zzso has undergone zzso new drug zzso zzso and safety zzso A phase I clinical trial of its efficacy in advanced cancer patients will initiate in 2013 and we anticipate that this new class of zzso agents will yield acceptable therapeutic zzso and prove to be synergistic with agents that disrupt zzso zzso
