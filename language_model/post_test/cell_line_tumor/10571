zzso of zzso zzso represents a possible avenue for the prevention and/or treatment of some zzso Our goal was to compare the effect of a selective inhibitor of zzso zzso and a zzso and zzso zzso zzso on the growth of canine zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso was used to induce zzso in nude zzso Mice were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (6 zzso zzso or a control zzso zzso volumes between 0 and 24 days zzso showed no significant difference between all zzso A second series of experiments was performed with a higher dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso volumes between 14 and 21 days zzso were significantly smaller in zzso mice compared with zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso reduced the growth of canine zzso cancer zzso in mice, suggesting that zzso zzso could have a positive effect in zzso
