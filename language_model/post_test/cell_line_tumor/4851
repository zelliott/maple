Gold zzso with a relatively small size zzso approximately 45 zzso in edge zzso have been developed, and the structure of these zzso was tailored to achieve strong zzso in the zzso zzso region for zzso cancer zzso zzso calculations show that the zzso has a large zzso cross section of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso conversion of zzso zzso into zzso The gold zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso to target zzso growth factor receptors zzso that are zzso on the surface of breast cancer cells zzso Our preliminary zzso results show that the zzso strongly absorb light in the zzso region with an intensity threshold of zzso zzso to induce zzso destruction to the cancer zzso In the intensity range of zzso zzso the circular area of damaged cells increased zzso with the zzso power zzso These results suggest that this new class of zzso gold zzso zzso gold zzso can potentially serve as an effective zzso therapeutic agent for cancer zzso
