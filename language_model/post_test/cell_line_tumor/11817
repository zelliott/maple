zzso zzso cell zzso zzso accounts zzso oral cancer which is a leading cause of cancer death zzso Early diagnosis may well offer an opportunity to increase survival to this zzso zzso cancer progression is zzso yet its migration machinery of zzso is still zzso To access whether the possible zzso zzso markers and underlying mechanisms, we developed a highly migratory zzso zzso cells from zzso cells to investigate the zzso 

zzso profiling was performed on zzso and zzso zzso Target zzso was correlated to pathological status in zzso patients by real-time zzso A downstream zzso was identified using a zzso analysis, and a zzso region zzso reporter zzso was zzso 

An zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso was found to be significantly zzso in zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso of this cluster decreased the migratory ability of zzso cell zzso We further demonstrated that zzso and zzso are the main zzso of zzso cluster which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed negative correlation with zzso stage and zzso zzso Through a zzso screening analysis and zzso reporter zzso we confirmed the zzso zzso zzso as a direct target of zzso and zzso of zzso reduced cell migratory capability of zzso 

zzso acts as a zzso predictor of zzso patients' outcome and a tumor migration zzso zzso
