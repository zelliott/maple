We have previously reported that the addition of zzso zzso to the culture medium of zzso cells (which cannot produce zzso that were infected with the zzso strain of zzso virus 5 zzso formally known as zzso that fails to block zzso zzso rapidly zzso zzso in the relative levels of virus zzso and protein zzso In addition, zzso treatment also caused a rapid zzso of virus proteins and enhanced the formation of zzso viral inclusion zzso The most studied zzso genes with known zzso activity are zzso zzso and the zzso A zzso L zzso We therefore examined the effects of these proteins on the replication cycle of zzso These studies revealed that while these proteins had some zzso activity against zzso they were not primarily responsible for the very rapid zzso in virus protein synthesis observed following zzso treatment, nor for the zzso formation of virus inclusion bodies, in zzso infected zzso
