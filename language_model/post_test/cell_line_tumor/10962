To express zzso alpha & beta in zzso cells by using gene zzso and to observe its effect on cell growth and cell sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs and zzso 

zzso expression zzso of zzso alpha & beta were zzso into zzso cells and cell clones with stable expression were zzso zzso alpha & beta expression levels in the zzso zzso cells were assessed at zzso level and protein level, zzso Cell growth status was assessed by biological zzso zzso was performed to test effects of zzso on sensitivity of the zzso cells to chemotherapy drugs and radiation, and cell cycle analysis was performed to evaluate cell zzso 

After zzso positive cells, especially zzso cells expressing zzso showed an increase of about zzso in zzso ability, a shorter doubling time zzso zzso zzso and lower sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs and radiation zzso zzso zzso Only zzso of the cells committed zzso with 10 zzso zzso 

zzso zzso especially zzso zzso are implicated in genesis and development of lung cancer, thus may be an important mechanism for drug resistance of lung cancer zzso
