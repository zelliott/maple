We have previously demonstrated that zzso and zzso zzso in mice zzso the development of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso mainly by increasing zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, these zzso showed very high expression levels of zzso a zzso factor that regulates the gene expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso itself, playing a key role in zzso zzso development and zzso zzso the aim of our study was to identify the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso development induced by zzso and zzso First, we demonstrated that zzso and zzso directly interact with both zzso and its gene promoter in zzso and that these proteins positively regulate zzso promoter activity, also zzso with zzso zzso zzso we zzso by zzso zzso on two different zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso that zzso zzso increases zzso cell zzso Finally, the expression analysis of zzso zzso and zzso in human zzso zzso of different zzso types revealed a direct correlation between zzso and zzso expression zzso Taken together, our data indicate a role of zzso zzso by zzso proteins in zzso zzso
