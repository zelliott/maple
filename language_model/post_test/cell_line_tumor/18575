Many molecular zzso are known to occur in zzso zzso of the zzso but their significance for tumor progression is poorly zzso zzso of zzso zzso are frequently found in several tumor types and are often associated with progressive zzso In all, 99 zzso tumors were screened for deletions at zzso using loss of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso FISH zzso zzso loss on zzso zzso in at least one marker was found in zzso zzso zzso There was a significant correlation of zzso deletions with invasive tumor growth and a highly significant association with zzso growth pattern in patients with invasive zzso zzso array analyses revealed that zzso zzso protein 1 zzso an zzso of zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso is frequently zzso in zzso zzso To investigate zzso as a candidate for a putative zzso gene on zzso zzso cell lines and primary zzso zzso were screened for zzso expression using quantitative real-time zzso Northern zzso zzso and zzso zzso Of the investigated zzso zzso 38% showed loss of zzso expression by quantitative zzso zzso of the protein expression by zzso using tissue zzso containing zzso zzso zzso revealed loss or strong reduction of zzso expression in zzso of zzso zzso loss was associated with higher tumor stage and grade and shorter overall zzso In addition, loss of zzso was an independent indicator of poor survival in patients with zzso but not with muscle invasive zzso zzso There were neither zzso in the coding region of zzso nor zzso deletions at zzso However, promoter zzso was detected using zzso zzso in zzso of zzso In conclusion, we could show a close correlation of zzso zzso deletions and progression of zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene on zzso zzso could be a candidate gene for the predicted, zzso tumor zzso gene in zzso cancer and could contribute to zzso zzso
