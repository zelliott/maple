In zzso zzso Lyn and zzso constitute the core of an zzso zzso that captures the zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the Signal zzso and zzso of zzso to generate zzso and zzso zzso zzso lines corresponding to zzso zzso and zzso zzso display zzso zzso organizations that zzso activate zzso zzso and zzso In the zzso zzso line, zzso zzso and zzso were zzso activated upon association with the zzso zzso while in the zzso zzso line, the association with zzso and zzso of zzso were zzso with by the zzso membrane proteins zzso by the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso line, a weak association of zzso with the zzso zzso resulted in poor zzso of zzso but in those cells, as in the zzso and zzso lines, efficient zzso induction by the zzso inhibitor zzso indicated that zzso is nonetheless an important zzso element and therefore a valuable therapeutic zzso In all zzso described zzso is the zzso zzso independent of external signals and provides efficient means of zzso for its associated zzso and protein zzso In zzso and zzso lines, zzso appears to be activated following binding to zzso and no longer requires zzso zzso zzso motifs for zzso Assessment of the different zzso of zzso zzso organization could help in selecting the appropriate combination of zzso zzso to eliminate a particular type of zzso zzso
