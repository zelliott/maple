zzso zzso zzso zzso belongs to the bone zzso zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are elevated in patients with advanced prostate zzso The effects of zzso on prostate cancer bone zzso are zzso 

In zzso effects of zzso on zzso differentiation and activity were analyzed with alkaline zzso and zzso zzso zzso numbers were counted zzso zzso effects on zzso expression were studied with Western zzso Human zzso prostate cancer cells were zzso zzso with a zzso zzso for mature zzso or with an empty zzso The in zzso growth characteristics of the characterized cells were studied with the zzso model of bone zzso zzso associated bone changes were viewed with X-rays, zzso and zzso Bone formation was zzso by measuring serum zzso 

zzso induced zzso differentiation and activity and zzso formation in zzso These effects were independent of zzso zzso which was promoted by zzso Both zzso and control tumors induced mixed zzso bone zzso but zzso increased the zzso component of zzso zzso formation at the zzso interface was significantly higher in the zzso tumors, whereas bone formation was significantly higher in the control zzso At zzso the mice bearing zzso tumors were significantly lighter with significantly smaller zzso 

zzso zzso zzso expression in various zzso zzso stimulates both zzso and zzso differentiation in zzso independently of zzso zzso zzso prostate cancer cells that grow in bone induce zzso formation and zzso
