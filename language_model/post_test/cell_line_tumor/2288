This study aimed to investigate the effects of zzso zzso Tang zzso on growth and zzso of zzso implanted tumors, zzso zzso and zzso tumors after surgical removal of primary colon tumor in zzso 

Three experimental models were built after surgical removal of primary colon tumor and the mice were randomly divided into three groups: primary tumor zzso zzso group, primary zzso zzso group and zzso zzso After zzso of the primary tumor and zzso treatment for 10 zzso levels of vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were examined by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso density zzso and cell proliferation of zzso were detected by zzso zzso zzso tumor cell zzso was detected by terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In the zzso implanted tumor model, the average volume of zzso of the zzso group was significantly lower than that of the zzso group ( zzso the zzso rate of zzso was zzso In the zzso zzso model, the average number of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso group was significantly lower than that of the zzso group ( zzso the zzso rate of zzso was zzso In the zzso tumor model, the average volume of zzso of the zzso group was significantly lower than that of the zzso zzso the zzso rate of zzso was zzso zzso was significantly inhibited by zzso and zzso expression of the zzso group was significantly lower than that of the zzso group ( zzso zzso zzso index of tumor of the zzso group was higher than that of the zzso group ( zzso zzso showed that the serum zzso level was significantly decreased and the serum zzso level was significantly increased in the zzso group compared with those in the zzso group ( zzso 

zzso of primary tumor in mice causes imbalance of zzso AS and zzso thus promoting zzso and zzso of zzso zzso can inhibit growth, zzso and cell proliferation of the zzso tumor and promote cell zzso after surgical removal of the primary zzso
