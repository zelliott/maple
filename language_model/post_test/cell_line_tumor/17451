zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso is an zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso This zzso protein regulates activities of zzso and possesses growth promoting effect in cell culture, zzso zzso and zzso effects in animal model systems in zzso It has been shown that this gene is zzso in cervical zzso The mechanism of zzso of zzso expression remains zzso We have examined whether zzso DNA zzso of the zzso island of the zzso gene is involved in its zzso during cervical zzso zzso DNA sequencing and MSP zzso showed zzso zzso of zzso zzso island in 17 of 36 zzso invasive cervical zzso and in 2 of 3 cervical cancer cell zzso zzso gene was mostly zzso in the zzso normal zzso adjacent to the tumors, whereas zzso zzso of this gene were found in 4 zzso Each tumor and each cell line DNA was characterized by unique zzso pattern, however a discrete region of zzso zzso island upstream to the zzso start site was densely zzso in all zzso DNA samples zzso The expression of zzso zzso can be restored in the cell lines, in which this discrete region of zzso zzso island is zzso by treatment with zzso agents, zzso and zzso Our data suggest that the zzso zzso of zzso favors the development of primary cervical zzso We describe for the first time the zzso zzso of zzso gene in human zzso
