zzso zzso T zzso compose a major zzso T cell subset in primates with broad zzso against tumor zzso zzso T cells are specifically activated by zzso zzso zzso zzso called zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso pathway, such as zzso zzso that zzso the zzso production of zzso increase zzso zzso T cell zzso zzso protocols exploiting zzso zzso molecules targeting human zzso T zzso have yielded promising, yet zzso signs of zzso efficacy and therefore need to be improved for next-generation zzso In this study, we used a model of zzso human tumor zzso in severely zzso mice to assess the zzso efficacy of systemic zzso treatments when combined with the adoptive transfer of human zzso T zzso We show that infusion of zzso T cells, 24 h after systemic zzso treatment, efficiently delays tumor growth in zzso zzso our results indicate efficient but transient in zzso zzso zzso of tumor cells to human zzso cell zzso zzso repeated and combined administrations of both zzso and zzso T cells yielded improved zzso responses in zzso Because zzso T cells show similar responsiveness toward both zzso and zzso tumors and are devoid of zzso these results provide zzso proof of concept for zzso zzso zzso combining zzso treatment and adoptive transfer of zzso human zzso T zzso
