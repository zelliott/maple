We have introduced the zzso zzso zzso into chicken zzso cell lines and examined its distribution in the neighborhood of the folate zzso zzso and zzso genes by using high-resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso incorporation of zzso zzso into the zzso gene is confined to its upstream regulatory region and is observed whether or not the gene is zzso zzso zzso is also observed over locus control regulatory elements in the absence of zzso of genes regulated by these zzso suggesting that gene activity per zzso is not necessarily required to replace zzso with zzso Other active genes display various behaviors, either incorporating zzso over both the coding region and upstream regulatory region or over upstream sequences zzso There is, however, no straightforward correlation between sites of zzso incorporation and regions of enrichment in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the case of zzso and zzso in which incorporation is confined to upstream regions, the presence of zzso zzso results in reduced zzso whereas zzso stimulates zzso This finding suggests that these zzso zzso can be active rather than passive participants in regulation of zzso
