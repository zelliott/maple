A zzso zzso hybrid system based on zzso 407 zzso was prepared to resolve the fast erosion and low loading capability of zzso drug of zzso gels for local zzso Different amounts of zzso zzso were applied to generate zzso networks with zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso gels, in which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were dispersed zzso The in zzso characteristics of zzso zzso gels zzso were performed by examining the zzso swelling ratio, mechanical property, and drug release, while the in zzso evaluation included tissue distribution and zzso efficacy through zzso administration in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso The results showed that zzso containing zzso zzso zzso possessed lower zzso higher swelling ratio, stronger mechanical property, and longer term drug release, in which the loading efficiency of zzso was enlarged by the introduction of zzso Moreover, zzso revealed a prolonged retention at tumor sites, lasting for 20 days, and a superior tumor zzso rate zzso with reduced toxicity compared with zzso , zzso and zzso loaded unmodified zzso gels zzso It can be concluded that zzso is a promising local delivery system for zzso drug in cancer therapy, providing both improved efficacy and relieved side zzso
