In the present study, the effects of zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso family, on two human multiple myeloma zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso were zzso In zzso zzso zzso showed much more potent zzso than conventional zzso agents to both cell zzso The zzso values of zzso for the zzso and zzso cells were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, much lower than those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso triggered zzso cells zzso by increasing the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was a critical zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso of the expression of zzso zzso and zzso by pharmacological zzso reversed the zzso zzso through decreasing the level of zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso zzso zzso was increased by zzso conversely, zzso inhibitor zzso enhanced zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The results demonstrated that zzso suppresses zzso cell growth through the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso with the potential to be developed as a zzso agent for zzso
