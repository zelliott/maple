The expression of zzso zzso is observed in approximately zzso of breast zzso A major product of the zzso reaction, zzso zzso is an inflammatory zzso that zzso in several biological zzso and influences invasion, zzso and zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso we determined the effect of zzso zzso on the metabolism and invasion of intact poorly differentiated zzso human breast cancer cells zzso expressing zzso short hairpin zzso Dynamic tracking of invasion, zzso zzso degradation and metabolism was performed with an zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso under controlled conditions of zzso temperature and zzso over the course of 48 zzso zzso cells exhibited a significant decrease in invasion relative to parental cells that was consistent with the reduced expression of zzso zzso zzso genes and an increased level of the tissue inhibitor of zzso We identified, for the first time, a role for zzso in zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso and established that zzso zzso expression is partly dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in a significant decrease in zzso and total zzso that was detected by zzso In addition, a significant increase in zzso as well as zzso zzso formation, was zzso zzso zzso transformed parental cell zzso patterns to those characteristic of less aggressive cancer zzso These new functional roles of zzso may identify new zzso and new targets for use in combination with zzso targeting to prevent invasion and zzso
