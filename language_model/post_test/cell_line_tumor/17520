zzso zzso gene transfer zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells expressing zzso zzso but fails in cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso express varied levels of zzso yet zzso high levels of zzso zzso Because the mechanism behind the differential zzso response to zzso infection remains zzso we examined how the zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso infection did not alter the levels of zzso zzso in either zzso or zzso zzso cell zzso In contrast, zzso infection led to an approximately zzso increase in zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso cell lines but not in their zzso zzso counterparts, as assessed in an zzso protection zzso zzso zzso induction appeared to be regulated at the zzso level because zzso infection resulted in up to a zzso increase in zzso promoter reporter zzso zzso flow zzso analysis revealed a zzso to zzso increase in surface zzso expression following zzso infection in zzso cell zzso Use of the protein transport inhibitor zzso A significantly inhibited zzso surface zzso zzso but only partially inhibited zzso in zzso cell zzso These results suggest that zzso regulates zzso expression at the zzso level and through protein trafficking in zzso cell zzso zzso activity zzso demonstrated that induction of zzso activity following zzso infection correlated with increases in zzso zzso zzso cells with a zzso inhibitor zzso prior to zzso infection inhibited zzso activity and zzso Together, our results suggest that regulation of the zzso zzso is partly responsible for zzso zzso in zzso cells, which depends on the zzso status of the involved zzso Additionally, the inability of zzso to activate the zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso with their zzso zzso Further zzso of the nature of this resistance could ultimately augment the efficacy of zzso gene zzso
