zzso zzso inhibitor type 1 zzso has been shown to be an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease, zzso zzso and cerebrovascular zzso Previous studies on variations in plasma zzso levels and associations between zzso levels and zzso zzso have suggested that zzso expression maybe regulated in a zzso manner by insulin, zzso very zzso zzso and zzso We investigated whether zzso zzso of the zzso gene also is regulated in a zzso zzso zzso zzso chain zzso fragments containing a zzso zzso of the zzso gene promoter were zzso into the zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso The zzso of zzso or zzso and zzso as an internal control were zzso zzso into human zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso employed a zzso from positions zzso to zzso zzso zzso or from zzso to zzso zzso zzso labeled with zzso zzso zzso with zzso 32 in the gamma position and used nuclear extracts of zzso zzso Analysis of zzso produced by zzso containing the zzso zzso or zzso zzso showed similar zzso increases in zzso activity in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared with the zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso using the zzso containing the zzso or zzso zzso site in the zzso zzso revealed no difference in the binding of nuclear zzso Our in zzso zzso of zzso zzso suggests no difference in the zzso activities of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
