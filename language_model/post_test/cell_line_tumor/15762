zzso of the zzso zzso expressed on zzso zzso zzso with zzso on zzso tumor cells is required to trigger polarized zzso of zzso zzso in zzso that elicit tumor cell zzso In this study, we investigated the functional and signaling properties of zzso and its individual contribution to zzso zzso zzso Our results indicated that the binding of zzso on zzso zzso to immobilized zzso zzso is sufficient to induce the polarization of zzso zzso whereas the zzso of zzso zzso also requires the zzso of the zzso zzso Moreover, minimal zzso triggering promotes the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blocks zzso zzso decreasing zzso zzso zzso Thus, our results emphasize a unique zzso role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso by providing signals that promote zzso zzso functions needed to specifically target and lyse cancer zzso
