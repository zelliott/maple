We have identified a zzso zzso zzso of zzso 18, breast zzso zzso zzso within a frequent zzso region of zzso zzso as a breast cancer tumor zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso protein with six fingers of the zzso type zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso has the potential to act as zzso zzso zzso is expressed in a number of normal zzso including zzso zzso cells although the level of expression is quite zzso In breast cancer cell lines and the majority of primary breast tumors, zzso zzso is significantly zzso A 160 zzso region within the promoter of the zzso gene is zzso in about zzso of the breast cancer samples and in the majority of breast cancer cell zzso The strong correlation between zzso promoter zzso and loss of zzso expression in tumor cells suggests that this zzso mechanism is responsible for zzso zzso We further show that zzso zzso expression in zzso breast cancer cells strongly zzso colony formation in soft zzso and the formation of tumors in a zzso mouse zzso
