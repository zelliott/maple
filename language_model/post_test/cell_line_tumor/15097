The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are inactive zzso that require zzso metabolism for zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the most important zzso in this process zzso both zzso and zzso to different zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, with different suggested pharmacological and zzso zzso While zzso is a potent inhibitor of de zzso zzso synthesis zzso and significantly contributes to the zzso effects of zzso zzso does not add much to the effects of zzso and the zzso of zzso seems to be more dependent on incorporation of zzso zzso zzso into DNA rather than zzso of zzso In order to investigate the role of zzso in metabolism and thus, zzso effects of zzso and zzso we knocked down the expression of the gene zzso the zzso zzso using specifically designed small interference zzso zzso in human zzso leukemia zzso The zzso was confirmed at zzso zzso and zzso function zzso zzso was determined using zzso V and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results showed a zzso increase in sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso zzso after treatment with zzso zzso as compared to cells zzso with zzso zzso while the sensitivity of the cells toward zzso was not affected significantly by zzso of the zzso zzso This differential contribution of the zzso zzso to the zzso of the two zzso is probably due to its role in formation of the zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso while in case of zzso zzso by zzso substantially zzso the zzso
