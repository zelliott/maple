zzso the inherent zzso and repair capacity of canine transitional cell zzso zzso can aid in zzso radiation protocols to treat this zzso The objective of this study was to evaluate the parameters surviving fraction at 2 zzso zzso ), zzso ratio and capacity for zzso damage repair zzso in response to zzso zzso and zzso studies were performed using the zzso zzso The mean zzso for three established zzso cell lines was high at zzso All the three cell lines exhibited a low to moderate zzso ratio, with the mean being zzso Two cell lines exhibited statistically increased survival at 4 and 24 h in the zzso zzso Overall, our results indicate that the cell lines are moderately zzso have a high repair capacity and behave similarly to a zzso normal zzso These findings indicate that the radiation protocols utilizing higher doses with less zzso may be more effective for treating zzso
