zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso targets the putative tumor zzso protein zzso zzso early zzso zzso to zzso zzso degradation zzso et zzso zzso 2001; zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso degradation is implicated in zzso melanoma zzso In a system using zzso zzso transgenic mice and melanoma cells in culture termed zzso cells isolated from zzso zzso mice zzso et zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso melanoma genesis and melanoma maintenance is strictly dependent upon expression of zzso We found that zzso protein was not expressed during melanoma genesis but was strongly expressed in zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, zzso protein expression was zzso regulated by zzso The expression of zzso zzso was not affected by zzso zzso suggesting that zzso regulation was zzso Indeed, pharmacological zzso of Ras activity or the zzso abolished the degradation of zzso caused by zzso expression indicating that zzso zzso regulates the expression of zzso protein by targeting zzso to zzso zzso By engineering clones of zzso melanoma cells zzso zzso with zzso we were able to determine the prerequisite for zzso zzso The zzso of zzso levels of zzso showed a significant decrease in cell growth, as well as zzso of zzso cell growth and zzso in nude zzso zzso was found to efficiently repress the expression of zzso D1 in zzso cells due to the binding of zzso to the zzso in the zzso D1 zzso Taken together, we zzso that zzso protein might be targeted to degradation in human tumors where Ras is zzso
