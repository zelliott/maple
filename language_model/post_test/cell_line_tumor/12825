The zzso zzso cell polarity zzso signaling zzso is essential for polarized cell migration and zzso zzso zzso and its binding protein zzso mediate zzso zzso in this zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso exchange factor zzso family, was shown to play a role in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, it has remained unknown which zzso of a zzso family are involved in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Here we identified zzso and zzso (also called zzso as the zzso responsible for zzso zzso zzso in zzso mouse zzso zzso We screened for zzso zzso zzso zzso that are capable of suppressing zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells and found that zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso suppressed zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also inhibited zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso proteins were capable of binding to zzso and zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso and zzso are critically involved in zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso
