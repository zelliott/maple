zzso zzso zzso is a synthetic zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso revealed the highest zzso effect among tested synthetic zzso zzso In this study we focused on zzso the zzso mechanism of zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso zzso reduced zzso cell viability with an zzso value of zzso In contrast to zzso the tested compound induced cell death by zzso zzso and the zzso zzso More specifically, we found that zzso was able to activate the zzso zzso pathway, which was proven by observation of zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso in Western zzso zzso An increase in the ratio of zzso protein levels was also zzso Moreover, zzso triggered zzso protein zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso This observed compound activity was modulated by zzso protein zzso and zzso signaling zzso Together, these data suggest that zzso a synthetic zzso acid zzso which activates dual cell death zzso could be a potential and novel zzso zzso
