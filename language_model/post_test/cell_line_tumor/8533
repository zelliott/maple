Early prediction of zzso breast cancer is important for improvement of prognosis and survival zzso The present study aimed to identify zzso protein zzso for detection of invasive breast zzso To this end, we performed a comparative zzso analysis by a combination of zzso and zzso zzso analysis of zzso media from invasive zzso zzso human breast zzso cells and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We identified a list of 25 proteins that were strongly detected in media of zzso zzso and focused on zzso II, which was shown to be involved in cell zzso zzso zzso human breast zzso cells, zzso and zzso showed increased levels of zzso II in media, demonstrating that zzso of zzso II correlated well with the invasive zzso of zzso We demonstrated a crucial role of zzso II in breast cell zzso and zzso zzso reorganization required for zzso zzso zzso II levels in the plasma samples and breast cancer zzso of breast cancer patients were significantly higher than those of normal groups, providing a clinical relevance to our in zzso zzso Taken together, we identified zzso II as a novel zzso zzso candidate for invasive breast cancer, especially zzso zzso breast zzso
