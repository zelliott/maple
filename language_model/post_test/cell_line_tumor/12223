Cell cycle progression is dependent on zzso iron level and zzso lead to iron depletion and decrease cell zzso This zzso effect can be inhibited by zzso zzso In this work, we present the synthesis of new synthetic zzso zzso bearing two zzso acid, zzso groups or zzso function at the lower zzso designed as potential iron zzso The synthesis only afforded zzso in the cone zzso We report their effect on cell zzso in comparison with the new oral zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of these new compounds was studied in the rat zzso cell line zzso by measuring zzso zzso zzso zzso Their zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso zzso results indicated that among all tested compounds, zzso 2 which is not zzso in zzso cells exhibits interesting zzso zzso This effect, independent on iron zzso remains to be further zzso Moreover, it also shows that new zzso zzso could open the way to new valuable medicinal chemistry zzso
