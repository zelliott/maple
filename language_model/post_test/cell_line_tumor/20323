zzso zzso of cells and zzso structures labeled with fluorescent proteins is the state-of-the-art technology for zzso imaging studies in zzso and living zzso zzso analysis of separate cell populations or signaling events by zzso zzso requires optimal pairing of zzso zzso zzso with zzso distinct fluorescent zzso While prior studies have analyzed two zzso zzso properties of isolated fluorescent zzso there is limited information about two zzso zzso and zzso zzso profiles of fluorescent proteins expressed in living cells and intact zzso zzso zzso was used to analyze zzso zzso of multiple blue, green, and red fluorescent proteins in cultured cells and zzso tumor zzso of human breast cancer zzso It is shown that commonly used orange and red fluorescent proteins are excited efficiently by 750 to 760 zzso laser light in living cells, enabling dual color imaging studies with blue or zzso proteins without changing zzso zzso It is also shown that small incremental changes in zzso wavelength significantly affect zzso zzso from fluorescent zzso which can be used to zzso zzso imaging using a single laser zzso These data will direct optimal selection of fluorescent proteins for zzso two zzso zzso
