The naturally occurring zzso zzso has been associated with the beneficial effects of red wine consumption on cardiovascular disease and shown to inhibit zzso in animal zzso To determine if zzso affects the expression of genes that control zzso zzso in human zzso we measured expression changes in the zzso pathway, crucial to cholesterol zzso and in genes that mediate zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso induced zzso at zzso and protein zzso Increased recruitment of zzso zzso II to the zzso promoter suggested that zzso was at least partly zzso by zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso in human zzso zzso together with elevated zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso the expression of the zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso The ability of zzso to zzso expression of the genes involved in zzso zzso and zzso suggests that zzso can potentially limit cholesterol zzso in human zzso
