Purpose zzso a core zzso clock zzso has tumor zzso properties and is zzso or down regulated in human breast zzso We have manipulated the expression of this gene in zzso and in zzso to more fully understand how the zzso clock gene product affects cancer zzso zzso We used zzso and zzso to down regulate zzso expression in zzso and in zzso and measured cancer cell zzso tumor growth rate and several molecular pathways relevant to cancer growth and their zzso zzso All statistical tests were zzso zzso Down regulation of functional zzso gene expression increases zzso D and zzso E levels and doubles in zzso breast cancer cell proliferation zzso zzso zzso Down regulation of zzso also zzso in zzso tumor growth and doubles the daily zzso of the tumor growth rhythm zzso zzso zzso zzso The clock gene zzso exerts its tumor zzso function in a zzso time dependent zzso zzso zzso and perhaps other clock genes represent a new class of potential therapeutic targets whose manipulation will zzso cancer growth and cancer cell zzso
