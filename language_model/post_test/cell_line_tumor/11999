zzso Although there is increasing evidence showing that zzso acid might be a potential zzso agent, the mechanisms involved in its action are zzso zzso In the present study, we showed that zzso acid zzso inhibited cellular growth in several colon cancer cell zzso Cell cycle analysis by flow zzso showed that cells were arrested at the zzso phase after zzso zzso zzso Further analysis showed that zzso D1 and zzso zzso 2 and 4 and zzso zzso were decreased in zzso cells while zzso expression was zzso zzso The growth zzso effect of zzso was dependent on zzso but not zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso to the zzso effect of zzso suggesting that zzso may have protected cells against zzso by inducing a zzso zzso In conclusion, we have demonstrated that zzso inhibited cellular growth in colon cancer zzso These findings may have implications to the use of zzso acids as potential zzso agents in colon zzso
