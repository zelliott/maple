The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to suppress the growth of human breast cancer zzso In this article, we examined the ability of zzso to inhibit the proliferation of human breast cancer cell zzso Cell cycle regulators and zzso cell death were determined using Western zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment produced significant increases in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso cells, the expression of zzso and zzso was decreased in a zzso manner after zzso zzso However, zzso expression was not changed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly induced expression of zzso and zzso zzso levels of cell cycle regulator proteins zzso zzso 4 and zzso zzso 2) were markedly decreased by zzso in zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso Cell cycle analysis indicated that zzso increased the proportion of cells in the zzso phase and decreased the proportion of cells in the S phase in zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso populations was observed in zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso treatment resulted in the induction of zzso cell death which was confirmed by zzso zzso Additionally, zzso significantly increased the zzso ratio in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso proliferation of zzso zzso breast cancer cells by altering the expression of cell cycle regulator proteins and inducing zzso cell zzso These distinctive zzso effects of zzso on the zzso of cell cycle arrest and zzso may be associated with zzso zzso zzso
