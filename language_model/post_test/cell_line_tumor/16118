zzso highly zzso during evolution, has been reported to play a key role in stem cell zzso in several different zzso As one of the four human zzso of the zzso family, zzso has been demonstrated to be significantly zzso in some human zzso However, the relationship between zzso and human zzso is zzso In this study, we investigated the clinical significance of zzso in human zzso zzso was found to be specifically expressed in the majority of zzso zzso and the expression was greatly increased with the ascending of tumor zzso In addition, it was statistically significant that the patients with high zzso positive had poorer outcome than the patients with low zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso may be a critical factor in zzso progression and could be used as a potential molecular marker for pathological diagnosis and prognosis evaluation for zzso zzso
