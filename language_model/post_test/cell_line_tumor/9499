Development of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with high DNA content suitable for in zzso intravenous administration and targeted gene zzso 

zzso DNA was condensed using zzso ethanol and packaged into neutral zzso targeted to the mouse zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso clones zzso and zzso attached to their zzso zzso zzso zzso size was measured by zzso light zzso The targeting capacity of the zzso was determined by zzso of mouse zzso zzso 2A zzso cells with zzso complexes zzso with either zzso or zzso zzso 

DNA zzso and zzso zzso efficiencies averaged 71 zzso zzso and 69 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No zzso in mean particle size zzso 100 zzso or DNA leakage were found after 48 h storage in a zzso zzso and the in zzso terminal zzso reached zzso zzso indicating that the zzso zzso was zzso zzso of free zzso zzso prevented zzso of zzso cells with zzso complexes zzso with either zzso or zzso zzso confirming that the zzso was zzso zzso 

The present data suggest that our new zzso zzso combines molecular features required for targeted gene therapy including high DNA zzso efficiencies and zzso transient zzso zzso
