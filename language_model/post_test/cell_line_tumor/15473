To study the effects of zzso zzso on zzso resistance in a mouse model of zzso zzso 

zzso resistant zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were produced in zzso by continuous exposure to increasing doses of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Cell toxicity was measured using the zzso zzso zzso zzso Survival time was calculated for zzso mice that received zzso injections of zzso cells followed by treatment with zzso zzso or zzso in combination with zzso for 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to measure the activity of zzso zzso zzso activity in plasma zzso 

The zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso significantly enhanced the zzso of the zzso regimen in zzso resistant zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso and 5 zzso combined with zzso significantly increased survival time in zzso mice by zzso and zzso respectively, compared with zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso 

The combined use of zzso zzso and the zzso regimen might be a novel strategy for overcoming the zzso resistance often observed in zzso zzso
