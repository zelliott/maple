The aim of this study was to clarify the zzso and zzso activity of Thai zzso zzso extract for application as a zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso ) grown in zzso Province, zzso was extracted by using zzso zzso or zzso The amount of zzso a major component of zzso zzso zzso was determined by using the zzso zzso The zzso content found in zzso extract was zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas that in methanol extract was zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso extract was then evaluated for zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso activity was tested in zzso by monitoring the zzso of the extract against the formation of zzso by zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso activity of the extract was in a zzso zzso The obtained zzso value was zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso acid, a well-known zzso zzso provided an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso melanoma cells zzso zzso zzso were then used for determination of the zzso activity of the zzso comparing it to zzso zzso acid, and zzso zzso The amount of zzso produced by the cells was monitored by measuring an zzso at zzso zzso The obtained results indicated that zzso zzso extract at a concentration of 2 to 25 zzso was able to decrease the zzso production of the zzso zzso zzso The obtained zzso also confirmed that the extract did not change the cell zzso but reduced the zzso content by zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso at a concentration of zzso zzso caused changes in cell zzso Additionally, the extract exhibited zzso activity in a zzso manner at an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso according to zzso zzso The obtained results indicated that the zzso extract of zzso zzso 's zzso has the potential of acting as a zzso agent for application in zzso
