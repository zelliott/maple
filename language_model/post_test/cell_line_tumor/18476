The zzso factor 1 zzso zzso complex is regulated by cellular oxygen levels and growth zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso has been shown to regulate zzso activity in response to zzso signals and growth zzso We assessed whether the zzso zzso a direct target of zzso could regulate zzso expression and zzso activity under zzso zzso We found that growth factor zzso zzso of zzso or loss of zzso resulted in enhanced expression of both zzso and zzso Growth zzso induction of zzso was zzso by transient expression of a dominant negative form of zzso or by treatment with zzso zzso expression of zzso led to increased expression of zzso zzso and zzso experiments revealed that zzso did not significantly affect the zzso of zzso Growth zzso zzso and zzso proteins were localized to the nucleus, and induction of both proteins was observed in both zzso and zzso zzso cells to comparable zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso expression was observed in zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso but was significantly impaired in zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating a requirement for zzso in this zzso Finally, we showed that zzso at zzso in zzso contributed in part to growth zzso induction of zzso Our study has important implications for the role of the zzso zzso in tumor progression and zzso
