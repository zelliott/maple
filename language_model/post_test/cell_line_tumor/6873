zzso stress has been suggested to be an important zzso of zzso cell death in Parkinson's disease zzso We investigated the zzso potential of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the rat zzso zzso zzso following zzso gene zzso Human zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso expressing either human zzso zzso or zzso zzso before exposure to 1 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso A strong zzso effect of zzso gene transfer was observed in the zzso cells exposed to zzso compared with zzso Adult rats were then given unilateral injections of either zzso or zzso into the zzso and zzso was administered 8 days later at the same zzso Strong zzso expression was detected in the zzso zzso zzso a consequence of retrograde zzso transport of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso behavior of the rats was markedly lower in zzso rats than in control zzso Also, behavioral recovery significantly correlated with the number of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of the treated zzso These results are consistent with zzso stress contributing to the zzso zzso neurodegenerative zzso They also indicate that zzso gene transfer into the zzso system may be a potential zzso strategy for treating zzso
