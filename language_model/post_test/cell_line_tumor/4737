zzso are small zzso zzso molecules that control expression of target zzso Our previous studies show that zzso is zzso in tumor zzso compared with the matched normal zzso Moreover, suppression of zzso by zzso zzso zzso tumor cell growth both in zzso and in zzso However, it remains largely unclear as to how zzso affects tumor growth, because our understanding of zzso targets is zzso In this study, we performed two-dimensional differentiation zzso zzso of tumors treated with zzso and identified the tumor zzso zzso 1 zzso as a potential zzso zzso In agreement with this, there is a putative zzso binding site at the zzso region zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thus, we cloned the zzso of zzso into a zzso reporter and found that although zzso zzso the zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso Moreover, deletion of the zzso binding site abolished the effect of zzso on the zzso activity, suggesting that this zzso binding site is zzso Western zzso with the cloned zzso plus the zzso indicated that zzso protein level was also regulated by zzso whereas real-time quantitative reverse zzso revealed no difference at the zzso level, suggesting zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso in breast cancer zzso cells suppressed zzso zzso Thus, zzso of zzso by zzso may explain, at least in part, why suppression of zzso can inhibit tumor growth, further supporting the notion that zzso functions as an zzso
