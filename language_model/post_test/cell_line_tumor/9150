zzso is a key zzso in zzso zzso production required for the production of zzso through the conversion of serum zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso There have been, however, controversies regarding the zzso zzso of zzso in human breast zzso zzso zzso we have first examined the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in 19 breast zzso using laser capture zzso reverse zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and protein were detected in both zzso zzso and zzso cells in breast zzso zzso zzso zzso expression profiling and zzso zzso in addition to quantitative zzso studies, showed a significant positive correlation between zzso and zzso zzso alpha zzso expression in isolated zzso zzso We further examined an interaction between zzso cells isolated from human breast zzso zzso and breast zzso cell lines using a zzso system to study the biological characteristic of zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity and zzso zzso type 1 zzso in breast zzso cell lines, including zzso and zzso cells, were zzso in the presence of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso The results from steroid conversion zzso were also consistent with the findings zzso The results of our study also showed that zzso zzso were more effective in zzso zzso induced by zzso in zzso than that in zzso zzso The examination of the zzso of zzso and its regulation, including the interactions existing between different cell types in human breast zzso zzso may provide important information as to achieving better clinical response to zzso zzso in breast cancer zzso
