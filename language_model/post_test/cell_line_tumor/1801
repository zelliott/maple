The use of zzso zzso systems has long been a valuable screening tool for the discovery of small zzso zzso against zzso C zzso While zzso zzso zzso systems have been widely used in stable systems, use in transient zzso has been hampered by low zzso Here we describe the generation of a more robust zzso zzso zzso zzso through the introduction of two fitness zzso zzso and zzso for use in transient zzso While these zzso significantly improved the signal to noise ratio, leading to more robust data, they have no effect on the potency of tool compounds against various targets of zzso thereby making this new system a powerful tool for screening of compounds against the zzso zzso zzso
