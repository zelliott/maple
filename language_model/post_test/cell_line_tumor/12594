zzso zzso zzso is an aggressive zzso lymphoma, with a characteristic clinical zzso zzso and zzso Over the past years, the typical zzso zzso and its zzso have been considered the molecular hallmark of this zzso However, zzso cases with no zzso zzso zzso have been zzso zzso these cases express zzso at levels comparable with cases carrying the zzso In normal cells zzso expression is tightly regulated through a complex feedback loop zzso In cancer, zzso is often zzso commonly due to zzso zzso It has recently emerged that this phenomenon may rely on an zzso of zzso regulation zzso by zzso zzso whose functional zzso are associated with zzso zzso It is also emerging that zzso zzso zzso zzso revealing an intriguing zzso between zzso and zzso 

Here, we investigated the expression of zzso possibly regulated by zzso in zzso cases positive or negative for the zzso A common trend of zzso zzso with the exception of zzso was observed in all of the zzso zzso zzso of this zzso seems to specifically identify a particular subset of zzso cases, lacking zzso zzso Here, we provided evidence that zzso gene is heavily zzso in those zzso Finally, we showed that zzso is able to zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso this study identifies zzso as potentially relevant for zzso transformation in zzso cases with no zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso may therefore be useful as a diagnostic zzso suggesting it as a promising novel candidate for tumor cell zzso
