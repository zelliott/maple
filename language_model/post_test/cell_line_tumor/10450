The resistance of pigmented human zzso over their zzso counterparts to a number of therapies has suggested that the presence of zzso zzso plays a role in rendering these cells less susceptible to cell death, probably through the ability of this zzso to act as an zzso zzso thus zzso zzso zzso zzso oxygen zzso zzso zzso zzso was recently suggested as an attractive, zzso therapy zzso to its cellular specificity and limited side zzso In the present study, we propose that first zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso inhibitor such as zzso zzso increases their zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (University of Cape Town melanoma cell line zzso and zzso zzso zzso were first characterized with respect to their zzso activities and zzso quantities and then treated with a zzso inhibitor for 48 zzso Cell viability zzso after treatment with 3 zzso zzso showed a significant increase in cell death in zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso that returned to the level of zzso melanoma cells on removing the zzso zzso The present study supports the hypothesis that combining the zzso of zzso with zzso should be explored as a valid therapeutic target for the management of advanced zzso
