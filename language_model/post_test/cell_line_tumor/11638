The red blood cell related traits are highly zzso but their zzso are poorly zzso Only zzso of the total observed zzso is explained by the genetic zzso found to date, suggesting that additional zzso should be searched using approaches alternative to large zzso zzso zzso zzso Wide Association zzso for red blood cell traits in a founder population cohort from Northern Italy identified a new locus for mean zzso zzso concentration zzso in the zzso zzso The association was zzso in two zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso that zzso in core promoter recognition complex, and is involved in zzso and mouse zzso We show here that zzso is required for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso one of the proteins that link the plasma membrane to the zzso zzso zzso in zzso are responsible for zzso zzso a zzso disorder of zzso as well as for the normal zzso zzso Based on our results, we propose that zzso is required for normal zzso in human and that it might have a role in controlling the ratio between zzso zzso and cell volume and in the dynamics of zzso maturation in healthy zzso Finally, zzso represents a potential candidate or a modifier gene for disorders of red cell zzso
