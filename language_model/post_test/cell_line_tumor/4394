Experimental and zzso evidence suggests that zzso of proteins involved in iron metabolism plays a critical role in zzso The mechanisms by which cancer cells alter zzso iron regulation are just beginning to be zzso Here, we demonstrate that iron regulatory protein 2 zzso plays a key role in iron zzso in breast zzso Although both zzso and zzso are zzso in breast cancer, the zzso of zzso but not zzso is associated with decreased zzso H and increased zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso human breast cancer cells increases zzso H expression and decreases zzso zzso resulting in a decrease in the zzso iron zzso Further, zzso zzso reduces growth of zzso cells in the mouse zzso fat zzso Gene expression zzso profiles of patients with breast cancer demonstrate that increased zzso expression is associated with high-grade zzso Increased zzso expression is observed in zzso A, zzso B, and zzso breast cancer zzso but not in breast tumors of the zzso molecular zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso is an early zzso point underlying altered iron metabolism in breast cancer and may contribute to poor outcome of some patients with breast zzso
