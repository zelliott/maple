zzso zzso dynamics may be a useful strategy for targeting prostate cancer cells, because they generally have short zzso Because a plateau has been reached in the development of zzso treatments for prostate cancer, this study was undertaken to evaluate the relative efficacy of targeting zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells were developed and their underlying zzso responses were zzso zzso dynamics and the effects of targeting zzso with sodium zzso zzso (an agent undergoing early clinical zzso including combinations with zzso and zzso were evaluated in parental and drug-resistant zzso The studies were extended to zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso mechanisms of resistance were recruited within the same population of zzso cells with selection for drug zzso zzso zzso cells have a small side population zzso zzso The SP fraction increased with increasing drug resistance, which was correlated with enhanced expression of zzso but not breast cancer resistance zzso zzso dynamics remained unchanged in zzso cells, which retained sensitivity to zzso Furthermore, zzso targeted SP and zzso zzso inducing DNA damage signaling in both zzso zzso induced zzso zzso decreased zzso gene zzso and was highly synergistic with the zzso in zzso and drug-resistant zzso zzso This zzso extended to zzso and zzso zzso cells under zzso and zzso zzso These studies demonstrate that zzso plus zzso and zzso plus zzso represent highly synergistic drug combinations that should be explored further in the different disease states of prostate zzso
