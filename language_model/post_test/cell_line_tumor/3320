zzso zzso occurs in a number of disease states, but its molecular basis is poorly zzso To determine which genes are zzso in cells contained within the zzso zzso of pancreatic zzso and chronic zzso we undertook genetic profiling of zzso tissue samples of pancreatic zzso chronic zzso normal zzso and pancreatic cancer cell zzso We observed that samples of both pancreatic zzso and chronic zzso showed elevated expression of many shared genes compared with the normal zzso We hypothesized that these common genes likely important in zzso production and/or function could be identified using a strategy that involved comparisons between pancreatic zzso chronic zzso normal zzso and pancreatic cancer cell zzso 

We performed zzso zzso analysis of zzso different genes expressed in 10 samples of pancreatic zzso 5 samples of normal zzso 5 samples of chronic zzso and 7 pancreatic cancer cell zzso zzso findings were validated with zzso and zzso was used to verify protein zzso to the zzso compartment of both pancreatic cancer and chronic zzso 

We employed a zzso comparison zzso genes expressed in the normal zzso and pancreatic cancer cell lines were selectively eliminated from those expressed in common by pancreatic zzso and chronic zzso This strategy identified 107 genes predicted to be expressed within cells of the zzso compartment of both pancreatic zzso and chronic zzso 

These genes are likely important factors in zzso signaling in pancreatic zzso and may serve as diagnostic or therapeutic zzso
