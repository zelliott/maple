The zzso activity of zzso responsible for processing full length zzso zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso The zzso and duration of zzso activity can be regulated at various points in the pathway, but there has been no report regarding regulation of the zzso interaction, despite its zzso In the present study, we found that the zzso interaction is regulated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are physically zzso and this association is responsible for zzso processing and zzso We also found that growth factor zzso an zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso induce the zzso interaction zzso by zzso Our results support three new and provocative zzso zzso The association between zzso and zzso is a zzso process; zzso zzso growth factor signals regulate this interaction, which is zzso by zzso zzso There is zzso between the plasma growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was confirmed in zzso tumor zzso and in the zzso of pancreatic cancer zzso Our findings have implications for the mechanism by which the zzso and growth factor zzso signaling pathways regulate zzso and cancer cell zzso
