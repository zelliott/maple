Although zzso is an essential trace element for humans, the metal is zzso and zzso at higher zzso Treatment of cells with zzso generates DNA strand breaks and zzso zzso zzso However, the basis for these effects is not well zzso Since the toxic events induced by zzso resemble those of zzso II zzso the effect of the metal on human zzso zzso was zzso The level of zzso DNA zzso increased zzso when zzso replaced zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at all DNA sites observed in the presence of zzso and the zzso cut DNA at several zzso zzso The increased level of DNA zzso in the presence of zzso was partially due to a decrease in the rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso retained many of its zzso properties in reactions that included zzso including sensitivity to the zzso drug zzso and the ability to relax and zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso in the presence of zzso in zzso systems and in human zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso is a zzso II poison in zzso and in cultured cells and suggest that at least some of the zzso effects of the metal are zzso through zzso zzso
