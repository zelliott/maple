zzso and efficient gene transfer into the nucleus would facilitate zzso gene zzso One promising method of zzso gene delivery is to apply penetration zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso may have promise as zzso vehicles in improving gene transfer zzso In this study, the zzso effects of zzso and zzso were evaluated using zzso zzso Gene delivery efficiency in a human breast cancer cell line zzso was investigated by quantitative zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso enhanced the efficiency of zzso gene delivery in zzso zzso zzso zzso results showed that growth hormone zzso zzso expression in the zzso and zzso treatment groups was zzso higher compared to that in the zzso group, while in the zzso and zzso treatment groups, a zzso increase in zzso zzso expression was zzso Both zzso and zzso treatments increased green fluorescent protein zzso expression efficiency as shown by zzso zzso zzso Compared to the zzso group, the number of positive cells in the zzso and zzso treatment groups was significantly increased by zzso Furthermore, cell cycle analysis demonstrated that there were significant differences among the zzso group, the zzso group and the normal group, which implied different effects of zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, both zzso and harmless zzso zzso and zzso zzso treatments improve gene transfer efficiency, while zzso treatment may be the most effective protocol in increasing zzso expression zzso
