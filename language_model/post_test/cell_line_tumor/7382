The zzso growth factor system has been associated to prognosis in patients with zzso cancer based mainly on the expression of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso and their zzso zzso Since limited information exists concerning the expression of other parts of the zzso system, we examined the expression of the receptors zzso and zzso and their zzso zzso the zzso zzso in zzso cancer zzso zzso from zzso cancer zzso were obtained from 88 patients followed for a median of 23 months zzso zzso zzso The zzso content of four zzso and their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two receptors zzso and zzso was zzso by real-time zzso A significantly lower zzso expression level of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso ( zzso was observed in zzso zzso zzso as compared to superficial zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso correlated strongly to overall survival zzso increased expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was also associated with better zzso Interestingly, patients with zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso together with their stimulating zzso zzso showed even better survival than for zzso or zzso zzso Our results together with previous data suggest a dual face for the zzso zzso While it is well established that an increased zzso through zzso and zzso is related to a poor zzso our data suggest that zzso through zzso and zzso is related to a zzso outcome in zzso cancer zzso
