zzso zzso such as DNA zzso play key roles in zzso regulation of gene zzso More recently, global DNA zzso levels have been documented to be altered in several diseases, including cancer, and as the result of exposure to environmental zzso Based on the potential use of global DNA zzso status as a zzso of disease status and exposure to environmental zzso we sought to develop a zzso sensitive, and precise zzso method for the quantitative measurement of global DNA zzso status using zzso liquid zzso with detection by zzso trap tandem mass zzso Using a zzso zzso column, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were resolved in less than 1 zzso with detection limits of zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso The accuracy of detection was zzso or higher, and the day-to-day zzso of variation was found to be zzso The method was validated by zzso of global DNA zzso status following treatment of cells with the DNA zzso inhibitor zzso which reduced DNA zzso from zzso in control cells to zzso in treated zzso The sensitivity and high zzso of this method zzso it suitable for large-scale analysis of zzso and clinical DNA zzso
