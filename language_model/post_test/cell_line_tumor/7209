To investigate the role of zzso D zzso in zzso zzso the zzso or the zzso inactive forms of zzso or zzso were zzso zzso in zzso mast zzso zzso stimulation resulted in the zzso of both zzso and zzso However, zzso was the source of most of the zzso zzso zzso There was enhanced zzso zzso only in cells that zzso the zzso inactive zzso This zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso of early signaling molecules such as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which resulted in faster release of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates signals upstream of the zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso required zzso and was downstream of the zzso suggesting that zzso zzso activity rather than that activated by cell stimulation controlled these early signaling zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso zzso acid formation in zzso cells, which was accompanied by an increase in zzso within the zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso activity by regulating zzso acid formation controls the early signals initiated by zzso zzso that lead to mast cell zzso
