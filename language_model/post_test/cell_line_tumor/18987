Growth factors have become an important component for tissue engineering and zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso and transforming growth zzso zzso 1) in particular have great significance in cartilage tissue zzso Here, we describe sequential release of zzso and zzso 1 from modular designed zzso zzso zzso zzso Growth factors were zzso in zzso zzso using spontaneous zzso and in zzso release zzso was characterized by zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso decreased the initial burst from zzso to zzso while using zzso zzso rather than capped decreased the initial burst of zzso 1 from zzso to zzso upon zzso The zzso of released zzso and zzso 1 was determined using zzso proliferation zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Both growth factors were released for up to 70 days in zzso zzso zzso were zzso by fusing zzso zzso and zzso 1 zzso with zzso zzso Three scaffolds with tailored release zzso were zzso zzso and zzso 1 released zzso zzso 1 with zzso released zzso after 10 days, and zzso with zzso 1 released zzso after 7 zzso zzso swelling and degradation were zzso indicating a peak swelling ratio of 4 after 7 days of incubation and showing 50% mass loss after 28 days, both consistent with scaffold release zzso The ability of these scaffolds to release zzso and zzso 1 zzso makes them very useful for cartilage tissue engineering zzso
