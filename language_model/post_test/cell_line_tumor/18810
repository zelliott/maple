Here, we have used a zzso of green fluorescent protein zzso and the zzso zzso zzso to study retrograde movement of a model soluble zzso zzso protein in zzso and zzso of cultured zzso zzso It is known that in zzso cells, the zzso moves from zzso to the nucleus in a zzso manner by a zzso zzso zzso When rapid movement is inhibited by zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of the protein zzso zzso the zzso zzso slowly to the nucleus by zzso Here we show that zzso expressed in zzso zzso is localized in both zzso and zzso and upon treatment with zzso zzso it moves to the zzso In zzso movement by diffusion is not possible, and we show that movement of the zzso from zzso is blocked by zzso suggesting that the zzso movement machinery is required for retrograde zzso In cells treated with both zzso and zzso the zzso becomes concentrated in fluorescent zzso located periodically along the zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso the zzso zzso zzso for the zzso also concentrates in the same zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso If zzso is removed, the zzso exits the zzso and continues its retrograde zzso However, in the continued presence of zzso the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso degradation, suggesting that the zzso function as zzso This is the first evidence for a linkage between zzso trafficking along zzso and zzso degradation by the zzso
