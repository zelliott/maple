zzso is a zzso target of both zzso during DNA zzso zzso and zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso mice exhibit zzso zzso associated with dramatic blistering of the zzso and oral zzso reflecting a critical role in zzso zzso zzso in zzso However, the role of zzso in tissue zzso in other zzso zzso zzso zzso is poorly zzso Given that zzso is essential for proper zzso zzso development and that cell zzso is fundamental for ensuring the proper architecture and function of the zzso zzso here we investigate zzso function in the zzso zzso 

zzso and Western zzso analysis were performed to characterize zzso expression and zzso in the mouse zzso zzso throughout zzso The consequences of zzso zzso for zzso zzso development and zzso were examined by using in zzso zzso transplant zzso zzso protein levels in a variety of human breast cancer cell lines were compared with those in zzso cells with Western zzso zzso The role of zzso in mouse zzso zzso was investigated by aging zzso of zzso mice that were zzso or deficient for zzso zzso tumor zzso was zzso and zzso survival was assessed using zzso zzso 

We show that zzso protein is expressed in the zzso zzso where it zzso with zzso Interestingly, although altering zzso through genetic zzso of zzso does not dramatically impair zzso zzso zzso development, zzso loss affects zzso zzso zzso by causing the zzso of inflammatory cells around mature zzso zzso Moreover, we show reduced zzso expression in many human breast cancer cell lines compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also promotes the development of mouse zzso zzso 

Together, these observations demonstrate an important role for zzso in normal zzso tissue function and in zzso cancer zzso In addition, our findings highlight the importance of zzso in cancer suppression and suggest the merit of evaluating zzso as a potential zzso indicator or molecular target in breast cancer zzso
