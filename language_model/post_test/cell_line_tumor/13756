The development of hypoxic areas often takes place in solid tumors and leads cells to undergo zzso zzso like zzso This process is responsible for zzso or zzso proteins and zzso zzso recycling, allowing cells to maintain their energetic zzso However, it could constitute a double-edged zzso leading to both survival and cell zzso So, in response to stress such as zzso zzso and zzso cells are often zzso To specifically study and characterize zzso cells and the process, we needed to develop a method able to zzso isolate zzso zzso and zzso respect zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was first used to monitor physical zzso changes due to the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso human zzso cell zzso Second, we showed that zzso zzso is able to prepare zzso enriched zzso fraction zzso zzso zzso markers zzso zzso zzso and zzso organization of zzso as well as zzso B zzso zzso the first zzso fraction exhibited zzso markers zzso activity and zzso increased zzso For the first time, zzso was employed as an zzso tool in order to discriminate zzso and zzso cells, thus providing an enriched zzso fraction zzso to a hypoxic zzso
