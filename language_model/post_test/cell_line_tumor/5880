To investigate whether zzso zzso enhances the zzso activity of zzso induced killer zzso cells in a zzso colon zzso zzso 

zzso size and weight served as indicators of therapeutic zzso zzso was performed to observe zzso zzso zzso and tumor zzso zzso Changes in the percentage of regulatory T zzso cells within the zzso of zzso mice zzso with zzso were monitored using flow zzso 

A marked T zzso synergistic zzso effect of the combined therapy was observed zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso 216 zzso P zzso zzso zzso chemotherapy with zzso zzso the zzso of zzso T zzso into the tumor mass and reduced the percentage of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso with zzso markedly enhances the efficacy of zzso transferred zzso cells, providing a potential clinical zzso for the treatment of patients with zzso zzso
