To investigate the role of zzso class II in the zzso of gastric zzso cell zzso induced by H zzso zzso 

After stimulating a human gastric zzso cell line with bacteria or zzso zzso specific for zzso class II and zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso events, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was performed with a zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso cells with the zzso class II zzso zzso zzso resulted in a reduction in global zzso zzso at 24 h of H zzso zzso When zzso 3 zzso was specifically measured, zzso of zzso class II resulted in a marked reduced zzso zzso while simple zzso of zzso class II did zzso zzso of zzso class II also resulted in an increased zzso of the zzso zzso zzso compared to simple zzso zzso microscope analysis demonstrated that the zzso of gastric zzso cells with a zzso zzso class II zzso blocked the recruitment of zzso to the cell zzso 

The results presented here demonstrate that the ability of zzso class II to zzso gastric zzso zzso is at least partially dependent on its zzso Furthermore, while previous research has demonstrated that zzso class II signaling can be zzso during extended zzso we have shown that the zzso of this zzso has zzso effects during the earlier time points of H zzso zzso This effect is possibly zzso by the ability of zzso class II to zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by blocking the recruitment of the accessory zzso zzso and this delay in zzso induction could allow for prolonged zzso zzso by H zzso gastric zzso zzso
