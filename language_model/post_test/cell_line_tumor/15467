Late zzso and zzso are dynamic zzso that constantly move and fuse to acquire cargo from early zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso dynamics cause severe neurodegenerative and zzso diseases, such as zzso type C disease and ARC syndrome, yet little is known about the regulation of late zzso fusion in a zzso zzso zzso zzso destined for fusion need to be transported over very long distances before they zzso to initiate zzso Here, we describe that zzso zzso and transport are combined processes zzso by one zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso directly and zzso binds the zzso zzso complex and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso then functions as a zzso switch controlling zzso zzso We show that zzso and zzso control Ebola virus infection, a process dependent on late zzso zzso By combining recruitment and regulation of both the zzso motor and zzso complex into a single zzso complex, the zzso complex efficiently couples and regulates the timing of zzso zzso transport and fusion, two major events in zzso zzso
