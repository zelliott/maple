Increased zzso zzso content is an early correlate of insulin resistance and can be caused by zzso zzso of zzso target of zzso zzso This zzso of zzso increases zzso zzso activity, leading to a zzso zzso zzso We have previously shown that the zzso zzso zzso has zzso functions in adult mouse zzso Acute or chronic zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso production and increases zzso activity and may therefore be predicted to increase zzso zzso zzso Here we now show that zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or its acute zzso with a decoy zzso zzso prevents zzso by blocking zzso complex 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso gain of function causes fatty liver through zzso zzso of zzso an effect that is zzso by treatment with zzso We demonstrate that zzso signaling increases zzso complex stability, zzso zzso function and zzso regulatory element binding zzso factor zzso zzso zzso These data identify zzso as a zzso zzso branch point of zzso signaling at which zzso zzso in the liver can be zzso from zzso
