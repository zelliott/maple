We have previously reported that the nuclear zzso zzso zzso activated zzso zzso regulates the zzso of zzso zzso a key zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso Here, we aimed to investigate the role of zzso zzso zzso which controls major zzso functions through the zzso of zzso and other zzso zzso Western zzso experiments with nuclear extracts from brain zzso of zzso cases and controls showed a reduction in the levels of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells induced a decrease in the levels of zzso zzso and an increase in the levels of zzso soluble zzso The decrease in zzso after zzso expression of zzso was a consequence of reduced zzso expression and transcription, together with a decrease in zzso promoter zzso In addition, we detected a significant reduction in zzso activity by measuring the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and by using a commercial zzso for zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso levels by zzso with zzso zzso increased zzso zzso These effects appeared to be dependent on zzso because zzso did not affect zzso and zzso levels in zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso or in zzso knockout zzso In conclusion, since zzso appears to decrease zzso generation, therapeutic zzso of zzso could have real potential as a treatment for zzso
