The total synthesis of zzso and formal synthesis of zzso via target oriented zzso formation is zzso The two key reactions involved a zzso reduction of the appropriate zzso zzso and a highly zzso and zzso zzso zzso protocol for the formation of the zzso zzso In addition to the described chemistry, in zzso screening of the zzso of natural zzso against the zzso 60 cancer cell line helped to illuminate the critical importance of the zzso zzso side chain of natural zzso for its reported potent zzso zzso Furthermore, by means of the in zzso screen of zzso a promising cancer therapeutic lead has now emerged for a variety of zzso More specifically, zzso exhibited zzso values in the zzso zzso zzso range against the four cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso while displaying modest zzso zzso
