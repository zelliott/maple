Recent studies have demonstrated extensive zzso activity across the human zzso a substantial fraction of which is not associated with any functional zzso However, very little is known regarding the zzso processes that operate within the different classes of zzso zzso To characterize the zzso properties of expressed sequences from human zzso 21 zzso we separated zzso molecules from three cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso according to their zzso content by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and total zzso were subsequently zzso to zzso zzso zzso We found that approximately 50% of the zzso signals were located outside of zzso zzso and were considered as zzso zzso active zzso Although zzso were observed among zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments revealed that approximately zzso were likely to represent zzso zzso zzso zzso discrimination of zzso according to conservation and sequence complexity allowed us to identify a set of zzso zzso This set of zzso was significantly depleted in the zzso suggesting that it was not likely to be involved in zzso Analysis of zzso representation of zzso zzso showed that at least zzso of zzso transcripts undergo significant zzso regulation in at least two of the three cell lines zzso Among the regulated zzso enrichment analysis revealed an zzso of genes involved in Alzheimer's disease zzso including zzso and the zzso zzso that zzso zzso to produce the zzso beta 42 zzso We demonstrate that the combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a powerful method to assess the zzso and zzso properties of zzso zzso
