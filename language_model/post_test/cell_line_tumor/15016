Small interfering zzso zzso is a promising candidate for gene therapy due to the strong and specific gene zzso zzso However, to effectively silence any zzso lack of an efficient delivery system is major obstacle for zzso zzso In the present study, we report on the development of a novel zzso zzso zzso as an efficient zzso zzso The zzso was prepared by a Michael addition reaction between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The composition of the zzso was characterized by zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso and the molecular weight was measured using gel zzso zzso zzso This zzso effectively condensed zzso into a compact zzso structure zzso 76 zzso with zzso size distribution and provided superior protection of zzso from zzso A zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso complexes showed good zzso zzso and had zzso gene zzso effect with low toxicity compared to zzso zzso These findings demonstrated that zzso has potential as an alternative to zzso zzso for zzso gene zzso
