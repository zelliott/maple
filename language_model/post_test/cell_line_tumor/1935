An ideal gene carrier is required both in safety and efficiency for zzso We examined the use of water soluble zzso and zzso as a carrier for zzso zzso zzso zzso in gene zzso The aim of this study was to zzso and characterize zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to increase zzso gene zzso and reduce possible zzso zzso zzso study showed strong DNA binding ability of modified zzso zzso Also structural properties of zzso zzso were confirmed by zzso We investigated in zzso properties of zzso zzso and coated particles which were observed between 145 and 250 zzso with the positive zzso potential zzso In addition, the zzso DNA complexes did not induce remarkable zzso against zzso zzso Due to low zzso we observed high zzso efficiency at zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso Although zzso studies carried on in zzso conditions, we measured slight increases at zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso can be a promising candidate due to its efficiency in condensing and zzso of zzso its low zzso and comparatively high zzso zzso
