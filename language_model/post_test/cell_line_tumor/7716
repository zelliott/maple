To zzso the extraction technology of total zzso with zzso activities in zzso zzso and explore the correlation between total zzso and zzso zzso 

The quantity of zzso zzso ratio of extraction and cell zzso rate were taken as the comprehensive indexes to zzso the main factors that influence the extraction of effective components by zzso experiment zzso zzso zzso software was used to analyze the zzso correlation between effective components and zzso zzso 

The best zzso condition of total zzso were as zzso the ratio of zzso ethanol to zzso zzso was zzso 1, zzso for 3 times, each time for 2 hour at 70 degrees zzso zzso extraction yield and cell zzso rate was positively related in the straight zzso 

This study provides a new insight into the zzso of extraction technology for traditional Chinese medicine, and lays a safe and reliable experimental basis for the clinical application of zzso zzso
