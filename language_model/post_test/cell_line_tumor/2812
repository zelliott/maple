zzso growth factor zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso was reported to take part in the hypoxic induction of zzso in zzso mouse zzso We zzso showed that zzso zzso and protein levels decreased under zzso in a zzso zzso cell line derived from zzso In this report, we examined whether zzso regulation of the zzso gene in these cells also depends on zzso We analyzed the effect of zzso on zzso zzso and it was revealed to be zzso Moreover, zzso small interfering zzso treatment decreased zzso zzso zzso To investigate the zzso of zzso under zzso we cloned promoter region of the human zzso zzso deletion analysis suggested that triple repeats of zzso element located between zzso and zzso zzso in the promoter are important for the hypoxic regulation of zzso Treatment with zzso small interfering zzso resulted in the significant decreased zzso activity in zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso showed the binding of the zzso protein to the promoter zzso We examined zzso zzso in zzso of term zzso tissue from patients with normal zzso and zzso which represents a condition of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein was decreased in zzso from pregnant women with zzso when compared with those from normal pregnant zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso is involved in zzso regulation of zzso in zzso zzso
