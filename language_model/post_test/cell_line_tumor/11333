zzso zzso was expressed in normal zzso zzso zzso cells zzso but was significantly suppressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso The biological significance of the zzso of zzso in zzso cells is zzso We hypothesized that zzso could function as a tumor zzso in these zzso To test this hypothesis, we sought the targets of zzso and characterized the effect of its zzso on zzso zzso We performed zzso analysis of zzso zzso cells to identify candidate targets of zzso and validated these targets by zzso reporter zzso zzso migration zzso were performed to study the migratory response of zzso cells to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso were used to identify the signaling that were potentially involved in the zzso migration of zzso Finally, we assessed zzso changes within the potential promoter region of the zzso gene in these zzso zzso analysis and subsequent validation zzso showed that growth factor zzso protein 2 zzso was a direct target of zzso The zzso migration zzso revealed that zzso significantly reduced zzso growth factor zzso cell migration in zzso zzso DNA zzso and subsequent zzso analysis showed that zzso 1 beta and zzso zzso 9 were possible participants in zzso migration of zzso zzso zzso sequencing showed higher zzso levels of zzso sites upstream of the zzso gene in zzso relative to zzso zzso Combined treatment with the zzso agent zzso and the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso A significantly zzso the expression of zzso in zzso zzso We revealed that zzso repression of zzso accelerated zzso cell migration through its target zzso in zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso functions as a tumor zzso Since zzso is the major cause of death in zzso zzso manipulation could lead to the development of novel zzso therapy strategies for zzso
