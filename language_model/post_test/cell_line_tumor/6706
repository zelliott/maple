We performed a zzso cell zzso culture zzso modified slightly from a method reported previously to provide a simple and sensitive evaluation of zzso shellfish poisoning zzso toxicity in zzso The cell zzso was just as sensitive for zzso as for zzso The sensitivity of our cell zzso was 4 times that of the current standard mouse zzso Using the cell zzso we evaluated zzso toxicity in zzso shellfish samples collected from zzso Bay and zzso Bay, zzso zzso Japan, from April zzso zzso The results were compared with those obtained in a zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso toxins were detected in zzso samples by both zzso and there was a fairly good correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso between the results from the two zzso We applied this cell zzso when zzso clams in the bay turned poisonous in zzso The zzso changes in zzso toxicity in the zzso clams were analyzed and compared with those of the cell density of poisonous zzso zzso zzso occurring in the zzso The zzso toxicity in shellfish peaked 2 weeks after the cell density reached a zzso We recommend using the cell zzso for routine monitoring of zzso toxicity in shellfish living in natural marine zzso
