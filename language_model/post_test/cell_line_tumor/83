zzso are known to have a serious side effect, zzso zzso We previously reported that zzso suppressed the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and suggested that this decrease was one of the causes of zzso zzso In this study, we examined the signaling zzso and regulatory factors for the expression of the zzso gene triggered by zzso in zzso zzso The zzso and protein expression of zzso detected by real-time reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and Western zzso respectively, decreased upon treatment of the cells with 10 zzso zzso for 24 zzso Under the conditions, zzso induced zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso decreased on treatment with an zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso for signal zzso zzso C, zzso and zzso restored the level of zzso zzso A zzso reporter zzso containing zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso region of the zzso gene was constructed for a reporter gene zzso The zzso activity in zzso decreased on incubation with zzso A zzso reporter zzso with an altered zzso element zzso zzso the zzso repression of zzso zzso These results suggest that signal zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso A zzso and zzso are involved in the signaling zzso triggered by zzso and zzso protein is one of the zzso factors for the zzso gene zzso by zzso
