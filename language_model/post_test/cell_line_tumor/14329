zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso has shown considerable promise as an zzso zzso Although the current zzso zzso were exclusively constructed from zzso zzso has several unique features that could be exploited to convert the virus to an zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso gene product contains a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso domain, which can activate the zzso zzso zzso and thus facilitate efficient zzso zzso Because the Ras signaling zzso is a key regulator of normal cell growth and zzso zzso it is zzso activated in many human zzso Here we report that a zzso zzso zzso constructed by replacing the zzso domain of zzso with the gene zzso the green fluorescent zzso can selectively replicate in and thus lyse tumor zzso Moreover, infection of zzso led to zzso formation in tumor cells, providing an additional zzso zzso A single zzso injection of zzso into established breast cancer zzso completely eradicated the tumors in more than zzso of the animals, leading to their long-term zzso We conclude that this zzso zzso is a safe and potent zzso agent useful for the treatment of zzso solid tumors such as breast zzso
