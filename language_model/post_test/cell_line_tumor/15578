zzso associated changes zzso can be defined as subtle zzso and zzso changes that are found in ostensibly normal cells of patients harboring zzso zzso It has been zzso that MAC have a potential to become a useful tool in zzso diagnosis and prognosis of zzso zzso An in zzso cell culture model system was designed to study interactions between zzso cell lung cancer zzso and the normal zzso zzso of the human respiratory tract in zzso to see if the zzso phenomenon can be detected in such a zzso In this study we examined changes in nuclear features of normal human zzso zzso cells zzso when they were zzso with cells derived from a lung cancer cell line zzso Using zzso function analysis, nuclear features were determined which allow zzso discrimination between normal cells incubated with or without zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that MAC appear to be specific to changes induced by zzso and that these changes differ from those induced by growth factors in the zzso This study provides evidence in support to the hypothesis that MAC are induced by a soluble zzso released by zzso zzso zzso figure can be viewed on zzso
