To develop zzso zzso zzso zzso in a gel zzso with sustained drug release properties and zzso advantages for local zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were zzso using zzso zzso and zzso by zzso and zzso The zzso zzso were performed using scanning electron zzso and differential scanning zzso The influence of various parameters on the disintegration time was zzso In zzso release of zzso was zzso using high performance liquid zzso zzso of the zzso was assessed by the zzso of zzso and zzso activity against zzso zzso cells in zzso The zzso were tested against a subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso gel beads containing a uniform zzso distribution were zzso zzso using zzso zzso ensured zzso of zzso with high loading zzso With an increase in the zzso time, zzso bath concentration and decrease in zzso zzso it was more difficult to disintegrate the beads and release the zzso The zzso demonstrated sustained drug release for more than 60 days at a zzso rate and a low initial zzso Cell culture studies proved the zzso against zzso zzso and improved performance in comparison to zzso The zzso could reduce subcutaneous zzso volume to a greater extent compared to zzso and the zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso in an zzso gel zzso could be potential local chemotherapy implants to treat zzso zzso with critical advantages of zzso and sustained drug release with low initial zzso
