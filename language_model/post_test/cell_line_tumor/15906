Despite years of interest in the zzso effects of cardiac zzso zzso and numerous studies in zzso and in animals, it has not yet been possible to zzso this potential zzso Reports have demonstrated promising in zzso effects on different targets as well as a possible therapeutic zzso in zzso and in experimental zzso Recently, however, general zzso of protein synthesis was suggested as the main mechanism of the zzso effects of zzso In addition, evidence of species differences of a magnitude sufficient to explain the results of many studies called for reconsideration of earlier zzso 

In this report we identified primary zzso and zzso cells as being particularly susceptible to the zzso effects of zzso zzso appeared most potent and zzso values for several patient samples were at zzso that may be achieved in the zzso zzso protein synthesis zzso at zzso corresponding to zzso was demonstrated in zzso zzso cell lines moderately resistant to the zzso effects of zzso and zzso but not in highly sensitive zzso cell zzso 

It is suggested that further investigation regarding zzso may be focused on diagnoses like zzso and zzso zzso
