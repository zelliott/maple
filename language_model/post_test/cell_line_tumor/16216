A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso fragments zzso specific for the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso a central zzso specific for zzso which is the low affinity zzso zzso present on natural killer cells and zzso was produced and its properties were zzso zzso and zzso in combination are present on acute zzso with mixed lineage zzso but not on normal human zzso zzso For comparison, two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso binding to zzso and zzso respectively, were also zzso The zzso zzso specifically zzso with all 3 zzso On the zzso zzso cell line zzso the zzso bound with zzso greater zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso 21 zzso 42 zzso and with zzso greater zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso 29 zzso All 3 fusion proteins had similar affinity for zzso and sufficient zzso stability in human zzso In zzso cellular zzso zzso reactions with human zzso cells as zzso the zzso promoted zzso of zzso cells at zzso lower zzso than zzso zzso and at zzso lower zzso than zzso zzso The zzso also zzso potent zzso of the zzso zzso mixed lineage leukemia cell line zzso and the zzso concentration zzso for zzso cells was 7 zzso zzso zzso and zzso are present on the surface of these zzso cell lines such that they can be connected by a single zzso zzso permitting the recruitment of zzso cells via zzso and tumor cell zzso
