A zzso resistant cell line, zzso was established by zzso the parental zzso cell line zzso with zzso increased zzso of zzso zzso in the presence of the zzso D analogue zzso zzso (2 zzso a potent zzso of the zzso resistance zzso zzso cells are zzso resistant to the selecting agent, zzso but also exhibit significant resistance to other zzso zzso including zzso resistance to zzso as well as zzso zzso to zzso zzso time and zzso were similar to the parental zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed no zzso in the expression of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and multiple zzso zzso occurred in both cell lines but required higher zzso of zzso in zzso cells than in zzso zzso zzso differences were observed in the zzso content of zzso zzso reduction of total zzso content, increased zzso fraction of total zzso and zzso of class III zzso which is expressed at very low levels in the parental zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso class III zzso did not display the resistance pattern observed in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to parental drug sensitivity, an increase in total zzso level, and a decrease in zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso cell line displays a novel mechanism of resistance to both zzso and stabilizing zzso zzso which does not involve altered cellular drug zzso but zzso to zzso in the total zzso content and zzso status, and may involve an effect on zzso zzso
