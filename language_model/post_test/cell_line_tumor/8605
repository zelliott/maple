Cell surface proteins are ideal targets for cancer therapy and zzso We have identified a set of more than zzso genes that code for zzso proteins believed to be at human cell zzso 

We used a zzso zzso system for the analysis of zzso cell surface zzso genes in 12 primary breast tumors, 8 breast cell lines, and 21 normal human zzso including zzso To better understand the role of these genes in breast tumors, we used a series of zzso strategies to zzso different type, of the zzso such as zzso zzso interaction databases, zzso and data from, zzso 

We found that at least 77 genes are zzso in breast primary tumors while at least 2 of them have also a restricted expression pattern in normal zzso We found common signaling pathways that may be regulated in breast tumors through the zzso of these cell surface zzso zzso Furthermore, a comparison was made between the genes found in this report and other genes associated with features clinically relevant for breast zzso 

The expression profiling generated in this study, together with an zzso zzso analysis, allowed us to identify putative targets for breast zzso
