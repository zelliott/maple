Lewis Y zzso is a zzso zzso zzso The majority of cancer cells derived from zzso zzso express zzso type zzso zzso zzso IV zzso is an essential zzso that zzso the synthesis of zzso zzso In a previous study we reported that zzso is associated with cell zzso however, despite the important role of zzso in cancer proliferation and zzso little is known about the mechanisms underlying the regulation of zzso zzso In the current study we investigated the regulation of zzso zzso in human breast zzso We compared the regulation of human zzso gene zzso in human breast cancer cells zzso and zzso using zzso zzso Using a series of promoter deletion zzso we identified a potential regulatory site located between zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso As shown by zzso and zzso zzso zzso factor 1 zzso and zzso required for zzso promoter zzso In addition, we explored the role of zzso and zzso on cell zzso and found that the zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways regulate the expression of zzso which play a role in cell proliferation via zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso is a target gene for zzso and zzso that is required for cell cycle progression in breast cancer zzso zzso
