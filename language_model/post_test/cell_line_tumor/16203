The zzso activity of zzso a zzso zzso zzso was zzso We found that zzso treatment of the zzso lung cancer cell line increased zzso cell zzso The increased zzso was correlated with decreased levels of zzso clients, such as zzso zzso and zzso as well as with increased zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso activity of zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment zzso an zzso client zzso zzso and this in turn resulted in degradation of the client zzso These results were not observed with another structurally similar zzso zzso zzso suggesting that a specific structural feature of the zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso treatment increased zzso levels by zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as by zzso its zzso zzso zzso may be considered an effective zzso acting as an inhibitor of zzso and a zzso zzso The two activities could be zzso to a broad range of cancer cells with either zzso or zzso zzso because either activity could be effective for the enhancement of radiation cell zzso Further analysis with other zzso should identify the functional zzso of the structure and additional candidates for effective zzso which can be used in combined zzso
