zzso zzso acid zzso zzso marked effects on limb zzso but the precise role of zzso zzso in this process has remained zzso We have studied the role of zzso in mouse limb development by focusing on zzso a zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso was shown to be expressed in the zzso region of the developing limb zzso and mice that lack zzso exhibited severe limb zzso zzso The lack of zzso resulted in spreading of the zzso signal toward the zzso end of the developing limb and induced zzso patterning defects characterized by expansion of zzso identity and restriction of zzso zzso zzso zzso also induced pronounced zzso in the developing limb and delayed zzso zzso zzso zzso exposed to excess zzso zzso the limb defects of zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso acts as a zzso to determine zzso identity, and that zzso prevents zzso and promotes zzso zzso in the developing zzso
