The mechanisms of increased expression of zzso zzso 4 zzso during the formation of foam cells were zzso Low density zzso zzso was prepared by density zzso zzso and oxidized by incubation with zzso The human zzso leukemia cell line zzso was cultured in zzso The differentiation of zzso cells into zzso zzso was induced by using zzso zzso zzso for 48 zzso The zzso were then incubated with oxidized LDL zzso to generate foam cells zzso The zzso and protein expression levels of human zzso were detected by zzso Western zzso and reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso The results showed that the zzso zzso and the protein expression levels were significantly increased during the differentiation of zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as during the formation of zzso foam cells zzso zzso zzso It was concluded that the zzso of human zzso gene expression during the differentiation of zzso into zzso and the differentiation of zzso into foam cells could increase zzso protein synthesis dramatically, which may enhance the ability of foam cells inflammation reaction in zzso
