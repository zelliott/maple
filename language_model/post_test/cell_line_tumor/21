Previous zzso studies revealed aberrations varied among the three zzso of zzso We zzso zzso imbalances in the different zzso and investigated the relationships between clinical parameters and zzso zzso 

Comparative zzso zzso was used to investigate zzso imbalances in 25 cases of primary zzso and two zzso cell zzso zzso were reviewed to determine zzso type, pathological grading and clinical zzso 

Changes involving one or more regions of the zzso were seen in all zzso zzso For zzso DNA sequence gains were most frequently zzso zzso seen in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso losses from zzso zzso and zzso In aggressive zzso zzso frequent gains were seen on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso losses from zzso zzso zzso and zzso For embryonic zzso frequent gains were on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso losses only from zzso Frequently gained zzso arms of zzso associated with zzso were zzso 2, 6, zzso zzso and zzso losses from zzso zzso and zzso The frequently gained zzso arms of zzso associated with zzso were zzso zzso and zzso while zzso and zzso were the frequently lost zzso zzso Gains on zzso zzso were significantly correlated with zzso zzso Gains on zzso zzso were significantly correlated with clinical zzso 

Gains on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and losses on zzso zzso zzso and zzso may be related to zzso zzso Furthermore, gains on zzso zzso may be correlated with zzso and gains on zzso zzso with the early stages of zzso
