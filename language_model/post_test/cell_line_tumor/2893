Far upstream zzso zzso zzso binds to an upstream element of the zzso promoter and regulates the zzso zzso zzso Earlier, zzso was identified as a candidate zzso of zzso Here, we report that zzso is zzso by executor zzso both in zzso and during zzso zzso occurs at the zzso consensus site zzso located within the classical zzso nuclear zzso signal zzso In cells subjected to zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso leads to its decreased presence in the nucleus, zzso with the marked zzso of zzso and its various target zzso By contrast, cells zzso with a zzso zzso of zzso zzso maintain higher levels of zzso and are protected from zzso On the basis of these results, we suggest that the zzso potential of zzso is zzso zzso after zzso induction as a consequence of the zzso zzso of zzso
