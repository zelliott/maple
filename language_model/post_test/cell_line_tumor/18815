We determined the expression of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso on tumor cells and zzso zzso cells in clinical specimens of human zzso zzso and human zzso cancer cells growing in culture and in the zzso cavity of nude zzso 

Ten specimens of high-grade zzso zzso zzso were analyzed using zzso zzso zzso was used to detect zzso and zzso expression in the human zzso cancer cells from zzso A8 and zzso growing in zzso zzso from these lines were also implanted zzso into the zzso cavity of nude zzso zzso was used to determine zzso and zzso expression in tumors that formed in the zzso zzso 

All 10 zzso samples expressed both zzso AA and zzso on tumor zzso zzso cells were positive for zzso in zzso samples, zzso in zzso samples, zzso in zzso samples, and zzso in zzso zzso zzso was positive in zzso zzso zzso cell samples and zzso was positive in zzso zzso Human zzso cancer cells expressed zzso zzso and zzso when growing in culture or in the zzso cavity of nude zzso zzso and zzso were also present on zzso zzso cells as demonstrated by simultaneous zzso with zzso zzso 

zzso and the corresponding receptors were expressed in zzso human zzso cancer zzso on both tumor cells and zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso were also present on zzso A8 and zzso human zzso cancer cells growing in zzso and in the zzso cavity of nude zzso
