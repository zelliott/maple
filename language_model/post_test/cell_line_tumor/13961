In light of the potential use of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in prostate cancer treatment, this study assessed the mechanism by which these agents suppress zzso zzso zzso zzso in prostate cancer zzso Two lines of evidence indicate that the effect of zzso on zzso zzso is independent of zzso zzso First, this zzso zzso zzso is zzso irrespective of the relative zzso zzso zzso Second, the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibit higher potency than the parent compound in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although 10 zzso zzso and zzso significantly inhibit zzso zzso they do not alter the expression level of zzso zzso zzso or interfere with zzso nuclear zzso of zzso However, reporter gene and zzso zzso studies indicate that zzso and zzso block zzso recruitment to the zzso response elements within the zzso zzso Thus, this study raises the question of whether the ability of oral zzso to reduce zzso levels in prostate cancer patients is zzso zzso A major concern is that the concentration for zzso to mediate zzso effects is zzso higher than that of zzso zzso which is difficult to attain at therapeutic zzso Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that zzso and zzso at high doses were able to inhibit zzso zzso From a zzso perspective, separation of zzso zzso activity from zzso zzso provides a molecular basis to use zzso as a platform to design zzso zzso
