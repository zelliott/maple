The coordination of the zzso agent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the DNA model base zzso zzso was investigated in zzso zzso zzso was first applied for the study of the molecular stability and zzso of zzso in zzso solution over a range of pH zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso degrees zzso In zzso conditions zzso zzso pH zzso zzso disappears from the solution in 15 zzso due to zzso and zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at lower pH zzso and in water zzso approximately zzso only a partial zzso zzso occurs, slowly forming the zzso zzso This latter species coordinates to zzso (via the zzso of zzso forming the zzso zzso zzso and zzso give comparable zzso zzso zzso and accumulate in zzso cells zzso mouth zzso and accumulate these at the zzso phase, while zzso zzso species do not, and their cell zzso is reduced to zzso On the contrary, zzso arrest and protein content in the zzso zzso cell line zzso are not influenced by zzso zzso zzso zzso species apparently are easier taken up by the zzso cells, showing zzso zzso zzso one order of magnitude greater than those of intact zzso zzso it is proposed that the selective zzso activity of zzso during in zzso experiments can be attributed to its zzso zzso
