In most tumors, the zzso environment is zzso The purpose of this study was to zzso the effect of zzso zzso environment on the zzso expression of zzso and related molecular zzso 

zzso zzso human zzso cancer cells carrying zzso zzso were zzso zzso grown in pH zzso medium or pH zzso medium were zzso with zzso and the expression of zzso and zzso zzso as well as the degradation rate of the zzso was zzso The zzso activity for zzso was investigated using cells zzso with a zzso reporter zzso The expression of zzso and the zzso of zzso essential factors for zzso degradation, were also zzso 

The pH zzso environment prolonged the zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso increase in zzso activity of zzso lasted longer in pH zzso medium than in pH zzso zzso The degradation of zzso was delayed at pH zzso The zzso expression of zzso was markedly zzso whereas the zzso of zzso was markedly increased after zzso in pH zzso zzso 

zzso environment significantly enhances the zzso expression of zzso partly by increasing the formation of zzso and also partly by slowing down the degradation of zzso through zzso zzso complex zzso The potential implication of zzso zzso zzso for the response of tumors to zzso remains to be zzso
