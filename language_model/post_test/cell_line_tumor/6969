The zzso zzso scavenger zzso zzso is a zzso surface zzso whose expression is strongly zzso by zzso We have previously shown that zzso is expressed by acute zzso leukemia zzso cells of zzso zzso zzso we expand this finding by demonstrating zzso and zzso zzso expression on zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso blasts of other zzso zzso and normal zzso zzso cells do not express zzso We provide evidence that the functional characteristics of zzso are preserved on zzso cells by showing the capability of types zzso blast cells to zzso zzso by a zzso zzso Together, our results identify zzso as a potential target for therapeutic zzso It is important that zzso does not appear to be released from zzso blasts under zzso conditions, thus reducing the probability of zzso zzso as a result of competitive binding of potential therapeutic zzso to zzso zzso
