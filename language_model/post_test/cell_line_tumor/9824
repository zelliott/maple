A chemically defined zzso feed zzso coupled with zzso medium zzso was developed to replace a zzso feed zzso for a zzso zzso zzso The zzso not only enabled a completely chemically defined process but also increased zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso tests of zzso in a zzso process indicated that it could also replace the zzso zzso feed in this expression system as well as providing an zzso increase in product zzso In both zzso zzso and zzso zzso the peak zzso zzso were lower and, more interestingly, zzso metabolism shifted markedly from net production to net consumption when cells zzso from exponential to stationary growth zzso zzso investigations of the zzso zzso shift in the zzso zzso process were carried out to identify the zzso of the zzso zzso These investigations revealed several zzso features of the zzso cell line that we zzso First, zzso consumption and zzso consumption are strictly complementary to each zzso The combined cell specific zzso and zzso consumption rate was a constant across exponential and stationary growth zzso Second, zzso zzso zzso activity zzso during the zzso zzso zzso activity was at the lowest when zzso concentration started to zzso Third, a steep cross plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration was more than two orders of magnitude lower than that in the zzso Fourth, a large quantity of zzso was diverted out of zzso to the zzso suggesting a partially truncated zzso acid zzso cycle in zzso zzso Finally, other zzso in or linked to the zzso zzso and the zzso cycle, which include zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated a zzso shift similar to that of zzso Interestingly, all these zzso are either in or linked to the zzso downstream of zzso but upstream of zzso in zzso zzso Although the specific mechanisms for the zzso shift of zzso and other zzso remain to be zzso the increased understanding of the metabolism of zzso cultures could lead to future improvements in medium and process zzso
