Signaling by zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso zzso adhesive cell properties and thereby coordinates cell movement and positioning in normal and zzso zzso While cell zzso zzso zzso frequently leads to zzso zzso also the zzso opposite response, zzso zzso is a probable zzso However, the molecular principles regulating such disparate functions have remained zzso We have examined zzso mechanisms underlying this switch by analyzing zzso zzso changes of zzso zzso zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso Their exposure to zzso surfaces leads to a rapid conversion from a zzso to an zzso cell type, a transition that relies on zzso functions operating in the absence of zzso zzso Cell zzso change and zzso of zzso cells are effectively attenuated by zzso protein zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso and productive zzso signaling reverse the zzso to zzso cells with a condensed zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso activities not only control zzso zzso levels, but as a result switch the response to zzso contact from zzso to zzso which may play a role in the pathology of zzso zzso
