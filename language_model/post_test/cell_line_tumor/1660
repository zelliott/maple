To investigate the expression of zzso in zzso free cancer cells isolated from human gastric cancer zzso and its relationship to zzso dissemination of gastric zzso 

zzso free cancer cells zzso were isolated from zzso specimens of gastric cancer zzso zzso expression in zzso was detected with zzso In human gastric cancer cell line zzso zzso expression was detected using zzso and Western zzso and was suppressed with zzso zzso The proliferation of zzso cells was measured using zzso zzso and the invasion ability was detected with invasion zzso The zzso of zzso cells to zzso was observed in human zzso zzso cells zzso zzso in zzso and in mice in zzso 

zzso were isolated from zzso of 6 out of 10 gastric cancer zzso zzso expression in zzso was detected in 5 of the 6 gastric cancer zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso significantly reduced both zzso zzso and protein zzso which resulted in suppressing the cell zzso invasion and zzso to zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso was significantly inhibited in zzso cells zzso with zzso In the zzso dissemination model of gastric cancer, zzso injection of zzso markedly suppressed the tumor zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso is expressed in zzso from the zzso of gastric cancer zzso zzso of zzso expression markedly suppresses the zzso process of zzso zzso thus may be a potential target for the treatment of gastric zzso
