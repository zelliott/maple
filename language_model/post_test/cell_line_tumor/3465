We have recently reported that two typical zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso for zzso zzso stimulate zzso zzso zzso and increase zzso zzso concentration zzso in zzso cells and zzso zzso cells, respectively, by a zzso involving zzso a zzso and zzso zzso zzso exchange factor zzso and the zzso zzso Here we have demonstrated that these zzso receptors use this zzso to activate zzso and the zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso Specifically, zzso zzso of the receptors resulted in zzso of zzso and zzso The latter action was suppressed by dominant negative zzso but not zzso The zzso actions were independent of protein zzso A but fully zzso by an zzso zzso analog as well as by a zzso active zzso zzso On the other hand, a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and a dominant negative zzso zzso suppressed zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso Finally, we have demonstrated that zzso of zzso and zzso requires the zzso activity of zzso and the subsequent zzso increase, suggesting that zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso In line with this hypothesis, zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was strongly enhanced by expression of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso our data indicated that zzso receptors can activate zzso and subsequently the zzso protein zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso possibly zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso which then lead via zzso and zzso stimulation to zzso zzso
