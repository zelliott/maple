zzso is a tumor zzso protein that limits zzso survival during normal zzso It is also important in cancer, as zzso level is reduced in tumors and in skin cancer cell lines, suggesting that loss of expression may be required for cancer cell zzso An important goal is identifying how zzso limits cell zzso In the present study we show that zzso expression in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso cells reduces cell proliferation and promotes zzso and zzso zzso To identify the mechanism that drives these changes, we demonstrate that zzso zzso near the zzso and that zzso zzso of zzso alters zzso and zzso organization and zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso is a hallmark of zzso and we demonstrate that zzso promotes zzso zzso zzso These changes are associated with reduced zzso zzso zzso E and zzso A, and increased zzso zzso In addition, zzso level is increased and zzso level is reduced, and zzso of zzso 3, zzso 9 and zzso is zzso We propose that zzso zzso of zzso is a key event that results in zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and that leads to cancer cell zzso
