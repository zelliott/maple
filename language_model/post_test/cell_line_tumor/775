We have cloned and characterized human and mouse zzso zzso zzso a new protein of the zzso family of zzso called zzso because of its zzso expression in zzso zzso Human and mouse zzso exhibit the same domain organization as other zzso including signal zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso show an additional zzso domain of about 150 zzso acids with no similarity to other ancillary zzso present in the equivalent region of most zzso Northern zzso analysis of human zzso and cell lines revealed that zzso is only detected at significant levels in leukemia and zzso cells of different zzso In addition, zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso is expressed in human and mouse zzso in zzso mouse zzso and in zzso zzso zzso Further studies showed that zzso caused a dramatic increase in the expression of mouse zzso indicating that the production of this zzso is under hormonal zzso Human zzso was expressed in zzso coli and the zzso zzso protein zzso synthetic zzso used for zzso zzso These activities were abolished by zzso of zzso but not by zzso of other classes of zzso On the basis of these results, we suggest that zzso could play in zzso a zzso function similar to that performed by zzso zzso in evolutionary distant species from zzso to zzso
