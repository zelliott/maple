Although advances have been made in understanding the role of zzso in the stem cell zzso almost nothing is known about a potentially similar role of zzso in maintaining the tumor stem cell zzso zzso Here we show that a highly zzso fraction of side population zzso cells is localized in the hypoxic zones of solid tumors in zzso We first identified a highly zzso zzso and zzso fraction of zzso side population cells zzso zzso in a diverse group of solid tumor cell lines, including zzso zzso and zzso lung zzso To identify the zzso zzso we used an zzso zzso zzso derived from bone zzso zzso cells treated with zzso and zzso zzso We found that a highly zzso SP fraction zzso to the injured zzso medium in a zzso zzso We show that as few as 100 zzso cells form rapidly growing tumors in zzso In zzso exposure to zzso increases the zzso fraction zzso zzso real-time zzso chain reaction and zzso studies showed that zzso cells expressed zzso a zzso gene having a potential role in zzso zzso In nude mice zzso zzso cells were localized to the hypoxic zones, as demonstrated after quantum dot zzso These results suggest that a highly zzso SP fraction zzso to the area of zzso this migration is similar to the migration of normal bone zzso SP fraction to the area of zzso Furthermore, the hypoxic zzso may serve as a niche for the highly zzso fraction of SP zzso
