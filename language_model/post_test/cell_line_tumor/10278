Fusion proteins created by zzso display peptides with tumor cell specificity and the zzso major coat protein of zzso zzso have been explored recently as a simple and cost-effective means for preparing zzso zzso that improve the zzso of zzso drugs in zzso The next step in the development of this approach is the zzso of the zzso composition for the maximum targeting activity and subsequent testing in zzso This study aimed to investigate the impact of preparation zzso zzso composition and zzso protein content on the targeting efficiency of zzso zzso zzso Analysis of size, zzso potential and zzso was used to investigate the effect of preparation protocols on the stability and zzso of the zzso zzso A previously developed zzso targeting zzso and a zzso design approach were used to determine the role of zzso composition of the zzso membrane on the target cell specificity of the zzso zzso Western zzso combined with zzso K treatment detected the orientation of targeted zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed positive effects on target specificity of zzso zzso The results served to identify optimal zzso that offer an improved zzso affinity for target tumor cells over the zzso zzso
