Numerous studies have shown that zzso have zzso effects in zzso but few studies were focusing on the zzso activity of zzso against one special cancer cell zzso The aim of this study is to investigate the growth zzso effect of four zzso on zzso cell line and the relationship between their structures and zzso 

The modified zzso zzso was adopted to measure the zzso effect of zzso on zzso cells at different zzso at 24 zzso 48 h and 72 zzso and the changes of cell zzso were observed by zzso phase contrast zzso 

zzso could inhibit the proliferation of zzso cells zzso and their zzso on zzso cells are all in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso I, zzso I, zzso zzso and zzso at 24 h were zzso zzso zzso zzso over 10 zzso and over 10 zzso at 48 h were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 72 h were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

All of the four zzso have proliferation zzso effects on zzso cell line, among which the zzso I is the most active one, followed by zzso I, zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results showed that the structure of aromatic ring A could enhance the zzso and the structure of zzso ring C would influence the zzso but the mechanism is still remained to be further zzso
