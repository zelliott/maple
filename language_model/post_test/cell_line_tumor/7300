The zzso is a zzso complex found in all zzso zzso it is responsible for the degradation of key regulatory proteins associated with the cell cycle and zzso In zzso zzso zzso can induce selective zzso in some zzso cell types as opposed to in their normal counterparts and first generation compounds are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of multiple zzso The objective of our study was to develop a method to extract and measure functional zzso activity in primary human cells so that this method could then be used to determine whether patients might benefit from zzso inhibitor zzso 

zzso zzso extraction and zzso conditions were established with myeloma and zzso cell zzso These conditions were then applied to primary human cells from zzso zzso was extracted using zzso buffer and activity measured as turnover of a zzso fluorescent zzso 

zzso expressing zzso showed significantly higher zzso levels zzso zzso zzso than did zzso cells zzso 8 zzso zzso and were more sensitive to induction of zzso by zzso zzso Human zzso leukemia cell lines showed higher levels of activity than those representing myeloma zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells from patients had similar levels of activity to those of the comparable cell line zzso 

This simple method measures functional zzso activity in primary zzso cells and demonstrates for the first time that this activity is higher in zzso leukemia than in myeloma zzso
