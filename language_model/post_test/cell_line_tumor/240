zzso c zzso zzso is the terminal zzso of the electron transport chain composed of 13 zzso three are zzso and 10 are zzso on nine different zzso within the zzso zzso The zzso regulation of such a zzso zzso and zzso zzso is mechanistically zzso zzso factories have been proposed as one mechanism by which genes from different zzso zzso zzso to transcribe functionally related zzso and zzso zzso capture zzso is a means by which such interactions can be zzso Thus far, however, only zzso from the same zzso or at most two zzso have been zzso by zzso The present study used zzso to test our hypothesis that not only the 10 zzso zzso from nine zzso zzso the 10 nuclear zzso of zzso but also genes from three zzso zzso zzso zzso factors A and B zzso zzso and zzso critical for the zzso of the three zzso zzso zzso genes all occupy common zzso sites in the zzso zzso zzso The pairing of various zzso zzso genes and zzso genes indicates that interactions are present among all of zzso On the other hand, genes for a zzso protein zzso as well as a zzso zzso zzso zzso did not interact with zzso zzso Furthermore, interactions between zzso zzso and zzso genes were zzso by zzso stimulation and zzso by impulse blockade in primary zzso Thus, a viable mechanism is in place for a zzso coordinated zzso regulation of this zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso
