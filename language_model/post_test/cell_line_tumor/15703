zzso of cancer therapy zzso are attracting attention to improve the outcome of treatment, since single zzso has not always been sufficiently zzso The aim of this study was to investigate a new strategy of combined application of zzso zzso with zzso drug zzso zzso in zzso therapy zzso Using a simple zzso solid state reaction in air at room temperature, we were able to zzso zzso zzso as the drug carrier of zzso in drug delivery zzso The combination of zzso zzso with zzso induced the remarkable improvement in the zzso activity, which has been demonstrated by the flow zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso Furthermore, the possible signaling zzso was explored by zzso It was noted that the notable zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso could considerably increase cancer cell injury zzso by zzso oxygen species zzso For instance, in human zzso cells zzso zzso our observations demonstrated that zzso zzso could obviously increase the zzso concentration of zzso and enhance its potential zzso efficiency, indicating that zzso zzso could act as an efficient drug delivery carrier importing zzso into target cancer zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso loaded zzso agent could induce distinguished improvement in zzso activity with zzso zzso These findings revealed that such zzso combinations represent a promising approach in cancer zzso
