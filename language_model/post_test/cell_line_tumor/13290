zzso cancer zzso is one of the major causes of zzso mortality zzso Recent studies revealed that there is a relationship between zzso occurrence and zzso zzso zzso Stem cells are a type of cells that have the ability to zzso and to zzso extensively while maintaining the zzso zzso Cancer stem cells zzso are closely linked to tumor recurrence and zzso To this end, we evaluated the zzso expression differences between colon zzso and zzso cells using the zzso cell line, to determine the relationship between tumor stem cells and tumor biological zzso We isolated populations of colon zzso with the zzso and zzso surface zzso from a human zzso colon zzso cell line using flow zzso The expression of zzso and zzso of both sets of cells was examined with zzso and zzso zzso zzso methods were used to analyze zzso zzso We completed gene zzso analysis, zzso analysis, zzso target gene prediction with zzso We identified a colon stem cell zzso expression profile zzso 31 zzso and 31 zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso Some of these zzso expressed zzso may be involved in the regulation of stem cell zzso Gene zzso and zzso analyses showed that the differences are closely related to the function of the cell cycle, cell zzso signaling pathway, zzso proteins and zzso zzso in colon cancer stem zzso We found that zzso play an important role in regulating the expression of colon zzso zzso By regulating the expression of zzso signaling zzso zzso and membrane zzso zzso give tumor stem cells the zzso behavior of recurrence and zzso This study provides a new perspective on zzso zzso and zzso
