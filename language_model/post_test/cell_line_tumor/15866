As a critical target for zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso controls early cell cycle zzso We report here a new type of regulation that influences zzso recognition and zzso of zzso zzso zzso through the targeted zzso of a critical zzso zzso in the zzso zzso recognition zzso In zzso zzso zzso 810 represents the essential and zzso basic zzso zzso required for zzso recognition and zzso zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso binding of zzso and thereby prevents subsequent zzso of the associated zzso zzso zzso retaining zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is under DNA damage control, and zzso zzso impacts on zzso at sites throughout the zzso zzso zzso is required for efficient cell cycle arrest, and significantly, a zzso zzso of zzso that cannot be zzso at zzso exhibits compromised cell cycle zzso Thus, the regulation of zzso by zzso reflects the combined interplay with zzso events, and more generally the targeted zzso of a zzso zzso within a zzso site in zzso represents an important point of control in cell cycle zzso
