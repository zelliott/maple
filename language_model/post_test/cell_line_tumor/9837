zzso growth zzso zzso is an zzso zzso having direct zzso activity against conventional zzso and zzso cells and natural killer cells, thereby zzso tumor zzso Here, we investigated possible zzso between zzso zzso and a zzso vaccine on induction of zzso zzso and the mechanisms accounting for synergistic zzso 

The effect of combination treatment with a zzso vaccine and zzso was examined in a subcutaneous zzso tumor model, as well as the mechanisms of protection induced by this zzso 

zzso significantly and zzso improved vaccine efficacy as measured by reduction in primary tumor growth, although zzso alone had no zzso The number of tumor zzso zzso with high functional zzso as measured by zzso production and zzso activity was significantly increased in vaccinated mice by zzso zzso Although zzso is known to play a critical role in zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso by an zzso zzso zzso zzso before tumor challenge did not enhance vaccine zzso and adding zzso did not affect zzso numbers in zzso zzso or tumors or their zzso Also, zzso zzso had no effect on zzso T cells, which are induced by zzso and zzso zzso of type II zzso cells, which induce zzso cells to produce zzso was not sufficient to eliminate all sources of zzso zzso Finally, the synergistic protection induced by zzso vaccine zzso was zzso by zzso T cells since zzso treatment completely zzso the zzso 

These results suggest that zzso blockade may be useful for enhancing cancer vaccine zzso
