zzso zzso zzso play a key role in the metabolism of a wide range of environmental zzso and zzso zzso The expression and activity levels of zzso can be elevated by a process of induction involving the zzso of nuclear zzso The effects of the zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso on the expression of zzso zzso members, including zzso zzso and zzso as well as on zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso and zzso X zzso zzso in mouse zzso zzso cells zzso were investigated by using quantitative real-time zzso in the present zzso The results reveal that zzso zzso the expressions of zzso zzso and zzso at zzso level, suggesting that zzso zzso liquids can activate zzso Our results also suggest that zzso zzso induction be zzso This result may be beneficial to evaluating the environmental toxicity of zzso zzso liquids and investigating the metabolism of zzso zzso
