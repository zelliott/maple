Our study aims to evaluate the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso on gastric cancer cells, and its zzso 

zzso cancer cells were treated with increasing doses of IT and zzso protein was zzso by Western zzso Cell proliferation was determined by Cell Counting zzso zzso zzso zzso incorporation zzso was used to evaluate IT zzso of protein zzso Cell zzso was zzso by flow zzso zzso activities were measured using zzso zzso zzso 

Cell growth and protein synthesis of the gastric cancer cell lines were suppressed by IT in a zzso and zzso zzso IT also induced zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso rates of gastric cancer cell lines zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso respectively when treated with 50 zzso of zzso There were significant increase of zzso activity at 24 zzso of IT treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in these gastric cancer cell zzso 

IT zzso has zzso effects on the gastric cancer cell lines in zzso and it provides an experimental basis for zzso therapy towards in zzso zzso
