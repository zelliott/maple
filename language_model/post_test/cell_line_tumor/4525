To assess the zzso and the exposure of zzso zzso in children during high-dose therapy with an intravenous zzso zzso of zzso containing the potentially zzso and zzso zzso as a zzso 

zzso children aged zzso to zzso years zzso age, zzso zzso received IV zzso in 15 doses of zzso to zzso zzso zzso containing overall zzso amounts of between 5 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso Plasma zzso of zzso and zzso were zzso and analyzed using zzso zzso zzso Four different zzso cell lines were incubated with zzso and zzso was assessed in comparison with zzso as well as in a combination reflecting the ratio in the zzso 

zzso plasma zzso of zzso up to zzso zzso were zzso No zzso of the zzso zzso Instead, the trough levels decreased over the 4 treatment zzso The population zzso analysis revealed a clearance of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that increased to zzso zzso zzso zzso on the fourth day and a volume of distribution of 469 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso volume of distribution correlated with the volume of distribution of zzso The zzso of zzso in zzso was 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of zzso No zzso was zzso 

The lack of zzso of zzso confirms that there is no safety concern related to the zzso content in this IV zzso zzso The contribution of zzso to the zzso effect of the zzso seems to be zzso
