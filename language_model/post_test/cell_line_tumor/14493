We design a class of zzso hybrid zzso for zzso delivery of zzso zzso The zzso structured hybrid zzso were zzso by coating the zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso polystyrene zzso gel layer as inner zzso and a subsequent thin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel layer as outer zzso The uniqueness of these hybrid zzso lies in the integration of the functional building blocks for combined zzso and zzso therapy to significantly improve the therapeutic zzso The zzso core zzso cannot only emit strong zzso for imaging and monitoring at the cellular level, but also exhibit strong zzso in the zzso zzso region for zzso zzso While the inner zzso gel layer is introduced to provide strong zzso interactions with zzso for high drug loading yields, the external nontoxic and zzso zzso analog gel layer is designed to trigger the release of the zzso zzso either by variation of surrounding temperature or zzso zzso with zzso zzso Such designed zzso hybrid zzso are well suited for in zzso studies and clinical trials, thereby likely to bring this promising natural medicine of zzso to the forefront of therapeutic agents for zzso and other zzso
