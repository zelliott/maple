Central nervous system zzso involvement remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in acute zzso the mechanisms of zzso cell zzso into the zzso have not yet been zzso The zzso barrier zzso makes zzso become a refugee to zzso cells and serves as a resource of cells that seed zzso zzso How can the zzso cells disrupt this barrier and invasive the zzso even if many of the currently available zzso can not cross the zzso Tight junction in zzso cells occupies a central role in the function of the zzso Except the well known role of degrading zzso zzso in zzso of cancer cells, here we show zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso cells, mediate the zzso opening by zzso tight junction proteins in the zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso cells impaired tight junction proteins zzso zzso and zzso resulting in increased zzso of the zzso However, these zzso reduced when zzso and -9 activities were inhibited by zzso interference strategy or by zzso inhibitor zzso in an in zzso zzso zzso We also found that the disruption of the zzso in company with the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso of zzso and -9 in mouse brain zzso with zzso cell zzso by zzso imaging and the zzso of in zzso gelatin zzso Besides, zzso protected all mice against zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the degradation of tight junction proteins zzso zzso and zzso by zzso and -9 zzso by zzso cells constitutes an important mechanism in the zzso breakdown which contributes to the invasion of zzso cells to the zzso in acute zzso
