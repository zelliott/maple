Long zzso nuclear element 1 zzso zzso are zzso that are capable of generating deleterious zzso by inserting themselves into genes and affecting gene function in the human zzso In normal cells, the activity of zzso zzso is mostly zzso maintaining a stable zzso zzso In contrast, cancer cells are characterized by zzso expression of zzso zzso which, in principle, have the potential to contribute to zzso zzso The zzso pathways that regulate zzso expression remain zzso Using zzso small zzso analysis, we identified a subset of zzso expressed zzso that directly regulate zzso zzso zzso analyses suggest that these zzso are significantly depleted in human breast cancer cells compared with normal breast zzso The zzso of these zzso in cancer cells markedly zzso zzso zzso expression through increased DNA zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The finding that zzso can silence zzso activity through DNA zzso suggests that a functional link exists between the expression of zzso and zzso zzso in human zzso
