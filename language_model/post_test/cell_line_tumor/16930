To investigate whether zzso protein 2 zzso affects zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso and protein expression of zzso were analyzed in human zzso cells, which serve as a model for zzso zzso by quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction and Western zzso before and after treatment with zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso cells was assessed by zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso with a small interfering zzso zzso that targets zzso zzso or with a zzso zzso using zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in the medium were measured by zzso linked zzso zzso 

Both zzso and zzso zzso were expressed mainly in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells that zzso zzso also expressed zzso zzso experiments revealed that release of zzso from zzso cells into the medium reached a maximum at 120 zzso and remained stable until at least 180 zzso after treatment with zzso acid (the level of zzso increased about zzso as compared with the level of zzso in the control cells, P zzso zzso In an experiment to determine dose zzso stimulation of zzso cells with zzso 8 zzso zzso acid led to a zzso release of zzso into the zzso 10 zzso zzso acid diminished the release of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso induced by zzso acid from zzso cells that were zzso with zzso decreased to zzso as compared with zzso cells that were zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso affected zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso that is induced by free fatty zzso
