zzso is expressed in a dynamic and complex zzso pattern during mouse zzso Previous studies identified zzso as a zzso factor that binds the key regulatory element zzso of the zzso promoter and stimulates zzso Here we show that members of the zzso family of zzso factors also bind zzso and zzso zzso zzso At least five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso cells, and of these, zzso and zzso were dramatically induced in parallel with zzso following differentiation into zzso zzso cells with zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso could be detected on zzso with zzso zzso and zzso by using nuclear extracts from differentiated zzso zzso However, only zzso expression markedly activated the zzso promoter in these zzso By contrast, zzso was a poor zzso of zzso transcription, and when zzso was zzso with zzso it zzso modulated the strong zzso zzso by zzso More detailed analyses showed that zzso competes with zzso for zzso occupancy and to activate the zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso is zzso with zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso mouse zzso In culture, zzso zzso stem cells were shown to express zzso upon differentiation into zzso bodies, although at lower levels than were found in wild type zzso stem zzso This zzso expression was virtually abolished when zzso expression was suppressed by zzso zzso These results show that zzso is a potent zzso of zzso zzso
