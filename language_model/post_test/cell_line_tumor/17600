An important objective in zzso biology is to link gene expression to function by developing zzso networks that include data from the zzso and functional zzso Here, we develop a model for the analysis of zzso changes in zzso zzso and gene expression in a zzso model zzso The experimental framework chosen was zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cultures of mouse zzso zzso The importance of zzso has been demonstrated previously in zzso cell culture by zzso zzso shifts with zzso depletion and zzso Our protocol removed zzso from the medium for 24 h and returned it for a second 24 zzso zzso zzso of zzso the zzso acid zzso cycle, and zzso were used at specified zzso All of these zzso declined in the absence of zzso and were restored when zzso was zzso zzso spectral analysis identified zzso and zzso as equal sources of zzso zzso zzso zzso of organic acids and zzso acids indicated that most zzso changed in parallel with the zzso zzso with zzso D indicated that de zzso zzso synthesis was required for observed flux changes during the zzso of zzso Analysis of gene expression data from DNA zzso revealed that many more genes were zzso with the zzso flux and zzso level than were correlated with these zzso In conclusion, this model may be useful as a zzso zzso regulatory network where gene expression profiles are analyzed in concert with changes in cell zzso
