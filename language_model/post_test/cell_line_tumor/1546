A novel sensing strategy for sensitive detection of zzso 1 protein zzso and zzso cells based on zzso zzso resonance energy transfer zzso from zzso zzso to zzso oxide zzso was zzso The zzso zzso was zzso combined with zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso Due to the strong zzso interaction between the zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso was efficiently zzso because of the zzso In the presence of a target zzso zzso the binding between the zzso and zzso disturbed the interaction between the zzso and zzso These interactions led to the release of the zzso from zzso and resulted in the restoration of zzso zzso This was shown to detect zzso protein sensitively in a linear range from zzso to zzso zzso with a detection limit of 40 zzso With further application in the detection of zzso cells, the presented method could respond at zzso as low as 30 cancer cells per zzso By substituting the zzso and the corresponding target, this method could be zzso extended for the sensitive detection of other zzso
