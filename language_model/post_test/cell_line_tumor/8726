Based on their zzso zzso properties, zzso iron oxide zzso or zzso zzso iron oxide zzso zzso are zzso for detecting and tracing cells or tumors in zzso Here, we developed an zzso and concise synthesis approach for a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coated with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso can be effectively zzso by beta cells and label primary zzso cells, at relatively low iron zzso The zzso and zzso of these products were investigated by comparison with the commercial zzso product, zzso zzso We also assessed the safe dosage range of the zzso Although some cases showed a zzso change at the site of zzso a strong magnetic resonance imaging zzso was zzso by a clinical zzso zzso at field strength of zzso zzso in zzso and the iron zzso in zzso was confirmed by zzso blue and zzso zzso It is noteworthy that based on our synthesis approach, in future, we could exchange the zzso with other zzso that would be more specific for the targeted cells and that would have better labeling specificity in zzso The combined results point to the promising potential of the novel zzso zzso as a molecular imaging agent for in zzso monitoring of zzso cells or other zzso
