Three zzso complexes of the general formula zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso by zzso in zzso the corresponding zzso zzso with the free zzso zzso zzso acid, using a Dean and Stark water zzso The zzso was derived from the reaction of the corresponding zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the presence of sodium hydrogen zzso The isolated free zzso and its respective zzso compounds have been characterized by zzso analysis, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The crystal structures of the zzso complexes have been confirmed by single crystal X-ray zzso zzso The investigations carried out on the zzso complexes of zzso zzso acid confirmed a zzso zzso The complex formation took place through the zzso via the zzso oxygen and subsequent zzso zzso group to the tin zzso The crystal structures of three zzso complexes were determined and were found to adopt six coordination zzso at the tin zzso with coordination to two zzso zzso
