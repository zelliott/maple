zzso is a risk factor for breast cancer, and low blood zzso of zzso are associated with high zzso and poor prognosis of breast zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying such zzso effects of zzso remain to be zzso By using zzso cells, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the zzso effects of zzso on breast cancer cells, particularly in the context of opposing zzso zzso We found that zzso at 20 and 40 zzso reduced zzso cell growth in the absence and presence of zzso These zzso effects were primarily the result of the significant increase of cells at zzso phase and zzso decrease of cells at S zzso In addition, the percentage of zzso cells increased more than zzso Within zzso of zzso addition, the zzso of zzso was sharply zzso and the level of zzso zzso was zzso zzso exposure to zzso resulted in reduction of zzso D1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso also increased zzso levels of zzso and the activity of protein zzso zzso The zzso of zzso completely abolished the zzso effects on cell zzso In conclusion, our studies revealed an important cellular mechanism underlying the relationship between reduced zzso zzso and breast cancer zzso
