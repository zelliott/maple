zzso transition zzso promotes and zzso migration and invasion of zzso tumor zzso zzso is induced by factors such as zzso growth factor zzso This study aimed to establish whether the zzso zzso is associated with gastric cancer zzso especially zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression and zzso molecules were evaluated using real-time zzso and zzso The role of the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso was determined, and zzso inhibitor zzso was tested for its ability to block zzso biological zzso In zzso zzso gastric cancer cells, zzso zzso promoted an zzso zzso that was characterized by zzso impaired zzso and induction of zzso zzso promoted cell growth, zzso and migration and zzso of zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso and biological effects in zzso In zzso zzso gastric cancer cells, zzso did not affect the biological outcome of zzso and zzso but zzso exerted the same zzso effects as in zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso gastric cancer cells only established zzso dissemination and zzso inhibited tumor zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly correlated with zzso expression in gastric zzso Increased zzso and zzso had a significant association with poor prognosis and predicted zzso zzso We demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in gastric cancer zzso zzso of zzso and zzso has the potential to promote zzso dissemination in gastric zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso could be clinically useful for the treatment of zzso dissemination in gastric zzso
