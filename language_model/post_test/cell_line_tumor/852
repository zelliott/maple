We investigated the relationship between the tumor zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso marker, zzso zzso IX zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells displayed similar induction of zzso expression and zzso promoter activity under hypoxic zzso zzso of zzso by the DNA damaging agent zzso C zzso was accompanied by a potent repression of zzso expression and the zzso promoter in zzso but not in zzso zzso The activated zzso zzso increased zzso degradation of zzso zzso resulting in considerably lower zzso levels of zzso protein in hypoxic zzso cells but not in zzso zzso zzso of zzso relieved the zzso repression in zzso cells, confirming regulation at the zzso zzso Similarly, zzso promoter activity was zzso by zzso in zzso 116 zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso protein levels by accelerated zzso degradation without affecting significantly zzso zzso In zzso our results demonstrate that the presence of zzso under hypoxic conditions has an insignificant effect on the stabilization of zzso protein and zzso expression of zzso However, upon zzso by DNA damage, zzso zzso mediates an accelerated degradation of zzso zzso resulting in reduced zzso of zzso zzso and, zzso decreased levels of zzso zzso A model outlining the quantitative relationship between zzso zzso and zzso is zzso
