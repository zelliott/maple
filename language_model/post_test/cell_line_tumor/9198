zzso has been implicated as a zzso factor zzso the zzso zzso mechanism against zzso We examined the in zzso and in zzso properties of a new human embryonic zzso zzso cell line carrying the human zzso gene zzso Adult zzso rats underwent experimental stroke initially and 14 days later were assigned randomly to receive zzso transplantation of zzso cells or infusion of vehicle into their zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells promoted significant zzso of behavioral zzso over a zzso period after stroke, characterized by decreased hyperactivity, biased swing activity, and zzso deficits, as well as significant reduction in zzso zzso cell loss compared to zzso stroke zzso zzso zzso cells survived and expressed zzso zzso markers in the zzso zzso In zzso results showed that cultured zzso cells were already negative for zzso even before zzso acid treatment, despite strong zzso zzso in zzso zzso This indicates zzso triggered a rapid commitment of zzso cells into a zzso zzso Indeed, zzso cells, at 4 weeks into zzso treatment, displayed more abundant zzso zzso positive cells than zzso zzso Parallel zzso studies showed further that cultured zzso but not zzso cells, zzso zzso cell derived zzso zzso The present study shows efficacy of zzso cell zzso in zzso stroke, with in zzso evidence suggesting the zzso excellent zzso differentiation capability and ability to zzso zzso as likely mechanisms zzso the observed therapeutic zzso
