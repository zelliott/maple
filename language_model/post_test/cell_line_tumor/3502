zzso and zzso factors and zzso signaling pathways are targets for therapeutic development of zzso zzso zzso zzso is an inhibitor of zzso calcium influx and zzso zzso signal zzso zzso The present study investigates the effects of zzso on human transitional cancer cell zzso viability and zzso and evaluates whether zzso resistance may be overcome zzso Both zzso zzso zzso 1) and zzso zzso 3; zzso 4) human zzso lines were shown to express zzso Upon exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso only zzso zzso lines underwent zzso cell zzso zzso exposure reduced cell viability and caused an at least additive zzso effect in combination with the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Under the same conditions under which zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso it was shown to reduce zzso zzso zzso This response to zzso indicates that zzso cell death is enhanced by the reduction of zzso protein zzso We suggest that the zzso effect of zzso is at least partially based on restoring a zzso of zzso It may cause transformation of cell zzso that leads to the zzso of zzso mechanisms, thus allowing highly zzso tumor cells to re-enter the zzso course of cell zzso
