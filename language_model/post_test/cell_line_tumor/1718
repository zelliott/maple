Novel zzso derivatives of zzso have been zzso zzso and evaluated as potential cancer zzso zzso The most active zzso zzso exhibited zzso effect against zzso and zzso cell lines with zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Further investigation on tube formation zzso in human vein zzso cells zzso demonstrated that 1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso possess zzso activity, with minimum effective dose of 25 zzso (for 1) and zzso zzso (for zzso The zzso of 1 and 6 were found to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results from in zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated the zzso zzso of 1 over other zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of 1 against zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso 36 zzso was comparable to that of zzso The binding mode of 1 from zzso simulation in the zzso active site revealed that the zzso motif formed hydrogen bonding with zzso zzso and zzso in zzso pocket of zzso zzso 1 is considered as a potential lead for further zzso
