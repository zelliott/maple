A key point for successful transplantation of zzso zzso stem cells in the treatment of leukemia is the zzso technique, of which zzso therapy zzso proved effective and zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso effect of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zinc zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Bone zzso cells zzso harvested from normal zzso mice, were contaminated with variable zzso zzso Cell suspensions were incubated with 4 zzso zzso for 5 h and then exposed to zzso zzso zzso by a semiconductor laser 670 zzso zzso zzso recipient zzso mice (7 zzso received zzso bone zzso transplantation with zzso or zzso cell zzso of zzso zzso contaminated with variable numbers zzso of zzso zzso All of the zzso controls died due to zzso All of the mice injected with zzso cell zzso developed leukemia and died, whereas the mice transplanted with zzso zzso had a longer survival time, and the fewer zzso cells there were in the cell zzso the higher the zzso survival zzso We conclude that zzso could purge zzso cells from bone zzso zzso but could retain sufficient zzso cells for the zzso zzso
