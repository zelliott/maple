zzso zzso repeat domain zzso proteins are involved in regulation of zzso zzso metabolism and translation and are required for zzso zzso We investigated an zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso protein of the small zzso 27 zzso and show that it associates with the zzso zzso and zzso however it does not affect their zzso We found that zzso is not required for zzso zzso processing or the stability of the small zzso zzso However, zzso is required for zzso protein synthesis and its zzso causes decreased abundance in respiratory complexes and zzso c zzso zzso
