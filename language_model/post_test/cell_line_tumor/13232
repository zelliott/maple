The zzso controlled tumor protein zzso plays a role in cell growth, cell cycle and cancer zzso zzso controls zzso the stability of the zzso tumor zzso protein and interacts with the cellular zzso The deregulation of the zzso and zzso zzso is responsible for the increased migratory activity of tumor cells and is linked with poor patient zzso Recent studies indicate that zzso zzso key regulator of cell cycle, controls zzso organization and zzso regulates cell zzso via regulation of zzso zzso We studied the organization of zzso and zzso zzso and the expression of zzso zzso A, zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso and zzso zzso low level of zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer cells with different zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses illustrated a dramatic difference in the organization of the zzso and zzso filaments in zzso versus cancer cell zzso We also determined that there is an inverse relationship between the level of zzso and zzso A expression in zzso cancer cell zzso This previously unidentified negative relationship between zzso and zzso A may suggest that this interaction is linked with the high aggressiveness of zzso zzso
