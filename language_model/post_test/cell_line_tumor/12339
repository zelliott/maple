Human lung cancer cell lines are widely used to test zzso zzso These zzso tests, however, zzso the detection of responses to zzso factors from surrounding zzso We have zzso pulmonary zzso zzso from a healthy zzso or zzso from a patient with zzso zzso of the zzso with two human pulmonary zzso cell lines to test the hypothesis that the zzso stimulate the growth of the tumor zzso Both zzso cell lines significantly increased the proliferation of the pulmonary zzso cell lines in zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso yielding the most pronounced zzso The proliferation of the pulmonary zzso cell lines in zzso with zzso was blocked by zzso against the transforming growth zzso and zzso In addition, reverse zzso chain reaction showed expression of zzso for zzso and transforming growth zzso in all cell lines, whereas zzso for the zzso growth factor was detected only in pulmonary zzso cell zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that medium containing growth factors released by each zzso cell line activated zzso zzso zzso 1/2 in the both tested pulmonary zzso cell lines, but activated zzso zzso only in zzso zzso Assessment of protein levels for zzso D1 and zzso E by Western blots demonstrated pronounced increases of both proteins in each pulmonary zzso cell line, whereas protein levels for zzso zzso inhibitor zzso remained zzso zzso analysis showed positive zzso for zzso zzso zzso 1/2, zzso D1 and zzso E in pulmonary zzso cells zzso with zzso or exposed to zzso zzso Our data suggest that the growth of pulmonary zzso is zzso by zzso and transforming growth zzso released from pulmonary zzso This may contribute to the disappointing clinical responses to zzso drugs, which have shown promise in tests with lung cancer cell zzso
