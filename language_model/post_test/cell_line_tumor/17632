zzso is zzso by gene zzso in zzso of familial breast and zzso zzso zzso is primarily a nuclear zzso although others previously reported zzso zzso in breast tumor zzso In this study, we demonstrate the zzso zzso of zzso caused by a zzso of clinically relevant cancer zzso We show that zzso that disrupt or delete the zzso zzso zzso but not other regions of zzso caused significant zzso of zzso from nucleus to zzso Two of the zzso zzso tested zzso and zzso are known to adversely affect zzso protein folding and nuclear zzso The zzso zzso reduced zzso nuclear import by a mechanism consistent with altered protein zzso as indicated by the restoration of nuclear zzso by more extensive zzso zzso Furthermore, we observed increased zzso zzso of both the zzso and zzso forms of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso Unlike zzso zzso the zzso zzso failed to form DNA zzso zzso when targeted to the nucleus by zzso We propose that zzso zzso alter nuclear targeting of zzso and that this may contribute to the zzso of nuclear DNA repair and zzso zzso
