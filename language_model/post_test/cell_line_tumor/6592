The zzso regulatory element zzso is considered to enhance zzso B virus zzso gene expression by zzso the nuclear export of zzso viral zzso zzso Its role in the zzso metabolism of the viral zzso zzso zzso is currently zzso We identified a positively zzso zzso regulatory element zzso and present two lines of evidence for its zzso zzso in a zzso context zzso functionally zzso for a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso As expected, zzso is a zzso zzso also in its natural viral sequence context, since deletion of zzso reduces zzso of zzso in cell culture zzso zzso we show that stimulation of zzso zzso zzso by the zzso factor zzso was zzso by the zzso Analysis of a variety of zzso zzso indicated that zzso and zzso interaction were required to enhance zzso In addition, we show that the zzso contributed to zzso stability, but has little influence on its nuclear zzso zzso we report for the first time that the zzso harbors zzso stimulating and zzso regulatory elements controlling processing of the viral zzso We discuss a model in which the regulation of zzso zzso depends on cellular factors interacting with the zzso
