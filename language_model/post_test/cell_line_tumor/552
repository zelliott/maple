zzso zzso has been known to be a key player of the zzso of Parkinson's disease and has recently been detected in zzso biological zzso and shown to be rapidly zzso from zzso The penetration of zzso into cells has also been zzso In this study, we observed that zzso a zzso zzso and zzso K inhibited the zzso of zzso zzso zzso into zzso cells, and the addition of zzso zzso ameliorated the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not prevent the zzso of zzso but disruption of zzso raft inhibited zzso zzso of zzso and disruption of zzso and zzso structures also did not inhibit the zzso of zzso In addition, we further confirmed these observations by zzso system of zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso is zzso into zzso via zzso as well as zzso protein receptors in zzso zzso and zzso but zzso zzso zzso zzso of the mechanism involved in zzso of zzso should be greatly helpful in the development of new treatments of zzso neurodegenerative zzso
