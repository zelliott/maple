Proper assembly of zzso zzso requires zzso a zzso zzso zzso possesses direct zzso binding activity at its zzso region and contributes to zzso zzso nucleation as a zzso of the zzso zzso However, whether zzso binding activity of zzso is modulated by zzso regulators remains zzso Here, we found that zzso zzso a major zzso zzso specifically binds to and zzso zzso We identified four zzso clusters on zzso that can be zzso by zzso in zzso Of the four zzso the zzso cluster was the most critical for bipolar zzso zzso whereas other zzso point zzso had a minimal effect on zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso primarily zzso to zzso poles during zzso to zzso but gradually diminishes after zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso binding activity in zzso and diminished zzso to zzso in zzso Furthermore, expression of the zzso zzso led to decreased association of zzso an zzso zzso with zzso On the other hand, expression of the zzso zzso zzso permitted zzso nucleation but delayed the separation of early zzso zzso poles and the timely zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso zzso the zzso binding activity of zzso in a zzso manner for proper bipolar zzso zzso
