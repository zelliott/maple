zzso interference has promising therapeutic zzso However, safe and zzso delivery systems are necessary for its application in the zzso 

An zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 2000 zzso zzso was zzso and evaluated for small interfering zzso zzso delivery in zzso liver cancer cells zzso zzso with zzso The zzso properties of zzso complexes, their cellular zzso gene zzso activity based on zzso reporter gene zzso and zzso were zzso 

zzso complexes effectively delivered zzso into zzso cells and efficiently induced zzso of zzso reporter gene zzso Compared with free zzso and zzso zzso was significantly more effective, reducing zzso activity by zzso 

zzso warrants further evaluation for therapeutic delivery of zzso
