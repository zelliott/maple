There is widespread agreement that cancer gene discovery requires high-quality tumor zzso However, whether primary tumors or cultured samples are superior for cancer zzso has been a longstanding subject of zzso This debate has recently become more important because federally zzso cancer zzso has been zzso under The Cancer Genome Atlas, which has chosen to focus exclusively on primary zzso Here, we provide a zzso zzso on the effect of sample type selection on cancer zzso zzso We show that, in the case of zzso zzso primary tumors and zzso are best for the identification of zzso whereas zzso and cell lines are superior for the identification of zzso zzso We also note that many of the most important zzso and tumor zzso genes have been discovered through the use of cell lines and zzso and highlight the lack of published evidence supporting the dogma that ex zzso culture generates zzso genetic zzso Based on this analysis, we suggest that cancer zzso projects such as The Cancer Genome zzso should include a variety of sample types such as zzso and cell lines in their integrated zzso analysis of zzso
