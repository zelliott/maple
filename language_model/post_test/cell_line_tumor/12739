Cellular zzso is a major barrier to zzso zzso though its role in zzso of cancer and other diseases is poorly understood in zzso zzso understanding of the degree to which zzso zzso zzso persists in zzso might identify intervention strategies to provoke zzso zzso responses as a therapeutic zzso zzso involves convergence of multiple pathways and requires ongoing dynamic zzso throughout its establishment and zzso Recent discovery of several new markers allows for an expression profiling approach to study specific zzso zzso in relevant tissue zzso We adopted a zzso zzso methodology based on expression profiles of multiple zzso markers to examine the degree to which signals of zzso or zzso zzso persist in various human zzso 

We first show that scoring captures differential induction of damage or inflammatory pathways in a series of public zzso involving zzso of colon zzso chemotherapy of breast cancer cells, zzso zzso of zzso stem cells, and progression of zzso We extended these results to investigate correlations between zzso score and growth zzso in response to zzso compounds in the zzso zzso zzso of our own zzso zzso zzso highlighted differential expression of zzso zzso pathways between distinct zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso signature yielded by zzso zzso of zzso markers showed zzso significance in zzso 

We find that zzso zzso accurately reports zzso zzso in a variety of situations where zzso would be expected to occur and highlights differential expression of damage associated and zzso zzso pathways in a zzso zzso
