zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are characterized by zzso region zzso In contrast, this molecular event has not been reported in benign zzso Within the zzso zzso region, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes are the most frequent targets of zzso A series of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso for zzso and zzso gene amplification by real-time zzso zzso and zzso gene amplification was detected in zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of the two genes as well as a zzso amplification was observed more frequently in zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proved to be a fast and reliable method to characterize zzso and zzso by zzso of zzso and zzso gene zzso It is zzso to zzso zzso zzso and could be useful when zzso diagnosis is zzso
