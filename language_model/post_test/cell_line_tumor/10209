The zzso zzso factor, which was originally identified as a zzso zzso mediates zzso in response to DNA zzso As zzso zzso is an attractive mechanism for cancer therapy, it is critical to fully zzso its zzso zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso is zzso activated by zzso and mediates zzso zzso in response to DNA zzso Acting through the zzso and zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso activated the human zzso promoter, which contains zzso zzso zzso zzso depletion of zzso by small interfering zzso or zzso deletion led to zzso zzso zzso agents (which included zzso increased zzso levels, unless zzso was zzso Moreover, zzso zzso protein zzso directly with the zzso gene promoter in zzso particularly after zzso zzso zzso suppression of zzso expression using an zzso zzso technique attenuated the cell death zzso by zzso and zzso Although the zzso tumor zzso its sibling protein zzso and zzso are well-known zzso zzso for DNA zzso zzso zzso did not compromise their zzso zzso Our results collectively suggest that zzso is a novel zzso target of zzso that triggers a unique mode of cell death in response to DNA zzso
