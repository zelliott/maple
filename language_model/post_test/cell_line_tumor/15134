zzso expression and activity of zzso V zzso in zzso zzso zzso is a common early event involved in tumor invasion during zzso A better understanding of the functional role and the molecular mechanism for zzso protein and downstream signaling zzso behind zzso invasion and zzso is urgently zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso promoted zzso growth and inhibited zzso in zzso zzso This effect was reversed by zzso inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso II inhibitor zzso treatment and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso 1 zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso dead zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso inhibitor zzso zzso inhibitor III zzso treatment reversed zzso resistance in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and following zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso treatment declined zzso growth and zzso resistance, which could be rescued by zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduced zzso zzso resistance, which could be reversed by zzso zzso These results identified zzso zzso zzso zzso and following zzso of zzso as a potential novel upstream molecular event for zzso zzso resistance in zzso cells, implicating that molecular targeted zzso against zzso might open a new avenue for personalized medicine in zzso zzso zzso
