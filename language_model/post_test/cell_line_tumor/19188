zzso zzso is characterized by a dense background of tumor associated zzso originating from abundant pancreatic zzso zzso The aim of this study was to determine the effect of human pancreatic zzso cells zzso on pancreatic tumor zzso zzso were isolated from zzso pancreatic zzso samples and immortalized with zzso and zzso large T zzso zzso of zzso zzso medium zzso on in zzso zzso migration, invasion, zzso colony formation, and survival in the presence of zzso or radiation therapy were measured in two pancreatic cancer cell zzso The effects of zzso on tumors were examined in an zzso zzso model of pancreatic cancer by zzso them with cancer cells and analyzing growth and zzso zzso zzso increased zzso and zzso tumor cell zzso migration, invasion, and colony zzso Furthermore, zzso and radiation therapy were less effective in tumor cells treated with zzso zzso activated the zzso protein zzso and zzso pathways in tumor zzso zzso of tumor cells with zzso in an zzso model resulted in increased primary tumor zzso size, and zzso which corresponded with the proportion of zzso zzso produce soluble factors that stimulate signaling pathways related to proliferation and survival of pancreatic cancer cells, and the presence of zzso in tumors increases the growth and zzso of these zzso These data indicate that zzso cells have an important role in supporting and promoting pancreatic zzso Identification of zzso factors may lead to novel zzso therapies for pancreatic zzso
