Six new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso having zzso zzso zzso chain lengths and three different zzso zzso zzso where zzso is 4, 5 and 6) and investigated for their zzso behavior by state of the art techniques such as zzso zzso and zzso These new zzso zzso zzso exhibit lower zzso values as compared to other zzso zzso reported in zzso These zzso form stable complexes with DNA as established by zzso gel zzso and zzso zzso exclusion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was carried out in zzso on zzso zzso cell line for zzso assessment of new zzso zzso The dynamic light scattering zzso and transmission electron zzso zzso have been used to measure the zzso size of zzso zzso Further, zzso stability of these zzso has been evaluated by zzso analysis zzso The dependence of zzso behavior and other properties on zzso as well as zzso chain length has been zzso
