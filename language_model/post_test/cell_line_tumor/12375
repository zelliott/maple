zzso cancer cell lines have provided a valuable model to study zzso zzso cells in zzso Since the first development of zzso over 35 zzso ago, many different cell lines have been isolated and zzso One valuable cell line that maintains hormone responsiveness and unique stability over time is the zzso cell line, developed originally by the late zzso zzso In this study, we investigated some of the properties of these cells and present their salient zzso Like zzso cells, zzso cells maintain both zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso A and zzso zzso and zzso receptors zzso along with the zzso steroid zzso zzso zzso (formerly zzso zzso (formerly zzso and zzso (formerly zzso The zzso of these cells is zzso with multiple structural zzso in all cells zzso Unlike zzso cells that express zzso zzso zzso zzso cells maintain a zzso zzso with expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso differences in the regulation of zzso also were evident in zzso cells compared to zzso zzso Like other zzso cell lines, zzso cells express the steroid zzso zzso and exhibit zzso growth zzso expression of known zzso proteins thought to be involved in zzso including the zzso zzso zzso and zzso (formerly zzso and zzso zzso zzso These characteristics appear to be stable and persistent over multiple cell passages, making this zzso cell line an excellent choice to study zzso and zzso regulation of zzso zzso in zzso
