zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit a unique ability to degrade zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells, which contrasts with the effect of zzso drugs on zzso zzso This selective degradation might foster novel strategies for zzso treatment in light of the correlation of zzso zzso with the aggressive tumor zzso and zzso Here we report a novel zzso by which zzso zzso mediate zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso zzso activated zzso zzso zzso expression through increased association of zzso zzso zzso with the zzso gene zzso In turn, zzso facilitated the binding of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso by way of zzso zzso Furthermore, we identified zzso a zzso zzso zzso as the zzso zzso that targeted zzso for zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso or zzso reversed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that the zzso zzso motif plays a crucial role in regulating zzso protein zzso This motif contains the consensus recognition sites for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This study also reports the novel finding that zzso may be a target of zzso zzso Evidence suggests that zzso serves as a zzso zzso through zzso at zzso for zzso zzso at zzso This double zzso facilitated the recruitment of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso leading to its zzso zzso 

This study shows a novel zzso by which zzso zzso facilitate the selective degradation of zzso which zzso the complexity of the functional role of zzso in regulating zzso and aggressive zzso in zzso zzso
