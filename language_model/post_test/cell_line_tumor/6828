In this study, we characterize the zzso and specificity of a first-generation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and compare it with a second-generation zzso zzso zzso and an zzso interference zzso All three approaches resulted in zzso of both zzso expression and cellular zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was confirmed by comparison with zzso targeted against another zzso zzso zzso as well as mismatch zzso Cellular zzso studies with zzso zzso zzso revealed that whilst the majority of cells treated at a zzso zzso density were zzso within 3 zzso cells treated at high density demonstrated neither zzso protein knockout nor significant growth zzso following similar zzso This lack of response at high cell zzso was associated with reduced zzso and zzso zzso Cell cycle analysis revealed that whilst zzso cells both accumulated in the zzso of the cell cycle and showed enhanced zzso V levels, following zzso zzso zzso these effects were also demonstrated with first-generation but not second-generation mismatch zzso zzso incorporation analysis suggested that these effects may indeed be partly attributable to sequence zzso zzso Finally, the combination of zzso zzso with either zzso or zzso showed enhanced growth zzso supporting the view that such zzso may have a more effective clinical role when used in combination with zzso zzso
