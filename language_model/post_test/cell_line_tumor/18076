The poor prognosis for patients with advanced zzso relates partly to the inability to reverse cancer zzso In this study we have investigated an integrated zzso method against zzso zzso in three kinds of advanced cancer models including zzso melanoma, zzso breast zzso and zzso zzso The progression of zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso and internal zzso was, markedly zzso in the midway stage and reversed in the ultimate stage following a zzso course of intravenous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stem cells zzso administered once every 5 days P zzso zzso the therapy was without systemic toxic zzso As the control, obvious systemic toxicity was observed in the free zzso group, yet zzso was partly delayed only in the midway stage but not in the ultimate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso expression levels of zzso were enhanced by zzso zzso to be tenfold greater than that of free zzso groups in the ultimate zzso conversely, free zzso groups showed elevated serum, but not zzso levels of zzso during the midway zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis revealed a reductive tendency toward zzso of zzso zzso sprouts and an increased tumor zzso index in engineered zzso groups zzso zzso zzso These data indicate the potential of zzso zzso to be considered as an integrated therapeutic weapon for targeting advanced zzso
