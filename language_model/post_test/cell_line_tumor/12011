zzso cancer cells in zzso transplant tissue can cause zzso and the rates are zzso A method capable of removing all contaminant cells with a high probability detected by zzso analyses would be zzso Neither zzso cell zzso nor techniques for measuring the probability of success have been zzso Here, we report a method for removing zzso of the cells under ideal zzso conditions and zzso the probability of zzso 

zzso zzso was combined with previously reported automated zzso to purge contaminant cells and evaluate zzso zzso in a zzso model of zzso mouse melanoma cells mixed with mouse zzso zzso zzso passage efficiency was measured zzso zzso zzso single cells into zzso zzso and zzso zzso all but one melanoma cell in zzso 

zzso zzso zzso of single melanoma cells zzso into zzso plate zzso divided at least zzso With zzso of all but one contaminant cell in zzso melanoma dominated in (62 zzso zzso cultures in 21 zzso With zzso zzso in six additional experiments, no melanoma outgrowth was observed, giving a zzso probability that all contaminant melanoma cells were zzso 

We successfully demonstrated a model for complete zzso within a defined probability using automated zzso image zzso with ideal zzso zzso The results show that the zzso is capable of delivering zzso zzso at a defined probability and establishes the basis for further studies with clinical models wherein zzso zzso analyses of unique cellular expression and/or zzso characteristics will be key for contaminant cancer cell zzso
