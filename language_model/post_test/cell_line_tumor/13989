The zzso of zzso which zzso the outgrowth of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the rat zzso on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity zzso of zzso gene expression zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso formation was studied in a human colon tumor zzso cell line zzso zzso Cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso and intact colon tumor cells were zzso The zzso activity in zzso 205 cells was inhibited by zzso in a zzso and time zzso manner in both examined zzso The data also indicated that zzso decreased the apparent value of zzso of zzso zzso being a competitive inhibitor of zzso zzso The zzso zzso formation in zzso 205 cells was also decreased by zzso Based on the results from zzso it was shown that zzso affected zzso zzso expression in human colon zzso 205 zzso The cells were stained with zzso zzso then analyzed by flow zzso The results showed that zzso decreased the percentage of cells stained by zzso This report is the first to demonstrate that zzso zzso human colon tumor cell zzso activity, gene expression and DNA zzso zzso
