In this study, we expressed and zzso zzso green fluorescent protein zzso that we used to study its combination with zzso acid and its cell zzso efficiency as carrier of zzso We transformed zzso zzso into zzso coli zzso zzso then expressed and zzso the target zzso We used the protein to zzso a variety of zzso cell lines including zzso cells, zzso cells, zzso cells and zzso cells at specified protein zzso zzso efficiency of the protein was analyzed by flow zzso Under laser scanning zzso zzso we observed visually zzso efficiency of zzso protein zzso zzso to zzso zzso We incubated zzso with zzso DNA and analyzed their binding ability with gel mobility shift zzso Then we zzso cells with the mixture of zzso zzso protein at various ratio and detected the expression of reporter gene by using laser scanning zzso microscope and flow zzso The experimental results demonstrate that zzso had high zzso efficiency, and as the concentration increased, the efficiency improved in a zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso indicates that zzso could bind to zzso DNA, blocking the migration of DNA in the gel in a zzso zzso After the zzso wrapped by zzso penetrated into cells, the cells could express target protein zzso proving that zzso had the ability to carry zzso acids into zzso zzso expression and zzso of zzso protein confirms its high efficiency of cell zzso and its ability as carrier to deliver zzso zzso acids into zzso
