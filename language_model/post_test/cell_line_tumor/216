We found that the expression levels of zzso zzso zzso were low in aggressive breast cancer cell lines when compared with less aggressive cell zzso However, the lower levels in the aggressive lines were zzso by zzso zzso Because zzso has been reported to be a zzso zzso that zzso zzso induced zzso activity, we decided to test whether zzso regulates expression of zzso which is also zzso by zzso We established stable clones zzso expressing zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso zzso was significantly zzso in the zzso expressing clones concurrent with reduced levels of the critical zzso zzso of zzso pathway, zzso Treatment of the zzso zzso with blocking zzso to zzso restored zzso protein zzso zzso is a known downstream target of activated zzso zzso Treatment of zzso zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso resulted in elevated zzso levels with zzso zzso of zzso zzso Our functional studies showed that zzso expression of zzso reduced the ability of tumor cells for the invasion, zzso independent growth and tumor growth in zzso zzso the data suggest that zzso of zzso zzso the zzso signaling via zzso of zzso and zzso tumor zzso
