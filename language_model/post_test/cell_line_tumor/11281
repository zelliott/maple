zzso zzso zzso zzso by red blood cell membrane zzso zzso the combined advantage of both long circulation lifetime and controlled drug zzso The authors carried out studies to gain a better understanding of the drug zzso zzso zzso and zzso efficacy of zzso zzso 

Two strategies for loading zzso into the zzso zzso were zzso physical zzso and chemical zzso In zzso efficacy was examined using the acute zzso leukemia cell line, zzso 

It was found that the chemical zzso strategy resulted in a more sustained drug release profile, and that the zzso zzso provided a barrier, zzso the outward diffusion of zzso drug zzso It was also demonstrated that zzso zzso exhibit higher toxicity in comparison with free zzso 

These results indicate that the zzso zzso hold great promise to become a valuable zzso platform for the treatment of various diseases such as blood zzso
