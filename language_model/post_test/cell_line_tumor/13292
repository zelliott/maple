zzso zzso is a toxic and zzso metal which zzso a zzso imbalance following zzso zzso Nuclear factor zzso related factor 2 zzso is a zzso factor that regulates zzso status and consequently mediates zzso responses against exposure to environmental zzso In this study, we investigated the protective roles of the zzso gene against zzso stress and DNA damage induced by zzso at zzso zzso Under zzso exposure conditions, we detected significantly increased zzso zzso generation, in addition to higher amounts of DNA damage using comet zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso lacking cells, as compared to zzso zzso zzso In addition, we attempted to identify potential zzso and zzso targets and the relevant zzso The zzso expression data were analyzed using zzso for the selection of synergistic zzso genes by zzso zzso under zzso zzso In particular, altered expressions of 6 zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and 4 zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso were confirmed by zzso Additionally, using zzso zzso we found that these genes functioned principally in a variety of molecular zzso including zzso stress response, zzso DNA repair and cell zzso Thus, we describe the potential zzso regarded as molecular candidates for zzso cellular protection against zzso zzso In conclusion, these findings indicate that zzso is an important factor with a protective role in the suppression of zzso and zzso by environmental zzso exposure in terms of zzso zzso
