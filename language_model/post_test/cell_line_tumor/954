zzso zzso is associated with the production and release of zzso oxygen species zzso which are capable of zzso zzso modification of zzso zzso zzso In the present study we questioned whether cellular capacity to zzso LDL increases during in zzso zzso zzso We developed a novel model for zzso maturation in zzso using mouse zzso zzso zzso harvested at increasing intervals after zzso zzso zzso zzso maturation was evidenced by a progressive increase in cellular size, density, zzso and expression of cell surface markers zzso and zzso and by a gradual zzso in zzso zzso Cellular capacity to stimulate copper zzso zzso of LDL increased gradually by up to zzso during in zzso zzso maturation in zzso mice, similar to the pattern observed during zzso zzso in zzso differentiation of the zzso cell zzso These effects were attributed to a gradual increase in production of zzso by up to zzso The mechanism for the increase in cellular zzso stress during zzso maturation could be zzso at least in part, to zzso zzso zzso as demonstrated by a gradual increase over time in zzso expression zzso and zzso and in its zzso to the plasma zzso In conclusion, in zzso zzso differentiation is associated with increased cell capacity to zzso LDL, which may represent a protective mechanism for rapid removal of zzso LDL from zzso spaces in the zzso zzso
