The essential regulators in the zzso of classical zzso zzso zzso are still largely zzso The zzso zzso zzso cells of zzso zzso various zzso leading to the zzso of signaling pathways such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso In this study, we investigate the role of distinct zzso zzso components in the regulation of proliferation and survival of zzso cell zzso zzso mobility shift zzso and western zzso analysis revealed that the zzso status of zzso family members varies in different zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso blocked the zzso of most of the zzso family zzso This was accompanied with a strong zzso effect and enhanced death of the treated zzso cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso expression decreased cell proliferation and induced zzso zzso of zzso and zzso resulted in a proliferation arrest of cells with limited zzso amount of these negative regulators, but not in cells that already express high amounts of zzso and zzso Our findings highlight the importance of zzso in zzso transformation and suggest zzso and zzso as potential targets for therapeutic intervention in distinct forms of zzso
