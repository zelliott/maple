zzso promoter zzso and repressive zzso constitutes a frequent mechanism of gene zzso in zzso There is great interest in zzso the mechanisms underlying this abnormal zzso Studies have shown changes in the nuclear organization of zzso in tumor cells as well as the association of zzso zzso with long-range zzso of neighboring zzso Furthermore, certain tumors show a high zzso of promoter zzso termed as the zzso island zzso zzso Here, we have analyzed the role of nuclear zzso architecture for genes in zzso inactive versus zzso active states and its relation with long-range zzso and zzso island zzso zzso Using combined zzso for zzso zzso marks and zzso in zzso zzso in zzso cancer cell lines, we show that zzso zzso of these genes occurs without requirement for their being positioned at zzso zzso zzso zzso even when associated with long-range zzso zzso of neighboring zzso occurs independent of their zzso or zzso zzso Together, these results indicate that, in cancer, extensive changes around promoter zzso of individual genes or gene clusters could potentially occur locally without preference for nuclear position and/or causing zzso These findings have important implications for understanding relationships between nuclear organization and gene expression patterns in zzso
