Because treatment regimens for breast cancer commonly include zzso we evaluated two promising combinations in zzso zzso zzso zzso Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, zzso with either zzso radiation or zzso zzso zzso Pharmaceuticals, zzso zzso zzso In breast cancer cell lines that expressed either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso sensitivity to the zzso effects of zzso during a 24-hour incubation was similar zzso values 80 and 60 zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Both cell lines were well zzso by zzso at the corresponding zzso with radiation enhancement ratios of zzso to zzso Although the zzso cells accumulated nearly twice as much zzso zzso compared with the zzso cells, a similar reduction in zzso zzso pools was zzso While the number of dying cells, as measured by zzso DNA content or zzso cells unable to replicate DNA, differed between the zzso zzso or zzso zzso cell lines, neither zzso correlated with zzso zzso was a more potent zzso agent than zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso 1 zzso Strong synergistic zzso was observed in cells treated with zzso (24 zzso followed by zzso (24 zzso or the reverse zzso However, simultaneous addition of the two drugs was zzso To determine whether zzso with radiation or zzso was zzso by increased DNA damage, DNA zzso breaks zzso zzso were measured by zzso for zzso zzso zzso radiation produced more zzso breaks than zzso alone, while no significant zzso breaks formed with zzso zzso The addition of zzso or zzso radiation to zzso cells did not increase zzso zzso zzso These results show that the combination of zzso with zzso radiation or zzso produces strong, zzso zzso in breast cancer cells that is not zzso through increasing DNA zzso zzso
