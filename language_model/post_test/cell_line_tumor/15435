We have developed a zzso zzso zzso zzso system for the combined tumor imaging and targeted delivery of the zzso zzso zzso gene in a single zzso zzso Here, we characterize and analyze the use of this system in a mouse model of breast zzso 

The zzso and cell zzso properties of zzso were determined through a series of in zzso zzso A nude zzso cancer cell line zzso model zzso zzso zzso was used to image the tumor zzso of zzso labeled zzso The clinical use of the system was tested by treating zzso mice with zzso loaded with zzso zzso DNA or fluorescent zzso 

The resulting zzso zzso zzso potential zzso zzso zzso displayed serum resistance, low zzso zzso and high zzso efficiency zzso in cultured zzso zzso intravenous administration of fluorescent zzso in the mouse zzso model resulted in zzso circulation for 72 hours, as well as selective and efficient zzso in tumor cells, according to in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso increased gradually up to 26 hours, whereas background zzso decreased to zzso zzso Treatment of mice with zzso zzso zzso suppressed tumor growth in mice by zzso on day 50 and increased the mean survival time of zzso Fluorescent zzso zzso showed good properties for simultaneous zzso imaging and zzso delivery in an animal tumor zzso 

Our developed zzso zzso system possesses promising characteristics for zzso imaging, and gene therapy zzso
