zzso cancer zzso relies on the identification and characterization of target zzso and the development of potent zzso recognizing the zzso Here we report the expression analysis and molecular characterization of the differentiation zzso zzso which we previously identified by using the zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso show that zzso is strongly expressed in zzso of 129 breast zzso Application of a zzso specific zzso demonstrated zzso expression in primary and zzso breast zzso In contrast, most of the breast cancer cell lines tested, expressed only low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso expressed zzso zzso to the zzso and the cell zzso zzso zzso in breast cancer specimens was also confirmed by zzso zzso analysis and deletion zzso further show that zzso membrane zzso is zzso by 2 zzso membrane targeting zzso zzso surface labeling and zzso analysis of live cells further characterize zzso as a zzso zzso which can be specifically recognized by the zzso zzso on the surface of vital zzso The strong expression of zzso in breast tumors, its zzso and membrane zzso and accessibility to an zzso applied zzso now suggest to pursue zzso as a potential target for zzso therapies in breast cancer zzso
