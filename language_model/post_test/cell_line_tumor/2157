zzso cancer is the eighth most common zzso and sixth leading cause of cancer deaths in the zzso Recent studies have shown the potential role of the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso in tumor zzso however, little is known about its role in zzso zzso cell zzso In the present study, we evaluated zzso expression in zzso tumor zzso as well as cell lines and investigated the effects of zzso zzso by its zzso zzso on zzso zzso cell zzso invasion using zzso and zzso cells as a zzso 

Western zzso was performed to detect the zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso migration zzso were carried out to study the effects of zzso on zzso zzso cell zzso cell zzso zzso zzso was used to knock down the expression of zzso zzso 

Our results showed that zzso was highly expressed in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and cell lines when compared with its expression in normal zzso zzso zzso robustly decreased zzso protein expression in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited invasion of human zzso zzso cell zzso cells via zzso of zzso 

The obtained results provide critical information on the roles of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso This information could be useful for future therapeutic intervention in this lethal human zzso
