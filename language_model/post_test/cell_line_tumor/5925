We have developed a zzso zzso zzso for delivery of small interfering zzso zzso to the zzso The zzso were designed to be transported into zzso via the zzso zzso which recognizes zzso zzso The zzso contained a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso by the zzso was evaluated by measuring the zzso activity of zzso : zzso complexes in two human zzso cell zzso A zzso with a zzso zzso : zzso ratio of 3 : 5 by weight, zzso showed the strongest zzso In mice, intravenous injection of zzso zzso with zzso zzso led to zzso of zzso in the zzso When the zzso cellular zzso was determined after intravenous injection into mice followed by zzso liver zzso the distribution of zzso to zzso cells was zzso times higher when zzso rather than zzso zzso was used as the zzso The concentration of zzso accumulated was 45 zzso 30 times the concentration that produced strong gene zzso in zzso and therefore presumably sufficient for a therapeutic zzso Because increasing the zzso content of a zzso carrier generally enhances the zzso of zzso by the liver at the expense of increased cell zzso we used only a moderate amount of zzso zzso in our zzso zzso zzso enhanced the zzso of zzso by the liver without zzso effects and is a promising candidate delivery system for zzso zzso zzso
