zzso zzso resonance zzso zzso has been used to develop and zzso a novel and quantitative zzso zzso for living cell zzso This highly sensitive method derives from two factors for zzso signal zzso the addition of zzso zzso and the resonance effect by zzso zzso of zzso The results show that the background zzso such as excessive zzso zzso serum, and the drug, did not interfere with the detection of zzso Moreover, the detection limit of zzso is as low as 1 zzso With the use of this method to zzso metabolically viable cells, zzso zzso of treated and zzso cells with the drug were constructed on the human lung cancer cell zzso The results also show that the zzso signal generated is dependent on the degree of zzso of the zzso In comparison to the traditional method, the main advantages of this method are its zzso (30 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso without time-consuming steps and any zzso or labeling zzso This work reports on an improved research tool that may help researchers apply this method for in zzso cell zzso
