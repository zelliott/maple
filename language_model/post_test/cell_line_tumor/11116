The combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso is currently used in the treatment of advanced zzso zzso When compared to both agents alone, zzso followed by zzso treatment demonstrated a synergistic zzso This observation can be related to increased in zzso induction after zzso zzso Several studies have demonstrated that changes in zzso membrane potential occur earlier in zzso In this study, we verified whether the collapse in zzso membrane and the zzso of zzso is responsible for increased zzso observed with zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso human colon zzso cell lines were exposed for 24 h to each drug alone, and to various combinations and treatment zzso and assessed for colony formation, changes in the zzso membrane potential, and the activities of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso treatment induced zzso in both cell zzso however, the most pronounced effect was observed in zzso zzso In these cells, both zzso and -9 were involved in the zzso of zzso after zzso zzso Moreover, in these cells, a reduction of 50% in zzso membrane potential was observed with this zzso On the other hand, in the zzso cell line in addition to zzso zzso zzso seems to be important to zzso after zzso zzso Furthermore, in this cell line we did not observe zzso in zzso membrane zzso In spite of the differences among the cell lines, these results indicated that the increase in zzso in zzso cells observed with zzso followed by zzso treatment could be explained by a disruption in zzso membrane potential that induced zzso zzso
