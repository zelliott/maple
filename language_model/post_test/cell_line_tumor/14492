zzso zzso DNA was zzso to form DNA zzso for use as a sustained delivery system for both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso motifs for cancer zzso zzso DNA zzso was designed as a building unit, and underwent zzso to form DNA zzso Two types of zzso were constructed using four zzso each, one containing six potent zzso motifs zzso zzso and the other with none zzso zzso zzso zzso was more effective than its components or the zzso counterpart in terms of the production of tumor necrosis zzso from zzso zzso zzso cells, as well as maturation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso effects of zzso zzso and their complexes were examined in a zzso system of zzso cells, a zzso zzso clone zzso expressing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the highest ability to inhibit the proliferation of zzso zzso zzso was slowly released from zzso DNA zzso zzso of zzso DNA zzso into a subcutaneous zzso tumor effectively inhibited tumor zzso These results show that zzso DNA zzso are an effective sustained system for delivery of zzso signals to zzso immune cells and zzso to cancer zzso
