Many compounds in the cell nucleus are structurally zzso To assess the influence of structural organization on nuclear function, we investigated the physical mechanisms of structure formation by using molecular crowding as a zzso for nuclear zzso zzso crowding promotes zzso of zzso compounds depending on their size and shape without the need for zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were incubated with zzso medium to increase crowding of their zzso content as a result of the zzso loss of zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso to the growth medium shifted nuclear organization, observed by zzso and electron zzso towards zzso of zzso and segregation of other nuclear zzso With increasing zzso load and incubation time, this nuclear zzso proceeded zzso irrespective of the substances used, and zzso relaxed to a regular zzso upon zzso of cells in zzso growth zzso zzso and zzso zzso are major features of controlled zzso by molecular zzso Of fundamental importance for nuclear function, we discuss how zzso crowding could account for the stabilization of processes that involve large, zzso zzso
