zzso a zzso tumor zzso zzso is frequently zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso was developed as a vehicle to restore zzso gene expression in zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso egg zzso cholesterol and zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso of a zzso mimic to zzso cells zzso zzso target genes by zzso In zzso zzso zzso in zzso were zzso taken up by zzso and tumor cells in a mouse zzso zzso The zzso mimic in zzso was functional in zzso cells without causing systemic zzso To demonstrate its therapeutic potential, zzso zzso zzso mimic was zzso injected and resulted in zzso growth suppression of zzso zzso within 30 days, which correlated well with suppression of target genes and impairment of zzso These data demonstrate the potential of zzso zzso delivery as a novel strategy for zzso zzso 

In this study, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reported as a vehicle to restore zzso gene expression in zzso zzso cells by zzso and zzso delivery using a mouse zzso Further expansions to this study may enable transition to clinical trials of this zzso
