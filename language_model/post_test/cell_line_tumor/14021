To construct a shuttle zzso zzso of fused zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso gene and enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso gene driven by human zzso growth factor II zzso zzso promoter, and investigate the special killing effect of the zzso zzso system on zzso zzso zzso zzso 

An zzso shuttle zzso zzso containing fused genes zzso and an zzso shuttle zzso zzso driven by zzso zzso promoter were constructed by techniques of gene zzso and zzso and identified by restriction zzso and sequencing zzso Human zzso zzso cells zzso and human cervical zzso cells zzso were cultured and zzso with these 2 zzso shuttle zzso zzso was used to detect the zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso of the final zzso of 0, 1, 10, and 100 zzso respectively was added into the culture fluid of the zzso cells zzso with zzso or zzso and zzso method was used to detect the cell zzso zzso 

zzso and sequencing analysis showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso Fluorescent zzso showed that zzso was expressed only in the zzso cells, but not in the zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso expression of zzso and zzso could be seen in both zzso and zzso cells zzso with zzso or zzso however, only in the zzso zzso zzso cells, but not in the zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso inhibited the 2 cancer cells, the zzso rates of zzso of the final zzso of 1, 10, and 100 zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cells, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso However, the zzso rates of the zzso zzso cells by zzso of the final zzso of 1, 10, and 100 zzso wee zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, all significantly lower than those of the zzso zzso cells (all P zzso zzso and no significant cell zzso was found in the zzso cells zzso with zzso 

A shuttle zzso zzso containing the zzso fusion protein gene driven by zzso zzso promoter has been constructed successfully and its specific expression in zzso cells provides a sound basis for targeted gene therapy for zzso
