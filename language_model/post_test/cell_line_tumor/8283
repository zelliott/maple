Growth of zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso has been known to be controlled by the interaction of zzso growth factor zzso and its zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso was previously found to interact with zzso and to inhibit zzso zzso zzso However, zzso of these cells, controlled by zzso and zzso was not zzso The present study is focused on the control mechanism of the zzso of these cells through interaction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Key results are as zzso zzso The level of zzso expressed in zzso cells is approximately 6 times higher than that expressed in zzso cells, and zzso of zzso cells is also much higher than that of zzso cells, yet growth of zzso cells is either not affected or is inhibited by zzso In contrast, growth of zzso cells is enhanced by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressed in zzso cells are much higher than those expressed in zzso cells, and zzso expressed in zzso cells are reduced by treatment of cells with zzso which zzso the synthesis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso are zzso with zzso in both zzso and zzso cells, indicating that zzso are closely associated with zzso zzso High zzso of zzso cells is greatly reduced, while low zzso of zzso cells is not affected, by treatment of cells with zzso These results, taken together, suggest that there is a close correlation between high zzso of zzso cells and high expression of zzso and zzso and between zzso zzso and zzso A similar correlation was suggested between the low zzso of zzso cells and low levels of zzso and zzso The correlation between high zzso and high level of zzso with the zzso complex in zzso cells is zzso This is in contrast to our previous studies that indicate that zzso of many types of tumor cells is inhibited by a high level of zzso or zzso together with growth factor receptors and zzso
