The zzso signaling has been implicated in uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor progression in pancreatic zzso The purpose of this study is to evaluate the zzso activity of zzso inhibitor zzso in combination with zzso inhibitor zzso zzso in pancreatic cancer zzso Western zzso showed that zzso caused a zzso to zzso transient zzso of zzso signaling in pancreatic cancer zzso The zzso sustained for 6 h before zzso zzso zzso The selective zzso inhibitor zzso completely abolished zzso induced zzso zzso and resulted in more than zzso of zzso degradation after only 15 zzso zzso Moreover, zzso had complementary effect on zzso regulated zzso and cell cycle related zzso Although zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso it led to zzso A and zzso zzso which was reversed by the addition of zzso zzso zzso showed that combination of zzso and zzso resulted in synergistic zzso zzso More importantly, zzso alone only exhibited moderate zzso of cell migration in zzso while addition of zzso dramatically enhanced the zzso effect by zzso to zzso Taken together, these data demonstrate that zzso inhibitor zzso zzso the activity of zzso inhibitor zzso against pancreatic cancer zzso The combination of zzso and zzso zzso could provide a promising avenue for the treatment of pancreatic zzso
