zzso derived zzso stem cells zzso have the potential to differentiate into zzso zzso The aim of the study was to investigate the induction process of zzso by zzso melanoma cells in zzso and to analyze the role of zzso in the zzso 

A zzso system containing zzso and zzso melanoma cells based on zzso indirect model was established, and the induction process of zzso by zzso melanoma cells was studied in zzso 

zzso were isolated from the bone zzso of zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and acquired zzso of zzso zzso markers including zzso zzso and Factor VIII after zzso with zzso melanoma cells for 48 zzso The expression level of zzso would be double and Factor VIII zzso more by extending the zzso time to 72 zzso In the zzso system, zzso melanoma cells also zzso the expression of zzso 

zzso plays a significant role in the differentiation of zzso into cells of zzso zzso therefore, is important to tumor zzso
