zzso promoters for use in zzso zzso zzso are valuable for zzso specific gene functions and for use in gene zzso However, low activity, zzso expression and size limitations in the zzso are always zzso Here, we developed a zzso zzso containing the zzso gene under the control of an zzso promoter near the right end of its zzso and bearing a compact zzso unit consisting of a target zzso zzso of a potent promoter between two zzso near the left end of its zzso When zzso was zzso the expression unit was excised as a circular zzso and strongly zzso zzso leak expression of zzso during virus preparation was completely suppressed by a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso against zzso Using this novel zzso a very strict specificity was maintained while achieving a zzso to zzso higher expression level, compared with that zzso using a direct specific zzso zzso the zzso zzso enabled us to produce a zzso promoter in an zzso with a high expression level and strict zzso
