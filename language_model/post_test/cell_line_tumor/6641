zzso zzso is crucial for the generation of multiple zzso zzso zzso killer zzso zzso cells, and memory zzso T zzso and zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso cells has been suggested to be the dominant zzso process of these zzso We have previously shown that a natural soluble form of zzso alpha chain corresponding to the entire zzso domain of zzso alpha behaves as a high affinity zzso zzso In sharp contrast with this finding, we demonstrate in this report that a zzso soluble sushi domain of zzso zzso which bears most of the binding affinity for zzso behaves as a potent zzso zzso by enhancing its binding and biological effects zzso and protection from zzso through the zzso zzso zzso whereas it does not affect zzso binding and function of the zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso Our results suggest that, if naturally produced, such soluble sushi zzso might be involved in the zzso zzso zzso Fusion proteins zzso and zzso in which zzso and zzso zzso are attached by a flexible zzso are even more potent than the combination of zzso plus zzso zzso After binding to zzso zzso zzso is zzso and zzso a biological response very similar to the zzso high affinity zzso Such zzso fusion proteins appear to constitute potent zzso for the expansion of zzso zzso
