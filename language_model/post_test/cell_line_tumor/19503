zzso a fusion protein generated by the zzso zzso zzso is frequently associated with acute zzso leukemia zzso In addition to blocking zzso zzso is also shown to induce growth arrest in zzso cells, which is zzso for zzso harboring the zzso zzso However, its precise mechanism is still zzso Here we provide the first demonstration that the conditional expression of zzso by the zzso system dramatically increases the expression of zzso 43 zzso together with growth arrest at zzso phase in zzso zzso zzso We also show that the zzso induction zzso the proliferation of zzso cells at zzso phase, while the suppression of zzso expression by small interfering zzso zzso effectively overcomes the zzso effect of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, either zzso or zzso induction zzso zzso negative regulator zzso protein by zzso its degradation, which is antagonized by zzso against zzso Taken together, our data indicate that zzso plays a role in zzso growth arrest possibly through the zzso of zzso zzso The potential zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and its related zzso deserve to be explored in zzso zzso zzso
