To develop a new toxic gene therapy using the zzso human zzso zzso zzso promoter for zzso zzso Although most patients presenting with zzso zzso tumor are cured through the use of chemotherapy with or without surgery, those patients with zzso after initial therapy present a difficult clinical zzso The serum tumor marker zzso is frequently elevated in patients with zzso cancer, and the zzso and zzso levels of serum zzso are highly zzso of treatment zzso 

Human zzso zzso zzso cell line, NEC 8, a human prostate cancer cell line, zzso and a human zzso cancer cell line, zzso were used in this zzso A transient expression experiment was used to analyze the activity of a zzso zzso promoter in all three cell zzso A zzso zzso carrying zzso zzso zzso under control of the zzso promoter was zzso The zzso activity of zzso was tested in zzso and in zzso 

The zzso promoter had significantly greater activity in the zzso cell line zzso 8) than in the zzso cell lines zzso and zzso In zzso zzso with zzso significantly inhibited NEC 8 growth but not zzso or zzso cell zzso In zzso zzso with zzso significantly inhibited NEC 8 subcutaneous tumor growth in nude zzso 

In this study, we explored the possibility of developing a new therapeutic agent to target and induce the killing of zzso germ cell tumor selectively by using zzso zzso zzso
