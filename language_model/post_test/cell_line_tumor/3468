zzso is a zzso factor that recognizes and binds zzso zzso zzso zzso to repress zzso zzso can associate with the zzso zzso zzso complex and mediate repression in a zzso zzso zzso In extracts from zzso zzso cultured cells, and zzso zzso zzso we find that only a small amount of zzso zzso interacts with zzso and that this interaction is not zzso zzso of rat brain zzso zzso zzso indicates no associated proteins despite an apparent molecular mass by size exclusion zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the large apparent size was not because of zzso as zzso consistently behaves as a zzso protein that has an zzso zzso Our findings indicate the zzso is not an zzso component of the zzso zzso complex and may therefore engage a more diverse range of zzso for repressive zzso
