zzso isolated from the aerial parts of zzso zzso was evaluated according to its capacity to interfere with zzso zzso cell zzso zzso cells were incubated with zzso zzso or zzso at zzso of 25, 50, and 100 zzso for 24, 48, and 72 zzso zzso and zzso affected zzso cell proliferation after treatment times of longer than 24 zzso However, increasing zzso of zzso inhibited 50% of zzso cell proliferation at 24 h and further reached nearly zzso zzso at 72 zzso This effect did not affect cell zzso cell zzso or zzso zzso levels, indicating that zzso did not induce zzso cell zzso A marked reduction in zzso D1 levels and an increase in zzso levels were observed when 100 zzso of zzso was added to zzso zzso Interestingly, nuclear zzso zzso observed in a zzso of zzso zzso cells was found in the zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso these data show that zzso reduces zzso cell growth without inducing zzso possibly by modulating the control of the cell zzso Our data also suggest that zzso signaling may be involved on the zzso activity of zzso
