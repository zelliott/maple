zzso fruit zzso zzso extract contains significant amounts of zzso compounds and exhibits powerful zzso activity against fat zzso in zzso The purpose of this study is to confirm the zzso activity of zzso extract on human breast cancer in zzso and in zzso and to zzso the mechanism of its zzso Human breast cancer cells were tested in zzso for zzso colony formation zzso zzso zzso and gene expression profiling after treatment with zzso zzso Seven nude mice bearing human breast zzso duct zzso zzso were tested for its zzso activity and expression of zzso in zzso by oral administration of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso crude zzso extract zzso for 10 zzso zzso extract demonstrated a zzso and zzso zzso effect on cell growth zzso zzso 80 zzso and it significantly inhibited colony formation and zzso incorporation of human breast cancer zzso zzso zzso analysis identified zzso zzso and 129 zzso zzso genes after zzso zzso zzso zzso the predominantly zzso genes were involved in various biological functions including cell cycle regulation and cell zzso zzso signal zzso and zzso regulation, and zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were mainly associated with zzso invasion, and zzso of cancer zzso A zzso tumor mass volume reduction and significant increase of zzso protein expression were observed in zzso zzso The findings in this study suggested that zzso extract might have potential zzso activity on both zzso positive and negative breast zzso which could be zzso in part, to its DNA damage effect, zzso zzso and zzso induction of cancer cells through zzso and zzso of multiple genes involved in cell cycle regulation and cell zzso zzso signal zzso and zzso regulation, zzso and zzso of cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso might be the main molecular targets at which zzso zzso zzso zzso
