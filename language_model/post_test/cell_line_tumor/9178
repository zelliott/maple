To observe the expression pattern and effect of zzso zzso beta zzso 2 zzso on the proliferation of cell zzso with zzso 1 zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso was transferred into zzso zzso The zzso zzso cells were selected by zzso with 100 zzso for over 20 zzso The steady expressions of zzso protein and zzso zzso were detected by zzso and zzso The effects of zzso on zzso cell growth and reproduction were measured by zzso 

The zzso cells which could zzso express the zzso protein were harvested with 100 zzso of zzso The zzso protein expression was, by zzso confirmed and its zzso in zzso with zzso could be detected at 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, and 10 weeks after cell zzso A 220 zzso segment zzso zzso was amplified by zzso and proved by zzso The zzso cells zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso had no expression of zzso zzso The zzso with zzso expression grew slowly than zzso and zzso control zzso zzso zzso 

The screening for zzso with zzso expressing zzso is zzso The cell growth curve shows that zzso can inhibit the proliferation of tumor zzso The above results establish a solid foundation for further studying the biological properties and the zzso mechanism of beta zzso
