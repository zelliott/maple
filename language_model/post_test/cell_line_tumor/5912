We have previously characterized the effects of zzso zzso zzso and their zzso on the proliferation and progression of breast cancer cell zzso For this study, we investigated the effects of the zzso zzso on 2 representative T cell acute zzso leukemia zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso Treatment of both cell lines with zzso resulted in significantly greater zzso of proliferation and induction of zzso than that of parent compounds, zzso zzso or zzso zzso Treatment of the cells with zzso resulted in increased zzso of zzso and zzso Furthermore, induction of zzso in both cell lines was reversed in the presence of a zzso family zzso Treatment with zzso reduced zzso membrane zzso These observations suggest that the effects are driven by intrinsic zzso zzso zzso treatment also zzso surface zzso zzso an important zzso zzso involved in cancer zzso that is highly expressed in both zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, our data suggest that the zzso zzso exhibits significantly more potent effects on zzso and zzso cells than that of zzso or zzso zzso These zzso have potential use for treatment of patients with T cell acute zzso zzso
