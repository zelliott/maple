DNA tumor zzso zzso processes typically involve functional zzso of cellular tumor zzso zzso and zzso by viral zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso factors such as zzso This feature could be exploited to design a treatment for corresponding zzso Here, we report a gene therapy strategy for DNA tumor zzso zzso using a zzso zzso gene expression system named zzso This system contains zzso zzso elements in combination with the binding sites for ubiquitous zzso factors zzso and zzso zzso could drive a high-level zzso expression comparable to that of the zzso zzso promoter and exert zzso activity in cells expressing DNA tumor viral zzso In contrast, it was effectively zzso by zzso and thus only minimally active in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso resulted in a highly efficient and specific killing of zzso zzso zzso after treatment with the zzso zzso Also, an effective tumor mass reduction was observed when the zzso was injected directly into zzso tumors implanted in zzso zzso zzso showed a superior performance throughout these experiments compared to the previously known zzso gene zzso These results clearly demonstrate the potential zzso of zzso for the gene therapy of DNA tumor zzso zzso
