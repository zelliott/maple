zzso zzso a zzso derived from zzso vegetables such as broccoli and Brussels zzso has potent zzso effects in human breast cancer cells and has been shown to decrease zzso spread of tumors in experimental zzso Using zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso significantly decreased the in zzso migration of zzso cells, a highly invasive breast cancer cell zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso revealed that concurrent with the loss of cell zzso zzso treatment significantly increased stress fiber zzso Furthermore, zzso induced the zzso of the focal zzso component zzso and zzso proteins to the cell zzso which implicates an zzso enhancement of focal zzso within the outer boundary of the zzso zzso analysis of focal zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso the dynamic formation of the focal zzso protein complex without altering the total level of individual focal zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is involved in stress fiber and focal zzso formation, and zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso which is a downstream target of zzso zzso zzso but did not increase the level of active zzso zzso Exposure of zzso cells to the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso or expression of dominant negative zzso zzso the zzso induced formation of stress fibers and of peripheral focal zzso zzso of zzso active zzso zzso the zzso effects on both zzso Taken together, our data demonstrate that zzso zzso stress fibers and peripheral focal zzso in a zzso zzso manner that leads to an zzso of zzso in human breast cancer zzso
