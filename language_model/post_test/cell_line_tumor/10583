zzso and zzso are novel candidate gene targets in zzso that were identified by zzso gain in zzso and loss in zzso respectively, through single zzso zzso array zzso In the present study, to assess the involvement of zzso and zzso in the zzso of zzso we analyzed their zzso status and/or expression profiles in a panel of 55 zzso samples, including 25 cell lines, followed by additional functional zzso No zzso zzso of zzso or zzso were identified in our case zzso zzso of zzso was zzso in 11 of 25 cell lines zzso and in seven of 20 fresh tumors zzso The zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells, which exhibit high expression of zzso resulted in a significant decrease in cell proliferation zzso zzso zzso zzso expression studies of zzso revealed significantly lower expression of this gene in zzso at an advanced stage of the zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells induced significant zzso of cell growth zzso zzso zzso The results of these studies provide supporting evidence for zzso and zzso as gene targets of zzso gains and zzso deletions in a zzso zzso In addition, the findings suggest a possible zzso value for zzso in zzso
