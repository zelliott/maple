zzso promotes zzso of the inner zzso zzso However, in isolated zzso zzso could participate in a futile cycle leading to zzso zzso Here, we investigated this paradox in intact human cells by measuring parameters reflecting zzso zzso in response to 1 zzso zzso and 5 zzso zzso zzso levels were elevated similarly by both zzso zzso zzso induced a first transient phase of zzso zzso before the establishment of the expected sustained zzso This correlated with zzso of zzso zzso levels exhibiting a first phase decrease followed by an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and reduces zzso in intact zzso
