zzso growth factor receptors zzso expression is frequently amplified in human zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso against zzso has been used globally in clinics as an zzso zzso It is largely unknown whether the blockade of zzso a zzso that is zzso in zzso cells, could amplify the effects of zzso zzso we have demonstrated that zzso directly targets von zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and that zzso regulates zzso signaling through zzso and the zzso zzso Further, the expression of zzso is regulated by zzso via the zzso of zzso and zzso These data indicate that a feedback loop exists between zzso and zzso We also show that the combination of zzso and an inhibitor of zzso is superior to zzso zzso These results clarify a novel association between zzso and zzso in the regulation of cancer cell zzso
