zzso are widely used in industry and cause public concern since they have zzso zzso effects via zzso zzso We previously found that some zzso have zzso effects, exerting zzso effects on the functional activities of zzso zzso receptors zzso in bovine zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of eight zzso on the calcium signaling of human zzso by using human zzso zzso zzso All eight zzso with different zzso have zzso roles on the calcium signaling coupled with human zzso but not zzso zzso receptors zzso For zzso of human zzso the strongest to weakest zzso were observed as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso were associated with their structures such that the most effective ones had zzso group carbon numbers of C4 or zzso with shorter or longer numbers resulting in decreased zzso At as low as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly inhibited the calcium signaling of human zzso The zzso of zzso on human zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso were zzso lower than those for bovine zzso We suggest that some zzso effectively inhibit the calcium signaling of human zzso and these zzso effects are cause for zzso
