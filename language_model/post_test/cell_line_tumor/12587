zzso are common zzso tumors of the human neural system, and zzso signaling zzso is closely related to zzso zzso Human zzso 2 zzso was recently discovered to be a component of the zzso signaling pathway, which is required for zzso zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso cell growth and survival remains zzso In the present study, zzso expression was evaluated in 80 zzso tissue zzso zzso demonstrated that tumor grade exhibited a positive correlation with zzso of zzso In addition, small hairpin zzso zzso was used to specifically zzso zzso expression in human zzso zzso cell zzso zzso showed that zzso of zzso expression resulted in inhibited cell proliferation and zzso as well as increased cell cycle arrest at the zzso stage and decreased expression of the zzso target gene zzso zzso These results demonstrated that zzso was highly expressed in zzso tissue and required for growth of zzso zzso
