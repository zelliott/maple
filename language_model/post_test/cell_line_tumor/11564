zzso zzso zzso zzso show activity in a broad range of zzso and solid zzso yet the percentage of patients in any given zzso who experience a meaningful clinical response remains zzso In this study, we sought to investigate zzso efficacy in acute zzso leukemia zzso cells expressing zzso fusion proteins zzso zzso have been shown to induce zzso in part, through zzso of DNA damage and zzso of DNA zzso zzso have been correlated with a DNA zzso zzso which may make them more sensitive to zzso DNA zzso We found that expression of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased sensitivity to DNA damage and zzso induced by the zzso zzso The increase in zzso correlated with an enhanced zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso also induced expression of the zzso regulators zzso and zzso and triggered a zzso cell cycle arrest to a greater extent in zzso zzso The combination of zzso and zzso further led to a greater zzso of several base zzso repair zzso zzso These zzso genes represent zzso candidates for response to zzso DNA zzso zzso repair of zzso DNA zzso breaks was found to be impaired in zzso cells, suggesting a mechanism by which zzso expression and zzso treatment cooperate to cause an zzso of damaged zzso These data support the continued study of zzso treatment regimens in zzso zzso
