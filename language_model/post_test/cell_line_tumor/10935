Currently, zzso rely on zzso microscopic examination of tumor cells using zzso techniques originally devised in the 1880s that depend heavily on zzso preparation and that can give false zzso Emerging zzso zzso zzso have the potential to provide accurate, zzso high zzso screening of tumor cells without invasive chemical zzso These techniques are critical to advancing early zzso diagnosis, and treatment of zzso Using a new technique to rapidly assess the properties of cells flown through a zzso semiconductor device, we discovered a method to rapidly assess the respiratory health of a single zzso zzso The key discovery was the zzso of zzso differences in normal and transformed zzso mouse liver cells by using zzso zzso as zzso for zzso This technique holds promise for detecting cancer at a very early stage and could nearly eliminate delays in diagnosis and zzso
