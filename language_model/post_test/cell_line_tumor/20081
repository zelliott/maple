The goals of this study were to analyze the change in the global gene expression profile of zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso in human embryonic stem zzso cells and to explore the molecular mechanism by which the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and quantitative real-time zzso analyses were performed to zzso the differential expression pattern of zzso + zzso zzso zzso The results showed that zzso zzso regulated the expression of 425 genes with at least a twofold increase or zzso These zzso expressed genes were classified into 13 functional groups, including cellular zzso biological zzso and molecular zzso The pathways of focal zzso the zzso signaling pathway, and the immune response were the most predominantly zzso The zzso of these genes could explain the mechanism of the zzso of zzso + zzso zzso zzso Thus, the expression pattern reflected a broad spectrum of roles of zzso in zzso zzso
