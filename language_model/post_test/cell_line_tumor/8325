zzso force zzso has the capability to detect magnetic zzso from a close distance, which can provide the magnetic force zzso image of the scanned samples and also simultaneously obtain atomic force microscope zzso topography image as well as zzso phase zzso In this work, we demonstrate the use of magnetic force zzso together with zzso topography and phase imaging for the characterization of magnetic iron oxide zzso and their cellular zzso behavior with the zzso zzso breast zzso zzso This method can provide useful information such as the magnetic responses of zzso zzso spatial zzso cell zzso and cell surface zzso at the same time for better understanding magnetic zzso zzso It would help to design zzso new imaging, diagnostic and therapeutic zzso
