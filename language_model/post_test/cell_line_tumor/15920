zzso cell lung cancer zzso which accounts for zzso of lung cancer, is the major cause of zzso mortality around the zzso zzso dysfunction and zzso are the typical biological features of the diverse solid tumors, including zzso To develop an effective and low zzso biological agent for targeted therapy, a zzso fusion zzso which was zzso with the minimum motif of zzso degradation domain zzso and the basic domain of zzso of zzso named as zzso was evaluated for the treatment of zzso established by zzso zzso cell line in which zzso is zzso zzso We provide the evidence that this zzso fusion protein could significantly induce the zzso arrest and/or zzso to inhibit zzso zzso growth via zzso zzso including zzso of zzso expression and zzso of zzso especially under zzso in zzso The results in zzso indicated that this protein could selectively accumulate in the low oxygen tension areas of solid tumor zzso zzso tumor growth via a similar mechanism to that in zzso No obvious side effects were zzso zzso this zzso zzso protein is likely to become a good candidate for targeted therapy of zzso
