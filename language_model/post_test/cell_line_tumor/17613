The zzso zzso zzso is a membrane zzso that zzso the zzso of zzso into zzso zzso zzso Recently, we and others have demonstrated the feasibility of imaging subcutaneous zzso expressing zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may serve as an imaging reporter gene to monitor zzso delivery and therapeutic gene zzso In this study, we established zzso pulmonary tumors in nude mice to investigate the minimal tumor size required for in zzso detection of pulmonary tumors by single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with pinhole zzso In order to define the zzso location of zzso tumor zzso zzso by zzso we performed simultaneous, zzso zzso We injected 1 zzso zzso via tail vein to image pulmonary zzso and injected 1 zzso zzso zzso to image zzso zzso zzso images showed that zzso zzso defects correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that tumors 3 zzso in diameter could be detected by zzso with pinhole zzso These studies demonstrate the feasibility of zzso to detect pulmonary tumors expressing zzso zzso in zzso
