zzso zzso 1 zzso is a zzso protein that is involved in the zzso zzso and the generation of the zzso inhibitor zzso In a previous study, we showed that the zzso of full-length zzso in Lewis lung zzso zzso can reduce tumor growth in zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 has two functional zzso a zzso domain zzso and a zzso domain zzso To identify the functional domain of zzso responsible for its zzso effects, we evaluated the zzso of zzso cells zzso full-length zzso zzso CD zzso and zzso zzso Although no difference in tumor cell growth was observed in zzso the tumor zzso was reduced in the zzso zzso and zzso cells compared to parental zzso cells in zzso In addition, in zzso tumor growth zzso by zzso and zzso cells was observed, similar to that by zzso zzso However, the reduced stability of zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso protein and its zzso zzso zzso was only found in zzso and zzso zzso Low levels of zzso were also observed in the tumor mass formed by the modified cells when injected into zzso The results indicate that zzso suppression by zzso is independent of its zzso zzso zzso targeting by zzso can be attributed to its zzso and is probably a result of the zzso of zzso gene transcripts brought about by the zzso property of zzso
