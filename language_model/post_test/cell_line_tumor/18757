To allow the zzso investigation of molecular events associated with the progression of human zzso zzso zzso we sought to develop a zzso model by zzso zzso of tumor fragments obtained from patients diagnosed at early zzso 

zzso pieces (2 zzso 2 zzso were implanted on the liver surface of zzso zzso After zzso growing, subsequent passages were performed to achieve long-term implant zzso Isolation of zzso zzso was done to establish new cell zzso zzso zzso proliferation rate, zzso index zzso zzso zzso zzso end zzso and expression of zzso regulators zzso E and A, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were assessed by Western zzso and zzso to correlate them with tumor zzso 

Five zzso of the 10 primary zzso resulted in small zzso liver zzso Three of them are viable after 48 months, whereas the remaining two survived for 15 and 13 zzso zzso throughout passages exhibited a more aggressive zzso with a poorer degree of zzso intense zzso moderate zzso zzso deregulation, zzso zzso zzso invasion, and zzso In one single passage, we observed critical growth zzso which was associated with significant zzso zzso We established the zzso growing zzso cell line from one zzso This has gains of zzso 7, zzso zzso and zzso is zzso B zzso positive, does not zzso zzso and has zzso zzso zzso in zzso 192 and zzso 

The zzso zzso of early zzso fragments in nude mice provides a useful model to investigate the mechanisms of human zzso evolution and to establish new cell zzso
