Certain primary transcripts of zzso zzso undergo zzso editing that converts zzso to zzso The zzso virus zzso zzso encodes multiple zzso genes of its zzso Here we report that primary transcripts of zzso zzso are edited in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso dramatically reduced loading of zzso zzso onto the zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso found in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell lines suppressed processing of zzso zzso Most importantly, zzso zzso silence zzso through multiple target sites located in the zzso of zzso zzso The significance of zzso was further investigated in cells in various stages of zzso We found that zzso zzso suppress the zzso viral zzso required for transition from zzso less responsive type I and type II zzso to the more zzso type III zzso as well as zzso and zzso viral proteins essential for zzso zzso revealing the regulatory function of zzso in zzso infection and zzso zzso and zzso editing appear to be zzso mechanisms that antagonize zzso zzso
