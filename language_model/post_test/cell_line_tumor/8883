G zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is widely expressed in human breast zzso zzso with increased tumor size and zzso Although zzso signaling via zzso was extensively studied in recent years, the underlying molecular mechanism of zzso zzso of breast cancer still remains zzso In this study, the main aims were focused on the potential role of zzso in regulating migration and invasion of nuclear zzso zzso zzso breast cancer cells upon zzso zzso stimulation and the involved signaling zzso Key events in zzso signaling were chosen for our studies, such as the zzso of zzso and zzso nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The migration and invasion activities upon zzso stimulation were also examined in zzso zzso and zzso breast cancer zzso Compared with zzso zzso breast cancer cells, both zzso and zzso cells had very similar expression of zzso but relatively high expression of zzso zzso zzso which is considered as an active regulator for cancer zzso upon binding zzso zzso showed that zzso facilitated the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso which could be significantly attenuated by zzso zzso or zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, increased zzso of zzso induced by zzso was also inhibited either by specific zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso or by zzso for zzso Furthermore, zzso could activate the migration and invasion of both zzso and zzso cells, which in turn could also be inhibited by blocking zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, or zzso for zzso and zzso In conclusion, we demonstrated that zzso signaling via zzso associated with the zzso of breast cancer, which might be through zzso zzso The zzso between zzso and zzso could be another potential target for the therapy of zzso breast zzso
