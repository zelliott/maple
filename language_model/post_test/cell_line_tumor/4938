zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of a family of zzso zzso zzso that regulates zzso and growth factor signaling pathways involved in cell migration, zzso and zzso zzso expression is increased in many zzso including breast and prostate zzso Here we describe zzso of zzso signaling with a zzso zzso zzso In zzso this compound inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with an zzso of 4 zzso In cultured cells, zzso inhibited zzso zzso on zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso Treatment of cells with zzso of zzso that significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso failed to inhibit cell growth or induce zzso In contrast, treatment with zzso inhibited both zzso and zzso migration zzso with the zzso of focal zzso zzso These studies show that zzso serves as a useful tool to dissect the functions of zzso in zzso signaling pathways in normal and cancer cells and forms the basis for the generation of compounds amenable for zzso and patient zzso
