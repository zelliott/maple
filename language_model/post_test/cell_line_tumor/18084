zzso tumor growth involves the zzso space that contains the zzso zzso Modeling tumor growth in this zzso has been associated with widespread zzso zzso which is zzso of human zzso zzso survival times and tumor properties are zzso limiting their utility in testing experimental zzso We report the development and characterization of a zzso zzso zzso zzso model in zzso mice using the zzso cell zzso zzso tumor growth was obtained by using optimal cell zzso and zzso as the zzso zzso Survival times were within a narrow range of zzso zzso The zzso grew locally zzso surrounding brain zzso These tumors had zzso characteristics of zzso zzso including high zzso nuclear zzso cellular pattern loss, necrosis and conspicuous zzso Similar to human zzso considerable invasion of the zzso and skull and some invasion of adjacent brain along zzso tracts were zzso The pattern of zzso was also similar to human zzso zzso We use zzso imaging to zzso monitor the growth of the zzso and determine the survival benefit from zzso zzso Thus, we describe a zzso zzso model system that will be useful for investigating the biology of zzso and for zzso assessment of therapeutic zzso
