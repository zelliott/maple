We have identified previously a zzso zzso and zzso element zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso that zzso with zzso proteins to zzso zzso gene expression in response to zzso zzso We have also described three zzso zzso zzso zzso in both sense and zzso orientation with respect to the zzso ARE that are able to regulate the zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein level in two different cell zzso Here we show that treatment of zzso cell line zzso with zzso zzso targeting the zzso ARE zzso ARE zzso prevents zzso zzso in response to zzso stimuli with zzso factor zzso zzso zzso or oxygen deprivation and enhances the zzso threshold as evaluated by zzso zzso zzso cell sorting analysis, and zzso zzso Additional effects of zzso ARE zzso included zzso of cell cycle entry and a marked increase of cellular zzso number and zzso a hallmark of zzso differentiation resulting from zzso zzso The ability of zzso ARE zzso to enhance the zzso threshold and to induce zzso differentiation implies their potential application as a novel informational tool to protect cells from zzso damage and to prevent zzso zzso
