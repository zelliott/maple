zzso zzso are promising zzso for delivery of zzso acids due to low toxicity and favorable zzso zzso The often improved zzso is usually explained by enhanced zzso reductive zzso of the zzso This study evaluated the effect of enhanced reductive zzso on zzso activity of zzso DNA and zzso zzso zzso zzso based on a series of zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that the presence of zzso bonds in zzso had no effect on zzso acid zzso zzso size and zzso potential of zzso zzso the zzso content in zzso increased zzso to zzso DNA and zzso release from the zzso zzso the zzso content in zzso increased DNA zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso Plasma membrane protein zzso played a key role in the observed enhancement of DNA zzso The presence of zzso bonds in zzso had no significant effect on the rate of zzso DNA zzso suggesting that enhanced zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is not a major contributing factor to the improved zzso zzso
