zzso zzso are small zzso zzso that act as zzso gene regulators and have been shown to regulate many biological processes including zzso development, cell zzso zzso and zzso Variations in the expression of certain zzso have been linked to a wide range of human diseases - especially cancer - and the diversity of zzso targets suggests that they are involved in various cellular zzso Several tools have been developed to control the function of individual zzso and have been applied to study their zzso biological role, and therapeutic zzso however, common methods lack a precise level of control that allows for the study of zzso function with high spatial and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for mature zzso and zzso were developed through the zzso installation of zzso groups on the bases of selected zzso zzso of zzso zzso led to complete zzso of the zzso zzso and thus zzso of zzso zzso The zzso activity of the zzso zzso was fully restored upon zzso through a brief zzso zzso The zzso zzso were applied to the zzso regulation of zzso function in zzso zzso Moreover, spatial control over zzso activity was obtained in zzso cells through localized zzso zzso The presented approach enables the precise regulation of zzso function and zzso networks with unprecedented spatial and zzso resolution using zzso zzso and can be extended to any zzso of zzso
