zzso zzso zzso are suitable targets for zzso of human zzso and clinical trials are mainly focusing on zzso However, the zzso zzso expression of zzso may hamper the effectiveness of zzso vaccination through the emergence of zzso zzso zzso We investigated the zzso zzso of zzso in human melanoma and the underlying molecular zzso at zzso level using 14 single cell clones generated from the melanoma zzso Mel zzso zzso zzso revealed a highly zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso among melanoma zzso Only nine clones expressed zzso and competitive reverse zzso identified relative differences in the number of zzso molecules of up to zzso between clones 5 and zzso This zzso zzso of zzso expression correlated with the zzso status of specific zzso zzso in zzso promoter: zzso zzso zzso zzso at positions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found in clones expressing high but not low levels of zzso Supporting the role of DNA zzso in generating the zzso zzso of zzso the DNA zzso agent zzso zzso invariably induced their expression in all zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso reduced to 6 folds the differential expression of zzso between clones 5 and 14, which became recognized to a similar extent by T cells specific for a zzso zzso These findings identify promoter zzso as directly responsible for the zzso zzso of therapeutic zzso in melanoma and zzso the use of zzso to overcome the limitations set by their zzso zzso expression to zzso vaccine zzso
