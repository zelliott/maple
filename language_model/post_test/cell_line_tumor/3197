Several individual approaches were combined to zzso a novel zzso drug delivery system to achieve targeting and zzso effects in various zzso cancer zzso 

zzso was zzso to zzso zzso zzso which was formulated into zzso via zzso zzso The surface of the zzso was subsequently linked with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to realize both passive and active targeting zzso The zzso zzso were then tested against several zzso cancer cell zzso 

The zzso increased loading efficiency of zzso to zzso zzso (the zzso efficiency was over zzso and alleviated the drug burst release effect zzso The drug was released from the zzso zzso in a sustained release manner over a period of 12 zzso The zzso zzso were zzso uniform and zzso The zzso targeting ability was proven through strong affinity to various zzso cancer cells, and much less affinity to the low zzso expression cancer zzso The zzso also showed high efficacy in inducing zzso in specific zzso cancer zzso 

The developed zzso zzso hold potential to treat zzso zzso zzso
