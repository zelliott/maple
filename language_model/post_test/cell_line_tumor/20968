Numerous studies have focused on the growth regulation effect of zzso zzso In our preliminary investigation we have observed growth zzso of rat zzso cell line zzso by zzso zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of zzso zzso zzso on zzso growth and survival of zzso lung zzso and prostate zzso human cell zzso Additionally, zzso human cell lines zzso (as a lung zzso and zzso (as a prostate zzso were zzso zzso modified crystal violet zzso differential zzso zzso and zzso methods and zzso for zzso colony formation were used to investigate the effect of zzso zzso The results showed that zzso significantly inhibited zzso growth, decreased zzso cells viability and increased the ratio of zzso and zzso cells compared to the zzso However, it should be noted that the examined zzso significantly decreased viability of zzso human cell lines zzso zzso
