A rapid method using zzso zzso with zzso zzso detection zzso was developed to determine free and zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso The samples were zzso with zzso zzso and analyzed at 22 zzso using sodium zzso buffer zzso pH zzso and an zzso 58 zzso zzso 75 zzso zzso fused zzso zzso The analysis time was less than 10 zzso and zzso was used as internal zzso The zzso conditions, such as reaction time, zzso zzso running buffer and zzso temperature were zzso zzso gas was used in the study to prevent the zzso of zzso during sample zzso The zzso method required only zzso zzso sample per analysis and was fast and zzso The method was applied to the analyses of zzso cells treated with the small metal zzso agent, zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrate that the amount of zzso zzso which reflects the amount of protein zzso increased in a zzso manner upon cell treatment with zzso reaching a maximum of over 50% increase zzso zzso
