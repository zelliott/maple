zzso C inhibitor zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which can penetrate through cellular zzso zzso zzso charged zzso like zzso zzso and zzso zzso bind to zzso and stimulate its zzso activity towards different zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso might also alter the zzso distribution pattern of blood cells and influence the zzso of cellular zzso Here we showed that zzso is an additional binding partner of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso overlay zzso exhibited a unique binding pattern of zzso towards different zzso zzso In addition zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso property of zzso towards activated protein C in a zzso like zzso As shown for zzso zzso and zzso zzso the incubation of cells with zzso led to the zzso of protein zzso B zzso which could be achieved through direct interaction of zzso with zzso This model is supported by the fact that zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso in zzso which would result in zzso zzso Hence the interaction of zzso with different lipids might not only stimulate the zzso of potential target zzso by zzso but could also alter zzso zzso zzso
