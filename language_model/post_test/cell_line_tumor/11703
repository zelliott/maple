zzso one of the zzso zzso agents, is currently being used in the treatment of patients with solid zzso In the present study, we compared the effect of zzso on two types of leukemia zzso Our results showed that zzso could inhibit the proliferation of zzso and zzso cells in a zzso and zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso zzso in zzso cells treated by zzso was related to the cell cycle arrest in the zzso phase, as well as the induction of zzso By contrast, zzso cells treated by zzso showed significant characteristics of zzso which indicated that the mode of cell death induced by zzso in these two types of leukemia cells zzso Advances in research of the cell cycle, zzso and necrosis will extend our understanding of the mechanisms of zzso cell death, particularly in leukemia zzso Further zzso of the mechanisms of necrosis in zzso cells may zzso the development of improved zzso regimens for cancer zzso
