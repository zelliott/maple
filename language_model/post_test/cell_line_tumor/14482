zzso analysis is currently the most promising approach for identifying zzso proteins for use in drug zzso However, many candidate zzso proteins that are zzso or zzso in diseased zzso are found by such a zzso Thus, establishment of an efficient method for screening and zzso the more valuable targets is urgently zzso Here, we describe the development of an zzso zzso zzso that zzso the screening of zzso proteins from many candidates by rapid preparation of zzso zzso using zzso zzso library zzso Using two-dimensional differential zzso zzso analysis, 16 zzso proteins from breast cancer cells were zzso Specifically, proteins were recovered from the gel pieces and a portion of each sample was used for mass zzso zzso The remainder was immobilized onto a zzso membrane for zzso zzso enrichment and zzso Using this zzso zzso zzso against each protein were successfully isolated within two zzso The expression profiles of the identified proteins were then acquired by zzso of breast tumor tissue zzso with the zzso zzso Using this approach, expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 8 in breast tumor zzso were successfully zzso These results demonstrate the zzso zzso system is an efficient method for screening zzso zzso zzso
