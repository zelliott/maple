zzso which zzso zzso arrest, and zzso which arrests zzso organization, are two agents that have demonstrate preferred zzso zzso zzso oxide acts in diverse functions including zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we aimed to examine the distribution of zzso of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso in cells of the zzso breast cancer cell line in response to treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso and combination of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso were determined by using indirect zzso or zzso methods and zzso zzso incubated with G, V and zzso for 24, 48 and zzso were zzso with zzso and zzso primary zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso A significant increase of zzso zzso on zzso cells treated with G and zzso was zzso zzso cells were also detected in G, V and zzso treated zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was detected in all groups but this zzso was not different among the zzso In conclusion, while G treatment, induced zzso arrest, triggered the zzso zzso after treatment of zzso cells, V treatment, arrested zzso organization and did not change the zzso zzso zzso of increased zzso zzso and zzso after G treatment of zzso cells could be important to the treatment of human breast zzso
