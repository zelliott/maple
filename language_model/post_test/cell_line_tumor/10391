The zzso action of zzso zzso was recognized long ago, but its features have remained largely zzso We used zzso zzso zzso and physical tools, to study the zzso response in zzso cells, as our model zzso zzso represented a stereotyped response induced by the addition of zzso zzso buffer (PBS) to cells that had been exposed to zzso after toxin removal and under optimal and zzso experimental zzso zzso was sensitive to zzso present during cell exposure to zzso but not in the course of the zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso showed that zzso caused cell zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso Atomic force zzso zzso was used to monitor zzso effects in real time, and we found that zzso and mechanical properties of zzso cells did not change during toxin exposure, but increased cell height and decreased zzso at its surface were observed when PBS was added to zzso zzso The presence of an zzso during zzso treatment prevented the detection of changes in zzso and mechanical properties caused by PBS addition to zzso cells, as detected by zzso By zzso technique, we confirmed that zzso action involved the transformation of the zzso into a channel and found that cell membrane zzso was not changed by zzso indicating that the membrane surface area was not greatly affected in our model zzso Overall, our findings show that the zzso response triggered by zzso in zzso cells includes a first phase, which is zzso and zzso zzso cells to zzso events taking place in a separate phase, which does not require the presence of the toxin and is zzso but is accompanied by marked reorganization of zzso zzso and altered mechanical properties at the cell's zzso A model of the zzso process of zzso zzso is zzso
