zzso zzso changes in response to various stimuli but the significance of this is zzso In a screen for zzso with abnormal zzso zzso we identified zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the French Canadian Leigh zzso protein zzso zzso zzso repeat zzso We demonstrate that reducing zzso or zzso function causes zzso zzso zzso zzso function also decreases the activity of complex IV of the electron transport chain, however without affecting cellular zzso zzso Preventing zzso zzso in zzso animals causes zzso arrest and embryonic zzso Furthermore, prolonged zzso zzso in zzso cells leads to zzso fragmentation and decreased levels of zzso These findings indicate that in a zzso background, zzso allows zzso to maintain their functions despite a reduction in complex IV zzso Our data reveal an evolutionary zzso mechanism that is triggered by reduced complex IV function and that zzso zzso zzso to zzso compensate for a drop in the activity of the electron transport zzso
