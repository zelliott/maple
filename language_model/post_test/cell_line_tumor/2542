The quest for highly efficient and safe gene delivery systems has become the key factor for successful application of gene zzso zzso zzso are currently investigated as excellent candidates for zzso gene delivery zzso In this study, we report the synthesis and characterization of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ranging from 5th generation zzso to 6th generation zzso via click chemistry, and their use for gene zzso in zzso and in zzso The zzso can zzso zzso DNA zzso and protect zzso from zzso zzso Both atomic force zzso zzso and dynamic light scattering zzso revealed that the sizes of zzso particles were within zzso zzso zzso In zzso studies showed that the zzso zzso zzso provided serum independent and high zzso efficiency on all studied cells, as over 2 fold higher than that of zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso with molecular weight of 17 zzso demonstrated zzso zzso activity than zzso in breast tumor models, as well as good zzso proved by in zzso and in zzso toxicity zzso However, zzso with molecular weight of 46 zzso showed much higher zzso The zzso zzso zzso with optimal generation may be therefore a potential candidate for gene delivery zzso
