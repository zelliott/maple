The zzso zzso zzso is a main regulation cascade in embryonic zzso It is also present in adult zzso and unusual expression has been associated with formation of benign and zzso zzso We examined the presence of the zzso zzso in normal and pathological human colon zzso zzso investigated include Sonic zzso Indian zzso and Desert zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso tissue samples comprised 23 benign and 20 zzso zzso of human zzso The influence of the zzso zzso on differentiation and proliferation has been investigated by analyzing the effect of the zzso inhibitor zzso on human colon cancer cell lines zzso and zzso In normal zzso we detected expression of zzso and zzso within the lining zzso and zzso zzso and zzso along the whole zzso Within all benign zzso positive zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was restricted to single cell zzso zzso zzso also displayed focal zzso pattern for zzso and zzso but to a much lesser zzso We conclude that zzso signaling is involved rather in constant differentiation and renewing of the zzso lining zzso than in cancer formation, growth, or zzso
