The objective of this study was to measure the zzso content of zzso zzso cancer cells in serum samples using a zzso crystal zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cells were first cultured onto the zzso surfaces of zzso in zzso modified Eagle zzso and then specified amounts of zzso serum samples of zzso rabbit were also zzso The change in mass caused by specific zzso of zzso of zzso to the surfaces of the zzso was zzso 

The change in resonance frequency of zzso caused by zzso of zzso cells was from 83 to zzso zzso The zzso content of zzso detected was zzso zzso The frequency shifts were zzso dependent on the amount of zzso mass in the range of 69 to 340 zzso The positive detection rate and the negative detection rate were zzso and zzso zzso 

This zzso provides a viable alternative to other early zzso cancer detection methods and is particularly suited for health screening of the general zzso
