zzso zzso a new structural class of zzso dependent zzso 4 zzso have been identified during extensive biological screening of synthetic zzso The molecules were zzso based on the structure of zzso which is not only a specific inhibitor of the zzso D1 zzso but also a relatively toxic zzso probably because it binds and zzso zzso Interestingly, the new structural zzso of zzso do not interact or zzso with zzso DNA, although they inhibit zzso D1 zzso We found that compound zzso was the most potent zzso showing at least zzso specificity towards zzso D1 zzso for zzso D1 zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso 500 zzso zzso zzso the growth of different cancer cell lines at zzso ranging from zzso zzso It blocks growth of zzso cells at zzso in a zzso protein zzso dependent zzso Moreover, zzso blocks growth only at early zzso in zzso cells released from a zzso zzso zzso These observations are reminiscent of a true zzso zzso
