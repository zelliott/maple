To analyze the relationship between zzso zzso and alternative zzso we developed a zzso approach for the detection of zzso zzso zzso events using zzso zzso array zzso Our analysis of expression data from 176 zzso cell lines revealed that the majority of expressed zzso genes exhibited alternative zzso events that were correlated to the expression of the zzso zzso Most of these events occurred in areas of zzso zzso gene zzso which were significantly enriched in both zzso and zzso occupancy levels relative to zzso regions of the same zzso zzso occupancy was highly correlated with Pol II abundance across overlapping regions and with zzso increases in local alternative zzso zzso These results are consistent with an zzso zzso mechanism of zzso regulation in normal human zzso A comparison of the prevalence of zzso zzso events between individuals of Mormon versus African descent revealed zzso events that may indicate the continued evolution of new zzso zzso Furthermore, the presence of zzso zzso was correlated to alternative zzso across multiple zzso species, suggesting that it may be a zzso mechanism contributing to zzso zzso
