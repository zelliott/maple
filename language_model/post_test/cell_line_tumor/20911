The generation of T cells with specific zzso against zzso zzso is prerequisite for adoptive transfer zzso zzso zzso cultures can be established from zzso zzso zzso by in zzso culture with high levels of zzso In this report, we present zzso data originating from zzso attempted cultures from 33 consecutive melanoma biopsy specimens originating from 30 zzso zzso were analyzed for the presence of zzso gamma zzso cells upon stimulation with a panel of zzso zzso melanoma cell zzso We sought to find whether such cell lines could be used to analyze zzso zzso Cell lines were used as zzso to circumvent the need for zzso primary tumor zzso zzso cultures were identified by flow zzso in 25 of the 30 zzso Four hundred zzso of zzso zzso cultures contained zzso at the end of zzso zzso of zzso cultures zzso contained zzso cells after zzso In zzso patients zzso analysis was zzso with zzso zzso zzso All but one zzso patient had zzso zzso with zzso ranging from zzso to zzso of zzso zzso In addition, zzso analysis also identified zzso directed against zzso zzso and zzso zzso material was collected via needle biopsy in 16 cases and surgery in 18 zzso Overall, surgical material generated more cultures positive for T zzso The described methods are efficient in characterizing clinically relevant zzso zzso
