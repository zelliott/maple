zzso zzso has turned out to be a universal feature of cancer cells, and in many cases, to correlate with altered expression or zzso of relevant zzso However, no such correlation exists between observed zzso changes and the expression of the zzso zzso zzso a core 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report that zzso zzso instead, zzso with elevated zzso pH in cancer zzso zzso using a zzso green fluorescent protein zzso as a probe, we show that the zzso pH zzso in a high proportion of breast zzso and zzso zzso zzso cancer cells is significantly more alkaline zzso zzso or zzso zzso than that of control cells zzso zzso The pH zzso between the zzso and the zzso zzso is also markedly reduced in zzso cells, suggesting a zzso zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso expression is highly sensitive to changes in zzso zzso as only a zzso pH unit increase was sufficient to increase zzso expression in control zzso zzso we found that zzso expressing zzso cells have zzso pH units more alkaline zzso pH than zzso zzso zzso zzso in all cell types zzso we observed significant correlation between the number of zzso expressing cells and cells with a markedly elevated zzso pH zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso with these observations in cultured cells, cells in solid tumors also zzso expressed the zzso Thus, elevated zzso pH appears to be directly linked to zzso expression in cancer cells, but it may also act as a more general factor for altered zzso in cancer by affecting the distribution of zzso zzso
