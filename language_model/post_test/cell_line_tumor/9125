The zzso zzso zzso zzso is emerging as a novel target in many solid tumors, including lung zzso zzso was identified as a small zzso zzso competitive inhibitor of the zzso activity of the zzso zzso Here, we show that treatment with zzso reduced zzso zzso cell lung zzso and zzso zzso cell lung zzso zzso in mouse zzso by zzso and zzso zzso Reduction in tumor size was also observed by magnetic resonance imaging of tumors in zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso binding sites in mouse zzso derived from zzso cell lung cancer cell lines zzso and zzso and small cell lung cancer cell line zzso zzso also inhibited zzso by zzso in all the zzso cell lines and caused an zzso switch which resulted in a decreased production of vascular zzso growth factor and an increase in the production of the zzso inhibitor zzso These studies show the feasibility of selectively targeting zzso with zzso competitive small zzso zzso and suggest that zzso may provide a novel therapeutic approach to lung zzso
