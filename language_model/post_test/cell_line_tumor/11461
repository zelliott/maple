Although zzso has been shown to inhibit zzso in a variety of human zzso including pancreatic cancer zzso the exact molecular mechanism of its zzso effects has not yet been fully zzso Recently, zzso zzso have been reported to regulate multiple aspects of tumor development and zzso indicating that targeting zzso could be a novel strategy to treat human zzso In the current study, we investigated whether a natural compound zzso could zzso zzso resulting in the zzso of cell growth and invasion, and induction of zzso in PC zzso We found that zzso treatment significantly inhibited zzso expression and zzso zzso one of the targets of zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso inhibited cell growth and induced zzso in PC zzso These findings suggest that zzso exerts its zzso activity partly through zzso of zzso in PC zzso
