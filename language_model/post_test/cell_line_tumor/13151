Gold zzso have been reported as potential tumor zzso therapy in zzso and in zzso However, development of the safe and efficient zzso gold zzso for in zzso localized tumor therapy is still a zzso In our present study, we zzso the zzso modified gold zzso and demonstrated its negligible zzso in zzso These zzso also have been demonstrated to efficiently zzso the different kinds of tumor cells in zzso after exposure to the zzso zzso When the zzso modified gold zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso this zzso showed great zzso and zzso effects on the human liver cancer cell line zzso in zzso when coupled with the zzso laser zzso To determine the potential zzso effect of zzso modified gold zzso or zzso zzso on tumor cells in zzso the mice zzso cancer cells were used to induce the subcutaneous zzso model in zzso zzso The significant zzso effects of zzso laser zzso zzso modified gold zzso or zzso zzso on the tumor growth were zzso These composite results suggest that the zzso zzso modified gold zzso exhibit great zzso particular zzso and effective zzso zzso of tumor cells, which warrant the potential therapeutic value of this zzso for further application in in zzso localized tumor zzso
