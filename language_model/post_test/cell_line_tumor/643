This study first investigates the zzso effect of zzso in the human lung zzso cell zzso zzso In this study, we first noted zzso inhibited zzso cells invasion and migration by zzso zzso and zzso chamber zzso The data also showed zzso could inhibit zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso which is involved in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas it did not affect zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Next, zzso significantly decreased the nuclear levels of nuclear factor zzso B zzso zzso and zzso Also, treating zzso cells with zzso also leads to a zzso zzso on the binding abilities of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Further, the treatment of zzso specific for zzso zzso or zzso zzso to zzso cells could cause reduced activities of zzso zzso and zzso These results showed zzso could inhibit the zzso ability of zzso cells by reducing zzso zzso and zzso activities through suppressing zzso zzso zzso or zzso signaling zzso and zzso zzso or zzso binding zzso These findings proved zzso might be an zzso agent against human lung zzso
