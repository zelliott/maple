To generate zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso for many cancer patients, we previously developed a protocol for generating zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells from healthy human T cells by zzso with a zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene composed of zzso variable fragments from an zzso zzso zzso fused to an zzso signaling domain of zzso and zzso These cells, designated zzso and zzso bodies, respectively, showed strong zzso activity against zzso tumor cells in zzso mice when both of them were zzso However, it remains unclear whether it is possible to generate zzso and zzso bodies from cancer patients with defective zzso function because of significant zzso Here, we prepared zzso and zzso bodies from T cells of a colon cancer patient, and asked whether these T bodies can exert effective zzso function against zzso tumor zzso These T bodies showed high zzso and produced zzso in response to zzso zzso tumor cells, even in the presence of soluble zzso It was also demonstrated that zzso bodies supported the survival of zzso bodies through zzso zzso Furthermore, our protocol zzso zzso for zzso zzso to achieve better induction efficiency compared to zzso zzso Taken together, our findings here indicate that zzso zzso zzso and zzso bodies will become a promising strategy for adoptive zzso of human zzso
