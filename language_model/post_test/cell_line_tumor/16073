The zzso precursor protein zzso is zzso by zzso and zzso to generate the zzso zzso zzso which are present in large amounts in the zzso plaques of zzso disease zzso patient zzso zzso processing of zzso by zzso leads to zzso zzso within the zzso zzso sequence and shedding of the soluble zzso zzso zzso which has been reported to be endowed with zzso zzso In this work, we have shown that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso release from mouse zzso cells expressing human zzso from human zzso cells and from mouse primary zzso or neural zzso zzso zzso shedding is inhibited by zzso zzso or zzso of zzso with specific small interfering zzso zzso and is not observed in neural cells from zzso zzso zzso zzso is independent of zzso calcium and strongly inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, zzso of a zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso by specific zzso known to have zzso activity, does not block the zzso zzso zzso Using several specific pharmacological zzso we demonstrate that the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso are involved in zzso zzso zzso Our study suggests that zzso which is expressed in zzso zzso and zzso cells, is a potential therapeutic target in zzso
