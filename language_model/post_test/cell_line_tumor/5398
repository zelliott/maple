The zzso zzso developed and zzso by zzso is based on incorporation of a new zzso zzso zzso zzso into newly zzso DNA and its recognition by zzso zzso via a copper zzso zzso zzso This relatively convenient and useful procedure depends on fixation of cells with zzso and zzso of the DNA with zzso zzso Both of these procedures result in DNA zzso with broad zzso of variation zzso In this report, we have shown that after zzso zzso zzso isolated by zzso can be incubated with the zzso zzso and stained with zzso zzso for generation of DNA zzso with low zzso This modified procedure results in better DNA zzso by replacing zzso with zzso zzso and also saves processing time by eliminating the fixation and zzso zzso
