We have recently identified zzso zzso or zzso as a novel type of zzso zzso that zzso zzso of protein zzso R zzso zzso zzso role through zzso initiation factor 2 zzso zzso zzso is well established in the host defense against viral zzso Paradoxically, some cancer patients have elevated zzso zzso however, its cause and consequence are not zzso Initially, we evaluated the expression of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in zzso cells and this repression is the cause of zzso zzso zzso zzso alone is necessary and sufficient for suppression of zzso via direct physical zzso zzso artificial suppression of zzso in zzso cells activates the zzso zzso cell death pathway, suggesting a potential significance of the zzso suppression and the zzso zzso zzso in eliminating zzso cells during zzso In comparison, active zzso in zzso cells does not induce zzso nor zzso but promotes the zzso nuclear zzso zzso Thus, zzso has a dual life or death role during zzso zzso to the zzso cell lines, zzso tends to be decreased but zzso tends to be activated in our clinical samples from zzso zzso zzso from our data, we propose a tumor surveillance model for zzso role in the zzso zzso during zzso
