Although the primary role of zzso and their receptors is controlling the trafficking of zzso during inflammatory responses, they also play zzso roles in cancer zzso There is emerging evidence that cancer cells produce zzso that induce tumor cell proliferation or zzso in various cancer zzso We have previously reported that zzso acts as a zzso and zzso factor for prostate cancer zzso growth and zzso As the cellular effects of zzso are zzso by zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso we hypothesized that zzso may contribute zzso zzso zzso we first determined zzso zzso and protein expression in various cancer cell lines, including zzso and other cancer zzso All cells expressed zzso zzso and zzso but in zzso more aggressive cancer cells such as zzso zzso and zzso expressed a higher amount of zzso compared with the less aggressive cancer cells such as zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso Further, we found a positive correlation between zzso expression and zzso progression by analyzing an zzso gene array zzso We confirmed that zzso zzso was highly expressed in zzso zzso zzso compared with the localized zzso or benign prostate zzso by real-time zzso Finally, zzso protein expression was examined by zzso zzso on tissue zzso specimens from 96 zzso patients and 31 benign tissue zzso We found that zzso expression correlated with zzso score and clinical zzso zzso whereas lower levels of zzso were expressed in normal prostate zzso These results suggest that zzso may contribute to zzso zzso
