zzso is necessary for the growth, invasion, and zzso of solid zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso in both normal and zzso cells, such as vascular zzso cells and pancreatic cancer cells, zzso In this study, we analyzed the role of zzso and other zzso factors in zzso zzso of the zzso Specifically, we used real-time reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and Western zzso to investigate the zzso of 7 zzso factors, zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and basic zzso growth factor zzso under hypoxic conditions in the zzso zzso zzso cell zzso We also used zzso zzso zzso zzso to measure the amount of zzso zzso into the growth zzso In addition, we administered an zzso zzso zinc zzso IX, to mice with subcutaneous zzso tumors to assess the zzso of zzso in solid tumors in zzso We also performed zzso analyses of 23 primary zzso cancer specimens with high-grade tumors zzso into the zzso zzso for expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Image analysis of zzso zzso was performed to estimate zzso density zzso a measure of zzso zzso conditions induced zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells and increased zzso zzso which could be suppressed by zinc zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso decreased tumor growth and zzso by suppressing zzso factors, particularly zzso and zzso In clinical specimens of zzso cancer, high expression of zzso was correlated with high expression of zzso zzso and high zzso zzso but not with zzso expression zzso In conclusion, since zzso of zzso promotes zzso in zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso could be used as novel zzso for zzso zzso of the urinary zzso
