The aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso effect of a zzso culture from zzso zzso zzso zzso and to zzso its potential mechanism in zzso 

zzso zzso mice received a transplant of zzso cells followed by daily zzso administrations for 8 zzso Following tumor zzso groups zzso were zzso administered 50 zzso 100 zzso or 250 zzso zzso powder per day, respectively, for 8 zzso Groups A and B received saline solution zzso for 8 zzso 

zzso administration induced a significant reduction in tumor size and was associated with a significant increase in T cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso increased numbers of zzso cells could have been caused by greater numbers of zzso cells and zzso in the zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso cells and zzso resulted in increased zzso zzso which could zzso zzso cell zzso The increased zzso of zzso zzso and zzso enhanced the activity and zzso ability of zzso zzso Thus, zzso may provide a potential therapeutic approach for both zzso and zzso zzso
