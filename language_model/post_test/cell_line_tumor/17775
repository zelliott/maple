zzso zzso remains the most effective therapy for zzso zzso cancer confined to the liver, although the zzso recurrence rate is zzso 

To develop a zzso model in order to investigate by which mechanisms liver surgery affects distant zzso zzso 

In this animal study the effect of partial zzso zzso on the development of zzso zzso in the lungs was zzso zzso rat colon zzso cells were zzso zzso zzso before, during or zzso after zzso zzso serum was obtained at different zzso after zzso and added to in zzso zzso cell zzso Finally, zzso was compared with an zzso zzso zzso 

zzso leads to increased zzso zzso in the zzso compared to zzso operation zzso but only when performed directly before the injection of zzso cells and not when performed zzso before or after the zzso zzso results were obtained for zzso No growth stimulation of zzso cells after incubation with rat serum, obtained at different zzso after zzso could be detected in zzso 

Not only zzso but also surgery, in general promotes distant zzso recurrence exerting the effect during the early phase of zzso cell zzso and not during zzso zzso
