To investigate the zzso role of the invasion and growth of zzso cancer by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene zzso 

zzso interference zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso of small interference zzso targeting zzso and zzso gene were zzso into zzso cells, and zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was used to test zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso The effect of the invasive capability in zzso cells after zzso and zzso zzso was observed by zzso zzso In zzso experiment, the nude mouse model of zzso zzso zzso was established and zzso and zzso were zzso zzso Finally, the tumor zzso effect was observed and the zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso expression in zzso were examined to evaluate proliferation change of the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso can zzso the target cells zzso zzso showed the expression of zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso showed there were zzso zzso 4) zzso cells zzso artificial basement which was less than that (32 zzso 6) in the control zzso In zzso the average tumor weight and volume in treated group were significantly lower than those in the control group zzso zzso zzso and the tumor zzso rate was zzso zzso showed zzso index in treated group was obviously lower than that in control group zzso zzso zzso 

The invasion, growth and proliferation of zzso cancer can be inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene silence zzso
