zzso acid zzso zzso is highly expressed in breast zzso to support their continuous growth and zzso but has low expression level in normal zzso zzso interest has been developed in searching for novel zzso zzso as a therapeutic target for breast zzso In present study, zzso was isolated from zzso zzso a traditional zzso medicine that has been used to treat cancer for many years, and was found to significantly inhibit the in zzso zzso activity of zzso at zzso above 50 zzso zzso was also found to decrease fatty acid synthesis by the reduction of zzso incorporation into lipids in zzso zzso human breast cancer zzso Furthermore, this study showed that zzso at a concentration greater than 75 zzso increased the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and administration of zzso inhibitor zzso completely rescued the zzso cells from zzso zzso The sequential zzso DNA fragmentation in zzso cells was observed at a concentration of 100 zzso A decrease in breast cancer cell growth was observed in zzso cells at 12 and 24 h post treatment with 100 zzso of zzso followed by a dramatic suppression after 48 zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso was zzso showing a slight reduction at 50 zzso and significant reduction at zzso of 75 and 100 zzso zzso zzso normal cell growth was not decreased by zzso both in zzso and zzso zzso These data provide evidence that zzso isolated from zzso zzso induced breast cancer zzso through blockade of fatty acid zzso
