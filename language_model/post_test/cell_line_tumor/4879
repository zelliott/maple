In this study we investigated the effects of constituents of zzso zzso zzso on zzso in rats and on the growth of human gastric cancer zzso The ethanol extract of zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso gastric zzso and the growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso The ethanol extract of zzso was further zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso Among these zzso oral treatment with the zzso fraction at a dose of 350 zzso was the most effective at preventing zzso zzso gastric zzso In zzso zzso rats, the zzso fraction also decreased the volume of gastric zzso and gastric acid zzso We isolated six zzso of the zzso fraction using open column zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso gastric zzso and gastric zzso in zzso zzso zzso Using zzso we identified the constituents of zzso 4 to be five zzso compounds, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso 4 reduced cell viability in a zzso manner in human gastric cancer cells zzso zzso and zzso It also increased zzso zzso concentration in zzso cells, an effect that was significantly inhibited by zzso a zzso release zzso Moreover, zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso 4 of the zzso extract of zzso has an zzso effect in rats and is zzso to human gastric cancer zzso The mechanism of its zzso action may be associated with the zzso of zzso of gastric acid and zzso zzso zzso Its zzso against human gastric cancer cells may be, at least in part, zzso by zzso zzso zzso From these results, we suggest that zzso may be useful for the treatment of zzso and gastric zzso
