zzso is a critical regulator of zzso zzso dynamics and plasma membrane organization in zzso A variety of zzso channels have been shown to be modulated by cellular cholesterol and partition into zzso membrane zzso However, very little is known about functional role of membrane cholesterol in regulation of mechanically gated channels that are zzso present in living zzso In our previous study, the effect of zzso zzso zzso agent, on zzso zzso zzso channels zzso has been zzso Here, zzso zzso method was employed to search for the mechanisms of zzso regulation of zzso and to clarify functional contribution of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to channel zzso zzso treatment with zzso significantly decreased open probability of zzso whereas zzso had no zzso zzso zzso fully restored high level of zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso treatment with zzso D or zzso B zzso zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso Single channel analysis and fluorescent imaging methods indicate that zzso of zzso after cholesterol depletion is zzso via zzso zzso initiated by disruption of zzso zzso Our data reveal a novel mechanism of channel regulation by membrane cholesterol and zzso zzso
