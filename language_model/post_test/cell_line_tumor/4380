zzso zzso is known to be a zzso zzso however, the genetic composition of the cells within a given zzso is only poorly zzso In the advent of zzso medicine the understanding of zzso zzso at the cellular and the genetic level is mandatory to improve treatment and clinical zzso By combining zzso flow sorting with zzso zzso zzso we show that primary zzso present as either zzso or zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso were limited to a zzso zzso clone zzso with normal zzso cells, whereas zzso zzso contained multiple zzso zzso yet always including a zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso and zzso zzso carried the same aberrations as defined by identical zzso zzso suggesting that evolution towards zzso is a late event in zzso zzso Interestingly, while zzso zzso could be zzso in zzso zzso we find that genetically distinct clones displayed different zzso zzso Moreover, we show that putative cancer stem cell markers including zzso zzso zzso and zzso were present on genetically distinct zzso cell zzso These data reveal the zzso zzso of zzso at the level of DNA content, zzso potential and stem cell marker zzso which is likely to impact zzso progression and treatment zzso The combined knowledge of zzso zzso at the zzso cellular and functional level is crucial to assess treatment responses and to design personalized treatment strategies for primary zzso
