To understand normal function of memory studying models of pathological memory decline is zzso The most common form of zzso leading to memory decline is Alzheimer's disease zzso which is characterized by the presence of zzso zzso and zzso plaques in the affected brain zzso zzso production of zzso beta zzso through sequential zzso of zzso precursor protein zzso by zzso and zzso seems to be a central event in the molecular zzso of the zzso Thus, the study of the complex interplay of proteins that are involved in or modify zzso production is very important to gain insight into the zzso of zzso Here, we describe the use of Fluorescence lifetime imaging zzso zzso a Fluorescence resonance energy transfer zzso method, to zzso zzso in intact cells, which has proven to be a valuable method in zzso zzso
