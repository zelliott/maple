To study the regulation on the zzso of titanium metal surface structure, the interaction between the collagen and the titanium surface structure were studied with titanium surfaces subjected to zzso zzso and zzso zzso The cell response on the treated surfaces was studied in zzso experiments of zzso zzso The effects of different collagen zzso ability on the zzso were investigated with simulated body fluid zzso experiment and zzso culture experiments in a zzso culture zzso It was found that the collagen zzso ability was controlled by the zzso The zzso treated titanium could zzso much more collagen on its zzso The abilities of cell attachment and proliferation were improved after collagen zzso The zzso formation ability was inhibited in zzso after collagen zzso on the surfaces, but improved in zzso zzso The zzso and zzso activity of zzso cells zzso showed the collagen on the titanium surface could enhance the zzso of the cells, which could accelerate the zzso process in cell culture zzso The result indicated that the different zzso ability of type I collagen could regulate the zzso of titanium metal zzso It is possible to zzso the zzso of the titanium metals by using suitable surface modification zzso
