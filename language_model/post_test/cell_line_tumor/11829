The DNA repair protein damaged zzso 2 zzso has been implicated in promoting zzso progression by regulating gene zzso zzso is selectively zzso in breast tumor cells that are zzso but not in those that are zzso We found that its zzso in invasive human breast tumor cells limited their zzso and zzso in zzso and blocked their ability to colonize lungs in zzso defining a new function for zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso attenuated the activity of zzso and the expression of its target zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso investigations indicated that zzso decreased zzso activity by zzso expression of zzso by binding the zzso promoter of this zzso This effect was zzso linked to invasive zzso Indeed, zzso of zzso zzso gene expression restored zzso activity and zzso zzso along with the invasive properties of breast tumor cells zzso zzso Taken together, our findings zzso understanding of how breast cancer cells progress to an invasive zzso and underscore potential clinical interest in zzso as a zzso marker or therapeutic target in this zzso
