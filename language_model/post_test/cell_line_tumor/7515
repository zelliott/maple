This paper aimed to investigate the preparation of zzso bovine serum zzso zzso zzso and their effect on killing liver cancer cells in zzso and in zzso zzso was prepared using a zzso zzso zzso Their zzso and particle size were observed using transmission electron zzso zzso The zzso zzso rates and zzso characteristics were determined zzso Their ability to kill liver cancer cells in zzso was determined using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso The zzso effect of the zzso in experimental animals in zzso was also zzso Under zzso zzso appeared zzso and was distributed zzso with a diameter of about 120 zzso and hydrated particle size of 170 zzso determined by dynamic light zzso The zzso rate was zzso and the zzso rate was zzso The in zzso zzso experiment showed that about 50% of the drug in zzso zzso was released continuously and slowly for 7 zzso The zzso zzso showed that zzso significantly inhibited cell zzso while zzso showed that it induced tumor cell zzso The in zzso tumor suppression test showed that the therapeutic effect of zzso zzso was superior to that of zzso zzso
