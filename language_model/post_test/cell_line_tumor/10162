zzso natural killer zzso zzso is associated with zzso virus and has poor prognosis because of local invasion and/or multiple zzso Recently, the role of zzso receptors in tumor proliferation and invasion has been zzso In this study, we examined whether the specific zzso were related to the tumor behaviors in zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso protein array was used to examine specific zzso produced by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso protein 10 zzso and the zzso zzso zzso was investigated by zzso and flow zzso Cell growth and invasion were assessed by the zzso and zzso invasion zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used to examine zzso expression in zzso and zzso from patients, zzso 

zzso was specifically produced by zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso was expressed on the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso did not affect cell proliferation but enhanced cell zzso In biopsy samples, zzso and zzso expressions were detected in the zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in the patients were much higher than those of healthy controls and the levels were decreased during the complete zzso phase after zzso 

These results suggest that zzso may play an important role in cell invasion in zzso zzso zzso through an zzso zzso
