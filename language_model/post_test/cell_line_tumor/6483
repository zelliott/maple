zzso differentiated tumor cells can be found in the majority of zzso zzso During zzso or zzso therapy the neuroendocrine differentiation is often increased but its zzso value is discussed zzso The origin of neuroendocrine tumor cells is under zzso While double zzso experiments suggest a zzso zzso stem cell, in zzso studies demonstrate a zzso of zzso tumor cells to a neuroendocrine zzso 

zzso differentiated zzso cells and laser captured zzso cells of eight radical zzso were zzso using 11 zzso markers from seven different zzso 

zzso zzso profiles were detected in zzso and neuroendocrine differentiated zzso cells for all markers confirming their zzso zzso and zzso tumor cells from radical zzso shared identical zzso profiles for all zzso suggesting a common origin for both cell zzso 

Our results support the concept of zzso of zzso tumor cells to a neuroendocrine tumor cell zzso
