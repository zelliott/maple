Members of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso control cell fate determination, including cell death and zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and signals zzso through well established zzso In the adult nervous system, zzso zzso zzso in the context of zzso such as stroke or zzso lateral zzso However, during nervous system development, zzso promotes zzso growth and zzso The molecular mechanisms underlying zzso process formation and branching have remained unknown to zzso Here, we define the molecular zzso linking zzso to process growth and branching in cell lines and in developing zzso We describe a new zzso membrane zzso domain zzso that is essential for zzso process growth and that is zzso in members of the zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso recruits zzso a zzso that links zzso proteins to the zzso and activates the small zzso zzso zzso of the zzso but not the death domain, abolished zzso zzso and process zzso Furthermore, an zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso growth in primary zzso Our results define a new domain, zzso and functionally distinct from the death domain, which regulates zzso via recruitment of zzso and zzso of zzso
