Cancer stem cells zzso play an important role in the development, invasion, and drug resistance of zzso but the exact zzso and characteristics of zzso zzso are still zzso In this study, we identified cancer stem zzso cells zzso and investigated their characteristics from the zzso zzso cell line zzso Our results showed that zzso were enriched in zzso test and highly expressed zzso The spheres and zzso cells possessed strong zzso ability by transplantation into zzso zzso combined zzso zzso zzso cells expressed stem cell markers and differentiated to zzso cells by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso experiments verified that zzso cells were markedly resistant to zzso and zzso In conclusion, our study identifies the zzso zzso zzso high zzso differentiation potential, and drug resistance of zzso zzso Our findings may provide the evidence needed to explore a new strategy in the treatment of zzso zzso
