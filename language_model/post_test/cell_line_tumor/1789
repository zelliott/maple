Cell zzso is an essential aspect of zzso spread of zzso zzso agents exhibit zzso properties, the underlying mechanism of which remains zzso In this study, we have investigated the role of zzso dynamics in migration of cancer cells using zzso a synthetic small zzso inhibitor of zzso We found that zzso at zzso that did not visibly affect zzso organization, suppressed dynamic instability of zzso and reduced the rate of migration of highly zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were defective in zzso formation and could not develop polarized zzso The kinetic stabilization of zzso was associated with a marked increase in their zzso level and a zzso in the zzso of zzso a zzso plus end binding zzso Using standard scratch wound healing zzso and zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso occurred in the direction of migration in zzso cells, whereas zzso treatment led to a global zzso of zzso The results together suggested that selective stabilization of zzso was zzso in the presence of zzso that possibly resulted in lack of cell polarization and a concurrent reduction in migration of zzso Moreover, zzso stabilization by zzso affected zzso turnover and impaired the polarized pattern of zzso sites in zzso Together the results indicated that the regulation of zzso dynamics is required to coordinate cell polarization as well as zzso asymmetry and support the hypothesis that the zzso of zzso dynamics by zzso agents can be exploited to restrict the migration of tumor zzso
