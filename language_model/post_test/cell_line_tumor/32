The objective of this study was to investigate the zzso of the zzso extract of zzso from zzso zzso zzso cultivated in a medium containing zzso plants zzso max zzso zzso and zzso zzso on human zzso zzso cells zzso zzso and to isolate the active components from zzso The results indicated that zzso induced zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, and the cells treated with zzso for 24, 48, and 72 h had zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was zzso into seven zzso zzso We found that F5 and zzso had higher growth zzso effects on zzso zzso cells than the other zzso and zzso possessed enough amounts (about zzso zzso to carry out a more detailed zzso zzso caused a zzso peak rise and DNA fragmentation in zzso zzso cells and was further separated by zzso liquid zzso to obtain two active compounds, zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso values of zzso and zzso based on the cell viability of zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso
