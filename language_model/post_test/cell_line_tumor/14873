Natural herbal compounds with novel actions different from existing breast cancer zzso treatment zzso are attractive for improving therapeutic efficacy and zzso We have recently shown that zzso zzso induced zzso arrest in prostate cancer zzso cells through zzso DNA zzso synthesis and zzso arrest, in addition to inducing cell death at higher levels of zzso We and others have shown that zzso through zzso zzso injection exerts a strong in zzso growth suppression of human zzso zzso models in zzso nude zzso This study aims to test the hypothesis that the novel targeting actions of zzso are zzso to zzso cells, especially those lacking proven zzso zzso 

zzso cell culture models of zzso type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were exposed to zzso for a comprehensive investigation of cellular consequences and molecular zzso To test the in zzso zzso female zzso mice zzso with zzso zzso were treated with zzso zzso body weight by daily zzso starting 4 days after cancer cell zzso 

Exposure to zzso induced zzso arrest in both cell lines as indicated by the lack of zzso zzso incorporation into zzso cells as well as zzso zzso Higher levels of zzso induced more zzso zzso in zzso in strong association with induction of zzso zzso zzso than in zzso zzso The cell cycle arrests were achieved without an induction of zzso dependent zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso treatment led to decreased zzso D1 in both cell lines and zzso zzso D1 attenuated zzso arrest and hastened S zzso In zzso synchronized zzso cells, zzso of zzso D1 was associated with zzso of zzso zzso protein by zzso shortly before zzso zzso In zzso oral administration of zzso led to a greater than zzso zzso of zzso zzso growth without adverse effect on host body zzso 

Our in zzso and in zzso data support zzso as a potential drug candidate for breast cancer with novel targeting actions, especially for a triple negative zzso zzso zzso
