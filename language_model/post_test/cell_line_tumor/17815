Mouse models of human cancer are a potential zzso setting for drug testing and for development of methods for delivery of zzso drugs to zzso We have assessed a mouse model of leukemia caused by zzso protein fusion as a zzso situation in which zzso leukemia results from de zzso occurrence of zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso Here, we show that the mouse zzso respond to zzso zzso a frontline treatment for human zzso The observations show that the zzso cells are susceptible to the drug and the mice undergo a zzso that comprises a reduction of the zzso population of cells and recovery of the zzso zzso This zzso model should therefore prove useful for future drug assessments against the zzso zzso zzso zzso
