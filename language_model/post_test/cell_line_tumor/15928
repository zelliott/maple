zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso family that is known to be a regulator of B cell zzso Its B zzso expression makes it an attractive target for zzso B cell depletion therapy for the treatment of B cell zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso is well documented to be an zzso zzso it is believed that after zzso it is targeted for zzso We show in this study that zzso is instead zzso recycled to the cell zzso We also find that zzso zzso cargo is released from zzso and accumulates zzso as zzso zzso between the cell surface and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso to zzso do not accumulate but remain bound to zzso and zzso to the cell zzso The results have implications for development of agents that target zzso as an zzso zzso for delivery of zzso cargo to B zzso
