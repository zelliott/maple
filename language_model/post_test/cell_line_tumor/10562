Cancer cells adapt their zzso processes to drive zzso zzso for rapid cell growth and zzso zzso interference zzso zzso screening has proven powerful for the identification of new and interesting cancer targets, and recent studies have used this technology in zzso to identify novel zzso zzso zzso Here we developed a method for identifying novel cancer targets via zzso zzso screening using a human breast cancer zzso model at an zzso site in the zzso Using this method, we screened a set of zzso genes associated with aggressive breast cancer and zzso to identify those required for in zzso zzso Among the genes identified, zzso zzso zzso is in a zzso region of zzso copy number gain in breast cancer and zzso protein levels are elevated in zzso of zzso zzso zzso breast zzso zzso zzso the first step in the zzso zzso pathway, and breast cancer cells with high zzso expression have increased zzso synthesis zzso zzso of zzso in cell lines with elevated zzso zzso but not in those without, causes a strong decrease in cell proliferation and a reduction in zzso zzso We find that zzso suppression does not affect zzso zzso levels, but causes a drop in the levels of zzso another output of the zzso and a zzso acid zzso cycle zzso In cells with high zzso zzso the zzso synthesis zzso contributes approximately 50% of the total zzso flux of zzso into the zzso zzso These results reveal that certain breast zzso are dependent upon increased zzso zzso flux caused by zzso zzso and demonstrate the utility of in zzso zzso zzso screens for finding potential zzso zzso
