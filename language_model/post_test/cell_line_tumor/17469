zzso zzso of zzso genes via zzso island zzso could be a mechanism zzso prostate cancer zzso progression from an zzso zzso to an zzso zzso zzso We have used the zzso restriction zzso zzso technique to identify novel zzso sequences that are zzso zzso between the zzso of the AS zzso cell line zzso and that of an zzso zzso zzso generated by maintaining zzso in medium with zzso zzso serum for over 30 zzso One such sequence identified was located on a zzso zzso island that was found to span part of the promoter, zzso 1, and part of zzso 1 of the zzso membrane protein 24 zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequencing, we established an inverse relationship between zzso expression and zzso of the zzso zzso island of zzso zzso zzso was absent in zzso and the zzso zzso zzso cell line; both exhibited dense zzso in the said zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was expressed in zzso and normal zzso zzso cells zzso whose zzso zzso zzso island remained zzso Treatment of zzso and zzso with the zzso agent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso into zzso and zzso cells induced a significant reduction in cell growth and zzso colony formation potential, suggesting that zzso gene product has zzso zzso These results demonstrate the utility of zzso in the identification of novel, zzso zzso DNA sequences in the zzso and suggest that zzso zzso of zzso is an zzso event involved in zzso progression to zzso zzso
