Many fundamental cell zzso such as zzso zzso and cancer zzso are thought to be modulated by zzso zzso zzso Thus, the availability of zzso zzso having zzso zzso profiles can be of great importance in zzso studies of zzso zzso Here, we present a method to zzso zzso zzso with a well defined and linear zzso zzso This method, involving the zzso of films by progressively uncovering an zzso solution initially covered with an opaque mask, can be easily implemented with common lab zzso It produces linear zzso zzso of at least 115 zzso extending from zzso zzso to 240 zzso (in units of Young's zzso zzso with less steep zzso and zzso zzso ranges can easily be zzso The zzso can be zzso zzso with uniform zzso of proteins that promote cell zzso Cell spreading on these zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso indicating that this technique effectively zzso the mechanical environment of living zzso This technique provides a simple approach that produces steeper zzso wider rigidity zzso and more accurate profiles than current zzso
