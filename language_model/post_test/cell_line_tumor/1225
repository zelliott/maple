The zzso of peptides derived from the zzso zzso protein to zzso molecules has gained wide acceptance as a means for zzso zzso Numerous studies have addressed the mechanism of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso but the zzso zzso and zzso of the transported cargo have not been zzso The current paper zzso a zzso zzso to perform quantitative zzso zzso of the concentration and accessibility of zzso zzso for protein zzso B zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso were zzso through a zzso zzso either a zzso or zzso zzso Free zzso zzso zzso of approximately zzso zzso were zzso in a cell when zzso were delivered utilizing these zzso The zzso peptides delivered as a zzso zzso were often present in the zzso as several oxidized zzso zzso exposure of cells loaded with the zzso zzso to UVA light released free zzso zzso into the zzso zzso zzso delivered by either zzso was accessible to zzso zzso as demonstrated by the efficient zzso of the zzso when the appropriate zzso was zzso After incubation of the zzso zzso with cells, free, zzso zzso was zzso in less than 30 zzso zzso of the majority of loaded zzso zzso from zzso zzso occurred within 1 zzso The utility of the zzso zzso was demonstrated by measuring the zzso of zzso in zzso cells after addition of varying zzso of zzso growth zzso
