zzso protein zzso positively regulates the high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in mast zzso zzso study identified the point zzso of zzso gene in zzso disease zzso The multiple zzso in zzso zzso of jaw bones are filled with the activated zzso and zzso cells, including mast zzso By zzso study using rat zzso zzso zzso mast cells, we have zzso the effect of the point zzso on the function of zzso zzso which plays a positive regulatory role on zzso mast cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso suppressed the zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso signal regulated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activated protein zzso zzso inhibitor of nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso and nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso were all impaired in the cells zzso the zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso may abrogate the binding ability to interact with zzso protein zzso These results demonstrate that zzso of the zzso form of zzso zzso the zzso mast cell zzso It suggests that point zzso of zzso gene cause the dysfunction of zzso in zzso
