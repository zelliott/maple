The zzso zzso have enormous potential as zzso drug carriers for cancer therapy due to their zzso changes in response to the tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso a series of zzso zzso zzso bearing zzso backbone were developed based on zzso ethane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as effective zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with different zzso ratios were prepared by zzso zzso addition fragmentation chain transfer zzso zzso of zzso and zzso Their molecular structures and chemical compositions were confirmed by zzso zzso zzso transform infrared zzso zzso and gel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could zzso into zzso zzso in zzso solution and displayed low critical zzso concentration zzso All zzso zzso displayed excellent drug loading capacity, due to the strong zzso zzso action and zzso interaction between the zzso and zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso chain could be selectively zzso into a zzso backbone in the mildly zzso environment, leading to significant swelling and final zzso of the zzso These zzso changes of zzso zzso with time at pH zzso were determined by zzso and zzso The in zzso zzso release from the zzso exhibited a zzso zzso The release rate of zzso was significantly accelerated at mildly zzso pH of zzso and zzso compared to that at pH zzso zzso test revealed that the zzso zzso exhibited low zzso whereas the zzso zzso maintained high zzso for zzso and zzso zzso The results indicated that the novel zzso zzso with low zzso small and zzso sizes, high drug zzso zzso drug release behavior, and good zzso may have potential as zzso drug delivery zzso for cancer therapy with intelligent zzso
