Heat shock protein 70 zzso can be a potent carrier of zzso because it is effectively delivered to zzso presenting cells zzso and activates innate zzso To induce a potent zzso T zzso zzso response, a zzso fusion protein harboring both zzso and zzso T cell zzso was developed based on the recent understanding of the importance of the role of zzso T cells in inducing the zzso response following zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were selected as the zzso and zzso T cell zzso of a model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its fusion zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso were effectively presented on zzso class II of zzso compared with zzso suggesting that zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso is better than the zzso for more effective zzso class II zzso zzso zzso with zzso resulted in a higher zzso activity than zzso with the mixture of zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso exhibited a greater zzso effect in the mice bearing zzso tumor cells than the physical mixture of zzso and zzso In addition, zzso with the zzso zzso with the fusion proteins also suggested that zzso which present both zzso and zzso can induce the highest zzso zzso These results demonstrated that zzso fusion protein harboring both zzso and zzso is a useful option for zzso zzso delivery zzso
