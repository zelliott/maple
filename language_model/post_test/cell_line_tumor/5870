The zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells is a site of zzso zzso where cellular forces are exerted and zzso zzso evidence indicates that zzso zzso molecules at the zzso serve to sense force applied on the junctions and coordinate zzso responses to those zzso Efforts to understand the role that zzso play in zzso have been limited by the lack of zzso to measure the impact of forces on the zzso In this study we used zzso imaging of zzso zzso to zzso the movement of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso displayed prominent movements oriented zzso zzso to the zzso zzso Two components were identified in these zzso a relatively slow zzso zzso component that could be readily fitted by zzso zzso analysis, upon which were superimposed more rapid zzso zzso zzso zzso was a dominant factor responsible for driving the unilateral zzso zzso In contrast, frequency spectrum analysis revealed that depletion of zzso zzso increased the power of the zzso zzso This implies that zzso zzso may serve to dampen zzso movements of the zzso This extends our recent analysis of zzso II at the zzso to demonstrate that zzso zzso and zzso zzso make distinct contributions to zzso movement at the zzso
