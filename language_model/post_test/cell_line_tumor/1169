Currently, pancreatic zzso is the fourth leading cause of zzso death in the United zzso Despite the advances in pancreatic zzso research, patients with this devastating disease have a very poor zzso To identify the gene expression profile of pancreatic zzso an important step in the process of developing new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, the authors investigated the zzso of gene expression in this zzso 

The authors analyzed a public serial analysis of gene expression zzso database and examined in greater detail the expression of zzso zzso in several pancreatic zzso cell lines and tumor tissue samples by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso analysis and Northern zzso zzso The expression of zzso protein was investigated further by zzso and Western zzso analyses using tumor cell lines, tumor zzso and serum zzso 

zzso zzso was zzso in 11 of 12 pancreatic zzso cell lines, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The expression of zzso protein was zzso in 8 of 12 pancreatic zzso cell lines zzso and in 22 of 32 pancreatic tumor tissue samples zzso by Western zzso zzso On zzso zzso zzso protein was present in zzso of the tumor tissue samples examined from patients with Stage I and II pancreatic zzso The zzso of zzso is correlated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein also was zzso by Western zzso in serum samples from 21 of 56 patients zzso with pancreatic zzso 

zzso which initially was described as a breast zzso gene involved in invasion, zzso and chemotherapy resistance, was frequently zzso in pancreatic zzso zzso of zzso may play a role in pancreatic zzso zzso Further studies will be necessary to determine the role of zzso in pancreatic zzso
