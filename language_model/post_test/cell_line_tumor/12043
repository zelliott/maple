zzso in zzso levels and function have been implicated in the zzso of bipolar disorder, but the role of these changes in the development of the illness is not zzso In view of the critical role of zzso zzso signaling in regulating cell survival, we investigated the potential role of zzso in modulating zzso to cellular zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to a level twice that of the zzso cells did not directly affect cell viability but significantly increased the sensitivity to induction of cell death by serum deprivation and other zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso This enhanced sensitivity was associated with increased zzso zzso and appearance of fragmented zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso completely suppressed cell death evoked by these zzso insults in both zzso and zzso zzso The increased vulnerability zzso by increased zzso expression was neither zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso nor attenuated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso These data indicate that zzso may zzso zzso processes in a zzso manner through a signaling cascade that is independent of the zzso or zzso zzso These results suggest that enhanced zzso zzso as was observed in zzso brain of bipolar patients, may impair cellular resilience in response to zzso stress signals resulting from zzso and/or zzso zzso dysfunction implicated in this zzso
