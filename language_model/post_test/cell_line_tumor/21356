The seven zzso zzso acids zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso promote zzso zzso by binding specifically to inhibitor of zzso proteins zzso and blocking their zzso zzso zzso cannot pass through the cell zzso but to be of therapeutic use it would be essential for it to enter the zzso To achieve zzso transport of zzso we coupled it to a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso transport zzso zzso via zzso to produce the zzso zzso zzso Because zzso are much more strongly expressed in the zzso of tumor cells, we expected this zzso to produce zzso of the zzso and for this to be stronger in tumor cells than in healthy zzso Surprisingly, we found strong nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso and of the transport zzso alone without subsequent release in both tumor cells and healthy cells from the zzso zzso and zzso This was accompanied by cell zzso In contrast to expectations, it appears that the zzso effects observed do not result from the zzso cargo zzso
