An improved synthesis of zzso zzso has been accomplished via the reaction of zzso with a range of zzso in the presence of a mild base zzso under zzso A number of zzso were zzso zzso zzso and the molecular structure of a representative compound determined by single crystal X-ray zzso study confirmed zzso of the zzso double bond present within the zzso Some of the compounds zzso have shown zzso zzso as well as anti zzso properties against two cancer cell lines in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso which showed a dose dependent increase in the zzso of zzso resulting in induction of zzso
