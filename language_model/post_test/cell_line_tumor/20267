Human head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso is a major cause of zzso death during the last decade due to its related zzso and poor treatment zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso inhibitor has been reported to reduce the zzso abilities of oral zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso zzso zzso a green tea zzso possesses cancer zzso and zzso zzso However, the mechanisms involved in the suppression of invasion and zzso of human oral cancer cells following zzso with zzso and zzso remain poorly zzso In the present study, we attempted to investigate the synergistic effects of a combined treatment of zzso and zzso in zzso cells in zzso and to zzso the underlying molecular mechanisms associated with the zzso of cell migration and zzso In the present study, we found that the individual treatments or the combined treatment of zzso and zzso zzso inhibited the invasion and migration of zzso cells using zzso invasion and zzso scratch zzso zzso Similarly, zzso in combination with zzso zzso attenuated zzso activity and the protein expression of zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, individual or combined treatment with zzso and zzso suppressed the protein expression of zzso and the zzso protein levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and displayed zzso effects on zzso ability of zzso zzso Combined effects of zzso and zzso zzso actions for related gene expression were observed using DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso in zzso Taken together, our results suggest that the synergistic suppression of the zzso ability of zzso cells after zzso and zzso individual or combined treatment are zzso through zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Our novel findings provide potential insights into the mechanism involved with synergistic responses of zzso and zzso against the progression of oral zzso
