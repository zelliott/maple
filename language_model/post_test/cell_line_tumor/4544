Treatment of cells with zzso at low zzso zzso zzso bipolar zzso of which two zzso stay at only one pole, and also zzso zzso zzso To gain insight into the relations between zzso impairment and structural defects of the zzso zzso imaging was performed on a human zzso zzso cell line in which zzso zzso nuclear membrane and zzso were simultaneously zzso by fluorescent zzso In the presence of zzso at zzso zzso the zzso did not zzso and multiple zzso structures zzso arose around the disappearing nuclear zzso Those zzso structures formed an zzso pole opposing to the zzso zzso In late zzso one pole often fragmented into multiple zzso zzso leading zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso pole fragility may be induced by zzso zzso and collapse of the pole may contribute to induction of zzso daughter zzso
