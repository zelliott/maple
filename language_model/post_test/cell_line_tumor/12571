zzso zzso which arise in zzso zzso can spread rapidly via the circulatory system and form solid tumors within multiple zzso zzso steps in this zzso process may be the zzso of zzso cells to vascular zzso cells, their exit from the zzso and their migration to tissue sites that will support tumor zzso Thus proteins that control B cell zzso and migration are likely to be key factors in zzso zzso and hence potential targets for therapeutic zzso The zzso zzso are master regulators of zzso zzso cell zzso and the underlying zzso zzso and membrane zzso We have recently shown that zzso zzso is critical for zzso cells to undergo zzso migration in zzso and in zzso As a consequence, suppressing zzso zzso zzso the ability of zzso injected zzso cells to form solid tumors in the liver and other zzso We discuss this work in the context of targeting zzso its downstream zzso or other regulators of B cell zzso and migration as an approach for limiting the dissemination of zzso cells and the development of secondary zzso
