For studying the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso routes for gene delivery, various zzso of zzso were used to treat human throat zzso cancer cells, zzso before zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso To eliminate the effect of inhibitor toxicity on zzso the zzso rate was used to represent the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso efficiency by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso At the same time, zzso a zzso zzso decreased it by zzso zzso Thus combined zzso routes through the zzso and zzso pathways were major mechanisms of cell zzso for the zzso zzso gene zzso After entering the cells, zzso played an important role on gene delivery as zzso a zzso zzso could reduce zzso efficiency by zzso zzso zzso
