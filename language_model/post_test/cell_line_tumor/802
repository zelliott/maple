zzso zzso is the principal zzso zzso participating in the initiation of acute phase zzso Human zzso zzso cells were exposed to 15 zzso of zzso for times ranging from 1 to 24 h and the total zzso was zzso Then zzso was obtained and used for differential display with 10 arbitrary zzso and 9 zzso zzso designed by zzso zzso of observed changes of zzso expressed known genes was carried out by zzso or Northern zzso zzso Out of 90 zzso strands modulated by zzso 46 have been successfully zzso and their sequencing indicates that they represent 36 different zzso zzso By zzso search, 26 zzso clones were identified as already known genes while 10 showed no zzso to any known zzso The identified transcripts modulated by zzso in zzso cells code for zzso proteins of various zzso zzso proteins (3 zzso proteins participating in the translation machinery or zzso modifications (7 zzso zzso (1 zzso proteins involved in metabolism (6 zzso activity zzso (3 zzso proteins of the cell cycle machinery (2 zzso and those functionally zzso (4 zzso Majority of genes responded to zzso within 1 to 6 h zzso zzso while two were late response genes zzso zzso and four showed prolonged response over the whole zzso zzso Most of the observed changes of expression were in the range of two- to zzso increase in comparison to control zzso zzso Among identified zzso no typical zzso acute phase protein was zzso The obtained results suggest that zzso affects the expression of several genes in zzso cells, especially those engaged in the synthesis and modifications of zzso
