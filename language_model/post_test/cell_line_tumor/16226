zzso zzso no zzso zzso protein zzso are found in all zzso zzso and many zzso zzso zzso influence zzso zzso Two zzso family members are associated with a single gene form of zzso zzso interference screens have implicated zzso in survival and growth, and zzso is essential for viability of zzso We found that the majority of zzso is localized on zzso zzso in resting zzso During cell division, zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso we analyzed zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso A large percentage of zzso zzso cells fail to complete cell division, displaying defects in zzso zzso and also in zzso and cell zzso One of the zzso zzso targets is the protein zzso zzso zzso stress responsive zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso is activated in response to zzso stress by zzso family members, and is largely associated with zzso In resting cells, the majority of zzso like zzso is on zzso zzso zzso is also in zzso In contrast to zzso however, zzso does not concentrate around zzso during zzso and does not show a zzso zzso pattern in zzso zzso zzso of zzso has only a modest effect on cell survival and does not lead to zzso zzso We conclude that decreased cell survival associated with loss of zzso is attributable to defects in zzso segregation and zzso and is independent of the zzso zzso zzso
