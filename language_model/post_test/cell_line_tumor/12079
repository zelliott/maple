zzso zzso are highly invasive tumors which are lethal despite aggressive zzso The zzso behavior of two human zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso cells was zzso The zzso cells showed a high degree of zzso zzso (especially zzso zzso that may be related to the considerable local zzso of such zzso even in the absence of zzso zzso The two cell lines responded equally well to zzso growth factor zzso as zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was strongly involved in the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso was capable of zzso the migration in both zzso cell lines without affecting crucial targets for zzso control like zzso and zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso by interfering with a target further downstream to zzso zzso affects zzso cell zzso and may thus offer a pharmacological approach to controlling the zzso zzso of these aggressive zzso zzso
