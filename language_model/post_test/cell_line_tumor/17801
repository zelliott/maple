High zzso infection in gastric cancer zzso suggests a possible association between zzso infection and zzso By using human gastric cancer cells zzso and mouse melanoma cells zzso zzso expressing zzso the major zzso of zzso zzso we found that zzso enhanced cell zzso migration, and invasion in zzso With experimental zzso model in zzso mice, zzso zzso zzso cells formed more zzso zzso in the zzso Furthermore, zzso promoted the zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso significantly blocked zzso zzso but has little effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso was only partially suppressed by inhibitor of zzso or by inhibitor of zzso However, all these zzso significantly reduced the zzso zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may stimulate invasion by increasing the activity of zzso thereby inducing zzso zzso and contributing to tumor zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and its regulated molecules could be the potential targets for cancer zzso
