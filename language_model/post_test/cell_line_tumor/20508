An zzso extract and fraction from the marine sponge zzso zzso have zzso zzso We performed a chemical and biological characterization of the zzso substance from zzso zzso and investigated its mode of action on zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso activity of the zzso extract of zzso zzso was determined against 14 bacteria belonging to type strains and clinical zzso zzso The zzso extract was zzso under zzso guidance and the zzso substance was identified by its zzso zzso and mass zzso The zzso and the zzso of this substance were zzso This substance was also subjected to zzso zzso The mode of action on zzso zzso cells was investigated by light and transmission electron zzso zzso 

zzso zzso showed a large spectrum of activity against type strains and zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso extract was zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated for the first time from zzso zzso zzso zzso had a zzso effect on zzso growing zzso zzso cells at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed moderate toxicity against cancer cell line zzso zzso This substance apparently acts by damaging the cell zzso with subsequent cell zzso 

zzso zzso is a zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso with a mode of action involving disruption of the zzso zzso It is a new candidate for research on zzso zzso
