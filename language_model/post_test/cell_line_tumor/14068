The expression of collagen zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso is zzso in invasive areas of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of collagen zzso is zzso from the plasma membrane of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The released zzso is predicted to regulate cell zzso zzso and zzso We report that the cell zzso domain of collagen zzso zzso is able to zzso attract invasive zzso SCC cells but not zzso Analysis of zzso expression revealed that zzso cells, unlike zzso express zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso We show that this novel zzso function is zzso by the known zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we report that zzso a zzso zzso zzso drug widely used for the therapy of acute coronary zzso syndrome and the prevention of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Together, these data demonstrate a novel interaction between collagen zzso and zzso zzso and also suggest a possibility to use zzso to inhibit the invasion and progression of zzso expressing SCC zzso
