zzso cancer is one of the most aggressive tumors in zzso Its aggressiveness is only due to the biological progressive characteristics but also the difficulty for clinical early detection which urges us to find diagnostic tools for early zzso zzso are a developing tool used to measure molecules such as zzso DNA, or zzso in blood samples or suspected tumor zzso The molecular zzso is believed to play major roles in zzso or a result after the tumor formation and can be used as a zzso for tumor zzso 

In this paper, we studied the gene expression profiles using zzso from pancreatic cancer zzso 

We observed zzso of gene expression profiles using zzso sequencing technique and verified zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso both in pancreatic cell lines and zzso zzso by zzso and Northern zzso A detailed description of the genes involved is listed within this zzso 

We believe that by unraveling the gene zzso profiles in pancreatic tumor zzso can we achieve an early and precise diagnosis of pancreatic zzso Moreover, these newly found zzso due to their functions involved in cell migration and zzso may play major roles in zzso
