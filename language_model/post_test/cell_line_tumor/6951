The sea zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and subsequently accumulates its derived zzso with characteristic zzso In the present study, we isolated zzso and zzso as zzso having zzso activity from zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the growth of zzso human leukemia cells in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso was decreased by zzso and zzso of control after 48 h zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso induced zzso in zzso cells, zzso human breast cancer cells, and zzso human colon cancer zzso When zzso cells were incubated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso for 48 zzso relative DNA zzso were enhanced to zzso and zzso compared to that in control cells, zzso The activities of zzso induction by zzso and zzso were higher than that of zzso which we have previously reported as a zzso possessing the ability to induce zzso zzso exhibited the highest zzso activity among the three zzso Furthermore, the expression levels of zzso protein zzso were decreased in zzso cells treated with zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso exhibited potential zzso effects via zzso induction in several cancer cell zzso
