zzso zzso zzso is a synthetic zzso that has been used in processed food and medicinal zzso The zzso effect of PG in leukemia is zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that PG reduced cell viability in zzso zzso and zzso leukemia cells and induced zzso in zzso zzso PG activated zzso 3, 8, and 9 and increased the levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso PG activated zzso protein zzso zzso inhibited nuclear zzso of the nuclear factor zzso zzso factor 2 zzso and induced zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, PG increased zzso zzso expression and decreased zzso levels of zzso oxygen zzso Our data show for the first time that an early event of zzso zzso is zzso zzso depletion and that PG induced zzso via multiple pathways in human zzso PG might serve as a potential zzso agent or food supplement for human leukemia zzso
