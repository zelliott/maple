zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are among the most common and most treatment resistant soft tissue zzso of zzso Here, we evaluated the potential of zzso zzso as a marker of therapeutic response to zzso zzso an zzso zzso in a conditional mouse model of zzso and a conditional model of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso tumor cell cultures from zzso and zzso conditional models of zzso and zzso were found to be highly sensitive to zzso zzso values 150 and 200 zzso zzso Animals of each model were then treated with 80 zzso zzso by zzso injection for 12 days and zzso by zzso zzso 

zzso volumes on day 4 for zzso zzso and zzso mice were lower than zzso control mouse tumor volumes, although treated tumors were larger than day zzso However, tumor zzso zzso was significantly reduced on day 4 for zzso mice compared to zzso baseline or zzso control mice on day 4 zzso zzso zzso Nevertheless, by day 12 tumor volumes and zzso zzso for treated mice had increased significantly, indicating rapidly evolving resistance to zzso 

zzso PET imaging is a potential imaging zzso of molecular zzso to targeted agents early in treatment for this aggressive form of zzso but may find best use serially for Phase zzso studies where chemotherapy and targeted agents are combined to zzso tumors and abrogate zzso inhibitor zzso
