The purpose of this study was to investigate the zzso and biological significance of human zzso zzso cell zzso zzso 6 zzso gene expression in human zzso zzso zzso is reported to be involved in human zzso However, in zzso expression of zzso and its zzso significance have not been zzso zzso expression status was determined and zzso with respect to various zzso parameters in 23 zzso zzso Additionally, we investigated effects of zzso gene in the zzso cell zzso zzso gene expression in cancer zzso was higher than in zzso zzso in 16 of the 23 zzso however, it was not statistically zzso The zzso with elevated zzso expression showed a tendency to be associated with zzso invasion and stage of the zzso Interestingly, patients with high zzso expression showed a significantly poorer zzso survival rate than those with low zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso cells were more zzso more invasive and more zzso to zzso compared to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso gene zzso by zzso zzso resulted in higher zzso to zzso zzso is a potential zzso indicator and potential zzso marker to zzso for patients with zzso zzso
