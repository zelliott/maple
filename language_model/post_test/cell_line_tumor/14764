Several lines of evidence have suggested that some naturally occurring zzso of zzso B virus zzso play a critical role in zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso To prove the relationship between the zzso zzso and zzso molecular epidemiology studies using zzso zzso restriction analysis zzso were performed, and the molecular mechanism was investigated through construction of a stable zzso cell line expressing the large surface HB protein zzso with the zzso zzso zzso Application of zzso zzso to samples from zzso Korean patients with chronic liver diseases of different clinical stages confirmed that zzso zzso were significantly related to zzso even in comparison to liver zzso zzso zzso of patients, or zzso liver zzso zzso of patients, or zzso P zzso zzso By studying stable cell lines, we found that zzso could induce cell cycle progression by zzso the zzso and zzso pathways and zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that in a zzso zzso the zzso rates in cell lines expressing zzso were about twice as high as those of the wild zzso In conclusion, our results suggest that zzso may contribute zzso to the zzso of zzso by inducing cell proliferation and zzso So, the zzso zzso examined in this study could serve as a diagnostic marker for the prognosis of zzso
