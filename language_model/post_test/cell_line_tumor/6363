zzso is the most frequent and zzso zzso in zzso To develop an effective gene therapy strategy for glioblastoma, we investigated the zzso effects of zzso and zzso zzso zzso restoration and zzso specifically targeting zzso and zzso on zzso zzso cells in zzso and in subcutaneous zzso Restoration of zzso or zzso of zzso but not zzso in zzso cells markedly zzso the zzso level of zzso zzso cell proliferation and colony formation, arrests the cell cycle at the zzso stage, and promotes zzso zzso Combined treatment with zzso restoration and zzso zzso shows strong zzso zzso restoration or zzso zzso is also able to efficiently inhibit the growth of human zzso zzso zzso in nude mice, while tumor growth is entirely suppressed by a combination of the two zzso In addition, we found that the zzso levels of zzso of zzso proteins zzso are reduced in zzso cells by zzso restoration, suggesting that combined zzso effects may also be partly attributed to the zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso our results demonstrate that zzso K zzso play specific roles in zzso and that combined treatment of zzso restoration and zzso zzso is a promising gene therapy strategy for zzso zzso
