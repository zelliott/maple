zzso is responsible for most cancer zzso Here, we show that zzso (or zzso gene functions as an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was decreased in liver zzso compared with primary colon tumors in both mice and zzso zzso inhibited zzso signaling by converting active zzso zzso complexes into repression complexes on zzso nuclear zzso In tumor cells, zzso signaling was triggered by zzso on adjoining blood vessels, and zzso zzso zzso zzso depletion of zzso in zzso zzso zzso mice caused marked tumor invasion and zzso that were suppressed by zzso signaling zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso signaling can be a promising strategy for prevention and treatment of colon cancer zzso
