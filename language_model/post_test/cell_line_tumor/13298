The aim of this study was to examine the expression and role of zzso elevated zzso zzso in biological processes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso patients was characterized with zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso cells was detected by real-time zzso and western zzso Cell zzso cell cycle and zzso were measured by zzso and flow zzso zzso activity was detected by gelatin zzso Of the studied tumors, 104 zzso exhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells suppressed cell proliferation and induced cell zzso inhibited zzso and zzso protein expression as well as zzso zzso zzso of zzso using zzso could provide a potential approach for gene therapy against zzso and the zzso effects may be associated with zzso of zzso and zzso protein expression and zzso zzso
