zzso and experimental evidence points to a critical involvement of the zzso zzso orphan zzso zzso in zzso development and zzso Unlike conventional nuclear zzso zzso appears not to function as a zzso zzso zzso Instead, it has acquired the capability to act as a zzso zzso of zzso factor 1 zzso The interplay of zzso and zzso is considered a central, presumably zzso element of zzso development and function that requires tight zzso This raises a substantial interest in identifying its zzso and the regulatory signals zzso Here, we uncover molecular mechanisms that link zzso to the zzso modification system via functional interaction with the zzso zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso is zzso with zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso gene zzso We provide evidence for the in zzso existence of a zzso complex containing zzso and zzso at the promoters of the zzso and zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso functions to stabilize zzso which might be linked to zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso appears to be required for zzso to repress transcription, provides means to regulate zzso in zzso ways, and emerges as a relevant zzso of zzso pathways governing physiology and zzso
