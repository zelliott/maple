zzso virus 40 zzso is a DNA tumor virus known to induce zzso in laboratory zzso There are numerous reports of the detection of zzso DNA and/or proteins in human zzso of the same types as those induced by zzso in animals, including brain zzso However, known exposure to the virus has not yet been linked directly to cancer development in a specific zzso Here we describe the detection of zzso sequences in the zzso of a laboratory researcher who had a probable direct exposure to zzso and subsequently developed a tumor positive for viral DNA sequences indistinguishable from those of the laboratory zzso This case suggests a link between viral exposure and tumor zzso
