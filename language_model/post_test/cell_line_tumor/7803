zzso zzso 33 zzso is a novel member of the sorting zzso zzso with three predicted structural zzso zzso Very little is known about the cellular function of zzso In an effort to analyze its zzso relationship, we attempted but failed to generate stable cell lines for short hairpin zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso both zzso and zzso cells to grow multiple long zzso delay the zzso transition, and become more zzso zzso that zzso may control cell cycle process through influence the zzso In zzso cell lineage analysis revealed that cells zzso with zzso failed to divide and became zzso suggesting a specific zzso in zzso Further analysis revealed that zzso induced the zzso of zzso at the zzso space, which might have disabled the zzso zzso However, zzso appears to mediate zzso zzso zzso as they do not interact with each zzso zzso interacts with itself and zzso Interestingly, it also interacts with zzso domain of zzso syndrome protein zzso a protein known to be involved in zzso zzso Indeed, cells zzso zzso failed to divide and form stable colonies as zzso consistent with the notion that zzso may interfere with zzso On the other hand, zzso of zzso zzso the zzso induced by zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso plays a role in maintaining cell shape and cell cycle progression through its interaction with zzso
