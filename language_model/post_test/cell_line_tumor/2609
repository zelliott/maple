Previously, it has been demonstrated that the zzso zzso particle zzso is able to package DNA in zzso coli and deliver the DNA into human colon cancer cells for gene zzso In this study, the maximum size of DNA packaged by the zzso was determined zzso zzso zzso with various sizes were packaged by the zzso in zzso zzso Human zzso cells were then infected with the zzso containing the various sizes of DNA to allow gene zzso In addition, zzso zzso packaged in the zzso were extracted and zzso back into zzso coli under selection to determine the size of the DNA zzso The results showed that the zzso zzso was able to package zzso DNA in zzso coli up to at least zzso zzso in size and this size of DNA could be delivered successfully into human zzso cells for gene zzso The zzso zzso is able to package zzso DNA up to at least zzso zzso in size for gene zzso These findings will help with the development of gene delivery systems using the zzso zzso as the gene delivery zzso
