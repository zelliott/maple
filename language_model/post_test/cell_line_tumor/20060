zzso zzso division cycle 25) zzso are essential for cell cycle control under normal conditions and in response to DNA zzso They are represented by three zzso zzso B and C, each of them being submitted to an alternative zzso zzso Alternative zzso of many genes is affected in response to zzso stress, but the impact of such a stress on zzso zzso has never been zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso agents zzso zzso zzso and zzso alter the balance between zzso zzso zzso in human breast cancer cell lines both at the zzso and protein zzso This zzso occurs during the response to moderate, zzso DNA zzso Our results also suggest that the zzso zzso zzso expression shift induced by a zzso stress is dependent on the zzso signaling but not on zzso This study highlights the zzso of zzso alternative zzso as an additional regulatory event involved in cellular response to DNA damage in breast cancer zzso
