Small zzso zzso of the BET family of zzso which bind zzso zzso within zzso has been shown to have a marked therapeutic benefit in zzso models of mixed lineage leukemia zzso fusion zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso a highly specific BET family zzso zzso leads to growth zzso in a human zzso zzso cell line as well as in zzso precursors isolated from zzso zzso zzso One of the genes most highly zzso by zzso was zzso an important zzso regulator of zzso stem cell development and zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso is dependent upon zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso Here, we show that the zzso changes induced by a zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso in zzso cells are significantly zzso suggesting a common zzso of zzso We generated zzso inhibitor resistant zzso cells and showed that these retain sensitivity to zzso These data highlight zzso as a potential alternative treatment against zzso zzso driven by zzso active zzso zzso
