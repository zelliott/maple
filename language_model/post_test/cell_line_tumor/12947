zzso growth zzso zzso zzso is widely zzso in a variety of human zzso including zzso zzso It plays an important role in cancer cell proliferation and tumor zzso In this study, small interfering zzso zzso was used to silence zzso gene expression in the human zzso cancer cell line zzso and then its effects on zzso zzso zzso and the growth of tumor cells in zzso and in nude mice were zzso 

Three zzso sequences for the zzso gene were cloned into expression plasmids and zzso into zzso zzso The zzso of zzso expression at both zzso and protein levels were detected by real-time zzso chain reaction and western zzso zzso Cell proliferation zzso rates were determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso mice zzso per zzso were zzso zzso with zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso growth, cellular proliferation zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were compared for mice administered either zzso or negative control zzso over 5 zzso 

The zzso and protein expression of zzso was significantly decreased at 48 hours after zzso leading to a potent suppression of tumor cell proliferation in zzso The zzso zzso dramatically suppressed tumor growth and cellular zzso as well as promoted tumor cellular zzso and inhibited zzso in an zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso targeting of zzso can effectively inhibit the growth of zzso cancer cells and may be used as a potent zzso
