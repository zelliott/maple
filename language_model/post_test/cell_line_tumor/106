zzso oxygen species zzso have been implicated in tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance of many zzso We evaluated the role of zzso zzso I in TRAIL resistance governed by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling with the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso cascade in liver cancer zzso zzso zzso I expression was found in zzso regions of human patient liver, and zzso I zzso resulted in accelerated zzso cell death in zzso human zzso zzso The TRAIL zzso by zzso I zzso was dependent on zzso of zzso zzso which was zzso by addition of zzso for zzso zzso zzso or zzso suggesting the association with zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso was zzso expressed in both zzso cells and tumor regions of patient zzso zzso of zzso expression could alleviate zzso generation and zzso zzso In accordance with previous findings, increased zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso I zzso was inhibited by either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso these data suggest that zzso I functions to block propagation of zzso zzso signaling to the zzso zzso death cascade during TRAIL treatment and also provides a molecular mechanism by which zzso I contributes to TRAIL resistance in liver zzso
