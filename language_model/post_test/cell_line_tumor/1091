Upon exposure to ultraviolet zzso radiation, zzso changes or the presence of zzso oxygen species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are rapidly zzso zzso studies have zzso molecular components that mediate the zzso of zzso However, it remains unclear whether zzso of zzso by various stress signals involves different zzso Here we show that zzso channel activity is involved in zzso zzso induced by zzso but not by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Specifically, zzso were rapidly zzso upon treatment of zzso cells with zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso with zzso zzso a zzso channel zzso zzso also blocked zzso increase in zzso activity as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso were concentrated at zzso in zzso cells and that these proteins underwent rapid zzso zzso upon zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso induced by zzso was largely blocked by zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso was blocked by zzso a zzso zzso agent also affecting zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso activities were inhibited by zzso suggesting that the zzso status does play an important role in the zzso of zzso Taken together, our findings suggest that zzso zzso by zzso and zzso is zzso by distinct yet overlapping pathways and that zzso channel activity and zzso status are zzso required for zzso and zzso zzso of zzso
