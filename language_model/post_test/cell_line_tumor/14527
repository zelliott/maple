zzso zzso zzso 3 beta zzso plays a critical role in signal zzso concerning zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the potential role of zzso in zzso zzso toxicity in human zzso cell line zzso We assessed the zzso proteins and the relative levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, we zzso the expression of zzso by short hairpin zzso zzso interference and compared the cell viability and expression of zzso proteins in zzso group with those in control group under the treatment of zzso We found that zzso increased the expression of zzso and zzso but not zzso Additionally, zzso decreased the ratio of zzso zzso and increased the ratio of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso induced less cell viability loss and lower expression of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso group compared with zzso The present data indicate that zzso may induce zzso in zzso via the intrinsic death zzso and zzso zzso can partly zzso zzso zzso death and zzso suggesting that zzso may have the potential to serve as a therapeutic target for zzso
