To determine the potential zzso factors produced by culture zzso of clinical zzso of zzso zzso 

Culture zzso of clinical zzso of zzso zzso were zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso in zzso zzso green zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed intensive zzso loss of zzso junctions and membrane zzso zzso followed by death of zzso zzso In zzso and zzso cells, the zzso effects were characterized by vigorous zzso and cell zzso The viability of cultured zzso cells was determined with neutral red and demonstrated that the sensitivity among the cells was zzso This activity was zzso by heating at 56 degrees C for 15 zzso and zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso The clinical zzso zzso presented a zzso zzso activity similar to the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso culture zzso caused vigorous zzso and cell zzso in zzso and zzso cells, produced zzso and zzso zzso 

This work revealed the presence of putative zzso factors that could be associated with human infections involving zzso zzso zzso
