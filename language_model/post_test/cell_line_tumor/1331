Recent advances in stem cell biology have identified zzso cells zzso in a variety of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso group gene products such as zzso and zzso have been characterized as general zzso regulators in a wide range of normal stem cells and zzso We previously reported that zzso tightly regulates the zzso and differentiation of zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso zzso cells remains zzso In this study, we conducted zzso zzso of zzso using zzso zzso and pharmacological zzso of zzso by an zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso Both zzso and zzso treatment impaired cell growth and zzso sphere formation of zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that the two approaches decreased the number of zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Administration of zzso zzso or zzso suppressed the tumors by implanted zzso cells in non-obese zzso combined zzso zzso Of note, however, zzso but not zzso predominantly reduced the number of zzso cells and diminished the zzso capability of these cells as judged by sphere formation zzso Our findings reveal that zzso zzso cells are highly dependent on zzso for their zzso zzso Although further analyses of zzso from primary zzso would be necessary, pharmacological interference with zzso might be a promising therapeutic approach to targeting zzso zzso zzso
