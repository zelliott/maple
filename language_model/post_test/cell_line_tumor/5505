Fluorescent protein that detects zzso zzso was used for the zzso observation of zzso cell zzso In the target cells zzso with zzso zzso fusion zzso complementary DNA, zzso zzso can be detected significantly earlier than the commonly used zzso binding that detects membrane change in zzso zzso Moreover, during the zzso interaction between zzso zzso and zzso tumor target cells, detachment of zzso from the target cells occurred prior to zzso zzso and death of the target cells, indicating very early sensing of zzso target cells by zzso This early detachment of zzso zzso from zzso target cells was inhibited by the expression of zzso zzso zzso on the target zzso Taken together, zzso observation of cellular interaction with functional probe, zzso provides new kinetic information and demonstrates that zzso molecules regulate the zzso of zzso cell zzso
