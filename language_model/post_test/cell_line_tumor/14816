zzso have been considered as potential targets for zzso because they are zzso on the surface of melanoma zzso However, zzso with zzso zzso results in a very poor immune response, usually zzso by zzso zzso To overcome this zzso we zzso mice with zzso a zzso zzso zzso that recognizes the most zzso zzso zzso our goal was to obtain zzso zzso zzso bearing the internal image of zzso Animals produced zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso were able to inhibit zzso zzso binding to zzso In addition, the zzso zzso were shown to recognize zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were then selected from two fusion experiments for zzso The most interesting finding emerged from the characterization of the zzso zzso zzso It was shown to recognize two different zzso human melanoma cell lines in zzso and to mediate tumor cell zzso by complement zzso and zzso cellular zzso The biological activity of the zzso zzso was also tested in a mouse tumor model, in which it was shown to be a powerful growth inhibitor of melanoma zzso Thus, activity of the zzso zzso zzso matched that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso Altogether, our results indicate that the zzso approach might produce high zzso specific and very efficient zzso immune zzso
