The inhibitor of zzso zzso protein zzso is expressed in most zzso and is a key factor in maintaining zzso zzso Although several zzso have been shown to act as direct zzso of zzso the precise zzso function of zzso remains zzso To clarify the mechanism by which zzso protects cells, we investigated the zzso of zzso and zzso events following zzso zzso utilizing a melanoma cell line harboring a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in both zzso zzso and zzso however, the level of zzso was only partially reduced by zzso zzso zzso blockade also resulted in zzso events that preceded zzso zzso including zzso and release of zzso c and zzso zzso of other zzso were not altered in zzso cells, although modest zzso of zzso and zzso was zzso The earliest zzso event observed in zzso cells was nuclear zzso of zzso zzso factor zzso known to trigger both zzso zzso events and zzso DNA zzso These findings suggest that a key zzso function of zzso relates to zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and its expression in melanoma and other zzso likely protects against both zzso and zzso zzso
