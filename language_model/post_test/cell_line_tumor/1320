zzso zzso doped zzso zzso zzso with well zzso zzso and high zzso have been successfully zzso through a zzso zzso The zzso images illustrate that the zzso doped zzso zzso are zzso (or zzso with a mean diameter of zzso zzso The excellent zzso in some of the polar zzso including water is achieved by using zzso as the capping zzso The zzso groups of the zzso chains on one hand bind to the zzso surface; on the other hand the free ones could link to functional materials including zzso The zzso zzso doped with zzso and zzso zzso show the characteristic zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso green zzso at zzso zzso as the strongest one) and zzso zzso zzso color at zzso zzso and zzso zzso color at zzso zzso zzso zzso The energy transfer from zzso to zzso and zzso was also investigated in zzso In zzso studies of zzso doped zzso zzso zzso on zzso cells confirm their excellent biological zzso The obtained solid zzso zzso zzso are very stable and flexible and exhibit strong green zzso upon zzso zzso
