This paper reports the identification of zzso resulting from the exposure of zzso cells to zzso zzso The zzso were identified using 2 independent and complementary techniques, zzso zzso zzso mass zzso and zzso zzso zzso They were identified from the zzso zzso of cells treated for zzso with zzso zzso of 1, 30 and 500 zzso of zzso Five zzso were zzso zzso namely zzso 74, zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one was a zzso zzso namely zzso Three of these zzso zzso zzso and zzso are implicated in a network centered on the zzso receptors zzso and zzso as well as on zzso After the discovery phase, three zzso were selected to test the presence of zzso using selected reaction monitoring zzso They were monitored using zzso after incubation of zzso in the presence of zzso for confirmation or selected zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced an zzso of zzso and zzso zzso while tamoxifen and zzso induced a zzso The exposure of all zzso induced the zzso of zzso These markers form a preliminary molecular signature that can be used when testing the zzso activity of zzso either pure or in zzso
