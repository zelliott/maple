zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso acute phase zzso which is also zzso in multiple zzso including breast, zzso and zzso Recently, zzso has been proposed as an early zzso in pancreatic cancer zzso However, its biological role in zzso is zzso In this study, we examined in zzso and in zzso the functional role of zzso in zzso zzso to moderately differentiated zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso expressed high levels of zzso but moderately to poorly differentiated zzso cells zzso and zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso tissue zzso showed specific zzso zzso in zzso zzso specimens zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly blocked zzso cell zzso and invasion in zzso and vice versa with stable zzso clones zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso zzso reduced focal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso in zzso partly through reduced vascular zzso growth factor zzso production and vice zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso had no effect on zzso cell survival, zzso and response to zzso zzso Finally, zzso cells zzso zzso reduced tumor volume zzso zzso zzso local and distant zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with no effect on zzso proliferation index zzso zzso zzso in an zzso nude mouse zzso zzso zzso our results suggest that zzso reduces zzso partly by suppressing zzso zzso and zzso zzso partly by blocking zzso production in zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a potential zzso of invasion and zzso in advanced zzso
