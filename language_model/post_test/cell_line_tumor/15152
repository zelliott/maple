zzso of the environmental toxin and zzso zzso zzso zzso include a wasting syndrome associated with decreased zzso zzso is a potent zzso of the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso a zzso activated zzso zzso The relationship between gene zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso is not well zzso We recently identified a zzso by which the zzso target gene zzso zzso zzso zzso contributes to zzso suppression of zzso of zzso zzso zzso a key regulator of zzso by consuming zzso and decreasing zzso 1 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso We report here that zzso zzso also targets zzso for zzso Both zzso and zzso forms of zzso were found to undergo zzso zzso zzso suppression also enhanced zzso and did so by a zzso zzso zzso This report 1) identifies zzso as a new zzso modification for zzso 2) describes a zzso by which zzso induction of zzso by the zzso can lead to a downstream zzso change in a zzso target protein zzso and 3) reveals that the zzso exerts complex, previously unidentified zzso effects on zzso
