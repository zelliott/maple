The candidate gene for zzso zzso type zzso has been localized to the zzso region of the zzso 8 by the linkage zzso zzso To validate the zzso of the zzso we rescued the deficient zzso zzso zzso activity in the cultured cells of zzso zzso patients by functional zzso via zzso zzso zzso The introduction of the target human zzso completely restored the activity confirming functional zzso of the candidate gene on human zzso zzso
