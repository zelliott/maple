The persistent zzso agent zzso zzso zzso zzso effects that alters zzso and behavior both during development and zzso There are many ongoing efforts to determine the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso the signaling pathways involved and its molecular targets in zzso In this work, we have used zzso human zzso cells to characterize the zzso zzso zzso produces a loss of viability linked to an increased zzso activity, zzso zzso DNA zzso nuclear fragmentation and zzso zzso DNA content, in a similar way than zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso In addition, zzso produces a decrease of zzso membrane potential and an increase of zzso calcium concentration zzso zzso zzso Finally, based on the high zzso properties of the zzso we test the zzso effect on the membrane integrity using zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso produces calcium zzso through the membrane and an zzso decrease zzso zzso zzso that reflects an increase in membrane zzso zzso these results support the hypothesis that zzso toxicity in zzso zzso cells provokes the disruption of calcium zzso probably affecting membrane structural integrity, leading to an zzso zzso
