The DNA mismatch repair system zzso maintains zzso stability through recognition and repair of zzso zzso and small zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso causes zzso instability and the zzso of zzso zzso that can cause or contribute to zzso In fact, zzso of certain solid and zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso do not respond to some standard of care zzso because of presumed increased tolerance of DNA damage, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic zzso Toward this goal, we generated zzso cancer cell lines for direct comparison of zzso and zzso zzso We engineered zzso lung zzso cells to contain a zzso zzso designed to suppress the expression of the mismatch repair gene zzso and compared single cell zzso that were zzso zzso versus induced for the zzso zzso zzso Here we present the characterization of these zzso cell lines and validate a novel class of zzso zzso compounds that zzso inhibit the proliferation of zzso cancer zzso
