Environmental zzso possessing hormonal activity have long been suspected of playing a role in cancer zzso What is unclear is whether such agents elicit their effects through zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was tested in the zzso M zzso zzso damage in zzso breast cells and zzso prostate cells was assessed using the zzso block zzso zzso zzso zzso were scored in 1000 zzso cells per zzso Cell viability and cell cycle zzso were also zzso along with zzso and quantitative gene expression analyses of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Following 24 h treatment, zzso zzso zzso induced increases (up to zzso in zzso in both cell zzso zzso in zzso occurred in the absence of DNA zzso breaks or zzso and, compared with zzso and zzso at low zzso zzso induced more zzso than the alpha or beta zzso of zzso Low dose zzso zzso zzso significantly elevated the percentage of zzso cells zzso positive for zzso and of zzso cells zzso positive for zzso Only high dose zzso zzso zzso disrupted cell cycle zzso with increases in percentage of cells in zzso and decreases in percentage of cells in zzso Despite a comparable high dose zzso induction of cell cycle arrest, marked increases in expression of zzso were observed only in zzso cells, although in zzso cells a significant increase zzso zzso zzso in the percentage of cells zzso positive for zzso was zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso can induce a number of subtle zzso in breast and prostate cells in the absence of zzso
