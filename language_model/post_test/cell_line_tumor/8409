Patients with advanced head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso have a poor prognosis with the currently available therapy, and tumor recurrence is frequently zzso The discovery of specific zzso cancer stem cell zzso markers is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to target these zzso To address this issue, we established sphere cultures to enrich zzso and used them for plasma membrane zzso to identify specific membrane signatures of the zzso zzso Of a zzso that included a total of 376 identified zzso 200 were bona fide membrane zzso Among them, 123 proteins were at least zzso zzso or zzso in the spheres relative to the adherent zzso These proteins included cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Some of them play key roles in zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso When we compared our zzso with two published zzso membrane protein signatures, we found 18 proteins common to all three of the zzso zzso and zzso were two such zzso Interestingly, the expression of zzso rather than that of the well-established zzso zzso marker zzso was significantly related to the zzso behavior of zzso Relative to zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso cells had a greater zzso ability in zzso and tumor formation ability in zzso Patients whose tumors expressed high levels of zzso had a significantly poorer clinical outcome than those whose tumors expressed low levels of zzso zzso 1: 96 cases, p zzso zzso whereas the level of zzso expression had only a marginal influence on the clinical outcome of patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso The level of zzso expression in zzso tumors was also associated with the tumor recurrence rate zzso zzso 104 cases, p zzso zzso This study demonstrates that zzso is a valuable cell surface marker for the enrichment of zzso stem cells and that plasma membrane zzso is a promising biological tool for investigating the membrane proteins of zzso
