zzso zzso zzso protect pancreatic zzso against zzso This property might relate to the increased risk to develop diabetes in patients with low HDL blood zzso However, the mechanisms by which zzso protect zzso are poorly zzso Here we used a zzso approach to identify genes zzso modulated by zzso in zzso subjected to zzso zzso The transcript zzso zzso protein zzso was zzso by serum zzso and zzso blocked this zzso zzso zzso zzso translation in its zzso or zzso state but it loses this ability when zzso At the protein level, zzso was also zzso in response to zzso and zzso and this was blunted by zzso Whereas an zzso increase of zzso expression induced zzso death, zzso zzso increase with short hairpin zzso inhibited the zzso capacities of zzso zzso can therefore protect zzso by blocking zzso protein zzso but this is not the sole protective mechanism activated by zzso Indeed, zzso blocked zzso induced by zzso zzso stress with no associated decrease in total zzso zzso zzso zzso favored the zzso and hence the zzso of zzso in these conditions, this appeared not to be required for HDL zzso Our results indicate that zzso can protect zzso through zzso of zzso depending on the type of stress zzso
