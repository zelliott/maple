The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression status and clinical implications of the stem cell genes zzso and zzso in breast zzso zzso of the zzso protein in zzso tumor cells zzso was detected by western zzso The resulting expression status and the relationship between zzso and zzso were determined in 726 breast zzso using zzso zzso and zzso double zzso zzso the relationship between zzso and zzso protein zzso and zzso parameters and prognosis was zzso The zzso protein was expressed at a higher level in zzso when compared to that in the control cells and was related to the resistance of zzso to zzso The zzso and zzso proteins were zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was observed in 235 zzso of the 726 cases zzso After universal analysis and zzso analysis, zzso type, zzso zzso zzso zzso breast cancer, zzso stage and distant zzso were verified as related to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A survival analysis revealed that zzso and zzso zzso was associated with a poorer prognosis zzso zzso zzso zzso After running Cox regression, the factors of age, tumor size, zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor status, zzso stage, distant zzso and zzso and zzso zzso were shown to be independent zzso factors of breast zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso may be a new zzso for evaluating the progression and chemotherapy sensitivity of breast zzso
