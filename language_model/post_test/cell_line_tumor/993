zzso of the zzso zzso factor zzso is required for early stages of zzso zzso Defining mechanisms regulating zzso zzso expression will be important to understand development of this zzso However, the zzso required for zzso zzso expression are not fully zzso Previous work identified HS 1 as a major zzso zzso but its role in zzso zzso expression is zzso Here, we show that mouse HS 1 deletion leaves zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso differentiation zzso zzso isolated from zzso and encompassing HS 1 is zzso enriched for zzso zzso zzso HS 1 deletion does not alter zzso zzso locus zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso binding protein zzso zzso zzso do not bind HS 1 but bind selectively a zzso in the first zzso zzso Thus, HS 1 is not required for zzso zzso zzso Instead, this study suggests a previously zzso role for the zzso zzso element for this zzso
