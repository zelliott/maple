We report zzso a novel strategy for the preparation of zzso zzso vehicles for zzso active pharmaceutical zzso 

The procedure consisted of three steps, zzso exposure of zzso zzso of a protein to a zzso partial zzso interaction between zzso zzso on the protein and the zzso active pharmaceutical zzso and a final step where the structure of the protein was reversed to a zzso state by returning to neutral zzso As proof of concept, the interaction of zzso with partially unfolded states of human serum zzso was evaluated as a potential method for the preparation of zzso complexes of the zzso with zzso 

We found that zzso readily binds to zzso partially unfolded zzso leading to the formation of zzso clear zzso zzso The complexes thus formed were more stable in solution when the zzso native state was at least partially restored by zzso of the solution to a pH around zzso It was also observed that the zzso radius of human serum zzso was only slightly increased after the cycle of pH changes, remaining in a zzso state with a size according to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso binding did not affect the overall exposure of charged groups of human serum zzso as evaluated by its interaction with an zzso exchange zzso 

The in zzso biological activity of the complexes formed was zzso equivalent to that of a zzso zzso
