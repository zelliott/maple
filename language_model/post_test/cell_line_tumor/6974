Previous results demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso production and stimulates zzso liberation in rat zzso zzso cells, a model for the pancreatic zzso This study addresses the impact of zzso on insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels of zzso cells in a zzso system were zzso Initially, zzso was used to stimulate zzso and subsequently insulin zzso zzso of zzso (5 zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso and insulin levels (down to zzso of insulin and zzso zzso The zzso zzso toxin zzso was used to distinguish between the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso In our experiments we employed a specific stimulation pattern to prove proper zzso of zzso by zzso In zzso cells incubated with 250 zzso zzso for 24 zzso zzso was no longer able to inhibit the zzso zzso and insulin zzso In a study, zzso was used to stimulate zzso and subsequently insulin zzso Surprisingly, incubation of zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso inhibited insulin release (down to zzso of insulin zzso Finally, in zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso insulin release (up to zzso of insulin zzso In conclusion, we found that the zzso zzso on pancreatic zzso is coupled to parallel signaling zzso with opposite influences on insulin zzso The zzso and subsequently zzso signaling zzso involves zzso zzso and is zzso in terms of insulin zzso
