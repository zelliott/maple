Recent studies have indicated that zzso proteins and their accessory proteins are involved in zzso release in mast cells and neurotransmitter release in zzso zzso These data suggest that a similar molecular mechanism operates in both zzso However, mast and zzso cells are structurally very zzso an active zone is found in zzso zzso In the present study, we examined the involvement of active zone proteins during zzso in mast zzso We found that several active zone proteins are expressed in zzso cells and focused on one of those proteins called zzso zzso and zzso of zzso caused an increase and decrease in zzso activity, zzso zzso analysis and live imaging of the expression of zzso zzso showed that zzso was zzso to the plasma membrane after zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso positively regulates zzso release in zzso by acting on the plasma membrane upon zzso
