Gap junctions mediate zzso communication through channels composed of proteins termed zzso zzso We have shown that zzso is zzso in the liver of female rats exposed to zzso zzso an zzso environmental zzso This is zzso with the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso pathway, leading to the zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an adhering junction zzso is also zzso in the liver of these female rats, zzso to the zzso of zzso Using an in zzso model, the aim of this study was to determine the role of the zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso In order to mimic the zzso of the zzso pathway, a zzso rat zzso cell line, zzso was zzso zzso with an expression zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso cells displayed significantly lower zzso zzso levels and zzso was also activated and zzso into the zzso Using a zzso active zzso expression zzso we showed that zzso zzso cells had lower zzso zzso levels, indicating a role for zzso in zzso zzso Finally, using an zzso zzso a zzso form of zzso we showed that zzso protein levels were reduced in zzso cells as compared with cell zzso with the zzso inactive zzso zzso suggesting that the nuclear form of zzso is responsible for the zzso of zzso Overall, these data indicate that zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso and that this is zzso via the zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso
