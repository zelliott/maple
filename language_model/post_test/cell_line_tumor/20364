In this study, we report an zzso drug delivery system based on zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso consist of uniform zzso zzso with an average diameter of 25 zzso The drug delivery system demonstrates the ability to release zzso by zzso of the zzso bond in mildly zzso zzso The zzso overlap between zzso of donor zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso and 477 zzso zzso and the broad zzso of zzso zzso centered at around zzso zzso enables energy transfer to occur between the zzso and zzso The zzso and recovery of the zzso zzso of zzso by zzso due to zzso resonance energy transfer zzso mechanism are applied as optical probe to confirm the zzso conjunction and monitor the release of zzso The zzso zzso zzso exhibit an obvious zzso effect on zzso zzso cancer cells via zzso zzso Meanwhile, the zzso process of zzso zzso zzso by zzso cells was demonstrated through zzso laser scanning zzso zzso flow zzso and zzso Such drug delivery system, which combines zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso property, has excellent potential applications in cancer therapy and smart zzso
