The development of green fluorescent protein zzso technology combined with live cell zzso techniques have revealed the dynamic properties of zzso proteins in the zzso The mobility of a zzso protein can be assessed using a quantitative zzso technique, zzso recovery after zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrate that many nuclear proteins are highly mobile within the zzso However, the factors within the nucleus that regulate this mobility are not zzso This is partly due to an absence of protocols that can be used to identify such nuclear mobility zzso We developed a novel in zzso zzso that combines a zzso zzso and extraction procedure with a quantitative zzso technique, a method we used to uncover a new functional role for molecular zzso in the nuclear mobility of steroid zzso This zzso can readily be adapted to identify and characterize other nuclear mobility zzso
