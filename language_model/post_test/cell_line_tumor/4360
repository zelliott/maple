zzso a major cellular zzso zzso zzso serves a central role in repairing damage induced by cancer drugs, pollutants and radiation and in the zzso of several cancer zzso drugs and zzso Current methods measure zzso levels only, which require cellular zzso rather than the zzso recycling dependent zzso activity in intact zzso Here, we present a novel method using a zzso probe of the zzso zzso zzso cycle, termed the zzso test, to zzso zzso recycling dependent zzso activity in whole blood and intact human and zzso cells without the need for the isolation and zzso extraction of zzso 

zzso test kit zzso zzso zzso which uses zzso zzso as a probe for the zzso zzso zzso cycle, was used in these zzso The results with zzso test kit in human blood and intact cells were compared with total zzso and high pressure liquid zzso detection of zzso zzso 

The zzso test measured zzso zzso activity both in intact human and zzso cells and breast cancer patient's blood with a better correlation zzso and biological zzso than the zzso zzso Additionally, human blood and zzso cells treated with various zzso showed a zzso decrease in zzso 

The results demonstrate the application of this test for measuring the zzso capacity of blood and the effects of environmental zzso It opens up new avenues for an easy and reliable assessment of zzso zzso capacity in various diseases such as stroke, blood borne diseases, infection, cardiovascular disease and other zzso stress related diseases and as a zzso indicator of chemotherapy response and zzso The use of this approach in zzso including screening drugs that improve the zzso zzso capacity and not just the zzso level is clinically relevant since zzso cells require zzso dependent pathways for zzso zzso
