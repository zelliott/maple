The zzso or zzso of zzso has been observed in zzso zzso breast, and lung tumors and in zzso zzso However, little is known about the role zzso plays in gastric zzso In the present study, we intended to investigate the influence of zzso on the growth, zzso zzso invasion, and cell cycle of the gastric cancer cell line zzso and the gastric cell line zzso zzso zzso was zzso into a zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso in normal gastric cell line zzso by using zzso Then stable zzso were selected and zzso zzso zzso of zzso was achieved using a zzso zzso system which was zzso in gastric cancer cell line zzso The zzso and cell cycles of these clones were analyzed by using flow zzso zzso The growth and proliferation were analyzed by cell growth zzso and zzso zzso zzso The invasion of these clones was analyzed by using cell migration zzso The zzso stable expression clones zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso were detected and compared with their control groups, zzso zzso grew faster than zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso 2 grew slower than zzso and zzso 2 zzso zzso with scrambled control zzso The cell counts of zzso in the third, fourth, zzso zzso and seventh days were significantly more than those of control groups zzso zzso zzso Those of zzso 2 in the fourth, zzso zzso and seventh days were significantly fewer than those of control groups zzso zzso zzso Cell cycle analysis showed that proportions of zzso and zzso cells in zzso and zzso were different significantly with their control groups, respectively zzso zzso zzso The zzso rate of zzso was significantly higher than those of control groups zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso showed that the colony formation rate of zzso was higher than those of control zzso otherwise, the rate of zzso was lower than those of their control groups zzso zzso zzso The results of cell migration zzso showed that there were no significant differences between experimental groups and control groups zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso can promote the growth and proliferation of normal gastric cells, and zzso of zzso can restrain the growth and proliferation of gastric cancer zzso It can induce cell zzso and help tumor cell maintain zzso zzso But it can have not a zzso influence on the ability of invasion of gastric cancer zzso
