Human zzso protein A zzso a zzso of innate immunity and zzso functions, consists of two functional zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression is regulated by several factors including environmental zzso zzso and zzso zzso region zzso zzso zzso have a differential impact on translation efficiency and zzso zzso To study whether these zzso mediate internal zzso entry site zzso activity zzso zzso zzso we performed transient zzso experiments in zzso cells with zzso containing one zzso zzso zzso or zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso genes of a zzso reporter zzso We found that 1) zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibit significantly higher zzso activities than negative control (no zzso zzso and zzso has no zzso the order of highest zzso activity was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) zzso activity of zzso significantly increased in response to diesel particulate matter (20 zzso but not in response to ozone (1 zzso for 1 zzso 3) deletion zzso of zzso revealed regulatory elements associated with zzso zzso one at the end of zzso A attenuated activity, whereas a region containing a short zzso motif in the second half of zzso B and the start of zzso D enhanced zzso 4) elimination of a predicted zzso structure or increase in free energy significantly reduced zzso zzso 5) elimination of one or both zzso structures in zzso did not affect zzso translation zzso Thus several factors, including zzso and secondary structure type and stability, are required for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
