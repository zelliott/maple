zzso is a major zzso zzso zzso with several alternatively spliced zzso including extra domain A zzso which was demonstrated to promote zzso via stimulating zzso and zzso Given that zzso cancer cells are critical in zzso of zzso cancer zzso we zzso that zzso zzso may promote zzso by sustaining the properties of zzso colon cancer zzso We found that tumor tissue and serum zzso levels are substantially higher in advanced versus early stage human zzso zzso we showed that tumor tissue zzso levels are positively correlated with differentiation status and zzso and correlated with a poor prognosis of zzso zzso We also showed that in colon cancer cells zzso zzso versus zzso cells express significantly elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells reduces zzso formation and cells positive for zzso or zzso which is associated with reduced expressions of embryonic stem cell markers and increased expressions of differentiation zzso zzso zzso zzso function strongly reversed the effect of zzso zzso We also provided evidence suggesting that zzso sustains zzso signaling activity via zzso zzso zzso In zzso models, zzso zzso cells exhibit reduced zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso is essential for the maintenance of the properties of zzso colon cancer zzso
