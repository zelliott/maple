zzso their cholesterol lowering effect, statins exert zzso effects, which include zzso zzso and zzso zzso In higher zzso statins trigger zzso in primary cells and zzso zzso In particular, melanoma cells have been found to be susceptible to zzso zzso although only after longer incubation zzso The molecular mechanisms behind this delayed drug-induced zzso are still zzso 

The human melanoma zzso and zzso cell lines were exposed to various statins in a zzso and zzso manner, and indicators of zzso zzso activity and individual zzso pathways were zzso for zzso A zzso dependent and independent zzso 

zzso analysis of zzso zzso revealed an zzso burst for exposure times longer than 24 zzso While the zzso zzso was not activated within 24 zzso longer incubation times zzso amplification of the zzso zzso with significant zzso of zzso zzso Continuous refreshing of the zzso medium zzso the zzso amplification loop via zzso zzso Moreover, conditional zzso supplemented with zzso acid in order to zzso a possible contamination by zzso significantly triggered zzso 8 zzso zzso zzso was excluded as a possible candidate to account for the zzso zzso amplification zzso 

zzso and zzso are capable of triggering an zzso suicide factor, which zzso zzso via the zzso zzso in human melanoma zzso This zzso stimulus implies possible therapeutic potential and may guide feasibility for more potent statins in zzso zzso
