The aim of this study was to investigate the difference in gene expression profiles of human lung zzso cells and identify genes whose expression is altered by heavy zzso but not zzso The lung zzso cell line zzso was zzso with carbon zzso beams and zzso using biologically equivalent doses (2 zzso and 6 zzso zzso The zzso profiling was determined with a high density zzso zzso containing zzso zzso and genetic network and gene zzso analysis was zzso The changes in selected genes involved were validated by quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso analysis identified 49 zzso zzso zzso the expression level of which was altered by carbon zzso but not by zzso From these, 29 were zzso while 20 genes were zzso 4 h zzso with carbon zzso in zzso cells, as compared to the zzso Among these, three genes zzso zzso and zzso were involved in the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso and zzso cell cycle checkpoint zzso The zzso data were zzso by zzso analysis of the selected genes ( zzso Our findings provide information on the genetic signature of carbon zzso in human lung zzso cells and add to the understanding of the complicated molecular response to carbon zzso zzso
