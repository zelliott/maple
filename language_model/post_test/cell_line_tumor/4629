DNA zzso agents including zzso zzso and zzso zzso are the most common form of chemotherapy in the treatment of zzso Despite their frequent use, the therapeutic efficacy of these agents is limited by the development of zzso Previous studies suggest that the mechanism of this resistance is complex and involves multiple DNA repair zzso To better define the pathways contributing to the mechanisms underlying zzso resistance, we tested the contribution of the zzso anemia zzso DNA repair zzso zzso and zzso treatment of zzso cell lines led to a zzso and zzso increase in zzso zzso and zzso nuclear zzso formation, both hallmarks of zzso zzso zzso The zzso cells were more sensitive to zzso relative to their corrected, zzso zzso To test whether these observations were pertinent to zzso biology, we screened a panel of zzso cell lines and identified one zzso that was deficient in the zzso repair zzso This cell line exhibited increased sensitivity to zzso and zzso relative to the zzso zzso cell zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso zzso by a small zzso inhibitor zzso or by small interference zzso suppression caused increased sensitivity to zzso in the zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso effect of zzso zzso appeared additive to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso The results presented in this paper underscore the complexity of cellular resistance to DNA zzso agents and zzso the zzso repair zzso as a zzso of this zzso
