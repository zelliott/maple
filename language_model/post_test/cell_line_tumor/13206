Cancer cells cultured in zzso relevant, three-dimensional zzso zzso can recapture many essential features of native tumor zzso In this study, a zzso acid zzso zzso zzso system that not only supports the zzso formation from zzso prostate cancer zzso cells, but also simulates their zzso interactions with the zzso zzso was developed and zzso zzso zzso were prepared by mixing solutions of zzso precursors zzso with zzso groups zzso and zzso zzso zzso under zzso zzso The zzso zzso gels have an average elastic zzso of 234 zzso 30 Pa and can be zzso readily by zzso The zzso and zzso nature of the zzso chemistry permits facile incorporation of zzso particles and zzso zzso In our zzso zzso zzso the top layer contains zzso zzso zzso zzso particles zzso capable of releasing zzso zzso growth zzso growth factor zzso in a sustained manner at a rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells embedded in the bottom layer receive the growth factor signals from the top, and in response form enlarging zzso with an average diameter of 85 zzso by day zzso zzso in zzso zzso assemble into zzso zzso form close cellular contacts through zzso and show cortical organization of zzso whereas those zzso as zzso zzso adopt a zzso zzso Compared to cells cultured on zzso the engineered zzso significantly increased the expression of two zzso factors, vascular zzso growth zzso zzso and zzso zzso both at zzso and protein zzso Overall, the zzso model system provides a useful platform for the study of tumor cell responses to growth factors and for screening of zzso drugs targeting these zzso
