zzso is highly resistant to chemotherapy, and the mortality rate is increasing rapidly zzso zzso signaling has been implicated in the zzso of melanoma and zzso activated zzso has been validated can as a target for melanoma zzso zzso a zzso dietary zzso with low zzso has been shown to exert zzso zzso However, the zzso mechanisms of zzso are not fully zzso In this study, we sought to test the involvement of zzso signaling in the zzso effects of zzso on melanoma cell growth, migration and zzso Our results showed that exposure to zzso resulted in zzso of proliferation of melanoma cells, induction of cell zzso and suppression of migratory and invasive zzso zzso study indicated that zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso signaling by interfering with zzso zzso and reducing zzso nuclear zzso This inhibited zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso targeted genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are involved in cell growth, migration and zzso zzso zzso of zzso active zzso partially rescued the growth zzso effects induced by zzso Furthermore, zzso suppressed zzso tumor growth and zzso activities in zzso mice model, and inhibited zzso zzso cells lung zzso in an animal zzso Overall, these results indicate that the zzso activity of zzso is at least partially due to zzso of zzso signaling in melanoma zzso Our findings provided new insight into the action of zzso zzso zzso the zzso signaling pathway, suggesting it has a potential role in the prevention and treatment of zzso
