New efforts are being focused on zzso pathways as targets for cancer zzso This particular study was designed to investigate whether blockade of the zzso zzso zzso zzso (a zzso pathway, zzso in various zzso could zzso human breast cancer cells to the effect of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso were used individually or in combination on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso human breast cancer cell lines, and on zzso a zzso human breast zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso Each drug showed zzso and zzso growth zzso of cell proliferation on all 4 cell zzso The combination of zzso resulted in enhanced cell growth zzso in zzso and zzso cells, and additive zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Cell cycle analysis showed that zzso enhanced the arrest of zzso and zzso cells in zzso with the appearance of a zzso peak indicating zzso a notion supported by enhanced zzso of zzso membrane potential in these cell zzso The combination also caused a greater additive increase in zzso zzso Thus, the synergistic effect of the combination on cell proliferation in some, but not all, breast cancer cells may be through enhanced induction of both zzso arrest and zzso in which zzso may play a zzso zzso lower doses of zzso could be used with low doses of zzso of the zzso pathway, without compromising the zzso effect, but also lowering zzso zzso of zzso This study supports the notion that survival zzso pathways offer special targets for chemotherapy in zzso
