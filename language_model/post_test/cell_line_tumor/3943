The poor zzso zzso and low zzso of zzso restrict its clinical application for cancer zzso In this study, a novel zzso zzso carrier was developed to improve the zzso and zzso ability of zzso using a zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were zzso by transmission electron zzso The zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied in zzso and in zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso as the zzso zzso was zzso into the zzso zzso which had a diameter of approximately zzso zzso zzso showed zzso behavior from the zzso in zzso zzso showed much higher cellular zzso in zzso zzso zzso liver zzso cells than did zzso zzso thereby leading to significantly higher zzso zzso zzso studies further demonstrated that zzso could accumulate markedly in mouse tumors after administration of zzso via the tail zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso are a promising zzso drug delivery system for targeted treatment of zzso
