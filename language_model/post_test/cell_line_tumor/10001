zzso zzso is one of the key strategies for the improvement of survival in pancreatic zzso however, no method to predict the response has yet been zzso The aim of this study was to zzso evaluate the zzso value of zzso a new member of the zzso zzso zzso family of zzso 

zzso zzso cells were established from a pancreatic cancer cell line and exposed in zzso to zzso or zzso to investigate the relevance of zzso to the resistance to chemotherapy or zzso In 23 patients with zzso pancreatic cancer, the serum concentration of zzso was measured before zzso zzso and the zzso response was evaluated after the zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activated cell scanning zzso revealed that zzso cells were resistant to zzso but showed a modest resistance to zzso The patients with a higher zzso level, but not zzso zzso or zzso showed an zzso zzso response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The patients showing a higher zzso level experienced local recurrence zzso 

These data demonstrated in zzso and in zzso that zzso protein zzso was associated with an zzso response to zzso zzso zzso can clinically be used as a zzso zzso
