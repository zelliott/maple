Although they have several important limitations primary human zzso still represent the in zzso gold standard model for zzso metabolism and toxicity zzso The large use of human liver cell lines either from zzso origin or obtained by zzso zzso is prevented by the loss of various zzso functions, especially many zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We review here recent results obtained with a new human zzso cell line, named zzso derived from a human zzso zzso These cells exhibit unique features: when seeded at low density they acquire an zzso zzso zzso actively divided and after having reached zzso formed typical zzso colonies surrounded by zzso zzso zzso zzso contrary to other human zzso cell lines including zzso cells, zzso cells express various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the nuclear receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso X zzso zzso at levels comparable to those found in cultured primary human zzso They also express various other functions such phase 2 zzso zzso and zzso ABC zzso and zzso zzso carrier zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso B that is a specific marker of adult zzso zzso cells could represent a surrogate to primary human zzso for zzso metabolism and toxicity studies and even more, a unique model system for zzso zzso zzso
