zzso in solid tumors is associated with the development of zzso Although many studies have focused on the effect of zzso on drug-induced zzso the effect of zzso pathways on zzso drug resistance has not been previously zzso Here, we determined the effects of zzso on multiple forms of drug-induced death in human zzso breast zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso to zzso leads to resistance to various classes of zzso agents, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed a high degree of zzso in nuclear and zzso zzso in response to acute drug exposure; however, the majority of exposed cells displayed zzso and zzso changes consistent with drug-induced zzso zzso decreased only the proportion of cells in the zzso population, whereas the small proportion of cells exhibiting features of zzso or zzso catastrophe were zzso Similar results were obtained with human zzso colon zzso cells, indicating that the protective effect of zzso on drug-induced zzso is not unique to zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with small interfering zzso targeting the zzso of zzso zzso zzso a key regulator of cellular adaptations to zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso small interfering zzso also selectively abolished the zzso changes in the zzso population, indicating that the increased survival was due to protection against drug-induced zzso These results support a requirement for zzso in the adaptations leading to drug resistance and reveal that decreased drug-induced zzso is also an important contributor to the development of zzso zzso
