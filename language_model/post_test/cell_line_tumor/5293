Little is known about the regulation of zzso synthesis zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso the initial zzso zzso The current view is that zzso associates with zzso zzso strictly via zzso interactions in response to an increase of zzso zzso In opposition to this accepted mechanism of two decades, zzso zzso zzso has been shown to increase the membrane association of zzso in zzso via a novel site in the zzso zzso of the C2 domain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study we demonstrate that zzso is a zzso and required zzso zzso for the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso in response to inflammatory zzso zzso calcium zzso and zzso zzso the absolute requirement of the zzso interaction was demonstrated for the production of zzso using zzso embryonic zzso zzso coupled to zzso zzso zzso this study provides a paradigm shift in how zzso is activated during zzso
