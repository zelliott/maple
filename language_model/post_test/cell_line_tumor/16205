Small zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso that regulate target protein activity in diverse zzso The most common group of zzso zzso is zzso factors, whose zzso activity can be altered positively or zzso as a result of zzso zzso is a zzso zzso factor involved in zzso development, in the differentiation of structures involving zzso zzso such as hair, teeth and zzso and in bone zzso We identified two potential zzso sites in the zzso domain of zzso at positions zzso and zzso Among the six members of the zzso family, zzso is the only member containing these sites, which are highly zzso among zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso can be zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso 83 and 112 to zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated that only zzso is involved in zzso zzso analysis determined that zzso does not affect zzso zzso to the nucleus and favors zzso zzso Moreover, using zzso mobility shift zzso zzso we found that zzso is still able to bind DNA when zzso Using zzso reporter zzso we showed that zzso exhibits a significantly lower zzso activity compared to zzso suggesting that zzso has a positive effect on zzso zzso We identified a new level of regulation in the activity of zzso that may play a crucial role in the regulation of hair, teeth, and bone zzso
