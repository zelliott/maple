To prepare zzso protein 17 zzso zzso zzso zzso and make foundation for target diagnosis of zzso cancer by magnetic resonance zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso were prepared by zzso zzso zzso on the surface of zzso magnetic zzso zzso using the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso and properties of the zzso were characterized by transmission electronic zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso was evaluated by zzso gel zzso the zzso activity of zzso was evaluated by zzso linked zzso zzso zzso A set of in zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso experiments were performed after incubated the zzso with human zzso gene zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso 

We had successfully grafted the zzso with zzso zzso and the zzso kept good zzso The zzso showed that the zzso were targeted successfully to the positive cells, and no obviously zzso zzso was zzso 

The zzso zzso with good specificity can used for further study of zzso cancer target zzso
