To develop zzso incorporated into zzso zzso based on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for use as zzso zzso agents against zzso zzso zzso 

Two different types of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and zzso was loaded into these using a zzso evaporation zzso After zzso characterization of the resulting zzso four human zzso cancer cell lines were incubated with various zzso of zzso incorporated in zzso and the results were compared with those of zzso formulated in zzso zzso zzso In zzso nude mice with zzso zzso zzso were zzso instilled with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso 

zzso are zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso and incorporation of zzso did not affect their zzso The release profiles of zzso from zzso were characterized by a zzso phase followed by a slower zzso zzso While the zzso zzso released only approximately zzso of the initially incorporated zzso up to zzso was released from zzso Moreover, only zzso was stable in zzso zzso In zzso all zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso cancer proliferation although zzso was slightly less zzso than standard zzso By contrast, in zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso was significantly more effective in reducing zzso zzso growth than zzso and was well zzso 

zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso of zzso might be a promising approach for zzso therapy of patients with zzso zzso zzso
