Emerging studies have shown the potential benefit of arming zzso viruses with therapeutic zzso However, most of these therapeutic genes are placed under the regulation of ubiquitous viral zzso Our goal is to generate a safer yet potent zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso for cancer zzso 

Using bacterial artificial zzso zzso zzso a cell zzso zzso zzso cassette was replaced with the infected cell protein 6 zzso coding region zzso for zzso or large zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso were further tested for its zzso zzso gene zzso 

The ability of zzso to zzso zzso zzso expression was demonstrated by injecting similar amount of viruses into the zzso region of the brain and the zzso normal brain zzso of the same zzso The results showed enhanced levels of zzso activities in the zzso region but not in the normal brain zzso Similar findings were observed in zzso short-term human brain zzso zzso cells compared with normal human zzso zzso injection of zzso viruses resulted in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso in human zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso viruses zzso zzso selectivity in zzso cells and may be developed further as a feasible approach to treat human zzso
