zzso is a zzso zzso that mediates zzso control of pathways linked to both cancer and stem zzso In this study, we show that zzso is required for both tumor growth and maintenance of tumor zzso in zzso and uncover a common role for zzso in controlling cancer and stem cell zzso Acute zzso loss in zzso strongly inhibited tumor growth and promoted zzso zzso profiling identified a set of embryonic stem zzso genes that are activated by zzso in zzso zzso with this, we found that zzso expression correlated to the embryonic stem cell zzso state and loss of zzso caused embryonic stem cells to zzso This effect was, at least zzso zzso by the ability of zzso to regulate zzso protein and downstream zzso target gene zzso Similar regulation of zzso target genes by zzso was observed in colon tumor cells, and increased expression of a zzso embryonic stem cell zzso target gene signature was associated with loss of differentiation and poor outcome in primary human colon zzso Together, these observations reveal that zzso acts, at least in part, through zzso to maintain both tumors and embryonic stem cells in an zzso zzso This raises the intriguing possibility that targeting zzso zzso may specifically inhibit the zzso properties of cancer zzso
