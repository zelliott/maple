To our knowledge, there are no data on hormonal regulation of zzso in zzso zzso We report the presence and zzso of expression of three zzso in zzso of zzso monkeys zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso obtained from zzso control and zzso zzso animals, respectively, were compared for zzso expressed proteins by two-dimensional zzso Mass zzso analysis zzso two such proteins as zzso and protein zzso zzso known to be molecular zzso in zzso zzso We then investigated if zzso another zzso is also zzso zzso zzso of these zzso was also investigated in the zzso during pregnancy in zzso zzso zzso were zzso by zzso and western zzso zzso in human zzso and zzso transcript levels in zzso cell line were assessed by real time zzso 

zzso analysis of the zzso region of zzso zzso in monkeys revealed higher expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso but no change in zzso in zzso or zzso compared with receptive zzso zzso level of all three zzso in the zzso region of zzso zzso was higher in pregnant than zzso animals zzso zzso zzso Human zzso zzso protein was higher in the zzso zzso phase than zzso zzso phase of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso with a trend towards zzso by zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso zzso are regulated by hormones and embryonic stimuli in a zzso specific zzso These novel data open up new lines of investigation for zzso the mechanisms by which hormones or embryonic stimuli influence the zzso physiology of zzso
