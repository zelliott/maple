Emerging evidence suggests that zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso cancer zzso might evade the zzso function of the dependence zzso zzso by directly zzso the zzso zzso Identification of the molecular zzso of the interplay between zzso signaling and zzso might provide a relevant contribution to the zzso of zzso zzso Here, we describe the zzso between zzso zzso zzso responsible for type zzso multiple zzso syndrome zzso and components of death zzso zzso zzso zzso In the human zzso zzso cell line zzso expressing zzso zzso was found associated with zzso known as inhibitor of the zzso death zzso trafficking to the cell zzso and with zzso the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Cell treatment with the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso likely inducing its local zzso followed by zzso of both zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso into zzso zzso According to the resulting increase of zzso cell surface zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso cell growth zzso and zzso zzso zzso interference zzso zzso protein in zzso cells, whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Overall, these data indicate that the zzso zzso exerts opposing controls on zzso and zzso increasing zzso expression and decreasing zzso cell surface zzso The functional interplay of the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso provides a mechanism possibly contributing to zzso zzso zzso and a rational basis for novel therapeutic strategies combining zzso zzso and zzso zzso
