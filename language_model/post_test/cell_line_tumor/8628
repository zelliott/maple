zzso system zzso are listed among the ten top causes of zzso death zzso Cancer stem cells zzso are zzso cells that share some of their characteristics with normal stem cells, including zzso and zzso and also cancer cells, such as drug resistance and zzso Despite many reports on zzso with zzso system origin, identification and characterization of zzso zzso have remained zzso To examine the zzso of routine zzso cancer cell and zzso markers in zzso cells, derived from zzso zzso cells were first characterized by zzso and zzso techniques, and then the significance of candidate zzso was evaluated in zzso zzso cells by flow zzso and/or real-time zzso Meanwhile, to study zzso (a newly introduced zzso zzso expression in zzso tract zzso human normal and zzso zzso of zzso stomach, and colon were analyzed by zzso Using several experimental approaches, we show that zzso but not zzso could serve as a reliable marker for zzso zzso zzso cells of zzso In conclusion, our study confirms the role of zzso as a zzso marker in zzso cells, an zzso zzso cell zzso cell line, and for the first time indicates the expression of zzso in zzso zzso cancer zzso Although the importance of zzso was not indicated in diagnosis of zzso zzso further studies are needed to better understand the biological identity and function of this zzso in zzso zzso
