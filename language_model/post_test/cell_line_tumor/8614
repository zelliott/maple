DNA zzso has been extensively explored to assemble various functional zzso for versatile zzso zzso by zzso zzso these DNA zzso have been conventionally assembled through zzso of many short DNA building zzso Here we report the zzso zzso of zzso DNA zzso termed as zzso zzso and the versatile biomedical zzso These zzso were assembled from long DNA building blocks generated via rolling circle replication zzso of a designer zzso zzso assembly was driven by liquid zzso and dense packaging of building blocks, without relying on zzso zzso between DNA zzso thereby avoiding the otherwise conventional complicated DNA sequence zzso zzso sizes were readily zzso in a wide range, by simply adjusting such parameters as assembly time and template zzso zzso were exceptionally resistant to zzso degradation, zzso or zzso at extremely low zzso presumably resulting from the dense DNA packaging in zzso The exceptional zzso is critical for biomedical zzso By rational design, zzso can be readily incorporated with myriad functional zzso All these properties make zzso promising for versatile zzso As a zzso demonstration, in this study, zzso were integrated with zzso zzso agents, and drug loading sites, and the zzso zzso zzso were demonstrated for selective cancer cell recognition, zzso and targeted zzso drug zzso
