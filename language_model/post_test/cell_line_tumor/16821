To validate those obtained zzso membrane zzso candidate of human pancreatic cancer in the performed zzso 

In the zzso serum zzso zzso from clinically collected zzso of pancreatic cancer patients underwent zzso with human pancreatic cancer cell line zzso membrane zzso totally obtained 9 positive protein zzso Number 5 and 6 positive dots of zzso were identified by zzso laser zzso of flight mass zzso and zzso mass zzso zzso The candidate membrane zzso were further validated in cell lines by zzso and real-time zzso zzso of human normal pancreatic tissue and pancreatic cancer tissue was extracted respectively, different gene expression level of zzso 2 was studied by real-time zzso 

Number 5 and 6 positive dots were identified as zzso 2 and zzso zzso and real-time zzso all showed that gene of zzso 2 and zzso were expressed in the human pancreatic cancer cell line zzso zzso and zzso respectively, especially in zzso cell with highest expression zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In addition, gene expression level of zzso 2 was significant higher in human pancreatic cancer than that of normal pancreatic tissue zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso 2 and zzso are both differently expressed in the pancreatic cancer cell line zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2 is obvious highly expressed in human pancreatic cancer zzso zzso 2 and zzso might be the candidate zzso membrane zzso of human pancreatic zzso
