zzso of zzso arms zzso and zzso are frequent in zzso zzso and linked to zzso and chemotherapy response as well as longer zzso The molecular mechanisms underlying this clinically important association are as yet zzso Here, we studied the zzso 1 zzso gene at zzso for promoter zzso and expression in primary zzso and investigated its role in zzso and zzso of zzso cells in zzso In total, we screened primary zzso zzso from 93 patients for zzso of the zzso island of zzso by sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein expression levels were determined in zzso of the zzso by quantitative zzso and western zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso and reduced expression were frequently detected in zzso zzso and secondary zzso but not in primary zzso In zzso zzso both zzso zzso and reduced zzso expression were significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso significantly increased zzso and reduced cell viability of zzso zzso cells exposed to zzso zzso or zzso in zzso Taken together, our findings indicate that zzso zzso of zzso is frequent in zzso zzso zzso and likely contributes to zzso and zzso of these zzso
