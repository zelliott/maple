To study the changes in the intensity and zzso pattern of target gene expression in the tumor tissue of nude mice bearing human zzso zzso zzso following injection of zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso human zzso cell line zzso was zzso zzso in nude zzso After the tumor mass reached 3 zzso in diameter, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or their balanced mixture was injected zzso At 5 and 10 days after the injection, the tumor zzso were harvested for zzso zzso of zzso and the ratio of the zzso cells and the intensity of zzso expression was zzso 

zzso for zzso showed that 5 days after the injection, zzso expression was detected zzso zzso zzso in the tumor tissue in zzso group, and the peak expression levels was seen in zzso group zzso the expression level was comparable between the combination group zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso At 10 days, zzso expression was considerably lowered to zzso zzso zzso in zzso group but increased to zzso in zzso zzso The expression in the combination group maintained a high level at 10 days zzso which was significantly higher than that in zzso group zzso 

zzso with zzso combined with zzso allows instant, sustained and significantly enhanced expression of the target gene in the tumor zzso This approach takes advantages of the two viruses and can be ideal for zzso gene delivery into the tumor zzso
