zzso expressed zzso zzso is frequently associated with a variety of zzso including pancreatic zzso zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the expression and possible role of zzso in zzso Data obtained by locked zzso acid in zzso zzso and real-time quantitative zzso chain reaction showed that zzso was zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso and in all tested zzso cell lines when compared with the corresponding normal pancreatic zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells inhibited tumor cell growth and zzso colony formation and zzso decreased tumor cell growth in nude mouse zzso in zzso Using in zzso predictions, zzso was defined as a potential direct target of zzso Data from the zzso reporter gene zzso showed that zzso was a direct target of zzso zzso of zzso could decrease zzso protein levels and reduce the zzso zzso of downstream zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso cells could increase cell zzso colony formation and zzso protein zzso Furthermore, zzso expression was observed to be zzso correlated with zzso protein expression in zzso cell zzso We conclude that the frequently zzso zzso can regulate zzso and function as a tumor zzso in zzso zzso zzso may serve as a useful therapeutic agent for zzso zzso zzso
