The b zzso of zzso growth factor zzso 2, zzso a zzso zzso zzso is expressed in a wide variety of zzso and is zzso in several human zzso including zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso has been shown to inhibit growth in zzso cell lines derived from these zzso Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso of human zzso zzso cell growth following zzso zzso Using a nylon DNA zzso we zzso the gene expression profile of the zzso zzso zzso cell line, zzso or not with a construct zzso zzso The expression of zzso in zzso cells decreased zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso This decrease was correlated with a decrease in zzso zzso and may have been responsible for the observed zzso of cell growth because the addition of zzso zzso restored growth rates to normal zzso Using zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso activity, and a zzso dead zzso of the zzso zzso zzso we also demonstrated that the growth zzso and decrease in zzso zzso induced by zzso did not require zzso zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrated the involvement of the zzso zzso domain of the zzso in decreasing zzso expression and zzso zzso cell growth, as zzso a zzso of zzso carrying a short zzso neither zzso zzso nor inhibited cell zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso the growth of zzso zzso cells by reducing zzso levels via its zzso domain, independent of its zzso zzso zzso
