zzso of zzso plays a crucial role in the response of tumors to zzso Thus, we investigated the zzso and tumor zzso zzso of a death zzso 5 zzso zzso when combined with zzso For our zzso we applied an imaging method that allows monitoring of zzso zzso in living zzso A zzso zzso zzso reporter based on split zzso technology zzso to screen various zzso and zzso on their ability to induce zzso in zzso cells in zzso as well as in zzso We found that zzso zzso treatment in zzso led to significant zzso induction within 48 hours and to a zzso increased zzso binding to the cell zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso zzso treatment altered zzso binding only zzso zzso of zzso by treatment with zzso was zzso and zzso (both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in tumor tissue and zzso revealed zzso zzso induction immediately after the compound had reached tumor zzso Regarding combination therapy of zzso and zzso we found that the sequential application of zzso before zzso resulted in zzso enhanced zzso reporter zzso In striking contrast, zzso given before zzso did not lead to increased zzso zzso We suggest that zzso recruitment of zzso to the cell surface impacts the enhanced zzso effect that can be zzso monitored by zzso zzso This study demonstrates that the combination of zzso and zzso imaging is an excellent method for zzso dosing and treatment schedules in zzso cancer zzso
