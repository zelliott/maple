The purpose of the present study was to determine whether exposure of pancreatic zzso to zzso conditions changes fatty acid zzso cluster zzso 36 zzso and examine the role of zzso on the induction of zzso We measured the changes of zzso and insulin zzso in high zzso (30 zzso exposed zzso cells and zzso suppressed zzso cells by zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso level of zzso cells increased in the high zzso media compared to normal zzso zzso zzso The zzso levels of insulin and zzso as well as zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso were decreased in zzso cells exposed to high zzso media compared to normal zzso media, while zzso and zzso zzso were significantly elevated with exposure to high zzso media for zzso The zzso of zzso reversed the decreased zzso and zzso zzso level in zzso zzso These results suggest that high zzso may exacerbate zzso via increasing fatty acid influx by zzso of zzso zzso and that zzso may be a possible target zzso for preventing zzso in pancreatic zzso
