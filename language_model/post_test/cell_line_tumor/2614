Combined vaccines containing zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso cells fixed with zzso zzso saline were injected into the zzso tissue of the tail base of zzso zzso After the zzso zzso cells were injected zzso into the left flank of the zzso zzso with fixed zzso cells induced the development of relatively high amounts of zzso cells after in zzso zzso with vascular zzso growth zzso 2 zzso zzso growth was inhibited after preventive use of the combined zzso prepared from zzso and zzso zzso zzso specimens obtained from the combined vaccine group in a therapeutic experiment showed significantly decreased vessel zzso zzso zzso with a combined vaccine prepared from tumor cells and zzso cells might represent a new clinical strategy, as such combinations may theoretically affect both high-grade zzso cells and their zzso
