The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of vitamin C towards zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso and leukemia zzso cell lines using flow zzso analysis and the terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso end zzso zzso zzso None of the vitamin C zzso tested zzso zzso caused zzso in zzso zzso However, there were significant losses of zzso cells zzso measured by zzso zzso 72 h after treatment with 50 and 100 zzso vitamin C (29 and zzso zzso Moreover, an increase of zzso zzso release was significant with 50 zzso at 72 h zzso and with 100 zzso of vitamin C at 48 and 72 h (27 and zzso zzso Also, the percentage of zzso zzso cells found in zzso zzso increased to zzso when they were treated with 100 zzso vitamin C for 72 zzso Thus, in subsequent simultaneous treatments with zzso (30 and 50 zzso or zzso (27 and 68 zzso and vitamin C, zzso of zzso zzso vitamin C were zzso Our results revealed that vitamin C, at all zzso and times tested, reduced the zzso induced by zzso and zzso in both cell lines, showing a similar effect in zzso and zzso cells towards zzso zzso zzso and zzso of reduction, zzso towards zzso (27 zzso the zzso was higher in zzso than in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso our findings suggest that zzso of zzso may be one of the mechanisms by which vitamin C exerts its protective zzso
