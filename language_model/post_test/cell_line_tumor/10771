zzso 3 zzso is a highly zzso inner nuclear zzso protein with two zinc finger zzso and two zzso recognition motifs zzso whose function is largely zzso Recently we found zzso to be zzso by the protein zzso zzso which activates the cellular response to double strand breaks in the zzso Here, we show that zzso interacts in an zzso manner with several proteins with established roles in zzso processing, and maintains its interaction with zzso via its zzso zzso Deep sequencing of the bound zzso zzso identified several small zzso zzso zzso Using zzso analysis to explore zzso role in transcription, we identified 77 transcripts whose amounts depended on the presence of zzso We validated this finding with nine transcripts which were also bound to the zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrated the importance of zzso for maintaining the stability of several of these zzso species and conclude that it has a role in zzso zzso The data suggest that the cellular level of zzso known to be highly zzso zzso the stability of a group of gene zzso
