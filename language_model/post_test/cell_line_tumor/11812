zzso positioning of the zzso zzso is critical to ensure proper distribution of zzso during cell zzso The small zzso zzso which regulates a variety of processes throughout the cell cycle, including zzso zzso transport and zzso zzso zzso was recently shown to also control zzso zzso Ran is required for the correct cortical zzso of zzso and zzso apparatus protein zzso proteins that generate pulling forces on astral zzso zzso through zzso zzso Here we use zzso a zzso inhibitor of zzso function, to study the role of Ran in zzso positioning in human zzso We find that zzso treatment results in defects in astral zzso zzso as well as in zzso of zzso and zzso leading to zzso zzso Of interest, zzso zzso defects can be rescued by zzso treatment, which zzso astral zzso or by zzso of zzso which does not restore proper zzso and zzso zzso but zzso astral zzso interactions with the zzso Together our data suggest a model for zzso zzso positioning in which zzso and zzso cooperate to align the zzso along the long axis of the dividing zzso
