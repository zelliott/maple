zzso zzso is still a poorly understood zzso The zzso step within the zzso cascade is not yet clear although it may be estimated that the zzso of circulating tumor cells is a step of crucial importance, as most tumor cells that are shed into circulation undergo zzso The process of zzso includes a cascade of consecutive steps, starting with zzso of tumor cells circulating in the zzso to zzso cells, mimicking zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso zzso interaction occurs when zzso adhere to zzso cells under conditions of zzso zzso As there are parallels between cancer cell zzso interactions with zzso zzso cell systems an experimental setup has been developed in which zzso of small cell lung zzso adhesive properties can be analyzed under zzso zzso stress conditions during their attachment to zzso and zzso
