zzso zzso from three zzso zzso lines zzso zzso and zzso were zzso with zzso zzso and separated by zzso gel zzso zzso were zzso from gel slices and zzso for zzso by a zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells also contained zzso zzso zzso molecules as judged by a zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 71, or zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso were selective for T cells since they failed to inhibit binding of natural killer zzso cells to zzso targets, zzso in the zzso experiment, the zzso target zzso inhibited zzso cells but not zzso T cell binding to intact zzso Cross zzso tests in the zzso system revealed that the zzso molecules maintained their specific zzso zzso These observations suggest that it will be possible to characterize further those parts of the zzso zzso preparations reacting with distinct killer zzso zzso
