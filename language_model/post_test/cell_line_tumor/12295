To investigate whether oxidized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso activity through zzso in zzso and the effect of zzso zzso on zzso foam cell zzso 

After exposing the cultured zzso cells to zzso in the presence or absence of different zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein levels were detected by Western zzso zzso activity was analyzed using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cholesterol zzso was assessed by Oil red O zzso and cholesterol zzso zzso zzso The zzso level of zzso target gene was determined by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso 

zzso evaluated zzso zzso status and subsequently decreased zzso gamma target gene expression in a zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly suppressed zzso zzso induced by zzso which in turn inhibited foam cell zzso 

In addition to its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma activity through zzso which is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso foam cell formation from zzso exposed to zzso
