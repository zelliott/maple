zzso structure and gene expression are both regulated by zzso zzso How environmental factors influence zzso nuclear import and the zzso assembly pathway, leading to changes in zzso organization and transcription, remains zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso which is abundant in the environment, especially in cigarette zzso It has recently been implicated as a potential major zzso of zzso lung zzso Here we show that zzso forms zzso with zzso proteins in zzso and in zzso and zzso zzso with free zzso rather than with zzso zzso Cellular zzso analyses reveal that zzso exposure specifically zzso zzso of zzso tails of zzso zzso zzso and zzso modifications that are important for nuclear import and zzso zzso zzso zzso exposure compromises the delivery of zzso zzso into zzso and increases zzso zzso Moreover, changes in zzso occupancy at several zzso zzso are correlated with zzso responses to zzso zzso Our data provide new insights into mechanisms zzso environmental factors interact with the zzso and influence zzso zzso
