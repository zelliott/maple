zzso zzso zzso which is primarily used for vaccine purposes, is a method for producing zzso to a protein by delivering the gene zzso the protein as a zzso expression zzso instead of the protein zzso The zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso gene 1 zzso is one of the most likely candidates for involvement in zzso of zzso zzso and probably of multiple zzso In the present work we describe the production and characterization of a mouse zzso zzso zzso directed against zzso and the study of zzso protein expression in a large series of zzso and myeloma cell zzso The full-length coding sequence of human zzso was inserted into zzso zzso and delivered into mouse skin using a zzso gene zzso Six new zzso against the zzso zzso were zzso In order to characterize and confirm the specificity of these zzso Western zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses were zzso A new zzso zzso was selected and tested in a large series of cell zzso These results confirm that zzso is a reliable and effective alternative method for production of zzso allowing accurate and sensitive detection and screening of proteins by zzso
