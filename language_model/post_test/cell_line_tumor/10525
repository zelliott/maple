zzso plays numerous roles in the regulation of zzso integrity and zzso Although zzso interaction with key proteins involved in DNA repair is well known, its role as a zzso in the zzso response to DNA damage remains poorly zzso In this study, we show that zzso plays a central role in the zzso response to zzso stress in prostate zzso zzso expression mediates zzso zzso arrest, and decreased viability in response to zzso zzso zzso studies using human prostate zzso zzso cells show that zzso depletion results in increased tumor zzso A focused survey of zzso genes in prostate zzso reveals that multiple regulators of zzso stability and zzso control, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are direct zzso targets of zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso targets zzso promoter to increase its zzso in response to DNA zzso Finally, zzso depletion significantly abrogates zzso influence on zzso progression and cell death in response to zzso zzso These findings define a novel zzso zzso through which zzso zzso cell fate decisions in response to zzso zzso and suggest that zzso status should be considered for new zzso treatment strategies in prostate zzso
