zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso acid zzso constitute a novel class of zzso agents that cause an increase in zzso zzso and thus restore the expression of dormant zzso and other genes related to cell zzso zzso arrest or zzso of tumor zzso The Ras inhibitor zzso acid zzso zzso zzso cancer cell proliferation in zzso and in zzso and, under certain circumstances, zzso cell zzso zzso by itself does not induce differentiation or complete growth zzso The zzso activity of zzso as a differentiation agent suggested that it might be worth investigating its possible therapeutic potential in synergistic combination with zzso Here, we examined whether the combined application of zzso and zzso could zzso inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells that express zzso zzso zzso zzso lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or chronically active zzso zzso and zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results showed that combined treatment with zzso and zzso zzso reduces proliferation in all of these cancer cell lines by zzso Ras and blocking the expression of zzso and Aurora zzso These zzso which were most pronounced following the combined treatment, led to a zzso crisis, as reflected by zzso of the zzso passenger zzso Our findings thus demonstrate that combination therapy with zzso and zzso might offer a promising therapeutic approach to the treatment of zzso zzso
