zzso resistance zzso is one of the major obstacles to successful chemotherapy of human zzso Although many strategies have been explored to overcome zzso none of them have been proven to be clinically useful until zzso The aim of this study was to investigate whether a novel therapeutic ultrasound zzso approach would have useful effects on the reversal of zzso in cancer zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells of the human zzso cell line zzso were exposed to zzso zzso US at an intensity of zzso zzso for a zzso exposure zzso energy zzso zzso zzso After US exposure, cell number and viability were counted immediately, and flow zzso was performed to measure retention of zzso 123 and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Both cell lines were then incubated in suspension with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and the zzso zzso was used to determine zzso The results showed that US exposure could significantly increase the zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso tumor zzso The resistant index for the zzso drugs was significantly lower in the zzso zzso cells than in those not exposed to zzso It was therefore concluded that US exposure could enhance the sensitivity of zzso tumor cells to these zzso agents, and the functional and structural changes induced by previous US exposure in zzso tumor cells may be responsible for zzso However, further study is needed to investigate the mechanism behind zzso reversal of zzso
