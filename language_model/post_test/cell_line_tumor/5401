zzso tumor cells zzso a zzso membrane zzso zzso that can be used as a marker to select these cells from highly zzso clinical samples, even when found in low zzso zzso and zzso have been developed that specifically bind to zzso In this study, zzso zzso were immobilized onto the surface of a capture bed poised within a zzso zzso which was zzso into a zzso zzso unit zzso used for the selective isolation of rare circulating prostate tumor cells resident in a peripheral blood zzso The zzso capture bed consisted of 51 zzso ratio parallel zzso channels with a zzso similar to the prostate cancer cell zzso The surface density of the zzso zzso on an zzso zzso zzso capture bed surface was determined to be zzso zzso zzso zzso Using a linear zzso for optimal cell capture in the zzso zzso zzso zzso a recovery of zzso of zzso cells zzso cancer cell line; used as a model in this example) was zzso Due to the low abundance of these cells, the input volume required was 1 zzso and this could be processed in approximately 29 zzso using an zzso linear flow rate of zzso zzso zzso cells were subsequently released intact from the affinity surface using zzso zzso zzso followed by counting individual cells using a contact zzso sensor integrated into the zzso that provided high detection and sampling efficiency zzso zzso and did not require zzso of the cells for zzso
