zzso is frequently found to invade local zzso and zzso to zzso zzso We investigated the expression of zzso in zzso samples and its zzso zzso In addition, the cellular function of zzso was studied in the zzso zzso cell zzso High zzso expression significantly correlated with zzso zzso zzso and positive surgical margins in zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses further demonstrated that zzso expression was significantly associated with the overall survival of these patients zzso and zzso zzso For in zzso studies, the zzso cell sorting zzso system was used to isolate zzso and zzso cell populations from zzso zzso zzso zzso cells had increased zzso zzso zzso zzso ( zzso migration ( zzso and invasion ( zzso capabilities when compared to zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was significantly elevated in zzso zzso cells zzso We found that zzso of zzso using zzso zzso significantly decreased the invasive capacity of zzso zzso Both clinical and in zzso studies suggest that expression of zzso is associated with zzso disease zzso zzso may thus serve as a new target for directed molecular therapy of zzso
