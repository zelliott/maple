zzso zzso are a family of proteins zzso zzso filaments that maintain zzso organization and cell zzso Recently, it has also become clear that zzso can function in the zzso In this report, we found that zzso (full zzso and its spliced zzso zzso zzso possess an unusual zzso nuclear zzso interacting zzso Both zzso (full zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and directly interact with zzso zzso zzso although zzso zzso binds zzso more zzso We have also found that both zzso (full zzso and zzso zzso interact with the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso interacts efficiently with zzso zzso such as zzso factor zzso and steroid zzso zzso 1 zzso the full length zzso protein either does not or does so zzso More importantly, the zzso sequences of the zzso motif are important not only for interacting with nuclear receptors but also for the association with zzso Taken together, we have identified a novel extended zzso motif that is critical for interactions with both receptors and zzso This motif functions more efficiently in a spliced zzso of zzso than it does in the full-length zzso
