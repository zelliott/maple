zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso on a single zzso zzso in response to growth factors, zzso zzso and zzso activates its zzso zzso to the nucleus, binding to the zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso site and zzso of zzso of target zzso zzso is zzso zzso in various zzso and drives gene expression from zzso promoters to promote zzso Recently, roles for zzso zzso zzso have been described in response to zzso zzso in zzso and in maintenance of zzso zzso However, the mechanisms underlying zzso binding to DNA has not been fully zzso Here, we explore zzso interactions by atomic force zzso zzso zzso We observed that zzso molecules bind to the zzso zzso site as zzso and zzso In addition, we observed that zzso binds to zzso DNA sequence sites and recognizes specific DNA structures, such as zzso junctions and DNA zzso within zzso zzso zzso zzso These structures are important for zzso organization and our data suggest a role for zzso as a zzso zzso zzso we found that a zzso truncated zzso zzso zzso recognizes zzso zzso within zzso structures that also have a role in zzso organization and gene zzso This zzso appears to be abundant in the zzso of cancer cells and, therefore, may have a role in regulation of gene zzso Taken together, our data highlight novel mechanisms by which zzso binds to DNA and supports zzso function as a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso
