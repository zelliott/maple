Given their relative simplicity of manufacture and ability to be injected zzso vaccines in a protein format are attractive for breast and other zzso However, soluble human zzso growth factor zzso zzso protein as a vaccine has not been zzso When protein is directly targeted to zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso efficient processing and presentation of zzso take zzso The aim of this study was to determine the zzso of a zzso protein vaccine that directly targets to zzso zzso cells zzso in a mouse breast cancer zzso 

We genetically engineered the zzso zzso domain into a zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso Mice of various genetic backgrounds were zzso with zzso in combination with DC maturation stimuli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T cell immunity was determined by analyzing the ability of zzso T cell to produce zzso zzso and zzso upon zzso zzso zzso were assessed for the presence of zzso specific zzso zzso For vaccine zzso zzso mice were zzso with zzso in combination with zzso zzso and protection against zzso zzso tumors was zzso Protection mechanisms and zzso T cell responses were also zzso 

We demonstrate that zzso fusion zzso but not zzso zzso elicits strong, broad and zzso zzso T cell zzso zzso T cell responses, and zzso immunity specific for zzso zzso zzso to rat zzso protein was also zzso zzso mice zzso with zzso were protected from a zzso zzso tumor zzso Both zzso and zzso T cells zzso the tumor zzso zzso zzso T cell immunity was detected in tumor protected zzso 

zzso of mice with zzso protein vaccine targeting zzso zzso in zzso induced high levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was poorly zzso for zzso and zzso T zzso This vaccination approach provided long-term survival benefit for mice challenged with zzso tumor following as little as zzso zzso of zzso protein incorporated in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso T cells were both essential for tumor zzso This zzso strategy demonstrates great potential towards the development of vaccines for breast cancer zzso
