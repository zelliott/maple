zzso in combination with radiation therapy is used to treat patients with head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso In the present study, the mechanism of acquired resistance to zzso in zzso cells was investigated in zzso 

The zzso cell lines zzso and zzso and zzso cells with acquired resistance to zzso zzso were zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were tested using a zzso survival zzso Western zzso was used to evaluate protein zzso The levels of zzso zzso were detected by zzso 

zzso inhibited proliferation and induced zzso in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso In comparison with zzso cells, zzso zzso cells markedly zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso as detected by Western zzso Resistance in zzso cells was associated with the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso proteins as well as an increase in the zzso production of the zzso zzso zzso and transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso cells were significantly more zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were not zzso by zzso but knocking down zzso and zzso with zzso and targeting Ras zzso using the zzso inhibitor zzso induced zzso in these zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed that the zzso of the zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso is associated with zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso Ras and zzso activity improves the outcome of zzso in zzso zzso cell lines in zzso
