zzso has a wide range of biological actions that suggest it may be of use in cancer zzso It was previously reported that zzso induced cell cycle arrest, not only at the zzso but also at the zzso in a zzso zzso However, the mechanism of zzso zzso arrest in leukemia cells is not fully zzso In the present study, the effects of the naturally occurring zzso (the major constituent of zzso zzso on the cell cycle, as well as on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressions, were investigated in the human zzso leukemia zzso cells and in the zzso zzso leukemia zzso zzso The flow zzso zzso indicated that zzso induced zzso arrest in both examined cell zzso The zzso zzso arrest in both examined cell lines was accompanied by increased levels of zzso and zzso but decreased levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso expression was not affected as revealed by Western zzso zzso zzso induced zzso arrest in both the examined cells via the zzso of zzso B1 and the promotion of zzso
