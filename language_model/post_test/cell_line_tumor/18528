zzso zzso are considered to be good gene delivery zzso for cancer gene therapy due to their wide host tissue range and cell zzso zzso However, the disadvantages include the lack of specificity for cancer cells and the high liver zzso in zzso The human zzso gene is expressed at high levels in many types of zzso but is zzso in the zzso We explored the zzso promoter as a candidate to restrict zzso zzso expression to tumor cells with a low expression in host zzso The zzso activities in multiple cancer cell lines infected with zzso zzso zzso or the control zzso zzso revealed that the zzso promoter exhibited relatively high zzso activity in a breast cancer cell line, zzso and two zzso cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared to that of the zzso promoter, respectively, and low zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in both normal cell lines zzso and zzso In addition, zzso had a low expression of zzso zzso compared to that of the zzso promoter in mouse liver in zzso The data also revealed that the zzso promoter was a stronger zzso promoter zzso than the zzso promoter in primary zzso obtained from two zzso The zzso promoter is shown to have a zzso and zzso status in zzso and in zzso and zzso may prove to be a good candidate zzso for cancer gene therapy approaches for melanoma and breast zzso
