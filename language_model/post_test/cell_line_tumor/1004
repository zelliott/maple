zzso is a zzso hormone that exerts zzso and zzso activities on some human zzso The zzso zzso acts as regulatory zzso of the DNA dependent protein zzso and its DNA binding activity mediates DNA double strands breaks repair that is crucial to maintain the genetic integrity of the zzso The zzso of the zzso regulates cell cycle progression and the activity of nuclear zzso factors involved in DNA replication and cell zzso zzso zzso behaves as a zzso for the growth zzso zzso zzso zzso we report that zzso treatment to a colon zzso cell line zzso zzso cell growth and, at same time, strongly zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and the levels of zzso in the nucleus by increasing its specific zzso zzso Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso controls cell cycle progression and DNA repair through a new zzso zzso that involves the regulation of zzso level and zzso the zzso activity in the zzso
