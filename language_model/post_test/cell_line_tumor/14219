zzso expression is lost or markedly zzso in the majority of zzso zzso The mechanism by which zzso is zzso in zzso zzso is still not zzso Our previous reports indicated that zzso promoter activity was reduced in zzso cancer cells, due in part to the effects of negative regulatory zzso zzso 

We now show that zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso bind to the zzso promoter and repress its activity in zzso cancer zzso zzso with this zzso zzso zzso of cell lines and of 364 samples of zzso cancer tissue show that the expression of zzso and zzso proteins is much higher in zzso cancer cells than in normal zzso zzso cells, and that increased expression of zzso was zzso correlated with zzso expression zzso zzso zzso zzso of the putative zzso binding site in the zzso promoter reversed this zzso effect and significantly increased zzso promoter zzso In addition to the effects of zzso regulation, zzso zzso also exhibited a significantly reduced zzso in zzso cancer cells when compared with that in normal zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso suggesting zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso contains zzso elements zzso in the zzso zzso We have found that these zzso interact with zzso an zzso protein that zzso bound zzso possibly contributing to the rapid turnover of zzso zzso Finally, reduced zzso ARE binding activity was observed in zzso cancer cells when compared with normal zzso surface zzso 

Taken together, our data suggest that zzso expression is regulated at both the zzso and the zzso levels, contributing to the dramatic decrease in zzso expression in zzso zzso
