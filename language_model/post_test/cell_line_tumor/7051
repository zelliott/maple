zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso under investigation as an orally administered zzso We previously reported that the mismatch repair zzso proteins (both zzso and zzso impact on the extent zzso of zzso incorporation and subsequent in zzso zzso zzso in human tumor cell zzso In this study, we used oral zzso to assess in zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso human colon cancer zzso 

We tested whether oral zzso treatment (1 zzso for 14 zzso can result in differential zzso incorporation in tumor cell DNA and subsequent zzso after a short course zzso day for 4 zzso of zzso radiation therapy, by using zzso nude mice with an zzso pair of human colon cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A tumor regrowth zzso was used to assess zzso zzso toxicity was assessed by daily body weights and by percentage of zzso incorporation in normal bone zzso and zzso 

After a zzso zzso zzso treatment by gastric zzso significantly higher zzso incorporation was found in zzso zzso tumor zzso compared with zzso zzso tumor zzso Using a tumor regrowth zzso after the zzso drug treatment and a zzso radiation therapy course zzso zzso of zzso we found substantial zzso in both zzso and zzso tumor zzso However, the zzso enhancement ratio zzso was substantially higher in zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso at 2 zzso per zzso zzso at 4 zzso per zzso compared with zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso at 2 zzso per zzso zzso at 4 zzso per zzso No substantial systemic toxicity was found in the treatment zzso 

These results suggest that zzso zzso can be an effective in zzso approach to treat zzso zzso tumors as well as zzso zzso
