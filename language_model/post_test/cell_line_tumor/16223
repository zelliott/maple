zzso cancer is the most common zzso related cancer with increasing zzso during the past five zzso Current treatments for zzso cancer, such as surgery or radioactive zzso therapy, often require patients to be on lifelong zzso hormone replacement therapy and given the significant recurrence rates of zzso cancer, new preventive zzso are zzso The present study investigates the property of a natural dietary compound found in zzso vegetables, zzso zzso to target the zzso zzso of zzso cancer cells through a functional zzso zzso 

zzso cancer cell lines were treated with zzso and/or zzso and subjected to in zzso zzso migration and invasion zzso to investigate the zzso and zzso effects of zzso We observed that zzso zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso cell migration, zzso and invasion, which is also supported by zzso zzso zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso analyses provided direct evidence for this zzso zzso zzso of zzso enhanced zzso associated events by virtue of targeting essential zzso zzso namely zzso and zzso 

Our data reports for the first time that zzso displays zzso like activity by zzso zzso enhanced zzso cancer cell proliferation and in zzso zzso associated events, namely zzso migration and zzso Most significantly, zzso and zzso which are known to promote and enhance zzso were determined to be targets of zzso This zzso like property of zzso may lead to the development of a novel preventive and/or therapeutic dietary supplement for zzso cancer patients by targeting progression of the zzso
