zzso is a critical component of the inflammatory response associated with a number of zzso zzso zzso is an zzso growth factor that promotes the zzso of zzso cells and zzso the maturation of new blood zzso zzso expression is zzso in response to tumor necrosis zzso zzso To begin to zzso the underlying molecular mechanisms by which zzso gene expression is regulated during zzso we isolated zzso zzso of the zzso promoter that contain regulatory elements sufficient to mediate induction of the promoter in response to zzso zzso and zzso Surprisingly, sequence analysis of this promoter failed to reveal binding sites for zzso factors that are frequently associated with zzso inflammatory responses, such as zzso zzso zzso or zzso However, putative binding sites for zzso and zzso zzso factor family members were zzso Interestingly, among a panel of zzso factors tested in a transient zzso zzso only the zzso factor zzso was capable of zzso the zzso zzso zzso binds to specific zzso sites within the zzso promoter that are functionally important for zzso by zzso zzso and zzso are induced in zzso zzso in response to inflammatory zzso with zzso induction slightly preceding that of zzso zzso of a zzso zzso binding site leads to a marked reduction in zzso zzso by zzso zzso by inflammatory zzso and DNA binding to the zzso zzso zzso profiling of cells zzso zzso with an zzso expression zzso demonstrates that the zzso zzso gene is directly zzso by zzso Finally, zzso and zzso exhibit a similar and strong expression pattern in the zzso of patients with zzso zzso Our results support a novel paradigm for the zzso factor zzso as a zzso zzso of zzso in the setting of zzso
