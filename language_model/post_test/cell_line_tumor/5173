This study is aimed at the pharmacological exploitation of zzso zzso zzso to develop potent zzso zzso Considering the structural zzso between the zzso chain and the zzso zzso in determining the zzso activity, our structural zzso led to compound 5 zzso zzso which exhibited zzso higher potency than 1 in blocking the zzso of zzso zzso breast cancer cells to zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso versus 10 zzso Evidence indicates that the ability of compound 5 to block cell zzso and migration was attributable to its effect on zzso focal zzso and zzso zzso integrity by zzso the degradation of focal zzso zzso zzso between tumor cells and the zzso in the tumor zzso have been increasingly recognized as critical zzso of the zzso potential of tumor zzso zzso the ability of compound 5 to block such interactions provides a unique pharmacological tool to shed light onto mechanisms that govern cell zzso and tumor zzso
