The aim of the study was to observe the effect of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso of pancreatic zzso 

zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso were exposed to zzso zzso for 4 zzso Expressions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction and Western zzso Growth zzso rates and zzso rates of zzso cells under different zzso of chemotherapy agents zzso zzso and zzso were measured by zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso The migration of zzso cells was zzso using zzso cell culture zzso zzso transplantation of zzso cells in nude mice for 8 weeks was to assess progression and zzso of pancreatic zzso 

zzso of zzso was obviously zzso and at the same time, zzso and zzso expressions were markedly zzso in the experimental group zzso zzso zzso Higher zzso zzso zzso and 400 zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso caused a greater increase of zzso in the experimental group than in control zzso zzso zzso The number of migrated zzso cells in the experimental group was far less than in control zzso zzso zzso In zzso the tumor size and weight in the experimental group were significantly lower than those in control zzso zzso zzso 

Our data demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso expressions of zzso and zzso zzso enhancing zzso in human pancreatic cancer cells and restraining the progression and zzso of pancreatic zzso zzso zzso may play a very important role in zzso zzso and zzso of human pancreatic zzso zzso zzso in pancreatic cancer cells may offer an avenue for gene zzso
