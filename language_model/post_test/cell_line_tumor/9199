Heat shock protein 60 zzso and zzso are zzso zzso proteins and are responsible for the folding of newly imported proteins and 13 zzso zzso by zzso zzso The expressions of zzso and zzso are regulated simultaneously because these genes are localized head to head on zzso separated by a zzso promoter, which harbors heat shock element zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso In the present study, we show that the expressions of zzso and zzso in the brain after middle cerebral artery zzso zzso are induced zzso Interestingly, the expressions of zzso and zzso were further zzso by the administration of zzso zzso an inhibitor of the zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso which is known to reduce zzso damage in an animal model after zzso The results obtained in the present study suggest that zzso and zzso are induced in the zzso brain, yet are zzso by NO generated from 12 zzso after zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso by NO were confirmed in zzso wherein zzso and zzso expressions were increased by treatment of zzso and zzso gamma zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells and further zzso by zzso another zzso zzso zzso gene analysis combined with deletion and zzso studies showed that zzso binding site in the zzso promoter is responsible for zzso zzso zzso and for zzso by zzso Our results indicated that NO suppresses zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso brain by suppressing zzso binding to its recognition zzso
