zzso zzso involves the zzso of circulating tumor cells to vascular zzso of the secondary zzso We hypothesized that breast cancer cell zzso is zzso by interaction of zzso zzso with its zzso zzso expressed on breast cancer zzso At a zzso wall zzso rate, zzso breast cancer cells specifically zzso to zzso expressing human zzso vein zzso cells when tested in parallel plate flow chamber zzso zzso zzso with their zzso zzso activity, zzso cells expressed flow zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso which recognizes high efficiency zzso zzso typified by zzso zzso Multiple zzso zzso proteins expressed by zzso cells were revealed by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by Western zzso Mass zzso analysis of the 72 zzso zzso which exhibited the most prominent zzso zzso activity, corresponded to zzso binding protein zzso a zzso unidentified zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso and possessed zzso zzso activity when tested by Western zzso analysis using zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, demonstrating that zzso is a novel high efficiency zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso the expression of zzso from zzso cells by zzso markedly reduced their zzso to zzso expressing cells under zzso flow conditions, confirming the functional zzso zzso activity of zzso on intact zzso In addition to zzso cells, several other zzso zzso positive breast cancer cell lines expressed zzso as detected by Western zzso and flow zzso suggesting that zzso may be an zzso zzso in a variety of breast cancer zzso Further, invasive breast zzso tissue showed zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso the possible role of zzso as an zzso zzso In zzso breast cancer cells express zzso as a novel zzso zzso potentially revealing a new zzso and therapeutic target for breast zzso
