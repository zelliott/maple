zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso It has been shown that the zzso gene zzso alternative zzso within its zzso region zzso in a zzso manner, generating identical protein zzso The employment of two alternative zzso is thought to be responsible for zzso expression of the human zzso zzso In this study, we focused on the investigation of the nature of the zzso expression in human cell lines of neural and zzso zzso Our results show the expression of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso 3 in all cell lines zzso zzso of the full length zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso 3 was detected in all cell zzso The alternative zzso protein zzso zzso was detected in zzso and zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the human zzso gene zzso complex processing, leading to the formation of multiple zzso zzso The study of the significance of this phenomenon of multiple zzso zzso zzso could provide us with new information leading to the zzso of the complex biological pathways that the human zzso is involved zzso
