The association between obesity and cancer is zzso whereas several zzso clinical and research studies using cancer cell lines have supported that high levels of insulin and zzso could favor prostate cancer development and zzso other studies have demonstrated opposite effects or even absence of zzso The main goal of this study was to evaluate the in zzso proliferation of zzso zzso insensitive prostate zzso cells zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso After assessing and confirming the presence of zzso and insulin receptors in zzso cells by zzso cells were cultured in the presence of different zzso of zzso zzso 25, 50, 100 and zzso insulin zzso 50, 100, 150 and zzso or zzso plus insulin ( zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso plus insulin, zzso Cell proliferation was evaluated by assessing the percentage of zzso reduction, a surrogate marker of cell zzso zzso zzso significantly decreased the percentage of zzso reduction in all studied zzso while there was only a slight or non significant difference in zzso proliferation in the presence of insulin or insulin combined with zzso when compared with zzso These results show that zzso decreases zzso prostate cancer cell proliferation at the studied zzso while insulin is able to antagonize the zzso zzso of zzso prostate cancer cell growth in zzso The difference in cell growth that is modulated by the various hormonal environments may explain the zzso behavior of prostate cancer in the obese human zzso
