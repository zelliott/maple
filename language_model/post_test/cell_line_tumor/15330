To discuss the relationship between zzso effect of different concentration ethanol extracts from zzso prescription on the growth of zzso cells zzso and its zzso 

The drug was extracted with zzso ethanol, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ethanol or water, the cell proliferation zzso rate of different zzso extracts were detected with zzso zzso and zzso was zzso The components of the drug were determined by zzso Based on the zzso rate and the components peak area, the samples were hierarchy clustered zzso The correlation of components peak area and zzso rate was analyzed with zzso zzso The components peak area and zzso rate were analyzed using zzso 

The zzso of the 7 extracts on zzso zzso cell zzso were respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 22 stable zzso were determined by zzso Based on the zzso rate and the components peak area, the zzso results of the two samples were zzso The 10 zzso zzso were closely related to zzso rate zzso zzso zzso and the zzso between components zzso area and zzso rate was zzso 

zzso with different concentration ethanol have different effects, and their zzso effects are closely related to zzso
