The development of a zzso zzso zzso screening system could zzso discovery programs for identifying novel zzso In this study, the zzso of nitrate reduction zzso by zzso tuberculosis during growth in zzso zzso was found to be almost parallel to viable zzso zzso zzso in the culture medium containing 50 zzso of nitrate was found to be optimum on the fifth day after infection with zzso zzso The zzso zzso ratio and zzso obtained from this zzso zzso were zzso and zzso respectively, which confirms the zzso of the zzso zzso The protocol was further validated by using standard zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso added at their zzso value, on the day of zzso These zzso were not able to kill the zzso when added to the culture on the fifth day after zzso Interestingly, zzso and zzso killed the zzso immediately after addition on the fifth day of zzso Altogether, this zzso protocol using zzso zzso zzso zzso provides a novel, cost-efficient, zzso and zzso screening platform for the identification of both active and hypoxic zzso zzso against zzso
