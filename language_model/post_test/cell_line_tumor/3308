The tumor zzso zzso plays an essential role in regulating signaling pathways involved in cell growth and zzso and is zzso in a wide variety of zzso In this study, we have identified a zzso referred to as zzso zzso interacting with zzso zzso 1), that binds to the C zzso of zzso and regulates its zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells by zzso interference enhances the degradation of zzso with a zzso decrease in its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which are highly susceptible to protein degradation, have lost the ability to bind to zzso along with their reduced zzso suggesting that their rapid turnover results from impaired binding to zzso Our results identify zzso as a zzso protein that promotes the zzso and stability of zzso These findings suggest a novel molecular mechanism underlying the turnover of zzso which also provides an explanation for the loss of zzso function due to zzso zzso
