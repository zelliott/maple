zzso protein 2 zzso is a member of zzso protein family, which plays a crucial role in regulating gene zzso cell survival, and zzso Although its function in zzso appears to be tumor zzso its roles in zzso formation and development are yet to be zzso In the present study, we demonstrated that the zzso level of zzso was elevated in both low- and high-grade zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso growth, and migration of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by short hairpin zzso zzso inhibited zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso of zzso increased the zzso of zzso cells in nude mice and decreased the zzso levels of zzso and its downstream zzso zzso including zzso zzso protein X zzso and zzso zzso of zzso It also enhanced the promoter activities of zzso zzso zzso human zzso reverse zzso and zzso zzso Together, these results provide the first evidence that zzso contributes to zzso zzso
