Invasion and zzso are key features of human zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso that can degrade zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso chains of zzso zzso zzso thus playing important roles in the invasion and zzso of human zzso zzso has been detected in various human zzso and regarded as a prospective target in human cancer zzso However, the effects of zzso the expression of zzso on human zzso have not been fully zzso In this article we show that zzso the expression of zzso either by zzso zzso or by zzso zzso can significantly reduce the expression of zzso in zzso human zzso cells, leading to zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso cells both in zzso and in zzso Our results suggest that genetic zzso of the expression of zzso may serve as an efficient cancer therapeutic for human zzso
