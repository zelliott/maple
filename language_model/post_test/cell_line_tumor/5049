To zzso the response of acute zzso leukemia zzso to TRAIL zzso we have adopted a strategy of combining zzso a potent zzso zzso of the zzso pathway, with zzso zzso The rationale for using such a combination was that deletions and/or zzso of the zzso gene occur in only zzso of zzso and that TRAIL and zzso activate the zzso and intrinsic pathways of zzso zzso TRAIL induced a rapid increase of zzso when added to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells, carrying a zzso zzso as well as to zzso zzso zzso carrying a zzso zzso On the other hand, the small zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso cell cycle arrest and a slow progressive increase of zzso in zzso and zzso but not in zzso Of note, zzso zzso the surface expression of zzso and zzso with TRAIL in inducing zzso in zzso and zzso as well as in primary zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso Moreover, while zzso zzso the expression of zzso dependent zzso inhibitor zzso a zzso gene zzso cell cycle block and showing zzso activity, the simultaneous addition of TRAIL plus zzso induced the zzso zzso of zzso The relevance of zzso zzso for zzso zzso cells to zzso was underscored in zzso experiments with small interfering zzso Our data suggest that the combined treatment of zzso plus TRAIL might offer a novel therapeutic strategy for zzso
