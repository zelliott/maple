The studies were carried out on nude mice bearing human zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso to evaluate the zzso potential of zzso containing compounds such as sodium zzso zzso and zzso zzso Three doses of zzso drugs were used, including zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso and 2 zzso zzso We explored the zzso effect of zzso and zzso administered by zzso injection for 21 zzso We observed the zzso changes and the cell zzso in tumor tissue by HE zzso and zzso zzso after zzso and zzso zzso zzso level and zzso zzso zzso activity in tumor zzso were zzso In addition, Western zzso was used to detect the expression of zzso zzso The results suggested that zzso and zzso had significantly inhibited tumor growth in zzso We also observed the zzso changes and cell zzso in tumor zzso after zzso and zzso zzso zzso level was a bit increased but the zzso activity was zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso treatment zzso the expression of the protein zzso increased the expression of zzso zzso and zzso and activated zzso zzso and zzso may be the selective, zzso zzso agents to treat human zzso zzso zzso
