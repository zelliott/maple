To zzso evaluate the zzso zzso and selectivity to tumor zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso window chambers on zzso mice with or without zzso a human small cell lung cancer, zzso implants and fluorescent zzso zzso imaging were zzso In zzso studies show that minimal loss of zzso marker zzso from zzso occurs after 4 days of zzso in zzso zzso and the release profiles of zzso and zzso were essentially the same with approximately zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso released after 26 zzso zzso faster zzso of zzso from tumor vessels was shown compared to zzso tissue after single dose zzso zzso The relative zzso amounts at 60 zzso zzso for tumor and zzso zzso were zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher in tumor than in normal zzso which continued beyond 48 zzso Both zzso and zzso showed significant zzso effects in window chambers and in flank tumors, compared with controls and zzso zzso The preferential zzso of zzso from tumor zzso as well as its differential retention in tumor tissue provides the basis for the enhancement in zzso activity of zzso over zzso
