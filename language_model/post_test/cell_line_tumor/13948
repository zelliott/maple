zzso particles were found in the medium in the presence of the human leukemia cell line zzso The particles were separated from human cells by zzso and incubated in zzso supplemented with zzso fetal calf serum at 37 zzso The particles increased in number very slowly in the liquid medium but did not reveal any biological zzso zzso electron zzso of the particles showed a zzso or zzso shape in zzso zzso No specific zzso from the zzso particles were detected by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso except for bovine zzso that zzso to the surface of the zzso X-ray zzso as well as zzso transform infrared zzso suggested the particles consisted of zzso The mechanism of zzso of the zzso particles in liquid medium is currently zzso This type of particle has been overlooked for a long period because it is zzso It will be necessary to examine its biological effects to the cultured zzso
