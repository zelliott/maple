zzso zzso is a zzso agent which zzso survival when administered during and after zzso in the zzso treatment of zzso and which also has significant activity in zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso is a DNA repair zzso attributed a role in cancer cell resistance to zzso zzso zzso Using a panel of 12 human zzso cell lines, we here defined the sensitivity to zzso in acute zzso and zzso survival zzso in relation to zzso mismatch repair and zzso status and its zzso by zzso zzso and zzso We found that the levels of zzso expression were a major predictor of zzso sensitivity in human zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso survival after zzso exposure are highly correlated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso survival after zzso exposure does not correlate with the expression levels of the mismatch repair proteins zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso 6 or zzso segregation increased zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso whereas zzso gene transfer into zzso cells zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso Neither zzso radiation (4 zzso nor clinically relevant zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso function strongly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso agents designed to stabilize the zzso zzso of zzso sensitize zzso cells for zzso zzso zzso these results suggest that the determination of zzso expression and zzso status will help to identify zzso patients who will or will not respond to zzso
