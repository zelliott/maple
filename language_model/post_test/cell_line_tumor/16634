zzso zzso and zzso zzso are important zzso agents widely used in the treatment of a variety of zzso including oral zzso cell zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the zzso efficacy of the sequential administration of zzso and zzso against zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso In in zzso growth zzso zzso sequential treatment with zzso followed by zzso was more effective in zzso cancer cell growth than zzso followed by zzso single treatment with zzso or zzso or combined treatment with zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso followed by zzso significantly inhibited tumor growth in zzso compared to zzso followed by zzso To understand the mechanisms underlying the enhanced growth zzso effect of the administration zzso zzso followed by zzso we examined the expression of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which were known to regulate the zzso effect of zzso by real-time zzso and western zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso expression and zzso of zzso expression were induced by zzso treatment, suggesting that zzso enhanced the efficacy of zzso by altering the expression of its zzso zzso These results indicate that sequential treatment with zzso followed by zzso could be a promising therapeutic strategy for oral zzso
