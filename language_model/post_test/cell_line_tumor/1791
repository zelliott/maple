The human zzso cell line zzso is a potentially useful model for the identification and zzso of zzso zzso but little is known about the pharmacology of their zzso expressed zzso The aim of this study was to determine the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells using zzso and zzso approaches, and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso expressed in this cell line using zzso and zzso zzso zzso human zzso cells were found to zzso express several zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso of zzso expressed zzso with zzso or the scorpion toxin zzso caused membrane zzso and subsequent zzso influx through zzso zzso and zzso calcium channels, allowing zzso zzso to be detected with membrane potential and fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso identified zzso and zzso as the major contributors of this zzso The zzso scorpion toxin zzso in combination with zzso produced a zzso response, confirming that zzso expressed human zzso in zzso cells is functional and can be zzso zzso providing a new zzso format for zzso zzso
