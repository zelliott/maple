zzso retarded tumor growth by several known mechanisms, including suppression of cell proliferation and zzso of tumor zzso zzso zzso growth factors zzso and zzso zzso zzso are major zzso zzso The current study examined the effect of zzso on the expression of these factors in conjunction with tumor growth and vascular zzso 

Growth characteristics of rat zzso cells zzso infected with zzso zzso zzso a full-length human zzso zzso gene were examined by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso was verified by zzso and zzso zzso zzso vascular architecture and the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were examined by zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso cells showed zzso in growth and colony zzso In zzso expression of the zzso resulted in prolonged survival and reduction of tumor volume zzso and reduced the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso and zzso The tumor exhibited increased necrosis zzso zzso and abnormal vascular zzso 

zzso causes tumor zzso by suppressing tumor proliferation and indirectly zzso zzso of tumor vessels by zzso zzso activity of zzso in an environment of diminishing zzso
