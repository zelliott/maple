zzso cancer is the most commonly diagnosed zzso zzso and second most common cause of zzso mortality in western zzso To investigate the mechanisms of prostate cancer development and zzso we did expression profiling of human prostate cancer and benign zzso We show that the zzso is zzso in prostate tumor samples compared with benign zzso by zzso analysis, real-time zzso and zzso We also show that zzso expression is highly correlated with zzso score at the zzso and protein level using tissue zzso Genes affected by zzso expression were also identified, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were identified as direct targets of zzso zzso of zzso by small interfering zzso zzso induced zzso of prostate cancer cells, suggesting that zzso could be a therapeutic target for prostate zzso zzso zzso of zzso into zzso prostate cells enabled colony formation in soft zzso suggesting that, in the proper cellular context, zzso can be a transforming zzso
