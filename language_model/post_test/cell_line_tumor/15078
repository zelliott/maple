We examined whether altered protein expression for 7 potential zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso could predict tumor recurrence and progression in patients treated with zzso zzso zzso therapy for primary stage zzso grade 3 zzso zzso cancer zzso 

The study included 61 patients with primary zzso BC who were treated with 6 weekly zzso zzso zzso after clinically complete zzso zzso of zzso tumor between 1990 and zzso All patients had proper muscle tissue in their zzso zzso expression for 7 molecular zzso before zzso therapy was analyzed by zzso based on tissue zzso methodology, and the percentage of positive cells was determined zzso in a blind zzso Survival analysis was performed using zzso zzso and Cox zzso to determine the effect of each marker on recurrence-free survival zzso and zzso survival zzso after zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso rates were zzso and zzso respectively, with a median follow-up of zzso months zzso zzso The altered expression for each marker were noted in zzso for zzso zzso for zzso zzso for zzso zzso for zzso zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso No significant association was found between altered marker status and zzso zzso While increased zzso expression was associated with progression after zzso therapy zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso no single marker was associated with zzso and zzso after zzso therapy in zzso and zzso Cox zzso zzso Similarly, in zzso analysis according to tumor size, zzso and zzso no single marker was associated with zzso and zzso No difference was noted in molecular marker status between zzso zzso and zzso 

Our findings indicate that zzso analysis for 7 potential molecular markers has no zzso value for recurrence and progression in primary zzso BC treated with zzso zzso Large prospective studies are needed to validate the zzso molecular markers in primary zzso zzso
