To investigate the mechanism of zzso zzso anchor zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso 

We identified a large zzso anchor protein deficient population in three different zzso zzso cell lines through zzso treatment of the cells and flow zzso analysis using a zzso zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso anchor protein zzso was studied by DNA gene sequencing, a zzso zzso to investigate the zzso anchor zzso pathway, zzso analysis, and quantitative real-time zzso chain zzso 

zzso zzso cell lines harbor large populations of zzso cells, which are resistant to zzso In all three cell lines, zzso of a gene involved in an early step in zzso zzso was responsible for the lack of zzso proteins on the cell zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and zzso analysis demonstrate that the level of zzso for zzso and zzso is lower in the zzso Ramos cells and that zzso levels of zzso are reduced in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of these genes was associated with the low levels of zzso and treatment of the cells with zzso zzso restored cell surface zzso proteins to the zzso zzso 

zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso cells is not due to a genetic zzso zzso zzso rather, the lack of zzso proteins results from zzso zzso of zzso and zzso
