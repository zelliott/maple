The zzso properties of a group of 13 structurally diverse zzso compounds, including six zzso zzso complexes, five zzso zzso zzso complexes, and two zzso compounds, toward several human tumor cell lines were evaluated in zzso using a systematic screening zzso zzso all compounds were tested against a panel of 12 human tumor cell lines, and the best performers were tested against a larger zzso zzso Very pronounced zzso properties were highlighted in most cases, with zzso zzso commonly falling in the low zzso even zzso Overall, zzso tumor selectivity was established for at least seven compounds, making them particularly attractive for further pharmacological zzso Compare analysis suggested that the observed zzso effects are caused by a variety of molecular mechanisms, in most cases zzso and completely different from those of platinum zzso zzso some new zzso systems such as zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso target of zzso and zzso zzso were proposed for the first time as likely zzso targets for the zzso species zzso The results zzso qualify zzso compounds as a promising class of zzso agents, of outstanding interest for cancer treatment, while providing initial insight into their modes of zzso
