Previously, it was demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and that it is capable of zzso these cells to zzso zzso The objectives of this study were to determine whether zzso can also act as zzso to zzso agents and to characterize the molecular mechanism behind its zzso zzso 

Ten zzso cell lines were used in this zzso The effect of zzso on the zzso concentration 50% zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was determined by the zzso 96 zzso The in zzso effect of combination treatments with zzso and the zzso agents was determined in animal zzso zzso zzso was measured using the zzso zzso and the zzso cascade was characterized by Western zzso zzso 

The results showed that zzso is able to sensitize zzso cells to zzso zzso and zzso both in zzso and in zzso In addition, it was demonstrated that zzso is capable of inducing zzso zzso 1) the zzso of the zzso zzso through zzso and Bid zzso and 2) the zzso degradation of the zzso protein zzso 

zzso the components of the zzso zzso activated by zzso which allows it to sensitize zzso cells to zzso agents, will provide valuable information on the characteristic mode of action of a zzso This will help in the identification of novel drugs and in the design of better strategies for combination therapy in patients with zzso zzso zzso
