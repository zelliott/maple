zzso zzso and zzso zzso are two of the most common zzso aromatic zzso zzso produced during cooking of meat, fish and zzso Both zzso produce different tumor profiles in zzso and are suspected to be zzso in zzso In order to better understand the molecular basis of zzso zzso we have analyzed gene expression profiles in the metabolically competent human zzso cells using zzso zzso zzso after either a single zzso or a repeated zzso exposure to 10 zzso zzso or zzso The most responsive genes to both zzso were downstream targets of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso after both time points and zzso and zzso after 28 zzso zzso zzso induction in zzso zzso cells was prevented by chemical zzso or small interference zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso induced activity of the zzso promoter, which contains a consensus zzso zzso element zzso In addition, several other genes exhibited both zzso and zzso expression changes with, however, a smaller magnitude than previously reported for the zzso zzso target zzso These changes concerned genes mainly related to cell growth and zzso zzso and zzso In conclusion, these results identify the zzso gene battery as the preferential target of zzso and zzso in zzso cells and further support the hypothesis that intake of zzso in diet might increase human cancer zzso
