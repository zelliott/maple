zzso ultraviolet zzso radiation response is a gene induction cascade activated by several zzso factors, including zzso Although zzso is induced by zzso radiation, the signal zzso mechanism remains relatively zzso In the present study, we show that zzso zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso We also show that caffeine specifically zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso In addition, our study shows that zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso protein zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso Because zzso (a zzso zzso zzso or zzso C or zzso zzso zzso was able to inhibit zzso zzso zzso we evaluated whether caffeine could inhibit zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso or zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso is downstream of zzso Additionally, caffeine could effectively inhibit zzso increases in zzso zzso Taken together, our study demonstrates that caffeine is a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso Additionally, this zzso occurs due to the zzso action of caffeine on zzso and zzso resulting in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
