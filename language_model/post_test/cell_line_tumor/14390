Prevention trials showed that zzso reduced prostate cancer zzso by zzso establishing zzso as a promising zzso agent for prostate zzso zzso inhibited human prostate cancer cell growth, blocked cell cycle progression at multiple transition points, and induced zzso cell zzso Previous studies showed a novel mechanism of zzso zzso action in which zzso markedly reduces zzso signaling and zzso zzso zzso gene zzso including zzso zzso zzso in human prostate cancer zzso The molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso of zzso signaling are not zzso In this study, a systemic approach was taken to examine the modification of zzso signaling by zzso in human prostate cancer zzso In addition to reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to initially increase the stability of zzso zzso within 6 hours while decreasing the stability of zzso zzso after 8 zzso zzso increased zzso protein degradation and reduced zzso nuclear zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso did not affect zzso binding to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso increased the recruitment of zzso and zzso such as zzso and zzso to the promoter of the zzso zzso and that recruitment was greatly diminished in the presence of 5 zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso enhanced the recruitment of zzso such as zzso to the promoter of the zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso zzso zzso signaling at multiple zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso stability, protein degradation, nuclear zzso and recruitment of zzso
