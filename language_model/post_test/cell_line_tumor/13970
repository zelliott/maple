In an effort to contribute to a better understanding of the zzso toxicity of the ubiquitous environmental zzso and zzso zzso zzso a comprehensive quantitative zzso analysis was performed on zzso rat zzso cells exposed to 1 zzso zzso for 8 zzso Changes in the zzso of individual protein species in zzso cells as compared to zzso cells were zzso using the zzso zzso protein label zzso method zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2005, 5, zzso 89 proteins were identified as zzso or zzso by zzso For the majority of the altered zzso an impact of zzso on their abundance had not been known zzso Due to the zzso properties or the zzso regulation of a large number of the affected zzso their zzso would have escaped detection by zzso methods for zzso analysis and by standard zzso expression zzso zzso The identified proteins with zzso abundance include several proteins implicated in cell cycle regulation, growth factor zzso and the control of zzso The results thus provide new zzso for the investigation of specific aspects of the toxicity and zzso of zzso in zzso
