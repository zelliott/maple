Members of a family of zzso zzso zzso were zzso characterized according to their zzso and zzso properties, and evaluated for their collective potential as zzso for zzso zzso zzso The zzso in this series possess zzso zzso excited states with lifetimes that can be tuned from 22 to zzso zzso in fluid solution and from 44 to zzso zzso in glass at 77 zzso To our knowledge, these zzso lifetimes are the longest reported for zzso zzso containing only one organic zzso and lacking terminal zzso zzso These excited states proved to be extremely sensitive to trace amounts of zzso zzso to their long lifetimes and very low zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso states of this nature are potent zzso agents, exhibiting the largest zzso zzso reported to date with zzso light zzso at very short zzso zzso zzso these new agents are robust enough to maintain zzso zzso in pigmented zzso melanoma cells, where the presence of zzso in combination with low oxygen tension is known to compromise zzso This activity underscores the potential of zzso zzso as an alternate treatment strategy for challenging environments such as zzso zzso
