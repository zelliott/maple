A major clinical problem encountered with the use of zzso zzso drugs zzso such as zzso is gastrointestinal zzso Both zzso zzso zzso and gastric zzso zzso are involved in zzso gastric zzso and this zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso stress response and resulting zzso of zzso Heat shock proteins zzso have been suggested to protect gastric zzso from zzso zzso here we have tested this idea zzso The severity of gastric zzso produced by zzso was worse in mice lacking heat shock factor 1 zzso a zzso factor for zzso zzso than in control zzso zzso administration zzso the expression of gastric zzso zzso zzso gastric zzso were ameliorated in transgenic mice expressing zzso After zzso administration, fewer zzso cells were observed in the gastric zzso of transgenic mice expressing zzso than in zzso mice, whereas the gastric levels of zzso zzso for the two were zzso This suggests that expression of zzso ameliorates zzso gastric zzso by affecting zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso but not the zzso zzso stress zzso zzso induced zzso at gastric zzso in an zzso manner and suppressed the formation of zzso gastric zzso in zzso mice but not in zzso zzso The results of this study provide direct genetic evidence that expression of zzso zzso gastric protection against zzso zzso by zzso the zzso of zzso The zzso inducing activity of zzso seems to contribute to its zzso activity against zzso
