zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso have been observed in human and animal models of breast zzso Both zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso can inhibit proliferation of breast cancer cells in zzso Here, we examine the effects of the zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso on mouse breast tumor cells in zzso and in zzso 

We created and characterized a mouse zzso zzso cell zzso line from zzso zzso tumor zzso mice to study zzso and zzso expression and response to zzso and zzso in zzso To study the in zzso effects, zzso zzso tumor zzso mice were given either control diet or diets containing three different zzso of zzso and zzso as well as a combination of both zzso Mice were then followed for tumor formation up to 1 zzso 

zzso cells express both zzso and zzso zzso and exhibited cooperative growth zzso with a combination of zzso and zzso In mice, the median age of death due to zzso tumors was significantly delayed in zzso animals at all three zzso but was not significantly affected by zzso treatment zzso A combination of zzso and zzso was significantly more effective than zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest that a combination of a zzso inhibitor and zzso zzso can delay breast cancer in a mouse model and suggest that these agents should be studied in the context of human populations with high breast cancer zzso
