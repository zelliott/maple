The abundant zzso human factor zzso is a zzso complex of zzso and zzso zzso that are essential for two stages of the cell zzso The zzso zzso promotes zzso phase zzso whereas the zzso zzso ensures proper zzso at completion of M zzso How the zzso zzso functions is zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso depletion causes extensive zzso zzso including a switch from zzso to zzso zzso 20 of zzso zzso zzso and defective zzso alignment and zzso zzso with these activities, the zzso zzso can associate with zzso independently of the zzso zzso and regulates the expression of the zzso zzso zzso Indeed, zzso of zzso expression upon loss of zzso leads to improper zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results establish the zzso zzso as an important M phase regulator and suggest that zzso zzso status contributes to zzso behavior during zzso and proper zzso
