Recent studies have demonstrated the possible function of zzso in zzso However, the exact mechanism of zzso in cancer remains zzso In this study, the association of zzso expression with zzso zzso cell zzso zzso was evaluated in 106 pairs of zzso cancer and adjacent zzso tissue from zzso zzso The tumor zzso features of zzso were measured by evaluating cell proliferation and cell cycle state, migratory activity and invasion zzso as well as zzso zzso reporter zzso and Western zzso analysis were performed to determine the target gene regulated by zzso The zzso level of zzso the target gene of zzso was determined in zzso zzso zzso showed that reduced zzso level was associated with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was investigated to induce cell cycle arrest in the zzso phase and to suppress the invasive capability of zzso zzso cells by targeting the zzso of zzso zzso zzso E1 and zzso were confirmed to participate in cell cycle arrest and invasive suppression induced by zzso zzso zzso correlation analysis further confirmed the significantly negative correlation between zzso and zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso exerts a zzso and zzso function in human zzso which demonstrates that zzso is a potential zzso for early diagnosis and prognosis and is a therapeutic target for zzso
