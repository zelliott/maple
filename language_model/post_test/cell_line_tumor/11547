Various mechanisms for zzso targeted drug delivery have been investigated in the past several zzso zzso are already known for their ability to zzso various drugs in their zzso zzso this paper reports evaluation of the potential of a zzso zzso as a drug delivery vehicle, using cell zzso in zzso in conjunction with ultrasound as the release zzso The application of ultrasound to the cell zzso results in both zzso and mechanical zzso a current challenge is to differentiate between these zzso In this study, the cell zzso routes of zzso zzso in the zzso carrier were investigated, examining individually the zzso and the mechanical effects of focused ultrasound for drug zzso zzso mechanical effects, the zzso of zzso zzso into cancer cells was increased by a factor of up to zzso when ultrasound was zzso zzso application of zzso increased the cellular zzso of zzso zzso by a factor of up to zzso zzso without focused ultrasound resulted in an increase by a factor of up to zzso
