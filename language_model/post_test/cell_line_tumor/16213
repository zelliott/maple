The zzso of zzso zzso and its zzso stem cell factor zzso has been reported in biopsy specimens of Merkel cell zzso zzso However, the functional role of zzso in the zzso of this aggressive tumor has not been zzso The present study reports expression and effects of zzso and zzso in the Merkel cell zzso cell line zzso in zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso soluble zzso modulated zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso growth of zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 signaling zzso On the contrary, an zzso zzso that neutralized the zzso zzso binding site, reduced growth of zzso cells, as did high doses of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Also, zzso of zzso downstream zzso zzso that blocks zzso as well as zzso and zzso that inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso zzso These data support the hypothesis that zzso is zzso by zzso or zzso tumor zzso zzso and stimulates growth of Merkel cell zzso in zzso zzso of zzso and the downstream signaling cascade at various levels results in zzso of Merkel cell zzso growth in zzso suggesting targets for therapy of this zzso
