zzso zzso zzso are essential for zzso zzso zzso breakdown and repair, and have been implicated in the development of zzso zzso was initially identified as a potent inhibitor of zzso however it also has several properties that are unique and not related to its ability to abrogate zzso We studied the effects of zzso of tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso on lung cancer cells and explored the mechanisms involved in zzso in susceptible cells and zzso the therapeutic effect in zzso zzso of zzso resulted in zzso of zzso lung cancer cells and zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on these zzso zzso delivery of zzso gene inhibited the growth of zzso zzso zzso in zzso nude mice, and was associated with a greater therapeutic effect than either zzso or zzso gene zzso There was no evidence of increased zzso toxicity following the delivery of zzso either from zzso or intravenous zzso Thus, at least in cells showing in zzso zzso zzso gene therapy offers a therapeutic advantage over zzso 1 and zzso These findings establish the potential of zzso gene delivery of zzso as a therapeutic agent for selected lung zzso
