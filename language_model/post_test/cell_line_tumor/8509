Because zzso carries a variety of zzso that are possibly recognized by the zzso family, we examined zzso zzso and found that zzso prominently bound to zzso An zzso study showed that zzso immune cells were associated with zzso cells in human zzso zzso and breast tumor zzso We investigated whether or not this interaction has any functional implications for zzso zzso When mouse zzso zzso cells and a human colon cancer cell line, zzso zzso zzso with zzso were zzso with zzso soluble zzso zzso was recruited to the zzso zzso domain, which was enhanced on stimulation with soluble zzso in zzso and zzso zzso A zzso model of zzso cells and zzso cells mimicking the interaction between zzso zzso cells, and zzso immune cells in a tumor zzso was zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells, but not mock zzso cells, with zzso cells similarly enhanced the recruitment of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso In addition, treatment of zzso cells with zzso almost completely abolished the effect of zzso on zzso zzso The recruited zzso was thereafter transported to the nucleus, leading to cell zzso These findings suggest that zzso expressed on immune cells may play a role as a potential zzso for zzso and that this signaling may be another zzso zzso and function in parallel with a growth zzso zzso
