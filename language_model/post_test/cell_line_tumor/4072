In the initial zzso human prostate cancer zzso is an zzso disease, which can be zzso controlled by zzso zzso This therapy often zzso selection of zzso PC cells with increased zzso We recently demonstrated, both in cells and mice, that a testosterone zzso locally zzso in zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso PC cell zzso migration and invasion, acting as an zzso zzso zzso is unable to bind zzso zzso zzso but exerts its protection against PC by specifically interacting with zzso zzso beta zzso Because of its potential zzso to zzso steroids, zzso cannot be used zzso zzso thus, the aims of this study were to investigate the capability of four zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to counteract PC progression by mimicking the zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso and zzso decreased zzso and zzso cell proliferation in a zzso manner; in addition, all four compounds significantly decreased the detachment of cells seeded on zzso or zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso cells showed a significant decrease in cell zzso zzso all these effects were reversed by the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that their actions are zzso by the zzso pathway, via the zzso the only zzso present in these zzso In conclusion, these data demonstrate that by selectively zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibit human PC cells proliferation and migration favoring cell zzso These synthetic and natural zzso of zzso action may exert a potent protective activity against the progression of PC even in its zzso zzso
