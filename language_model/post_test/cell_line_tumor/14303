zzso contain many zzso that may be recognized by the immune zzso It is not known whether these zzso and the zzso within these zzso can all be recognized by the zzso immune response or if such responses are restricted to a few dominant zzso zzso function of zzso zzso T zzso zzso generated during tumor progression has previously been assessed by zzso ex zzso zzso which often focused on a single zzso zzso we evaluated the zzso in zzso zzso response to multiple zzso tumor zzso using zzso Lewis lung zzso tumor cells zzso with zzso or a zzso zzso Both express multiple zzso class zzso zzso zzso contains a known hierarchy of zzso for given zzso zzso whilst the zzso expresses a number of dominant zzso We show that as tumors progress, potent zzso zzso are generated in zzso that are restricted to dominant zzso we did not see the responses to zzso or cryptic zzso Our data show that the zzso recognizing tumor zzso vary in their zzso capacity, as the zzso responding to two of the four zzso were particularly potent zzso The presence of these zzso zzso did not prevent tumor zzso However, zzso zzso treatment altered the zzso but not the zzso of these zzso such that they zzso tumor zzso These results have implications for zzso zzso
