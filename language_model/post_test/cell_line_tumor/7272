zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso is a zzso zzso factor that mediates a spectrum of toxic and biological effects of zzso zzso zzso and related zzso zzso zzso activated zzso alpha zzso is a nuclear zzso involved in the maintenance of zzso and zzso zzso In this study we hypothesized that one of the possible mechanisms for the effect of zzso and its related chemicals on fat metabolism could be through down regulation of zzso zzso We treated zzso rats with an zzso zzso Sudan III zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso Acid zzso for 3 zzso We zzso the expression of one of the zzso gene products, zzso protein and its zzso We also tested zzso cells with the zzso treatments and evaluated their effects on zzso and zzso zzso Treatment of zzso rats with zzso was found to down regulates zzso protein expression and reduced its induction with zzso It also decreased zzso expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso cells, zzso and zzso protein expression was decreased by zzso treatment in a dose dependent zzso Our results suggest that zzso has an zzso effect on zzso function and a new zzso by which zzso zzso could disturb zzso zzso
