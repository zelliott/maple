In zzso cells, zzso are the primary source of zzso oxygen species zzso which are generated by zzso of the electron transport chain zzso High levels of zzso can trigger cell death, whereas lower levels drive diverse and important cellular zzso We show here by employing a newly developed zzso zzso zzso zzso that individual zzso undergo spontaneous bursts of zzso generation, termed zzso zzso zzso flashes occur randomly in space and time, exhibit zzso properties, and provide a vital source of zzso production across many different cell zzso Individual flashes are triggered by transient openings of the zzso zzso transition pore stimulating zzso production by the zzso Furthermore, we observe a flurry of zzso flash activity during zzso of zzso after zzso which is inhibited by the zzso compound zzso We propose that zzso flashes could serve as a valuable zzso for a wide variety of zzso stress-related zzso
