zzso is a novel targeted oral zzso inhibitor currently in Phase III clinical development for treatment of zzso cancer zzso in combination with zzso and multiple myeloma zzso in combination with zzso and zzso 

The zzso zzso testing, and clinical activity of zzso in zzso and zzso are discussed, with supportive zzso information zzso zzso literature searches were carried out for background and discussion zzso 

In zzso models, zzso has been shown to target zzso zzso zzso In zzso cell lines, zzso studies indicate that zzso may enhance the zzso effects of zzso likely primarily through the nuclear zzso zzso B zzso A zzso Phase II zzso trial of zzso zzso zzso in previously treated patients with zzso zzso showed the combination to be zzso In zzso Phase zzso clinical trials have established the optimal dosing schedule for zzso and zzso in zzso and demonstrated that zzso can sensitize to, or overcome resistance to, zzso associated with prolonged responses and a favorable side effect zzso Ultimately, the favorable zzso of zzso will allow for its testing in combination with multiple targeted therapies to improve zzso and zzso which represent an important zzso need in these zzso
