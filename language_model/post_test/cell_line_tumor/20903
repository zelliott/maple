The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse model of zzso zzso in zzso zzso consists of six lines with distinct zzso zzso and behavior, each meeting zzso defined criteria for zzso Specifically, these lines grow zzso in cleared zzso fat pads and consistently progress to an invasive zzso that is capable of zzso zzso Transition to zzso has a consistent zzso for each line, and three of the lines also exhibit pulmonary zzso zzso 

zzso cleared zzso transplanted zzso zzso zzso were analyzed by bacterial zzso zzso and zzso array comparative zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso repeat amplification zzso zzso cells were zzso and cultured in three zzso culture and transplanted in zzso zzso cleared zzso fat zzso 

Comparative zzso zzso shows that the zzso and invasive tumors are genetically stable, with low level changes including whole zzso gains in some zzso No changes are associated with zzso although spontaneous focal zzso and deletions were detected zzso zzso analysis shows a low frequency of zzso that are predominantly permanent within a zzso zzso zzso activity is increased in both the zzso and the derived tumors when compared with normal mouse zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso cells and three zzso zzso culture of single cells reveals a zzso for zzso and zzso differentiation and the formation of unique three-dimensional zzso These zzso exhibit features that are intermediate between zzso that are derived from normal and zzso zzso zzso of a single cell derived zzso zzso the outgrowth of the zzso zzso and progression to zzso 

These data establish a zzso zzso cell that is capable of zzso and zzso differentiation as the origin of invasive zzso Within the context of this model, these cells have programmed potential for zzso and zzso that does not appear to require sequential genetic zzso for zzso
