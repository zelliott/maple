The zzso gene is responsible for a high number of zzso breast and zzso zzso and studies of the zzso biological functions are limited by the lack of models that resemble the patient's zzso zzso The aim of this study was to establish and zzso a new human breast zzso zzso obtained from a woman carrying a zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso was obtained by zzso a breast cancer sample into nude zzso The biological and genetic profiles of the zzso were compared with that of the patient's zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing, comparative zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso response to standard zzso was zzso 

zzso profile identified the zzso as a zzso zzso breast zzso zzso zzso DNA sequencing of the zzso showed the presence of the zzso previously identified in the zzso Comparative zzso zzso array profiles of the primary zzso and the zzso revealed a high number of similar genetic zzso The therapeutic assessment of the zzso showed sensitivity to zzso chemotherapy and resistance to zzso The zzso was also highly sensitive to zzso and zzso zzso 

This study describes a new human breast cancer zzso obtained from a zzso zzso This zzso provides a new model for the zzso drug development and for the exploration of the drug response biological zzso
