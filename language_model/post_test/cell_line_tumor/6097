zzso is a zzso for zzso cells that promotes tumor growth and zzso spread in animal models, and expression of which zzso with zzso zzso zzso in some human zzso It is zzso from the cell as a full-length form with zzso zzso a central region containing binding sites for zzso and zzso receptors that signal for zzso and zzso The zzso can be zzso from zzso enhancing affinity for zzso and zzso in zzso however, the importance of this processing in cancer is zzso To explore the necessity of processing for the effects of zzso in cancer, we use a zzso full-length form that cannot be zzso and show that, in contrast to full-length zzso that is zzso this zzso does not promote tumor growth and zzso zzso zzso in a mouse tumor zzso zzso of zzso is required for tumor zzso zzso and recruitment of zzso zzso These observations may be explained by the requirement of processing for zzso to bind zzso receptors and activate zzso Our results indicate that zzso processing is necessary for zzso to promote the growth and spread of cancer, and suggest that zzso catalyzing this processing could be targets for zzso zzso
