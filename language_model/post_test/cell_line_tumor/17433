zzso of the plasma membrane zzso is crucial for the regulation of zzso cell zzso and zzso In zzso canine kidney cells, the protein zzso zzso from the zzso to the zzso surface of the plasma membrane during the formation of zzso contacts and the development of zzso zzso This targeting is zzso and regulated by zzso zzso zzso At the plasma zzso zzso associates as a zzso complex with zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso serves to mediate the interaction between zzso 2 and the zzso regulatory domain of zzso zzso of both zzso 2 and zzso using an zzso zzso small interfering zzso zzso the association of zzso with plasma zzso In zzso canine kidney cells, zzso of zzso using zzso small interfering zzso prevents cortical zzso zzso reorganization required to support cell zzso We propose that the interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso regulates cortical zzso zzso organization and cell membrane zzso
