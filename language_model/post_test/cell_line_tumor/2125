Novel zzso zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso in the zzso at zzso were zzso and evaluated for their zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso liver, zzso breast, and zzso colon zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso were analyzed initially by an zzso zzso method based on a zzso B zzso Two zzso derivatives with promising zzso activities (11 and zzso were further analyzed on the zzso zzso The zzso analogue 11 displayed the best zzso activity, with zzso values between zzso and zzso zzso Similar to previously described zzso zzso compound 11 also interferes with cellular zzso reserves, possibly through influencing cellular zzso zzso Furthermore, the novel zzso analogue 11 was shown to induce zzso cell death, as demonstrated by the zzso zzso The zzso zzso effect of 11 was also confirmed through zzso of the zzso protein by zzso zzso in the presence of this zzso
