zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potential cancer therapeutic agent that zzso zzso zzso in cancer zzso However, breast cancer cells are generally resistant to zzso zzso is a major active ingredient of the traditional Chinese medicine zzso The present study aimed to assess the synergistic effect of zzso and TRAIL and zzso the underlying mechanisms in breast cancer zzso 

Cell proliferation and zzso were measured by zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso The expression of proteins was zzso by flow zzso and/or Western zzso zzso studies were used to determine the involvement of zzso zzso and zzso in the synergistic effect of zzso and zzso 

zzso and zzso cells were resistant to zzso Both cell lines were dramatically zzso to zzso zzso by zzso Further experiments indicated that zzso zzso zzso and zzso activated zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso rendered cells less sensitive to zzso induced by the combination of zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso by specific zzso attenuated zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso by zzso led to stronger zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso more zzso of zzso and zzso and a stronger synergistic effect of zzso and zzso 

zzso enhanced zzso zzso by zzso the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso contributed to the zzso of zzso and zzso which might be partially zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
