Street rabies viruses are field zzso known to be highly zzso However, the viral elements related to their zzso have yet to be identified at the zzso or zzso acid zzso Here, through 30 passages in mouse zzso zzso cells, we have established an attenuated zzso of street rabies virus strain zzso originating from a rabid zzso followed by 2 passages in the brains of zzso zzso The zzso zzso was well adapted to zzso cells and highly attenuated in adult mice after intramuscular zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso had seven zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the G protein led to an additional zzso Street viruses usually possess one or two zzso sites on the G zzso zzso has two, while an additional zzso site is observed in zzso zzso We also established a cloned zzso zzso by limiting zzso Apart from the zzso zzso zzso possessed only one zzso acid substitution in the P zzso which is found in several field zzso zzso also efficiently zzso in zzso cells and was attenuated in adult mice after zzso zzso although it was more zzso than zzso The spread of zzso in the brain was highly restricted after zzso zzso although the pattern of zzso spread was intermediate between that of the parental zzso and zzso Meanwhile, both zzso strongly induced zzso immune responses in mice compared to zzso Our results indicate that the additional zzso is likely related to the reduced zzso Taken together, we propose that the number of zzso sites in the G protein is one of the zzso of the zzso of street rabies zzso
