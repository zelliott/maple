The zzso transfer of zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso as zzso or to zzso zzso as zzso requires binding of zzso zzso The preceding paper zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 43, zzso shows that zzso of zzso can serve as zzso DNA for zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso binding zzso experiments reported here demonstrate that short DNA zzso containing the zzso zzso sequence motif zzso bind to cloned zzso in zzso The same zzso sequence motif is responsible for zzso zzso zzso of a zzso protein gene zzso cardiac zzso T zzso zzso of experiments reported here demonstrate that zzso of this motif also zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso promoter in zzso cultured in zzso indicating that zzso zzso binding of zzso to promoter DNA of the zzso gene is also necessary for zzso zzso Thus, zzso has two types of zzso binding activity: zzso zzso zzso zzso analyzed here with zzso experiments, and zzso zzso zzso measured zzso which does not depend on the zzso sequence of the zzso We zzso that the well-known association of zzso with zzso can be attributed to its stable binding to zzso zzso some portion of which is likely to be zzso zzso zzso According to this hypothesis, the distribution of this zzso zzso in zzso may be targeted to specific zzso zzso and vary according to cell type and zzso zzso
