zzso is a protein zzso modification with key roles in the regulation of cell zzso and zzso zzso analysis of zzso using mass zzso is permitting the investigation of processes controlled by zzso at the system zzso A critical step of these zzso methods involves the isolation of zzso peptides from the more abundant unmodified peptides produced by the zzso of cell zzso Although different techniques to enrich for zzso have been reported, there are limited data on their suitability for direct quantitative analysis by zzso Here we report a zzso based enrichment method compatible with large-scale and zzso quantitative analysis by zzso Starting with just 500 zzso of zzso the technique zzso isolated hundreds of zzso zzso of which were zzso These results were obtained by using relatively short zzso zzso runs zzso zzso and without any previous separation zzso In order to characterize the performance of the method for quantitative zzso we employed zzso zzso using extracted zzso zzso as the quantitative zzso After zzso zzso were zzso with good precision zzso of variation was zzso on average, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and accuracy zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso signals correlated with the concentration of the respective zzso in samples, making the approach suitable for in-depth relative zzso of zzso by zzso zzso
