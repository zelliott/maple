zzso are commonly used for the treatment of zzso diseases including zzso zzso More recently, following the fortuitous discovery that zzso was clinically active against zzso zzso compounds are being investigated for activity against zzso zzso we show that zzso compounds are similarly potent to human zzso melanoma and zzso zzso Furthermore, a recently discovered zzso compound, zzso was 50- to zzso more potent than zzso against human melanoma and zzso cell zzso As zzso compounds are known to act as zzso producing zzso zzso zzso upon zzso we investigated the DNA repair pathways zzso We show that, contrary to research in zzso coli, the zzso zzso zzso zzso is not required to repair zzso DNA damage in zzso zzso Instead, we show that zzso repair of zzso DNA breaks with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhances zzso toxicity in melanoma and zzso zzso We propose that this is due to zzso cells zzso Type 2 zzso for zzso zzso producing zzso zzso Species which cause DNA damage that is repaired by the Single Strand Break zzso and/or Base zzso zzso zzso whereas in bacteria and zzso Type 1 zzso are also zzso resulting in different DNA zzso In addition we show that, consistent with zzso zzso Species being formed upon zzso zzso and the ability of zzso to absorb zzso zzso Species, production of zzso in melanoma cells offers some protection from zzso and hydrogen zzso zzso Our data suggest that combinations of zzso and zzso compounds may be advantageous for the treatment of melanoma and zzso but that the protection offered to melanoma cells by their zzso zzso must be taken into zzso
