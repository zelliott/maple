zzso is an active component of zzso which has been shown to inhibit proliferation of a wide variety of tumor zzso The ability of zzso to enhance zzso effects of zzso in wild type zzso liver zzso zzso and colon cancer zzso cells was investigated with focusing on zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso cells were treated with zzso and/or zzso in a zzso and zzso manner and their zzso response was evaluated by zzso zzso The expression of zzso protein was assessed using Western zzso zzso exerted zzso activity on both cell types in a dose zzso zzso and time zzso zzso zzso Interestingly in zzso cells, zzso exhibited the same levels of zzso as zzso (10 zzso when the cells treated with zzso 25 zzso for zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso significantly enhanced zzso effects of zzso in zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso by zzso and zzso and zzso of both cells with zzso increased levels of zzso zzso zzso In line with zzso effect, combination therapy showed stronger zzso of zzso in zzso compared to zzso It seems that zzso exerts differential synergistic effect with zzso on proliferation of cancer cells from different origin which is mainly accompanied by zzso zzso Our data represent a future strategy to provide much safer and more effective treatment for colon zzso
