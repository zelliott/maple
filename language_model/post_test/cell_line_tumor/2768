zzso factor zzso plays a critical role in zzso through the integrated regulation of cell zzso zzso and zzso In zzso gene zzso mice, zzso expression zzso to zzso of zzso zzso zzso a level insufficient for supporting normal zzso and one that leads to zzso of zzso zzso that are readily transformed into zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells into primary or subsequent nude mice zzso complete zzso zzso in zzso To delineate characteristics of zzso stem cells zzso we analyzed zzso of zzso zzso which have a potential to zzso leukemia in zzso 

zzso cells isolated from the first recipient mice of zzso leukemia cells were divided into two zzso using zzso zzso zzso cells were transplanted into second recipient, or analyzed gene expression profiles and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso treatment on zzso cells in zzso were zzso 

zzso were enriched in the zzso zzso side population zzso and zzso cells in the SP population zzso zzso were zzso and zzso indistinguishable from other zzso zzso However, expression of zzso stem cell zzso genes was zzso in the zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso like zzso but zzso into the cell cycle was zzso by zzso zzso Nonetheless, zzso treatment established a point of newly adjusted equilibrium in the zzso cells and the cells never recovered to their previous zzso zzso 

Based on this zzso distinct zzso regulatory mechanisms in zzso may be considered as one of the causes of worsening of the features of leukemia after injury and zzso
