The zzso zzso 32 zzso a member of the gap junction gene family, acts as a zzso zzso gene in human zzso cell zzso zzso and is zzso by the zzso of zzso islands in a promoter region of the zzso zzso The current study investigated whether the restoration of zzso silenced by zzso in zzso by a DNA zzso agent could be an effective treatment against zzso 

Using nude mice bearing zzso cells (a human zzso zzso cell zzso the effects of zzso zzso a DNA zzso zzso on zzso zzso expression and zzso growth were examined by zzso and by measuring zzso weight and zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso short interfering zzso zzso and the effect of zzso on zzso suppression of zzso growth in nude mice was zzso 

zzso treatment inhibited the growth of zzso cells in nude mice by zzso and increased zzso the level of zzso zzso The zzso injection of zzso zzso almost totally inhibited the expression of zzso zzso and significantly reduced the suppression of zzso growth in zzso nude zzso 

zzso suppressed the growth of zzso zzso in a zzso model, by restoring zzso zzso This finding suggests that treatment with zzso could be a new effective therapy against human zzso zzso and that zzso could be a potential target for the treatment of zzso
