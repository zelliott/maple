zzso metabolism in zzso cells plays a central role in the processes of zzso zzso and in the regulation of immune zzso In this study, we investigated zzso transport activity and the expression of the related zzso genes during the differentiation of zzso to zzso We show here that the induction of zzso zzso differentiation by zzso markedly increases the expression of zzso zzso and of zzso protein and consequently, the activity of system zzso zzso zzso zzso the activity of system zzso decreases during zzso differentiation as a result of a reduction in zzso protein zzso The zzso zzso zzso and the increased activity of system zzso through the induction of zzso gene are zzso by the specific zzso of zzso zzso gene zzso causes a significant reduction of system zzso activity and a zzso marked increase of zzso and zzso cell content, thus suggesting that in zzso cells, system zzso activity is mainly directed zzso zzso agents other than zzso zzso zzso and zzso are equally effective in the stimulation of system zzso transport activity through the increased expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, we found that also during differentiation of human zzso from peripheral blood zzso zzso and system zzso activity are zzso These findings point to zzso gene as a marker of zzso zzso
