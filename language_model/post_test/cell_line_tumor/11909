Recent studies have demonstrated that zzso a newly discovered specific inhibitor of zzso cells, may significantly suppress the growth of a variety of zzso We constructed an zzso expression zzso containing zzso zzso zzso To study the effect of zzso we zzso injected zzso into zzso melanoma bearing zzso mice, we found that zzso could obviously inhibit tumor growth and reduce the size of tumors in zzso melanoma bearing zzso mice compared to the zzso control zzso In addition, we also investigated whether zzso of zzso can prevent the tumor formation in mice treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso mice which received 5 days of treatment of zzso prior to zzso tumors resulted in the zzso effect when compared to control zzso No zzso effect was observed when zzso was combined with zzso zzso These findings provide a basis for the further development of zzso delivery of zzso gene zzso
