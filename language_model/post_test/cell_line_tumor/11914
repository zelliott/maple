We used zzso zzso to examine the extent to which the expression of individual genes varies in mouse brain and in cultured zzso zzso cells zzso extracted from zzso zzso mouse brains and from four distinct cultures of zzso zzso cells was zzso with ten zzso zzso zzso chips to determine the individual gene expression zzso A mathematical zzso reduced the effect of potential sources of zzso not associated to the biological material by about zzso The zzso estimates of the standard zzso of individual gene zzso determined through zzso zzso The newly introduced relative expression zzso defined as the zzso of the middle of the zzso estimate of the standard zzso and the mean expression ratio (and its zzso gene zzso zzso was used to rank the most zzso and the most zzso transcribed zzso In brains of different animals and in separate cultures of zzso cells, unique sets zzso exhibited exceptional stability or were highly zzso zzso implications for such tight or loose zzso control are zzso
