zzso zzso zzso is a highly zzso tumor with poor response to classical zzso zzso zzso acute regulatory zzso protein is expressed in most human zzso The aim of this study was to induce zzso T cells directed against zzso in a zzso tumor zzso Because a suitable zzso zzso mouse tumor model is zzso we established a clone of the mouse myeloma zzso tumor cell line zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso Using repeated zzso injections of zzso DNA zzso zzso followed by infection with a zzso zzso virus zzso expressing zzso we induced a zzso zzso response as measured by zzso zzso zzso To demonstrate zzso activity of the vaccination zzso mice were treated as zzso group A, mice zzso with plasmids and zzso zzso zzso receiving zzso zzso control group B, mice zzso with the empty zzso and the empty zzso receiving zzso zzso control group C, mice zzso with the empty zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso receiving zzso zzso and control group D, mice zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso receiving parental zzso zzso A high proportion zzso of the control groups B, C, and D developed subcutaneous zzso In contrast, zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso was highly protective against tumor growth zzso of zzso animals, zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso these results show that zzso tolerance toward zzso can be broken, resulting in zzso zzso Thus, zzso represents a candidate target zzso for zzso strategies against zzso
