The nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma plays a key role in the regulation of zzso and zzso metabolism in zzso by regulating their zzso zzso and zzso A zzso zzso in the zzso zzso which changes an zzso zzso at position 425 into a zzso zzso has been reported in a patient with familial partial zzso zzso 3 zzso The strong conservation of zzso 425 among nuclear receptors that zzso with zzso acid X zzso prompted us to investigate the functional consequences of the zzso zzso on zzso zzso Here we show that this zzso displayed strongly reduced zzso activity compared with zzso zzso irrespective of cell type, promoter context, or zzso whereas zzso of nuclear zzso activity remained largely zzso Our data indicate that the reduced zzso activity of zzso zzso is not caused by impaired zzso release, but due to reduced zzso with zzso acid X zzso alpha in combination with reduced zzso binding and subsequent zzso zzso As a consequence of these molecular zzso the zzso zzso was less effective in inducing zzso zzso zzso zzso did not inhibit its zzso counterpart in a zzso manner, suggesting a zzso mechanism in at least some zzso zzso Using molecular dynamics simulations, substitution of zzso with zzso is predicted to cause the formation of an alternative salt zzso This structural change provides a likely explanation of how zzso of a single zzso zzso in a patient with zzso can disrupt the function of the zzso zzso factor zzso on multiple zzso
