zzso of zzso into downstream zzso zzso followed by signaling zzso tumor zzso and the cancer cells to influence tumor zzso As such, zzso signaling represents a novel way to zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso the most common zzso solid tumor of childhood, is highly zzso and often displays poor zzso However, the role of zzso zzso is not known in zzso We found that zzso expresses high levels of zzso zzso which is essential for the formation of zzso zzso zzso induced zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso The effect occurred at the zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso had a synergistic effect on zzso zzso Strong correlation was detected between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in 11 different cell lines and 17 zzso zzso zzso of zzso with the selective zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso cells increased or inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso significantly inhibited tumor growth, zzso zzso zzso and induced zzso in the zzso tumor zzso Taken together, our data suggest that enhanced formation of zzso zzso zzso in zzso profoundly influences tumor zzso by inducing zzso expression via zzso zzso of zzso signaling by zzso zzso may constitute a novel strategy to control zzso
