The in zzso zzso of zzso T cells by zzso cells zzso zzso killed tumor cells can be zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso We investigated whether zzso zzso killed zzso cells coated with zzso zzso could elicit zzso immunity in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with bone zzso zzso in the presence or absence of zzso zzso Mice vaccinated with zzso zzso with zzso tumor cells were protected from tumor challenge zzso long-term zzso whereas zzso loaded with tumor cells alone were much less zzso The zzso whole tumor zzso vaccine zzso significantly better tumor protection than a traditional zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and in combination with chemotherapy could eradicate zzso zzso Moreover, the DC vaccine protected animals from both zzso and zzso zzso tumor cells, indicating that Id is not a major target of the induced tumor zzso Protection was critically dependent upon zzso T cells, with lesser contribution by zzso T zzso zzso zzso whole tumor zzso vaccination did not result in zzso zzso Since zzso whole tumor zzso and Id vaccines appear to target distinct tumor zzso optimal zzso immunity might be achieved by combining these zzso
