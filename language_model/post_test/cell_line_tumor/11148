As the reliable identification of proteins by tandem mass zzso becomes increasingly common, the full characterization of large data sets of proteins remains a difficult zzso Our goal was to survey the zzso of a human zzso zzso cell line in a single set of experiments and present an automated method for the zzso of lists of zzso A downstream application of these data includes the identification of novel zzso and candidate diagnostic markers of zzso zzso Total protein isolated from zzso zzso and nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso zzso cell line was resolved by zzso and the entire gel lanes zzso and analyzed by tandem mass zzso zzso data files were searched against the zzso protein database using the zzso zzso Search results for each zzso fraction were analyzed using zzso and zzso All protein identifications with an error rate of less than zzso were directly exported into excel and analyzed using zzso zzso The Gene zzso molecular function and cell location data were summarized for the identified proteins and results exported as zzso directed zzso zzso A total of zzso unique proteins were identified and fully zzso including numerous proteins that had not been previously characterized in lymphoma, in functional categories such as cell zzso migration, zzso and stress zzso This study demonstrates the utility of currently available zzso tools for the robust identification and zzso of large numbers of proteins in a zzso zzso
