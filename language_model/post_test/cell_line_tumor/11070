zzso cell function can be influenced by nutrition, especially dietary zzso and zzso One class of dietary zzso that is found in meat and dairy products derived from zzso animals is zzso zzso acids zzso We have examined the effects of several zzso zzso on zzso cell zzso zzso was the only zzso that inhibited bovine zzso zzso cell zzso zzso incorporation zzso zzso 35 zzso and this zzso effect was zzso A small decrease zzso in cell number was observed only at the highest concentration zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not exhibit any zzso effects over a zzso zzso concentration zzso zzso and zzso decreased zzso zzso but zzso of cells with either of these antioxidants substantially attenuated the zzso effect of zzso zzso No difference in zzso zzso as measured by the zzso acid zzso for zzso was observed on treatment of zzso cells with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso However, a zzso increase in zzso activity was observed after zzso zzso with zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso effect of this zzso is partially due to an zzso zzso In contrast to the above results with normal zzso cells, these five zzso zzso all inhibited proliferation of the human zzso cell line zzso with the zzso zzso zzso again being the most zzso zzso 60 zzso zzso These results confirm that different zzso zzso have different zzso zzso on the proliferation of normal and zzso zzso
