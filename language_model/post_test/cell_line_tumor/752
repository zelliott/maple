The effects of zzso zzso on proliferation and differentiation of human zzso zzso cell line, zzso were zzso zzso showed that zzso suppressed the proliferation of the zzso cells in a zzso manner, with an zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso or zzso zzso could trigger zzso After treatment with this compound at 100 zzso the growth curve of human zzso cells decreased zzso When treated with 50 and 100 zzso the zzso zzso rate decreased from zzso zzso in the control group to zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and the zzso content decreased from 123 zzso in the control group to 68 and 45 zzso zzso The zzso on the surface of treated cells were also zzso All the above indexes related to cell zzso were alleviated zzso zzso showed that zzso could reverse human zzso zzso zzso zzso characteristics and induce zzso
