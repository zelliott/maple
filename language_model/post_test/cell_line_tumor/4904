Airways function as an innate immune organ against airborne bacteria that are zzso and deposited in zzso One of the mechanisms of host defense is to recruit zzso into airways to clear the zzso zzso zzso cells produce zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to invading zzso In this study we show a signaling zzso on the plasma surface of human airway zzso zzso cells that regulate zzso production in response to a model inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso bacterial zzso First, we show that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are involved in zzso expression by these zzso Second, we show that zzso zzso transforming growth factor zzso mediates zzso zzso Third, we show that tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso production by zzso zzso zzso zzso into soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso we show that dual zzso 1 zzso a zzso of zzso zzso in zzso mediates zzso zzso and zzso expression via generation of zzso oxygen zzso In zzso we describe a signaling pathway, zzso on the surface of airway zzso zzso cells that mediates airway zzso defense against bacterial infection by producing zzso This pathway, which also regulates zzso production in human zzso provides mechanisms for killing foreign organisms and for their zzso
