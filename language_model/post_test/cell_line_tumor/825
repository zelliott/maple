zzso is a downstream zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso It is zzso expressed in normal human zzso including the zzso zzso and loss of expression of zzso has been reported in diverse human zzso However, expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso has not been zzso zzso we studied its expression in four zzso cell lines and 22 zzso by Western zzso and correlated the findings with in zzso zzso activity and zzso In addition, 47 surgically zzso zzso and 29 zzso zzso zzso were evaluated for zzso expression by zzso on zzso zzso tissue zzso and the zzso intensity was correlated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso was present in all four zzso cell lines, and zzso zzso of zzso in comparison to the zzso liver zzso by Western zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso in zzso by Western zzso correlated with zzso zzso by zzso zzso and in zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso in zzso by zzso was associated with serum zzso zzso levels zzso In conclusion, zzso is frequently zzso in zzso and is associated with high serum levels of zzso
