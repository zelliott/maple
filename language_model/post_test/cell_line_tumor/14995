zzso mechanisms underlying zzso zzso and identifying new therapeutic targets are still under zzso We aim to investigate the role of zzso and zzso zzso and examine whether they have any clinical significance in zzso zzso Human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer cells, and other control cells were used in this zzso Western zzso cell zzso invasion zzso and zzso were applied to study the expression levels and functional zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The protein expression was evaluated by zzso using human tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to examine whether these proteins have any clinical significance in patients with zzso zzso The protein expressions of zzso and zzso were detected in most zzso cancer cell lines when compared with normal zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduced the migration and invasion in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed more zzso against zzso and zzso in zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso and normal zzso A positive correlation was established between zzso and both zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and age zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso however, it showed a negative correlation with tumor stage zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso increased tumor migration and invasion in zzso and showed a high expression in zzso compared to those in zzso and normal human zzso demonstrating their role in early stage of zzso zzso zzso was positively correlated with age, but zzso correlated with tumor zzso
