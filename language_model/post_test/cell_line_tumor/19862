zzso acid zzso zzso are involved in diverse cellular zzso such as zzso transcription, zzso and zzso zzso zzso new compounds that inhibit both zzso I and II is very important due to the zzso of the specific zzso to overcome zzso resistance zzso A zzso study was developed, employing the zzso zzso and a set of 64 zzso in order to model the zzso of the zzso I and II, expressed by the zzso of these compounds zzso versus drug-resistant human small cell lung zzso line cell zzso A comparison with other approaches such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso charge indexes, zzso zzso zzso molecular profile, zzso zzso and zzso zzso was carried zzso The mathematical models were obtained by means of the multiple zzso analysis zzso and the variables were selected using the genetic zzso The model relative to the zzso zzso was considered as the best, taking into account its statistical zzso It was able to describe more than zzso of the zzso in the experimental activity once the zzso were zzso
