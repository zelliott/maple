Smoking and chronic stress are well-documented risk factors that are associated with zzso in the development of pancreatic zzso zzso of zzso can activate zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso A zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso pathways in pancreatic cancer zzso Many recent studies have focused on the function of zzso in cancer zzso Thus, we hypothesized that zzso may play a role in pancreatic cancer invasion, and zzso may suppress the pancreatic cancer invasion and zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines express zzso and protein of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso significantly suppressed cell invasion and proliferation in comparison to zzso zzso zzso and control in a zzso invasion zzso and zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso inhibited zzso of zzso factors nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso and zzso response element binding protein zzso as demonstrated by zzso mobility shift zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso also significantly altered vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso suppressed invasion and proliferation by zzso both zzso and zzso which regulate zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso factors, such as zzso zzso and zzso as well as expression of its target zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, zzso zzso suppressed invasion by zzso only the zzso pathway, suggesting that they may be useful as novel preventive and therapeutic strategies for pancreatic zzso
