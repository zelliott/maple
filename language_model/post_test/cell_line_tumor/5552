zzso processes of zzso zzso zzso are highly associated with the breakdown of zzso zzso zzso However, the regular two-dimensional zzso culture system, in which only little zzso is involved, fails to provide a zzso zzso for zzso functional zzso zzso a zzso zzso plays important roles in zzso zzso migration and zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso enhanced the zzso migration and invasion in three-dimensional zzso culture model through affecting the key molecules and zzso involved in the zzso zzso such as focal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We found that, compared with those in zzso cell culture model, the expression of zzso was significantly increased in zzso cell culture model, together with a high production of zzso ( zzso an enhanced expression and zzso of zzso ( zzso and a changed distribution of zzso In addition, the expressions of zzso and zzso which enhance the zzso and migration zzso were also significantly increased in zzso cell culture model ( zzso All the results suggest that the enhanced expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso changed the zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso basement membrane zzso and increased the zzso and invasion zzso of zzso zzso
