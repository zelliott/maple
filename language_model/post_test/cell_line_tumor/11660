In this study, we investigated whether cancer stem cell marker expressing cells can be identified that predict for the response of zzso cancer zzso to zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used to assess in zzso stem cell activity, zzso capacity and radiation zzso zzso tumors were generated using zzso mice to assess in zzso zzso capacity and tumor zzso zzso and fresh zzso biopsy tissue was used to confirm our in zzso and in zzso zzso 

We showed that the zzso zzso of zzso cells exerts a higher proliferation rate and sphere forming potential and is more zzso in zzso when compared to zzso or zzso zzso Moreover, zzso cells formed zzso tumors faster and were often located in hypoxic tumor zzso In a study of archival zzso zzso biopsy material from zzso zzso patients zzso this population could only be identified in 50% zzso of zzso to zzso zzso but never zzso in the complete zzso zzso 

These results warrant further investigation into the possible clinical benefit of zzso as a zzso marker in zzso patients for the response to zzso
