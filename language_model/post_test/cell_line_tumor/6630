Some zzso cancer patients without clinical evidence of zzso spread die as a result of recurrence even after zzso zzso These zzso may arise from zzso tumor cells that are not detected by conventional zzso The goal of this study was to develop a quantitative method for the detection of zzso tumor cells zzso in the peripheral blood zzso and zzso zzso zzso of patients with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso samples from 30 patients and 218 zzso from 14 patients were zzso zzso quantitative analysis was performed using a zzso instrument and a zzso probe for zzso 19 zzso as a marker zzso 

This method resulted in the zzso zzso of 10 to zzso zzso cells zzso breast cancer cell line) per zzso peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was detected in 28 zzso samples and in 62 zzso Only three zzso zzso samples and one zzso zzso sample (from four zzso and 33 zzso (from six zzso were zzso The zzso rate of zzso was higher in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso than in patients with zzso but zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso background expression rate was higher in the zzso of zzso but zzso patients than in zzso of zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso with zzso zzso is a sensitive, specific and rapid method for the detection of zzso in zzso and zzso Additional studies with larger numbers of patients and adequate follow-up would be of zzso
