zzso zzso is a zzso mass protein playing an essential role in zzso of heavy metal zzso Its relation with formation and progression of a zzso disease is discussed in this zzso Here, we propose a new zzso approach for zzso of zzso on zzso zzso after zzso and zzso by using a commercial mouse zzso zzso E9 and zzso chicken zzso The zzso procedure was as zzso We dotted 1 zzso sample volume on zzso membrane and let it to zzso Then, we blocked the membrane surface with zzso zzso in PBS for 30 zzso After that, the membrane was incubated in chicken primary zzso zzso zzso washed, and incubated in zzso secondary zzso zzso with zzso zzso To zzso the interaction, we used zzso Under these conditions, we estimated detection limit as 3 zzso of zzso per 1 zzso The optimal approach was further zzso for detection of zzso level in two human zzso cell lines and in blood serum obtained from children with zzso The results were in good agreement with differential pulse zzso zzso
