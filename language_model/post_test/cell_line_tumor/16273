zzso stress in zzso therapy zzso tumor cells is known to zzso a strong zzso of the expression of heat shock zzso However, the treatment of mouse Lewis lung zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso resulted in the zzso of heat shock protein 70 zzso gene not only in these cells but also in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To investigate whether this phenomenon extends in zzso LLC tumors growing in zzso mice were treated with zzso zzso The tumors and the zzso from the mice were collected at 4, 8, or zzso after therapy for quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain zzso analysis of zzso gene zzso Increased zzso gene expression was detected in both the tumor and liver zzso and was most pronounced at zzso after zzso This effect was inhibited by treatment of host mice with zzso synthesis inhibitor zzso zzso protein levels in the zzso of mice bearing zzso tumors gradually decreased after therapy while serum levels increased at zzso after therapy and then continually zzso The exposure of in zzso zzso LLC cells to zzso and subsequent flow zzso analysis revealed binding of this protein to cells that was dependent on zzso dose and more pronounced with dying than viable zzso Thus, following the induction of tumor injury by zzso zzso can be produced in the liver and zzso as acute phase zzso and released into zzso from where it can be rapidly zzso to damaged tumor tissue to facilitate the disposal of dying zzso
