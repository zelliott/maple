To construct four expression zzso carrying enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso gene under the control of different zzso zzso and to detect and analyze their expressions in zzso cell zzso 

Four zzso promoters were amplified using zzso and they were inserted into the zzso and identified using restriction zzso and sequencing, then cloned into the expression zzso zzso The four zzso plasmids were zzso into human zzso cell line zzso by zzso and the positive cell clones were detected using zzso zzso 

All target fragments were separately obtained and successfully cloned into the expression zzso The expressions of zzso under the control of the four promoters were zzso The expressions of zzso controlled by different promoters had some zzso 

zzso gene zzso under the control of four zzso promoters can be specifically expressed in zzso cell line zzso and different promoters give different results; this may provide another option in gene therapy of liver zzso
