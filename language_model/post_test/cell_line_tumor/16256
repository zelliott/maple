zzso of zzso zzso zzso plays a central role in selective zzso zzso zzso zzso molecular mechanism of action, although studies have indicated that zzso zzso mechanisms zzso It has been suggested that the induction of zzso stress by zzso could be one of the zzso mechanisms held responsible for their zzso role in zzso zzso zzso cells are known for their high requirement of zzso zzso that serves multiple functions within the cells, including nutritional and energy source, as well as one of the precursors for the synthesis of natural zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that one of the mechanisms responsible for zzso zzso properties of zzso and also for their adverse side effects could be dependent on the zzso of zzso zzso 

Human zzso zzso breast cancer cells were treated with different doses of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was monitored by using zzso zzso The effect of zzso and Ral on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels and cellular proliferation was zzso 

zzso and Ral inhibited zzso zzso in a zzso manner through zzso of zzso zzso zzso This effect of the zzso was associated with zzso of zzso production and zzso Treatment of cells with zzso zzso and 17 zzso 2 reversed the effects of Ral and zzso 

Our results indicate that one of the mechanisms of action (and possibly some of the side zzso of zzso and zzso is associated with zzso of cellular zzso zzso zzso stress and induction of zzso
