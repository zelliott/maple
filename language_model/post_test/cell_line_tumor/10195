Little is known about the mechanisms underlying heat zzso zzso of zzso D1 zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso zzso D1 zzso is inhibited by heat zzso The zzso level of zzso D1 decreased under heat shock zzso This zzso of zzso is promoter activity dependent and is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso did not influence the zzso zzso pattern and heat shock did not significantly change the binding activity of zzso zzso can inhibit zzso D1 promoter activity via an zzso zzso manner and its binding activity increased after heat zzso zzso zzso zzso can prevent zzso D1 promoter zzso by zzso zzso we can deduce that zzso zzso promoter activity under heat zzso These results reveal that the mechanism of heat zzso zzso of zzso D1 zzso involves an zzso zzso The data presented provide a new insight into the underlying heat shock zzso of gene zzso
