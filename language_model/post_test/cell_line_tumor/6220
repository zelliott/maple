Drug discovery and therapeutic development for disorders of the central nervous system zzso represents one of the largest zzso markets in modern zzso We have increasingly recognized that the lack of stringent assessment of zzso function during the discovery process has resulted in drug zzso black box warnings, and an urgent need to understand the zzso liability of small molecules in neural zzso Given that the brain is the most energetically demanding organ, even modest zzso in zzso energetic pathways have been shown to impact growth, zzso zzso and the zzso capacity of the zzso In this work, we describe several tools to assess zzso activity of primary zzso cultures and neural cell lines using an acute model of injury induced by oxygen zzso zzso zzso include the measurement of total zzso and zzso zzso assessment of zzso production by zzso zzso as well as viability zzso We also present a modified screening method for assessing zzso zzso of immortalized cell lines using zzso zzso
