zzso is a putative tumor zzso located at zzso at which frequent zzso loss has been observed in several human zzso To explore the candidacy of zzso as a zzso of gastric zzso we analyzed the expression and zzso status of zzso in gastric zzso and cell zzso zzso transcript was expressed in all normal and benign tumor zzso zzso but zzso or very low in zzso zzso cancer cell lines and zzso zzso primary zzso Loss or reduction of zzso expression was zzso and correlated with stage and grade of zzso While zzso loss or zzso zzso of the gene were zzso its expression was restored in tumor cells by zzso treatment and zzso zzso of 23 zzso sites in the promoter region showed a tight association with altered zzso zzso or stable expression of zzso led to a zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso of tumor cells, and strongly suppresses colony forming ability and zzso tumor zzso In addition, zzso elevated zzso sensitivity of tumor cells to zzso agents, such as zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso increased the protein stability of zzso and expression of zzso target zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso while zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso were abolished by blockade of zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso is a novel tumor zzso whose zzso zzso contributes to the zzso progression of gastric tumors, in part, through attenuated zzso response to zzso
