The early growth of zzso breast cancer in the brain often occurs through vessel zzso and is independent of zzso zzso of the existing zzso is an important step in the evolution of co-opting zzso into zzso solid tumor zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether phase contrast zzso an intrinsic source of contrast exquisitely sensitive to the magnetic zzso properties of zzso zzso could detect vascular changes occurring independent of zzso in a rat model of breast cancer zzso to the zzso Twelve nude rats were administered zzso zzso zzso breast cancer cells through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the brain was performed weekly until zzso disease was zzso The results demonstrated that images of the signal phase zzso under the receiver operating characteristic curve, zzso were more sensitive than zzso zzso echo magnitude images zzso under the receiver operating characteristic curve, zzso to zzso brain zzso The difference between the two techniques was probably the result of the zzso effects of zzso on the magnitude of the zzso A region of interest analysis revealed that vascular abnormalities detected with phase contrast zzso preceded tumor zzso measured with zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso size was correlated with zzso zzso p zzso but phase contrast was independent of tumor size zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso zzso cells zzso by tumor cells were significantly zzso but less dense, relative to the normal brain zzso Although zzso vessels were vascular zzso growth zzso vessels within larger tumor masses were vascular zzso growth zzso In conclusion, phase contrast zzso is believed to be sensitive to vascular zzso in co-opting brain tumor zzso independent of zzso zzso and may therefore aid in zzso studies of zzso tumors or in the monitoring of continued tumor growth following zzso zzso Published zzso This article is a US Government work and is in the public domain in the zzso
