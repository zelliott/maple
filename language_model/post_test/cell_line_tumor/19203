zzso a DNA zzso agent, is currently undergoing clinical evaluation for cancer zzso Because zzso has been shown to increase survival rates of patients with zzso zzso when given combined with radiation, and there is conflicting zzso data concerning the zzso effects of zzso we further investigated the possible zzso enhancement of zzso 

The effects of zzso on the in zzso zzso of zzso (a human zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso of a human breast zzso cell lines was evaluated using zzso zzso DNA damage and repair were evaluated using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso catastrophe was measured using nuclear zzso Growth delay was used to evaluate the effects of zzso on in zzso zzso tumor zzso 

Exposure of each cell line to zzso for 1 h before zzso resulted in an increase in zzso with dose enhancement factors at a surviving fraction of zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso or on the zzso of the zzso cell cycle zzso As a measure of DNA double strand breaks, zzso zzso were determined as a function of time after the zzso + zzso zzso The number of zzso zzso per cell was significantly greater at 24 h after the combined zzso compared with the individual zzso zzso catastrophe, measured at 72 zzso was also significantly increased in cells receiving the zzso + zzso combination compared with the single zzso In zzso studies revealed that zzso administration to mice bearing zzso tumor zzso resulted in a greater than additive increase in zzso tumor growth delay with a dose enhancement factor of zzso 

These results indicate that zzso can enhance tumor cell zzso in zzso and in zzso and suggest that this effect involves an zzso of DNA repair leading to an increase in zzso zzso
