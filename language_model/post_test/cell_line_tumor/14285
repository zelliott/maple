To study the effect of small interference zzso on zzso zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso in cervical cancer zzso 

The specific zzso and zzso zzso zzso by in zzso zzso The cell activity was detected by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to determine the most suitable zzso then cells were zzso into zzso cervical cancer cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso level was examined by zzso zzso and the cell cycles were analyzed by flow zzso 

The activity of the zzso cells had an obvious suppression after zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared with the contrast of zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso level was zzso zzso zzso before zzso decreased to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso evidently after zzso at 24, 48, 72 zzso The expression of zzso zzso level was zzso zzso zzso before zzso and decreased to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso at 24, 48, 72 zzso The number of cells in zzso phase was increased after zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso S phase was declined from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and they were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso exists in zzso cells, and its effect has zzso
