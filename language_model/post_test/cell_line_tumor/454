Previous studies have suggested that the zzso zzso gene zzso of the Atlantic zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso upon reporter gene expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso and fish zzso and zzso cells in zzso zzso and deletion analyses identified a putative zzso element zzso between 109 and 90 zzso upstream of the major start zzso This zzso is characterized by the sequence zzso spaced by 8 zzso from a perfect zzso zzso and both sites are necessary for hypoxic induction of reporter gene expression in zzso and fish zzso This zzso differs from the zzso sequence at one zzso position that is zzso among zzso from a wide range of zzso zzso In fish cells, zzso induction of reporter gene expression driven by this zzso occurred at the lowest oxygen level tested zzso took 48 h to 96 zzso and was independent of zzso concentration (between zzso and 25 zzso Under all conditions tested, hypoxic induction of gene expression was lower in zzso cells than in zzso suggesting a potential zzso in zzso signaling in zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso promoter contains a novel zzso that is capable of driving reporter gene expression in a zzso and zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso
