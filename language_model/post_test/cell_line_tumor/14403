zzso of Ras is one of the most common abnormalities in acute zzso zzso In experimental models, Ras zzso zzso zzso which is characteristic of zzso however, the mechanism through which it zzso zzso is poorly zzso In zzso zzso cells, Ras zzso terminal zzso zzso thereby indefinitely extending their zzso zzso Ras also strongly promotes the sensitivity of these cells to zzso zzso factor zzso Using this model, we have dissected the signaling elements downstream of Ras to determine their relative contribution to the zzso of zzso zzso expressing Ras zzso selectively zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso did not significantly affect differentiation or zzso capacity, whereas zzso (which selectively activates zzso zzso proliferation and blocked zzso development in a manner similar to that of zzso zzso expression of zzso active versions of these zzso confirmed the overriding importance of Ral zzso zzso exchange zzso zzso expressing Ras demonstrated zzso of zzso which itself was able to exactly mimic the zzso of zzso including hypersensitivity to zzso zzso dominant negative Ral promoted spontaneous zzso zzso zzso in turn, appears to influence differentiation through multiple zzso These data show, for the first time, the importance of Ral in regulating differentiation and zzso in zzso zzso
