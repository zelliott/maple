zzso zinc zzso is strictly regulated by zinc binding proteins and zinc zzso In the present study, we zzso in a first global view the expression of all characterized human zinc exporters zzso in different zzso zzso in response to zinc supplementation and depletion and analyzed their influence on zzso in the zzso zinc zzso We found that zzso is the most regulated zinc zzso Furthermore, we discovered that zzso is localized in the plasma membrane similar to zzso zzso is most highly expressed in zzso zzso after treatment with zzso and is responsible for the measured decrease of zzso zinc content after high zinc zzso In addition, we found that zzso zzso and zzso in zzso as well as zzso and zzso in zzso are zzso in response to cellular zinc zzso Those zinc exporters are all localized in the zzso network, and this type of regulation explains the observed zinc increase in both cell types after zzso of their expression during zinc zzso and, zzso high zinc zzso Furthermore, we zzso for the first time, the expression of zzso in peripheral blood zzso which varied strongly between zzso While zzso was not zzso zzso and zzso were expressed at low zzso Further on, the amount of expression was higher in primary cells than in cell zzso These data provide insight into the regulation of zzso zinc zzso in cells of the immune system and may explain the variable effects of zinc zzso on different zzso zzso
