Hodgkin's zzso zzso is characterized by the presence of zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso in a background of inflammatory zzso Free zzso and zzso stress generated in the inflammatory zzso could cause DNA damage, thus providing a basis for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes are responsive genes for DNA damage, therefore the potential involvement of the zzso gene in zzso zzso was examined in 8 zzso cell lines and 7 clinical zzso zzso zzso were detected in 6 out of 8 zzso zzso Most zzso transcripts observed were zzso zzso which may have resulted from zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts were also detected in 3 out of 7 clinical zzso Three zzso del zzso 4, deletion zzso zzso and zzso of 137 zzso in zzso zzso were commonly observed in both cell lines and clinical zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso except del zzso 4 showed a zzso in repair for DNA zzso breaks zzso and zzso break zzso as well as exhibiting a zzso in zzso zzso These findings suggested the role of zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso
