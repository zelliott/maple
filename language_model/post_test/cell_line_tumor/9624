To assess zzso expression in advanced human prostate cancer zzso cell lines, the role of zzso in zzso migration, and zzso potential of PC cells, and efficacy of zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment on PC cells in zzso and tumor growth in zzso 

zzso advanced human PC cell lines zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated for zzso zzso Several zzso cell line clones expressing various levels of zzso were isolated, their zzso migration capacity, and in zzso proliferation as well as survival following zzso treatment were zzso zzso and proliferation capacity of these clones in zzso and efficacy of zzso treatment on tumor growth were estimated by zzso of subcutaneous tumors developed in nude zzso 

PC cell lines studied express zzso Both zzso and zzso cell lines express high zzso zzso only 50% of zzso cells express zzso with large zzso zzso zzso highly expressing zzso showed increased cell zzso migration, and proliferation rate in zzso and enhanced growth in zzso compared to clones with low zzso zzso zzso treatment inhibited the growth of cells expressing high but not low zzso levels in zzso and decreased the growth of subcutaneous tumors in nude mice generated by zzso highly expressing zzso 

High expression of zzso in prostate cancer zzso cell clones correlated with high zzso and migration capacity and high zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on cell proliferation and on subcutaneous tumor growth suggests zzso potential as a target for molecular zzso zzso
