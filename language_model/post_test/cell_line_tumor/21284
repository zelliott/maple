Resistance to zzso is a hallmark of cancer and zzso with aggressiveness of tumors and poor zzso The zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in the genesis of zzso cancer by mechanisms not fully zzso zzso Previous studies have linked regulation of zzso zzso in bone to zzso zzso As zzso also serves as a decoy zzso for tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso might play a role in zzso resistance to zzso in zzso cancer zzso 

zzso analysis and functional studies in human zzso cancer cell lines and determination of expression in primary tumors and zzso from patients with zzso zzso 

We found production of zzso in zzso cancer cells to be regulated by zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso cancer cells caused resistance to zzso Similarly, zzso of zzso in medium of cultivated cells caused resistance to zzso and this could be reverted by removal of zzso Furthermore, zzso levels were significantly increased in serum of patients with advanced zzso 

We conclude that the zzso zzso contributes to zzso and cancer cell survival by driving expression of zzso zzso of the survival factor zzso might provide zzso cancer cells with an essential growth advantage and contribute to cell invasion and zzso zzso of zzso expression might offer a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of patients with zzso tumors zzso zzso and make these tumors sensitive to zzso zzso
