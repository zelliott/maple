Two different human diseases, zzso zzso zzso and zzso disease, result from zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Although events involved in zzso zzso and zzso synthesis are well established and pivotal in zzso signaling and degradation, zzso involved in zzso degradation and their roles in trafficking are incompletely zzso Here, we dissect the functions of the zzso and zzso zzso and establish how they contribute to zzso zzso zzso By mimicking loss of function in disease through zzso depletion of the zzso excess zzso accumulates on early zzso and late zzso zzso Surprisingly, the increased zzso blocks the zzso of zzso growth factor receptors from early or late zzso suggesting that the zzso of signaling receptors in distinct zzso may contribute to the unique disease zzso when zzso or zzso are zzso We further demonstrate that direct zzso binding to the type III zzso zzso complex zzso leads to zzso zzso The zzso zzso interaction also zzso interaction of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso Thus, unique molecular complexes control zzso and zzso zzso and locally regulate zzso on discrete zzso zzso thereby providing a molecular rationale for related human zzso and zzso
