The development of novel engineered zzso materials is a rapidly emerging technology with many applications in medicine and zzso In zzso and in zzso studies have suggested many deleterious effects of carbon zzso exposure including zzso zzso release of zzso zzso pulmonary fibrosis, zzso oxygen damage, cellular zzso DNA zzso zzso and errors in zzso number as well as zzso zzso zzso The physical properties of the carbon zzso make respiratory exposure to workers likely during the production or use of commercial zzso Many of the investigations of the zzso of carbon zzso have focused on zzso oxygen zzso DNA zzso however, the long thin zzso carbon zzso have a striking similarity to cellular zzso The similarity of carbon zzso to zzso suggests a potential to interact with cellular zzso such as the zzso zzso as well as the motor proteins that separate the zzso during cell zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso would result in zzso zzso and zzso divisions of zzso The resulting zzso is a key mechanism in the potential zzso of carbon zzso
