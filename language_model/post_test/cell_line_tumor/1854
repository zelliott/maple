This work describes the zzso characterization of a novel in zzso prostate cancer model system, the zzso zzso human zzso cancer zzso cell zzso The model is composed of three cell lines representing the three progressive cancer states found in zzso zzso zzso and zzso The cell lines were evaluated for differential protein expression between states using two zzso zzso zzso separation followed by mass spectral zzso The proteins from cellular extracts were first separated using zzso primary separation based on their zzso points and zzso The resulting zzso zzso were applied to liquid zzso zzso zzso separation for mass determination and protein identification based on zzso database zzso Over 200 proteins that change expression over the course of progression of this in zzso prostate cancer model were discovered during the comparative analysis of the three cell zzso The importance of these proteins on prostate cancer progression remains to be zzso with further zzso The combination of the two zzso zzso separation and mass spectral identifications was used to successfully analyze differential protein expression between multiple cell zzso
