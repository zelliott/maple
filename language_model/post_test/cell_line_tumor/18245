A key strategy to achieve regulated gene expression in higher zzso is to prevent illegitimate zzso zzso by imposing robust control on the dismissal of zzso Here, we report that many signaling zzso including zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso are subjected to a zzso zzso based on distinct zzso zzso Gene zzso requires the release of both zzso and zzso repression, through the coordinate action of two highly related exchange factors, the zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso that license zzso and degradation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso their function and differential specificity reside in only five specific zzso zzso site differences, regulated by direct zzso at the level of the promoter, as exemplified by the role of zzso in zzso dismissal of zzso Thus, our data reveal a strategy of zzso repression zzso in which dedicated exchange factors serve as sensors for zzso dismissal of distinct zzso with specificity imposed by upstream signaling zzso
