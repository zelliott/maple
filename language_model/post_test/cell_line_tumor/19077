zzso is a zzso inhibitor for the treatment of zzso multiple myeloma zzso zzso of resistance to zzso are zzso zzso cell zzso zzso is an zzso zzso which protects tumor cells against spontaneous and zzso zzso In zzso specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso Here, we examined the role of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso but not zzso triggers zzso generation of a 28 zzso zzso in several zzso cell lines, including zzso zzso zzso transient zzso of zzso cells with a previously reported 28 zzso zzso fragment, but not with the zzso fragment, zzso zzso zzso both zzso of full-length zzso zzso as well as zzso generation of zzso zzso zzso contribute to zzso cell zzso To verify further these findings, we next compared effects triggered by zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso embryonic zzso zzso Our results show that zzso but not zzso or zzso triggers zzso zzso in zzso but not zzso zzso and zzso zzso phase zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso signs of zzso Taken together, these results support an important role of zzso and a zzso zzso in zzso cell death in general, and in zzso in zzso To prevent zzso of zzso in patients treated with zzso we therefore recommend the combination of zzso with agents that induce zzso cell death independent of zzso
