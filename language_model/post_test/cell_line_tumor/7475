zzso zzso composite and zzso zzso were employed to sensitive zzso zzso strategy for the specific detection of zzso cancer cells based on a portable zzso tin oxide zzso zzso composite was zzso using a facile zzso method, and then applied to improve the zzso performance due to the unique hollow structure of zzso zzso and the superior properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso was applied to this specific detection of zzso cancer zzso And the concentration of zzso cells was measured with a low detection limit of 58 cells zzso and a wide linear range of zzso cells zzso through the decrease in zzso intensity resulting from the increase in zzso zzso when specifically recognized with zzso zzso Excellent discrimination against target and analogous cells was demonstrated, indicating the high selectivity of the proposed cell zzso Our work also demonstrated a sensitive, stable and low zzso approach for early and accurate detection of cancer zzso
