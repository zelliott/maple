zzso has been investigated for several decades for its potential role in breast cancer zzso Previous researches have shown that zzso and zzso zzso are the major species circulating in the blood after zzso zzso It was hypothesized that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso present in breast zzso would catalyze the zzso between the zzso and the zzso in zzso zzso our aim was to investigate how zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso in zzso cells and to determine the effects of metabolism on their zzso actions using cultured breast cell zzso As expected, zzso zzso the cell growth of breast cancer cells zzso and zzso zzso at lower zzso but inhibited their growth at higher zzso It showed low activities in a zzso cell line zzso due to the absence of zzso zzso was extensively zzso to zzso by zzso and to zzso by zzso while it was poorly zzso by zzso zzso displayed weak stimulation activity in breast cancer zzso zzso underwent extensive metabolism in zzso and zzso but not in zzso The zzso effects of zzso on zzso and zzso were associated with its zzso to zzso in these zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso were not zzso by these three cells and had no effects on their zzso In conclusion, production of phase II zzso did not affect the proliferation effect of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso was correlated to the apparent zzso effects of zzso in breast cancer zzso
