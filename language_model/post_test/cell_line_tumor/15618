zzso zzso is a novel zzso that can induce proliferation of activated T cells and maturation of natural killer zzso zzso We therefore examined whether expression of the zzso gene in tumor cells could generate zzso zzso zzso colon zzso zzso 26 cells that were zzso with the mouse zzso gene zzso zzso were rejected in zzso mice and the mice subsequently acquired protective zzso The growth of zzso zzso tumors developed in nude mice was retarded compared with that of parent tumors, and this growth suppression was not observed in nude mice that were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso cells from the mice that had rejected zzso zzso cells showed zzso activity to zzso 26 but not to irrelevant tumor cells, and produced larger amounts of zzso upon stimulation with zzso zzso 26 zzso zzso cells from zzso zzso but not zzso mice had zzso activity to zzso zzso These data suggest that expression of zzso in tumors zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
