The zzso zzso factors control proliferation and zzso in different cell zzso Their activity is regulated by zzso zzso mainly by the zzso pathway, which controls nuclear export and zzso We show that zzso is highly expressed in normal zzso center B cells as well as in zzso zzso including zzso lymphoma, diffuse large zzso lymphoma, zzso zzso tissue zzso lymphoma, zzso chronic zzso zzso and mantle cell zzso In contrast, in 31 of 32 classical zzso zzso zzso cases, zzso and zzso cells were zzso zzso zzso cells of zzso zzso zzso zzso were negative in 14 of 20 zzso zzso was zzso in zzso cell lines, whereas it was expressed in zzso zzso cell lines at levels comparable with normal B zzso zzso expression of a zzso active zzso induced zzso in zzso cell lines and blocked zzso accompanied with zzso arrest in the zzso zzso We found that, in zzso cell lines, zzso is zzso by multiple mechanisms, including zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso repression contributes to zzso zzso
