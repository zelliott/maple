With the aim of identifying more novel natural zzso derivatives produced by the zzso A and B producing strain zzso zzso strain zzso a large-scale zzso zzso zzso of the strain was carried zzso As a result, five new zzso zzso zzso were isolated from the zzso zzso Their structures were established as zzso of zzso A zzso B zzso D zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso by extensive zzso analysis and chemical zzso zzso results showed that compounds 1 and 2 had a weaker zzso activity than did zzso zzso
