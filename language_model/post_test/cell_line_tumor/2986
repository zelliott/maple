The zzso of zzso drugs to targeting zzso such as zzso is a promising method that can increase the efficacy of chemotherapy and reduce the overall toxicity of the zzso In this study, we zzso link the zzso agent zzso zzso to the DNA zzso zzso which was selected by the zzso zzso In doing so, we expected that this zzso zzso would specifically kill the target zzso zzso acute zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, but with minimal toxicity towards zzso zzso The results demonstrated that the zzso zzso possesses many of the properties of the zzso zzso including high binding affinity zzso zzso and the capability to be efficiently zzso by target zzso Moreover, due to the specific zzso method, the zzso linkage connecting the zzso zzso can be zzso inside the zzso zzso zzso Cell viability tests demonstrate that the zzso zzso not only possess potency similar to zzso zzso but also have the required molecular specificity that is lacking in most current targeted drug delivery zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso cell lines could also be inhibited by linking the drug with the zzso thus, the zzso are selective for cells that express higher amounts of target zzso Compared to the less effective zzso these zzso zzso make targeted chemotherapy more feasible with drugs having various zzso When combined with the large number of recently created DNA zzso that specifically target a wide variety of cancer cells, this zzso method will have broad implications for targeted drug zzso
