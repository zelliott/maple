Although targeting of the death receptors zzso zzso and zzso still appears a suitable zzso strategy, the limited clinical responses to zzso soluble zzso zzso inducing zzso zzso zzso novel zzso with improved zzso zzso zzso zzso induction by a zzso TRAIL zzso zzso could be enhanced zzso by generation of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso By forcing zzso of zzso based on zzso zzso zzso we obtained a targeted zzso composed predominantly of zzso zzso exceeding the activity of zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso colon zzso zzso Increased activity of zzso was also demonstrated on zzso cells, suggesting that, in addition to zzso zzso equivalent to an at least zzso assembly of standard TRAIL per zzso enhances zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso such as the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso was effective at zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso was well tolerated and displayed superior zzso activity in mouse zzso zzso tumor zzso Our results show that both targeting and controlled zzso of zzso fusion proteins provides a strategy to enforce zzso zzso together with retained tumor selectivity and good in zzso zzso
