We examined the effects according to the extent of surgical wound mimicking zzso or zzso on zzso cancer growth in an zzso mouse zzso 

To mimic surgery effects, we performed zzso or zzso on zzso nude mice under zzso inhalation at four days after tumor cell zzso For the zzso model, we performed zzso with zzso by inserting three zzso 

Mice in the zzso group had significantly lower tumor weight compared to mice in the zzso group ( zzso In the immediate zzso period, serum levels of vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso were significantly lower in the zzso zzso 

These results indicate that a minimal surgical wound such as that on zzso appears to induce little surgical stress on enhancing tumor growth compared to zzso in an zzso cancer animal model, possibly because it minimally influences the zzso of zzso and zzso
