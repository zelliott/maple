zzso studies based on a zzso zzso were performed with cultured melanoma cells zzso with zzso added to normal blood and subjected to separation and recognition zzso zzso cells zzso were isolated on zzso zzso and melanoma cells were separated from zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were then recognized by measuring zzso activity zzso and zzso zzso It was found that: zzso of zzso cells present in zzso did not exceed zzso zzso further recovery of zzso cells after separation from zzso did not exceed zzso zzso the overall recovery of zzso cells did not exceed zzso zzso the entire procedure was able to reliably detect as few as 30 zzso cells added to normal blood, providing a zzso signal significantly higher than that found in absence of melanoma zzso These results furnish the technical bases for developing a tumor detection zzso in the blood of melanoma zzso
