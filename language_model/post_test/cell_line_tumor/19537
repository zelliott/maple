Based on a zzso mouse model and a few expression studies, zzso is regarded as a zzso gene crucial for the development of the zzso nervous zzso This gene can undergo zzso or deregulation, giving rise to zzso acute zzso zzso The present report is focused on the identification of elements and factors playing a role in the zzso zzso expression regulation and therefore likely to be involved in cancer zzso In particular, after identifying the zzso start points, we have made use of in zzso zzso zzso to show that the zzso region of the gene is necessary for the zzso promoter activity in cell lines from different zzso By zzso zzso two tandem zzso boxes have been localized as critical elements of this zzso In zzso zzso zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso have indicated that nuclear factor Y zzso recognizes these sites in all the analyzed cell zzso The zzso role of such an interaction has been confirmed by a zzso version of the zzso zzso factor that has turned out to decrease both in zzso zzso promoter activity and zzso amount of zzso Finally, a consistent in zzso zzso expression impairment was also achieved after zzso zzso zzso The full characterization of the zzso zzso regulation will ultimately provide crucial elements to define the involvement of this gene in zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso
