The stem zzso zzso factor zzso regulates tumor proliferation and zzso but its role in tumor migration and invasion is still zzso Here, we compared zzso expression in zzso and zzso cells, two breast cancer cell lines with similar zzso origins, but distinct invasive and zzso zzso We found zzso cells to express very high levels of zzso while no obvious expression was detected in zzso zzso We then zzso zzso expression using small interfering zzso zzso to explore its effects on migration and zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso in zzso cells improved their migration and invasion zzso zzso zzso and western blots showed that zzso expression zzso and zzso muscle zzso expression increased with zzso zzso which suggests that zzso transition zzso zzso A potent zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso expression in both zzso and time zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso expression of two major components of zzso zzso entry channels zzso zzso and zzso and enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked the zzso influx and rescued the zzso initiated by zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso promotes invasion and zzso in breast cancer cells by inducing zzso This effect may be related to zzso enhancement of zzso zzso
