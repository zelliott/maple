A mechanism used by zzso virus zzso for in zzso transformation of B cells into zzso cell lines zzso is zzso of the zzso pathway, which is largely zzso by the zzso zzso membrane protein 1 zzso zzso is zzso with zzso in many zzso zzso zzso Since zzso of zzso leads to zzso of zzso zzso and zzso cell lines, we sought to determine whether zzso alone, or in combination with other viral zzso is responsible for initiating zzso zzso in these cells, thereby playing a role in cell zzso We found that suppression of zzso by zzso interference results in zzso of zzso zzso and induction of zzso zzso zzso of zzso also resulted in comparable decrease of zzso activity and zzso We report that zzso protein controls the expression of zzso zzso which in turn is necessary for signaling by zzso Our data contrast with previous studies showing that zzso zzso can signal in the absence of zzso or zzso and demonstrate that both zzso and zzso are required for survival in naturally infected zzso cells and zzso These results also support zzso zzso and zzso as potential therapeutic targets in a subset of zzso zzso zzso
