zzso plays a zzso role in inflammatory zzso diseases zzso which are characterized by altered zzso production and increased zzso zzso cell zzso In zzso studies suggest that zzso zzso of zzso zzso is an essential regulatory zzso for zzso survival pathways in zzso zzso cell zzso Here we use a zzso mouse model to study the role of zzso in regulating zzso cell fate during zzso zzso We show that zzso and its target signaling pathways are activated in inflamed colon zzso Loss of zzso increases zzso to chronic colitis and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, disruption of zzso expression enhances zzso zzso in mouse colon zzso cells and is associated with a failure to activate zzso signals including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These effects are reversed by zzso but not zzso zzso We conclude that zzso has an essential protective role in the zzso zzso cell during inflammation through zzso of cell survival zzso
