zzso zzso plays important roles in the zzso system, and its zzso is involved in a variety of human zzso However, the roles and implications of zzso in zzso zzso zzso remain zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso was significantly zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso of zzso patients, and the low zzso expression in zzso was correlated with tumor zzso an elevated risk of zzso zzso and a low survival zzso Both the zzso zzso protein and the enhanced expression of zzso significantly inhibited zzso cell growth in zzso and zzso in zzso Further study showed that zzso suppressed cell proliferation via its zzso activity of zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso could zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso B pathways in zzso cells and thereby increase the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and lead to zzso degradation and zzso D1 zzso In addition, increased zzso expression could remarkably sensitize zzso cells to zzso drugs zzso zzso and zzso 

For the first time, we describe the function of zzso as a tumor growth zzso in regulating cell zzso the relevant signaling zzso and the drug sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso is a promising independent zzso predictor for zzso recurrence and the survival of zzso zzso These findings provide new insights into potential strategies for drug discovery and improved zzso zzso
