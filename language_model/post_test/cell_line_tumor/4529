In zzso models, transgenic zzso tumor vaccines overcome many of the limitations of zzso zzso by producing the sequence of zzso attraction followed by proliferation of tumor zzso zzso The safety and zzso effects of this approach in humans were tested in 7 patients with relapsed or zzso zzso They each received up to 8 subcutaneous injections of a vaccine combining zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells in a zzso zzso zzso events were limited to grade 1 or 2 localized reactions in all patients, pain in 3 patients, and fever in 3 zzso zzso site zzso revealed increased zzso caused by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells with a decrease in zzso cells from the first to the second zzso zzso vaccine was associated with increased tumor recognition as measured by zzso zzso spot zzso Two patients had zzso zzso responses and 3 had zzso zzso zzso Only 1 patient received all 8 injections, 1 patient stopped the study early, and all other patients progressed before completion of the zzso zzso zzso tumor cell vaccines combining transgenic zzso with zzso seem to have little toxicity in humans and can induce an zzso immune zzso In this setting, the immune response was insufficient to overcome active zzso zzso
