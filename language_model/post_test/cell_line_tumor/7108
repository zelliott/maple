A new zzso resonance energy transfer zzso homogeneous zzso to evaluate the presence of zzso compounds has been developed and zzso The zzso is based on the direct evaluation of zzso zzso zzso zzso as a result of zzso compound zzso zzso zzso was genetically fused either to zzso zzso zzso or to enhanced yellow fluorescent protein zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso brings zzso and zzso molecules close enough for an energy zzso An in zzso zzso zzso was first developed using zzso fusion proteins zzso and zzso expressed in zzso coli to evaluate and zzso the zzso performances of the zzso in the presence of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso quantitative zzso was then developed by zzso the two fusion proteins in live zzso zzso The zzso can be performed in zzso zzso format with a zzso incubation and allows detection with adequate accuracy and precision of as low as 1 zzso of zzso zzso This new zzso zzso zzso zzso allows evaluating the zzso activity and synthetic zzso from biological and environmental zzso
