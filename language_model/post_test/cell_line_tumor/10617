Recent studies indicate that interactions between leukemia cells and the bone zzso zzso zzso promote leukemia cell survival and zzso resistance to zzso zzso There is evidence that zzso zzso contains hypoxic areas that zzso survival advantage to zzso zzso In the present study we investigated whether zzso in zzso zzso contributes to the protective role of the zzso zzso We observed a marked expansion of hypoxic zzso areas in zzso mice zzso with acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso with this finding, we found that zzso promotes zzso in various ALL derived cell zzso These findings suggest to employ zzso zzso to eliminate leukemia cells within hypoxic zzso Using several zzso models, we demonstrated that administration of the zzso zzso mustard, zzso prolonged survival and decreased leukemia burden of zzso mice injected with primary acute zzso leukemia zzso Together, these findings strongly suggest that targeting zzso in zzso zzso is feasible and may significantly improve leukemia zzso
