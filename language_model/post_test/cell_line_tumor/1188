zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso essential for the survival of zzso We have reported that zzso is essential but not sufficient for the synergistic induction of zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso To further identify zzso factors and zzso that participate in the induction of zzso we used zzso affinity zzso to isolate potential zzso interacting zzso zzso zzso from the zzso affinity column were subjected to zzso analysis and verified by Western zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso is the most abundant single protein zzso zzso studies suggest a physical interaction between zzso and zzso zzso To verify the role of zzso on zzso gene transcription, cells were zzso with zzso expressing zzso in sense or zzso orientation as well as interference zzso The results indicate that an increase zzso expression leads to increased zzso gene zzso in a zzso zzso zzso with this, expression of small interfering zzso for zzso leads to zzso of zzso gene zzso but does not have any effect on the expression of zzso suggesting that the effect of zzso is zzso These results identify zzso as a partner of the zzso zzso complex in the induction of zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso
