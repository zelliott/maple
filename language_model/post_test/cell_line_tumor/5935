zzso zzso which is one of tumor promoting agents stimulates cell migration ability of several tumor zzso In the present study, we investigated whether zzso acid zzso receptors are involved in cell migration of rat liver cells zzso by zzso The rat liver zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells were treated by zzso for zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso genes in those cells were measured by real-time reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso The expressions of the zzso zzso zzso gene were significantly elevated in zzso and zzso cells treated by zzso but not zzso and zzso zzso In cell migration zzso zzso treatment showed markedly high cell migration in both zzso The zzso with zzso of zzso protein suppressed those migration zzso We next generated the zzso zzso cells from zzso cells and investigated the effect on cell zzso Interestingly, the cell migration of the zzso cells was not zzso by zzso These results suggest that zzso cell migration of rat liver cells may be mainly dependent on the zzso zzso
