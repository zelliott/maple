The death zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso regulate zzso of zzso cells, thereby functioning as a critical component of the host cancer zzso zzso To evade zzso zzso cancer cells often zzso zzso to acquire an zzso zzso which is a hallmark of zzso human zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso resistance is of critical importance in zzso cancer therapy and zzso In this study, we demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso and zzso cooperate to zzso zzso expression in zzso human colon zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulted in effective zzso of the zzso human colon zzso cells to zzso zzso Using an experimental zzso mouse model, we further demonstrated that zzso and zzso cooperate to suppress colon zzso zzso Analysis of zzso lung zzso revealed that a large portion of zzso zzso T cells are zzso and zzso and zzso zzso efficacy was significantly decreased in zzso mice compared with zzso mice, suggesting a critical role for zzso in zzso and zzso tumor suppression in zzso zzso with their function in zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly increased the efficacy of zzso adoptive transfer zzso in an experimental zzso mouse zzso Thus, our data suggest that combined zzso of chemotherapy to sensitize the tumor cell to zzso zzso and zzso zzso is an effective approach for the suppression of colon cancer zzso
