zzso zzso as zzso of gene expression have been described to display both zzso and zzso zzso Although their role has been studied in different tumor types, little is known about how they regulate nuclear factor zzso zzso signaling in breast zzso Here, we performed an unbiased whole zzso zzso zzso screen to identify novel zzso of zzso zzso in breast zzso The screen identified 13 zzso families whose members induced consistent effects on zzso zzso Among those, the zzso family inhibited zzso signaling through direct targeting of zzso and thus strongly reduced expression and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso With a combination of in zzso and in zzso approaches, we propose a zzso role of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso both in zzso cell invasion and in zzso zzso of highly invasive zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso did not affect their zzso zzso zzso profiling of zzso cells on zzso of zzso members revealed a strong zzso of transforming growth zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso role of zzso can be attributed to direct suppression of zzso as the zzso of zzso zzso the effects of zzso zzso on suppression of zzso expression of the zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 4 as well as tumor cell invasion, in zzso and in zzso A negative correlation between zzso and zzso expression was observed in zzso zzso negative zzso breast cancer patients but not in the zzso positive zzso zzso zzso decreased expression of zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso specifically in zzso zzso Taken together, our findings reveal that zzso family has a zzso role in zzso breast cancer by acting as a link between the zzso and zzso pathways and may thus contribute to the interplay of tumor zzso zzso and zzso
