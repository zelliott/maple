zzso produces good responses in solid zzso including small cell lung cancer zzso but this is limited by the development of zzso zzso is reported to show activity against some zzso zzso but there is little known about zzso in zzso and there are no reports of zzso resistant zzso cell zzso Studies of drug resistance mainly focus on the cellular resistance mechanisms rather than how the cells develop zzso This study examines the development of zzso and zzso resistance in zzso human zzso cells in response to repeated treatment with clinically relevant doses of zzso or zzso for either 4 days or 2 zzso zzso with 200 zzso zzso or 400 zzso zzso for 4 days produced zzso zzso and zzso zzso that showed low level zzso zzso resistance after eight zzso zzso with 1,000 zzso zzso or 2,000 zzso zzso for 2 h also produced zzso however, these were not zzso resistant suggesting shorter treatment zzso of drug may be more zzso zzso survived the first five treatments without any increase in resistance, by arresting their growth for a period and then zzso The period of growth arrest was reduced after the sixth treatment and the zzso and zzso zzso showed a reduced growth arrest in response to zzso and zzso treatment suggesting that zzso zzso initially protected against drug treatment and this was further zzso and became part of the resistance zzso of these zzso zzso dose escalation produced more surviving zzso than zzso dose escalation but neither set of zzso were associated with increased resistance as determined by zzso zzso zzso also suggesting the involvement of regrowth zzso The resistant zzso showed no change in platinum zzso or zzso levels even though the zzso zzso was more sensitive to zzso zzso zzso The zzso cells were zzso to zzso demonstrating that zzso does not have activity against low level zzso zzso Relative to the zzso cells, the zzso and zzso zzso were more sensitive to zzso and zzso suggesting that the zzso may be useful in the treatment of zzso zzso These novel cellular models of zzso and zzso resistant zzso will be useful in developing strategies to treat zzso zzso
