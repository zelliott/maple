The zzso of the zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso domain zzso has been shown to affect the zzso and transition to zzso of the Pol II zzso The differential zzso of zzso within this domain zzso with the recruitment of factors important for zzso processing and zzso zzso A role for zzso and zzso zzso has yet to be zzso The discovery of zzso that express a preference for specific zzso within this sequence suggests a mechanism for the controlled recruitment and displacement of zzso partners during the zzso zzso The last zzso repeat zzso contains unique interaction sites for the only known zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso II zzso Here, we show that removal or severe disruption of the last zzso zzso but not point zzso of its zzso sites, results in its zzso degradation to the Pol zzso form in zzso but does not appear to affect the specific zzso of zzso These results suggest a possible mechanism of zzso control through the zzso removal of the Pol II zzso
