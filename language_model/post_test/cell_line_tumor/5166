Head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso represents an ideal model for assessing the impact of anemia and tumor zzso on the response to zzso zzso Various treatment strategies aimed at increasing tumor zzso in zzso patients have been studied and these studies have been fueled by evidence that zzso and, unexpectedly, zzso zzso adversely affect the zzso of zzso The purpose of the present study was to zzso examine the relationship between zzso EPO, its zzso zzso zzso and their effects on the survival and zzso of zzso cells underwent zzso 

We used zzso head and neck cell line to investigate different cellular responses after zzso given in zzso and hypoxic conditions, focusing on the role of EPO administration in cell proliferation and in regulating response to zzso 

Our results show that EPO do not evoke a zzso response on zzso tumor cells as assessed by cellular growth and zzso In addition, we present some indications that EPO could activate opposite signals related to zzso DNA repair and zzso Among them, zzso and zzso zzso may play a role in zzso 

We concluded that the expression of the zzso in zzso cells does not seem essential for their growth and that administration of EPO does not affect zzso zzso
