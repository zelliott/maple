To investigate the mechanisms underlying cancer pain, we developed a rat model of cancer pain by zzso zzso into the rat hind zzso resulting in zzso cell zzso and determined the time course of zzso mechanical sensitivity, and spontaneous zzso behavior in this zzso In addition, pharmacological and zzso studies were performed to examine the role played by transient zzso potential zzso zzso and zzso expressed in the zzso root zzso zzso of zzso induced marked mechanical zzso zzso zzso and signs of spontaneous zzso behavior, which were diminished by systemic zzso zzso zzso administration of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso channels zzso zzso red did not inhibit spontaneous zzso behavior at zzso However, zzso administration of zzso or zzso red completely inhibited mechanical zzso and zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso the number of zzso zzso zzso increased, whereas there was no change in zzso zzso in the zzso root zzso Our results suggest that zzso play an important role in the mechanical zzso and zzso zzso caused by zzso zzso 

We describe a cancer pain model that induced marked mechanical zzso zzso zzso signs of spontaneous zzso behavior, and zzso of zzso Mechanical zzso and zzso zzso were inhibited by zzso channel zzso The results suggest that zzso plays an important role in the model of cancer zzso
