Although zzso zzso has revolutionized the management of patients with gastrointestinal zzso tumor zzso resistance and progression almost inevitably develop with long-term zzso To enhance zzso zzso and overcome zzso in zzso cells, we examined the zzso effects of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso alone and in combination with zzso 

We treated zzso zzso and zzso and zzso cells with zzso alone and with zzso We determined the zzso and zzso effects by cell viability zzso flow zzso zzso and cell cycle analysis, zzso and nuclear zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso zzso at 72 h was 10 zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells, and 1 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso combined zzso in a zzso and zzso manner to inhibit the proliferation and induce zzso of all zzso cells, as evidenced by cell viability and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed strongly synergistic drug zzso with combination zzso zzso for most zzso zzso Thus, clinically relevant in zzso zzso of zzso have zzso zzso activity and are synergistic in combination with zzso 

We provide the first zzso evidence that zzso zzso with zzso zzso enhances zzso zzso via zzso and that direct engagement of zzso cell death may be an effective approach to circumvent zzso in zzso
