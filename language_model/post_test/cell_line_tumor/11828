zzso interest in using pharmacological zzso zzso to treat cancer has prompted interest in leveraging its zzso mechanism of zzso A central feature of zzso action in cancer cells is its ability to act as an electron donor to zzso for generating zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso zzso would increase zzso zzso rates, thereby increasing zzso zzso and zzso Three different zzso were tested zzso zzso and zzso exhibiting a range of zzso and zzso zzso Of the zzso tested, zzso exerted the greatest effect on increasing the rate of zzso zzso as determined by the concentration of zzso radical zzso and the rate of oxygen zzso At zzso that had minimal effects alone, combining zzso and zzso zzso to decrease zzso survival in human pancreatic cancer zzso This zzso effect was reversed by zzso but not zzso zzso consistent with a mechanism zzso by zzso zzso increased zzso zzso of zzso upon ex zzso addition to whole blood obtained either from mice infused with zzso or patients treated with zzso zzso Finally, tumor growth in zzso was inhibited more effectively by combining zzso with zzso We concluded that zzso increase the rate of zzso of zzso to leverage zzso flux and zzso zzso
