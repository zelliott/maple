zzso is one of the most important zzso treatments for patients with zzso zzso but zzso of zzso are widely zzso This study was to induce human zzso cell line zzso to become a stable zzso cell zzso and investigate the mechanisms of zzso 

Human zzso cell line zzso with survival fraction of 2 zzso zzso of zzso was zzso by intermittent high dose X-ray (2 zzso for 3 times, 5 zzso for 2 zzso After each zzso the cells were cultured for 5 to 8 weeks and received zzso zzso The whole process of zzso and culture lasted for 11 zzso The cells derived from zzso were obtained and named zzso zzso radiation zzso Double times of zzso and zzso cells were determined by zzso zzso zzso curves, zzso parameters and zzso were determined by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The variation of their cell cycles was investigated by flow zzso and cell cycle synchronization of zzso 

The double time of zzso cells was zzso days, while that of zzso cells was zzso zzso The growth rate of zzso cells was slower than that of zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso model, the parameters of zzso and zzso were zzso The alpha values of zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso the beta values were zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso cells was stronger than that of zzso zzso The distribution of cell cycle in zzso cells after synchronization were zzso in zzso phase, zzso in S phase, and zzso in zzso zzso 24 h after loss of zzso the distribution of cell cycle were zzso in zzso phase, zzso in S phase, and zzso in zzso zzso The distribution of cell cycle in zzso cells after synchronization were zzso in zzso phase, zzso in S phase, and zzso in zzso zzso 24 h after loss of zzso the distribution of cell cycle were zzso in zzso phase, zzso in S phase, and zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells appeared zzso phase arrest before zzso and zzso phase arrest after loss of zzso 

After intermittent high dose X-ray zzso zzso cell line zzso has been induced to be relatively zzso zzso zzso cells grow slower and have zzso phase and zzso phase arrest which might relate to its zzso
