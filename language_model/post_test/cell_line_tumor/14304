zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso insulin zzso however, the precise mechanisms are zzso It was reported that zzso could increase zzso zzso oxygen species zzso production, and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso was reported to be required for zzso zzso Here, we examined roles of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso impaired insulin signaling in cultured human zzso zzso zzso Using reduced zzso Red probe, we confirmed that zzso increased zzso zzso production, which was suppressed by zzso of either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly activated zzso increased zzso zzso of insulin zzso zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and all of these effects were inhibited by zzso of either zzso or zzso Similar to zzso zzso of zzso zzso increased zzso zzso of zzso and decreased zzso zzso zzso of zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso ameliorated these zzso zzso In addition, zzso activated zzso zzso zzso zzso and this observation was partially inhibited by zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso increases zzso zzso and activates zzso in zzso cells and that these zzso phenomena zzso at least in part, to impaired insulin zzso
