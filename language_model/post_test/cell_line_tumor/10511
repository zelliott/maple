zzso is characterized by uncontrolled inflammatory zzso zzso migration zzso factor zzso has been shown to play an important role in the progression of zzso thus is a potential therapeutic zzso The aim of this study is to produce zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso abilities in zzso and to determine mechanisms of their zzso We generated 8 zzso zzso zzso with high specificity and 3 of them showed potent protective abilities in zzso lethal zzso induced by zzso zzso and puncture zzso One zzso zzso zzso showed zzso protection within 72 h after zzso induction and zzso mice treated with this zzso survived up to 84 h with reduced lung and kidney zzso zzso treatment also reduced tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels in septic zzso We further found that all 8 zzso zzso recognized the same zzso located in the zzso acid zzso zzso region of the N zzso of the zzso zzso Three of the zzso zzso in particular, inhibited zzso activity in association with their protective effect on zzso zzso Thus, we have produced zzso zzso that protected mice from zzso zzso by recognizing the same zzso zzso in zzso These zzso are promising candidates for further development of zzso against inflammatory zzso
