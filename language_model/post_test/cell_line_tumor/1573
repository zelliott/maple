zzso is the most common zzso tumor in zzso zzso of many signaling pathways regulating cell survival or zzso make the disease more zzso zzso resistance to chemotherapy zzso by zzso zzso protein zzso is the most challenging aspect to treat this zzso zzso much attention has been given to the recently developed zzso drug zzso because of its zzso nature and potency to activate tumor zzso protein zzso However, being a zzso of zzso resistance protein zzso and zzso its application has become zzso Currently, research has step towards reversing zzso drug resistance zzso by using zzso however its clinical relevance is restricted by plasma instability and poor zzso In the present investigation we tried to zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso surface zzso with folate to enhance therapeutic potential of zzso by modulating zzso We document that zzso can inhibit the expression of zzso and zzso zzso in a concentration dependent manner in zzso zzso In zzso cellular zzso cell cycle analysis and zzso studies were done to compare the effectiveness of native drugs zzso or zzso and single or dual drug loaded zzso zzso zzso The result demonstrated an zzso therapeutic efficacy of targeted dual drug loaded zzso zzso over other zzso zzso expression or down regulation of zzso proteins respectively and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso by zzso substantiate the above zzso This is the first investigation exploring the role of zzso as zzso zzso to enhance the therapeutic zzso of zzso which may opens new direction for targeting cancer with zzso resistance zzso
