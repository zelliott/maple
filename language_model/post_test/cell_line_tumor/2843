zzso resistance zzso is still a major threat to successful clinical application of cancer zzso zzso plays an important role in biological systems, and copper is also involved in zzso In the present investigation, we addressed the question whether metal copper might be involved in drug resistance of zzso and human zzso By means of atomic zzso zzso we determined serum copper zzso We found that the blood serum of zzso mice contained higher amounts of copper than healthy mice with zzso zzso mice bearing zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Lewis lung zzso contained more copper in their serum than mice bearing the corresponding zzso parental zzso Furthermore, the analysis of patients with breast cancer, colon zzso or lung cancer showed that the serum copper contents were higher in patients not responding to chemotherapy when compared to patients whose tumors responded to zzso The copper levels in serum of healthy volunteers were lower than in cancer patients irrespective of their response to zzso Our results imply that the level of serum copper may be considered as a zzso for treatment zzso
