This study reports for the first time the zzso expression profile of human breast cancer zzso cells and the effect of green zzso Although hundreds of zzso have been identified in humans, only a small proportion zzso of zzso are expressed in zzso zzso Low concentration treatment with zzso significantly alters the zzso expression profile in zzso zzso Twenty three zzso have been identified with differential expression after a 48 h treatment with 10 zzso zzso zzso tea zzso These zzso include zzso and zzso that were found to be zzso following treatment with green zzso These two zzso have previously been identified as being zzso in zzso breast cancer cells, with zzso specifically implicated in zzso the tumor zzso zzso zzso This data supports the hypothesis that zzso modification of the breast cancer zzso expression profile contributes to the efficacy of green tea zzso The resulting decrease in zzso is further supported by the altered zzso regulation of potential zzso and zzso zzso
