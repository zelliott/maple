Breast cancer is the most common zzso in zzso Although zzso agents, such as zzso are effective treatments for the majority of breast cancer patients, recurrence is frequent and often leads to zzso Thus, there is an urgent need to identify novel therapeutic targets that zzso zzso cells to existing chemotherapy zzso 

The levels of zzso B4 zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells were determined using quantitative zzso and zzso zzso The potential role of zzso in the zzso resistance of zzso cells was assessed using a pharmacological inhibitor and small interfering zzso zzso and the zzso resistance mechanism was zzso 

The expression levels of zzso were markedly zzso in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso with zzso or zzso zzso significantly zzso zzso cells to zzso and induced significant levels of zzso death, suggesting that zzso mediates zzso zzso We also demonstrated that zzso zzso resistance was associated with the zzso of zzso Finally, zzso with a zzso inhibitor and zzso markedly reduced zzso growth in an zzso in zzso zzso 

Together, our results demonstrate that zzso is a novel therapeutic target that zzso drug-resistant breast cancer cells to zzso
