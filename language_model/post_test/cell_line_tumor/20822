zzso zzso such as zzso cause zzso arrest and subsequent zzso through the intrinsic zzso zzso However, although zzso family proteins have been implicated as zzso zzso their precise role is largely zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso was mainly zzso in zzso zzso cells, and zzso corresponding to zzso zzso and higher zzso were observed after zzso zzso The zzso zzso species were strongly diminished in cells zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso induced the interaction of active zzso with active zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso prevented zzso and zzso interaction and strongly inhibited zzso whereas zzso zzso did not prevent zzso interaction and only zzso inhibited zzso The relative contributions of zzso and zzso were investigated using zzso deficient in one or both of these zzso double zzso were highly resistant compared with single zzso with zzso sensitivities in the order of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results highlight zzso as a key zzso of zzso zzso and show for the first time zzso and zzso of zzso by an zzso zzso In addition, our results suggest that the interaction of the activated forms of zzso and zzso represents a key zzso step in the zzso response to this important zzso zzso
