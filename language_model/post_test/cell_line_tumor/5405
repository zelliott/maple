To develop new approach for tumor zzso with zzso DNA zzso 

zzso derived from different species were prepared by zzso and subjected to zzso zzso The zzso gene of zzso was prepared by zzso different zzso in different zzso By zzso into cells, the zzso effect was evaluated with the approaches of zzso zzso and animal zzso 

zzso All these zzso in particular zzso zzso can result in both zzso and zzso response in zzso mice after zzso evaluated by the ratio of zzso and release of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Mice were vaccinated with these zzso and challenged with zzso zzso cells zzso It zzso that tumor growth was suppressed significantly in the mice vaccinated by zzso zzso zzso 

Our results zzso that zzso DNA zzso vaccine could be developed as a promising approach for tumor zzso
