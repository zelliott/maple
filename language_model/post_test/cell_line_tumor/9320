zzso within the zzso zzso domain of the zzso precursor protein zzso typically generate zzso strokes and vascular zzso zzso In contrast, the Arctic zzso zzso zzso results in Alzheimer's zzso Little is known about the zzso mechanisms that result from the Arctic zzso although increased formation of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso suggest that early steps in the zzso zzso are zzso Here we show that the Arctic zzso favors zzso zzso processing by increased zzso zzso as demonstrated by altered levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although the Arctic zzso is located close to the zzso site, zzso harboring the Arctic zzso is not an inferior zzso to a zzso and zzso a major zzso Instead, the zzso of Arctic zzso is altered, with reduced levels at the cell surface making Arctic zzso less available for zzso zzso As a result, the extent and zzso location of zzso formation is changed, as revealed by increased zzso levels, especially at zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the unique clinical zzso and zzso associated with the Arctic zzso but not with other zzso zzso could relate to altered zzso processing with increased zzso levels of Arctic zzso particularly at zzso zzso
