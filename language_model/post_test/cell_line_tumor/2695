zzso B e zzso zzso is a zzso version of zzso B virus zzso core protein that promotes immune tolerance and persistent zzso It is derived from a translation product of the zzso gene by two zzso zzso events: removal of the zzso signal zzso and removal of the zzso zzso zzso Four zzso motifs are present at the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with the first two fused as zzso zzso A possesses two extra zzso acids at the first motif zzso which zzso the first motif and separates it from the second zzso Western zzso analysis of patient zzso revealed a single zzso form for zzso B to D but two additional forms of larger sizes for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments with human zzso cell lines indicated that zzso of zzso B is derived from zzso at the first zzso zzso The major zzso form of zzso A zzso to zzso at the second zzso zzso and the other two forms are zzso products of the first zzso and third zzso zzso zzso Only the zzso product of the third motif of zzso A was observed in zzso zzso cells, and an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso of the first and second motifs in human zzso zzso In conclusion, our study reveals zzso differences in zzso processing and implicates zzso as the major zzso involved in the zzso of the first and second zzso zzso
