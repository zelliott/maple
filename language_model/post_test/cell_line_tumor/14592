Members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are involved in the regulation of various stages of the cell cycle and have been implicated in cancer zzso Unlike its other family members, the expression of zzso remains steady during cell cycle zzso suggesting that its activity may be zzso zzso However, the mechanism of regulation of zzso activity is not well zzso Here, we show that zzso and zzso protein 1 zzso a zzso interacting zzso is widely expressed in various cancer cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso as well as protein is increased in breast cancer tissue as compared to normal zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso as determined by both in zzso and in zzso zzso This interaction of zzso with zzso is independent of zzso zzso Furthermore, binding of zzso results in zzso of zzso zzso activity both in zzso and in zzso Interestingly, this zzso of the zzso activity by zzso is zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso is a regulatory zzso of zzso and it regulates zzso activity in a zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso in cancer cells could thus inhibit zzso activity leading to abnormal cell cycle regulation in breast cancer zzso Thus, in addition to zzso zzso may be a potential zzso and target for therapeutic intervention of breast zzso
