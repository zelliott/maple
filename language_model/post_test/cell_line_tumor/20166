The cellular zzso sorting complex required for transport zzso machinery zzso in membrane zzso and zzso budding of many zzso zzso Here, we found that expression of dominant negative zzso proteins caused a blockade of zzso virus zzso release and retention of viral zzso at the nuclear zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso was redistributed and partially zzso with zzso at the nuclear rim of virus replicating zzso Following transient zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso reorganized the nuclear membrane and induced zzso zzso zzso Multiple zzso within zzso zzso zzso formation and zzso zzso whereas both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso machinery abolished zzso zzso formation, leading to the zzso of viral DNA and zzso proteins in the nucleus of zzso zzso Overall, data here suggest that zzso recruits the zzso components to zzso nuclear envelope for the nuclear zzso of zzso
