zzso cells having stem zzso qualities are widely employed models for the study of neural zzso cell proliferation and zzso We find that human zzso zzso cells possess a signaling cascade initiated by zzso influx via zzso calcium channels and the zzso zzso zzso and culminating in nuclear zzso protein zzso IV zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso factors zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso functions to maintain zzso cells in an zzso zzso zzso Parallel to this zzso zzso is a zzso program by which zzso acid zzso zzso the differentiation of zzso cells toward a zzso zzso This is evidenced by zzso induction of the cell cycle inhibitor zzso zzso protein 1) and cell cycle arrest, induction of the zzso marker zzso and of the zzso intermediate filament zzso zzso and by zzso extension of zzso zzso During zzso differentiation there is a complex zzso interplay between these two major signaling zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso and one of its upstream zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso This is accompanied by zzso suppression of zzso zzso of zzso with a time course zzso that of zzso zzso zzso repression of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso appears to be involved in regulating the timing of zzso zzso as shown by the effect of zzso interference of zzso to markedly accelerate zzso zzso of zzso and zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso repression of the zzso signaling zzso may represent an early event in zzso zzso zzso
