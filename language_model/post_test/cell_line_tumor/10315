We recently described an oxidized zzso zzso named zzso , which is a product that chemically links to tissue proteins while maintaining the capacity to zzso zzso administered zzso Such product proved to be successful in targeting zzso therapy in a mouse model of zzso breast zzso Here, we show that the zzso of a single or multiple doses of zzso (up to five zzso by the zzso zzso , is stable for 2 zzso Taking into account that oxidized zzso is the first chemically zzso protein to be proposed for clinical use, we evaluated its zzso zzso and zzso Present in zzso data indicate that zzso (up to 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso does not affect cell viability or proliferation of zzso human prostate cancer or zzso mouse zzso cell lines as well as primary mouse zzso zzso Safety pharmacology and zzso studies were conducted using zzso up to the highest concentration compatible with its zzso (about 12 zzso representing four times the product concentration intended for human use, and in the maximum zzso volume compatible with each study zzso The intramuscular administration in rat and monkey induced a moderate to strong inflammatory response particularly after a second administration and consistently with the induction of an immune zzso Interestingly, the intramuscular administration of zzso to zzso and monkeys exhibiting very high zzso zzso zzso was well tolerated with no systemic symptoms of any zzso zzso administration of zzso , performed to mimic an accidental injection of the dose intended for a local administration (15 zzso of zzso zzso zzso showed significant zzso of the product into the zzso not associated with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso injected after 24 zzso thus suggesting rapid zzso No zzso activity was induced by oxidized zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Overall, the present data indicate that zzso is well tolerated in zzso and zzso zzso thus supporting its clinical use within protocols of zzso therapy of zzso zzso zzso
