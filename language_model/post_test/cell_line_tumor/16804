zzso of zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso activity by a class of zzso termed selective zzso zzso zzso has been demonstrated to zzso zzso gene expression and zzso including repression of zzso induction of zzso genes zzso zzso These effects are observed to occur through an zzso mechanism that does not require zzso signaling through zzso response zzso Previously, we have demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso can repress the zzso induction of complement factor zzso Here, we report that the zzso of the zzso with zzso can suppress zzso induction of the membrane complement regulatory protein zzso When zzso is expressed on host cells, it zzso the zzso of the complement component 3 zzso zzso thereby protecting the cell from zzso zzso zzso cells often exhibit elevated zzso expression on the cell surface in the inflammatory zzso of the zzso and such enhanced expression could represent a means of escaping immune zzso zzso can repress the zzso induction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso reporter analysis has identified possible response elements on the zzso promoter, which may be targets for this zzso A zzso deposition zzso with zzso revealed that repression of zzso zzso expression by zzso led to an increase of zzso deposition on the surface of zzso cells, which would likely stimulate the formation of the membrane attack zzso These results suggest that zzso such as zzso have therapeutic potential in regulating the immune response to tumor zzso
