zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are a major barrier in clinical gene therapy using zzso zzso however, the zzso profile of zzso zzso in the presence of zzso following zzso injection has not been fully zzso although such zzso are often zzso injected in clinical zzso In this study, we evaluated the correlation between the zzso of zzso in the serum and the zzso profiles in the tumor and the liver following zzso administration into mice possessing various zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the tumor was inhibited by zzso however, when the zzso of zzso was less than zzso the levels of zzso in the zzso efficiencies within the tumor ranged from approximately zzso to zzso A more than zzso reduction of zzso zzso zzso was found in most of the mice when the zzso of zzso were zzso On the other hand, the zzso efficiencies in the liver were largely reduced almost to the levels of the zzso mice even at the low zzso of zzso These results provide crucial information for the clinical use of zzso zzso
