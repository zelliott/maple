Gene zzso zzso by zzso interference zzso presents a promising strategy for gene zzso The aim of this work is to evaluate a new gene delivery system for zzso of zzso expression and enhanced zzso of zzso cells to zzso zzso A new zzso zzso zzso with multiple zzso groups was zzso through Michael addition for zzso zzso zzso delivery in zzso zzso zzso complex zzso with the size of zzso and zzso potential of zzso achieved zzso suppression of zzso even superior to zzso or zzso zzso based complex zzso The significant zzso of zzso expression was achieved by zzso zzso The nuclear zzso by zzso laser scanning zzso zzso and apparent zzso peak of cell cycle in zzso cells were observed when zzso by zzso zzso The combined use of zzso and zzso enhanced the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso at a larger extent than that of zzso or zzso based complex zzso These results suggested that zzso could be potential as an efficient and safe gene carrier in zzso zzso and tumor zzso
