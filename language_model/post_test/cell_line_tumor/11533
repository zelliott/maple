Head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso is a zzso that is associated with severe mortality despite advances in zzso Today's standard treatment most commonly includes zzso often combined with chemotherapy or zzso There are so far no established zzso to predict response to radiation, and thus the aim of this study was to investigate a series of markers that could potentially identify zzso patients who would benefit from zzso The selected zzso both proteins zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso and single zzso zzso zzso in the genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were correlated to the response to zzso and overall zzso zzso were performed on zzso tumor zzso from patients classified as zzso or zzso to zzso zzso expression was examined using zzso and the zzso of specific zzso was analyzed using zzso or zzso We found that zzso expression was significantly stronger in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso and that patients with a strong zzso expression had a significantly better overall survival zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso by zzso in two zzso cell lines significantly decreased their sensitivity to zzso Among the zzso zzso patients with the zzso zzso zzso had a significantly shorter overall survival zzso zzso zzso and patients with the zzso zzso zzso had a significantly longer overall survival zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, our results suggest that zzso plays an important role in the response to zzso and may be a useful marker for predicting zzso response in patients with zzso
