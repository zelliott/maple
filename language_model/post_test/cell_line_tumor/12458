Recent studies have shown that zzso in zzso light zzso gene zzso cause zzso zzso zzso Since the first description of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso in the zzso gene have been reported in patients affected with CMT zzso We report a novel zzso zzso acid substitution in the zzso gene in two unrelated patients affected with zzso Because the zzso zzso acid substitution in the zzso protein was not detected in a CMT affected brother of the zzso its zzso effect became zzso In order to determine whether this zzso acid substitution is a benign zzso or zzso of the disease, we performed a functional analysis of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso of the zzso protein in cultured cells revealed an increased tendency to form highly zzso zzso structures but no other zzso of zzso assembly or transport were zzso Furthermore, the sibling of one of the patients was also affected with CMT but did not have the zzso zzso These data suggest that this zzso substitution in the zzso gene was not a direct cause of the disease but could be a zzso or possibly a modifier of the CMT zzso
