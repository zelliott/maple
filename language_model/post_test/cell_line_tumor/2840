zzso protein is a member of the family of zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso family members have different activities, such as zzso and zzso making them good candidates to mediate the zzso zzso zzso and changes in cellular zzso that zzso certain zzso and cancer zzso It was reported that one family member, zzso is zzso by promoter zzso This seems to correlate with zzso progression and zzso in breast zzso In this study, we explored the involvement of zzso another zzso family member, in breast zzso 

First, we zzso zzso expression in breast zzso cell lines by zzso and western zzso We also used zzso zzso treatment and DNA zzso sequencing to study the promoter zzso of zzso in breast zzso cell zzso We evaluated zzso zzso in primary zzso samples by zzso specific zzso zzso Finally, zzso promoter zzso was correlated with zzso data using the zzso test and zzso exact zzso 

The expression analysis of zzso in breast zzso cell lines by zzso revealed gene zzso in zzso of zzso cell zzso The corresponding lack of zzso protein was confirmed by western zzso We also used zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequencing zzso to confirm that gene zzso is due to zzso promoter zzso Using zzso we detected zzso promoter zzso in zzso of primary breast zzso zzso The correlation between zzso pattern and patient's zzso data was not significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso stage zzso zzso size; zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso frequency in invasive zzso zzso zzso was zzso compared with zzso in invasive zzso zzso zzso and this difference was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso 

zzso gene zzso may be related to the zzso zzso appearance of zzso We suggest that zzso promoter zzso may be a useful molecular marker for zzso zzso and zzso
