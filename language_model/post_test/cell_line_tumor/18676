Ras proteins have been found zzso in about one-third of human zzso In zzso Ras has been shown to regulate distinct and contradictory effects, such as cellular proliferation and zzso Nonetheless, the effects that the zzso protein elicits in zzso are poorly zzso Depending on the type of zzso Ras zzso appear to either promote or inhibit the tumor zzso In this report, we treated zzso and zzso knockout mice with zzso zzso to induce zzso and found that zzso is more zzso in zzso mice than in knockout zzso After injecting different doses of a zzso cell line, the zzso mice exhibited a shorter zzso of tumor development than the zzso indicating that there are zzso differences in the zzso zzso Likewise, we have analyzed zzso zzso induced by either zzso or by the zzso zzso in mice that zzso the zzso zzso and found that the zzso of zzso zzso is able to increase the zzso of these zzso zzso together, our results indicate that Ras zzso can enhance or inhibit the zzso zzso in zzso in different zzso
