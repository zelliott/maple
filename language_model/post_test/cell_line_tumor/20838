The metabolism and toxicity of zzso zzso zzso were investigated in zzso using zzso zzso a melanoma molecular target, and zzso induced rat liver zzso and in human zzso melanoma zzso The results were compared to zzso zzso At 90 zzso zzso was zzso zzso by zzso and zzso by liver zzso while the extent of zzso metabolism was zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso 2) of zzso and zzso towards zzso cells were 75 and 50 zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso and zzso a zzso depleting agent, increased zzso toxicity towards zzso cells indicating zzso formation played an important role in zzso induced cell zzso zzso of zzso acid and zzso to the media was effective in preventing zzso cell zzso zzso A and zzso zzso of zzso transition pore in zzso were significantly potent in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso caused zzso decline in zzso zzso concentration which preceded cell zzso zzso also led to zzso oxygen species zzso formation in melanoma cells which exacerbated by zzso and zzso whereas zzso A and zzso prevented zzso Our findings suggest that the mechanisms of zzso toxicity in zzso were zzso formation, zzso zzso zzso zzso formation and zzso zzso
