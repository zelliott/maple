zzso and targeting of growth factor receptors for zzso degradation have been associated with zzso of the zzso part of the zzso To zzso the role of zzso zzso in zzso and sorting of zzso growth factor zzso zzso we constructed several zzso of zzso in which zzso potential zzso sites, were zzso for zzso zzso of all zzso zzso in the zzso part of zzso resulted in zzso of the zzso zzso domain of the zzso However, several zzso zzso zzso where up to 26 of 29 zzso in the zzso part of the zzso were zzso retained zzso zzso zzso The active zzso zzso were poorly zzso but zzso zzso indicating that zzso of the zzso is not required for zzso In contrast, degradation of the zzso zzso was dramatically reduced as the zzso were zzso transported to zzso but rather sorted to recycling zzso The altered sorting resulted in sustained zzso The duration of zzso signaling seems to be tightly regulated by zzso zzso and subsequent sorting to the zzso for zzso
