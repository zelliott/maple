zzso acid zzso and its derivatives are currently under development as zzso agents against second primary zzso in zzso We aimed to evaluate zzso targets of zzso and a surrogate marker of zzso response to clarify the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso with zzso Human zzso cell lines such as zzso zzso and zzso were treated with zzso and its zzso Cellular dynamics of several zzso proteins were assessed by either zzso or zzso zzso The cellular expression of zzso D1 protein was suppressed immediately after zzso zzso This reduction was partially blocked by zzso with zzso zzso inhibitor zzso indicating that zzso degradation was involved in zzso disappearance of zzso zzso A zzso of zzso protein zzso at zzso zzso a target site of zzso zzso zzso 4, was rapidly decreased in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso revealed zzso nuclear zzso of zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso D1 may be a target of zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso rapid repression of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso may influence cell cycle progression and may be relevant to zzso cell death zzso
