To evaluate the pure zzso impact of the zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso breast cancer patients, and to identify zzso expressed genes associated with high or low zzso zzso zzso 

zzso transcript levels were measured by real-time zzso in tumor samples from 280 zzso breast cancer patients who had not received zzso systemic zzso zzso were distant zzso survival zzso and overall survival zzso Gene expression analysis was performed with zzso isolated from breast cancer tissue and breast cancer cell lines using zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso analysis, zzso significantly contributed to the base model of traditional zzso factors for zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Using zzso seven genes were found to be zzso in tumor samples and cancer cell lines with high zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso a member of the Ras zzso family, was selected for quantitative analysis of zzso expression in the set of 280 zzso High zzso values were significantly associated with worse outcome of patients for zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in zzso analysis, independent from zzso The patient zzso with high zzso and zzso levels showed the worst zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with tumors with low values of both zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso and zzso zzso represent independent zzso markers in breast cancer and may be components of different, but possibly zzso zzso signaling zzso
