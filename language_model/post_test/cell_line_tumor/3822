zzso accessory zzso 1 zzso is expressed on all zzso T cells and promotes their zzso and zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso a critical zzso for zzso zzso formation between T cells and zzso and for zzso killing of target zzso Mice that lack zzso display abnormal T cell responses and zzso zzso however, the mechanism involved is zzso In this article, we show that zzso zzso results in reduced proliferation of zzso T cells after zzso presentation and impaired zzso zzso We also demonstrate that zzso T cells show reduced zzso with tumor cells and decreased recruitment of both zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso which zzso with reduced tumor cell killing in zzso This zzso zzso may explain why zzso mice cannot clear tumors in zzso and highlights the importance of zzso and the zzso zzso in T zzso zzso zzso
