The involvement of zzso in breast cancer development and growth has been well zzso However, the effects of zzso hormones and their combined effects with zzso are not well zzso We investigated the response of human breast cancer cells to zzso hormone, particularly the role of zzso in zzso cell proliferation and gene zzso We demonstrated that zzso zzso or zzso zzso promoted cell proliferation in a zzso manner in both zzso and zzso cell zzso The zzso or zzso cell proliferation was suppressed by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We also demonstrated that zzso could enhance the effect of zzso on cell proliferation in zzso zzso Using an zzso response element zzso zzso zzso we determined that zzso was able to induce the zzso of zzso gene expression in zzso cells, although the effects were much weaker than that induced by zzso These results suggest that zzso can promote breast cancer cell proliferation and increase the effect of zzso on cell proliferation in some breast cancer cell lines and thus that zzso may play a role in breast cancer development and zzso
