Our study focused on investigating the mechanism of action of zzso in regulating zzso levels within zzso In the studies reported here, we attempted to understand the role of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso We zzso expressed zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cells and isolated several single cell zzso These clones were initially characterized for expression of the zzso zzso and representative clones from each type were chosen for further zzso Cell zzso alkaline zzso activity, and the viability of these clones in culture were zzso The cells expressing zzso zzso exhibited more differentiated characteristics than cells expressing zzso zzso zzso cells were more rounded than the zzso cells, which were more zzso and zzso in zzso The zzso cells had a higher survival and growth rate when compared with zzso zzso The zzso clones were not as viable as zzso zzso and some of the zzso cell lines showed signs of zzso with an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso levels of zzso functional activity were higher in cells expressing zzso as was protein expression of the zzso gene zzso The significance of these receptors to zzso differentiation and zzso regulation is zzso
