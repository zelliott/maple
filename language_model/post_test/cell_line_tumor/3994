The zzso zzso zzso zzso play an important role in many zzso processes induced by numerous stress zzso Each zzso protein appears to have a distinct function in cancer, diabetes, or Parkinson's zzso zzso we found that zzso A, a major zzso constituent isolated from licorice zzso suppressed zzso activity but had little effect on zzso in zzso zzso Although zzso A binds with zzso competitively with either zzso or zzso a computer simulation model showed that after zzso A zzso the zzso zzso of zzso was distorted more substantially than that of zzso This could reduce the affinity of zzso more than zzso for zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso A inhibited zzso but not zzso zzso zzso in both ex zzso and in zzso zzso We also observed that in colon and pancreatic cancer cell lines, zzso is highly expressed compared with normal cell zzso In cancer cell lines, treatment with zzso A or knocking down zzso expression suppressed colon and pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and colony zzso The zzso resulted in zzso phase arrest and zzso Moreover, an in zzso zzso mouse study showed that zzso A treatment effectively suppressed the growth of zzso zzso without affecting the body weight of zzso These results show that zzso A is a selective zzso zzso zzso we suggest that because of the critical role of zzso in colon cancer and pancreatic zzso zzso A might have preventive or therapeutic potential against these devastating zzso
