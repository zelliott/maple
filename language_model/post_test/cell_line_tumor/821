A series of novel zzso zzso targeting the zzso gene product human zzso growth factor zzso zzso were constructed and evaluated in breast cancer cell lines to zzso zzso zzso for zzso gene zzso These zzso were zzso complexes zzso prepared by zzso at varying ratios, zzso DNA carrying a zzso reporter gene to zzso which is a zzso of linear zzso zzso a zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso studies were carried out in both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso breast cancer zzso The zzso zzso showed significantly greater zzso activity up to zzso than zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso efficiency of targeted zzso was dependent on the zzso ratio and can be blocked by excess free zzso suggesting zzso gene zzso In contrast, no significant difference in zzso activities was observed between zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso efficiency of zzso zzso was retained in zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso have shown promising zzso zzso gene transfer properties and warrant further evaluation as a zzso zzso for gene zzso
