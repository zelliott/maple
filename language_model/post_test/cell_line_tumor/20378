The efficacy of agents that zzso the zzso position of zzso is inhibited by zzso zzso zzso which removes these zzso from the tumor zzso To increase differential zzso zzso must selectively zzso zzso in tumors, while sparing normal zzso where this protein serves a protective zzso A newly zzso zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso with an zzso zzso masking the essential zzso group has demonstrated the feasibility of targeting hypoxic regions that are unique to solid tumors, for drug zzso However, these modifications resulted in greatly decreased zzso Recently, new potent global zzso zzso with improved zzso such as zzso zzso have been zzso However, zzso zzso zzso exhibits a pronounced decrease in zzso Thus, 1 would be zzso by zzso and probably zzso To combat potential zzso zzso while retaining favorable zzso we zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso is protected by zzso and to impart tumor selectivity we zzso zzso zzso a zzso targeted zzso of 3 utilizing an zzso zzso zzso with this design, 7 demonstrates both zzso selective conversion by zzso cells of 7 to 3 and hypoxic zzso of zzso containing zzso cells to the zzso actions of zzso while exhibiting improved zzso
