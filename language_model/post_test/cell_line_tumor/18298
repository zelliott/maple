Gap junction channels exhibit zzso dependent zzso properties, including selective zzso passage of larger zzso such as second zzso and zzso Here, we report the determination of zzso zzso zzso zzso through gap junction channels composed of zzso zzso or zzso using simultaneous zzso of zzso zzso and zzso transfer of zzso For zzso detection the recipient cells were zzso with a reporter zzso the zzso zzso channel from sea zzso zzso zzso zzso was introduced via patch zzso into the cell of the pair that did not express zzso zzso currents zzso were recorded from the other cell of a pair that expressed zzso zzso diffusion through gap junction channels to the neighboring zzso cell resulted in a five to zzso increase in zzso current over zzso zzso zzso transfer was observed for zzso zzso channels over a wide range of zzso However, zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibited reduced zzso zzso in comparison to zzso The zzso zzso ratios were zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso channels were approximately 10 to 7 times more permeable to zzso than zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso suggesting that these channels have distinctly different selectivity for zzso charged larger zzso involved in zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso to zzso results in a rapid delivery of zzso from cell to cell in sufficient quantity before degradation by zzso to trigger relevant zzso zzso The data also suggest that the reduced zzso of zzso and zzso might compromise their ability to deliver zzso rapidly enough to cause functional changes in a recipient zzso
