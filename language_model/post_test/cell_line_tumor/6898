Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in many developed countries, including zzso zzso a widely distributed zzso is well known to induce growth zzso in a variety of human cancer zzso zzso zzso are the main circulating zzso after dietary supplements with zzso in zzso However, there is little information available as to how zzso zzso affect human cancer zzso We investigated the effects of zzso zzso in a human lung cancer cell line zzso We checked the cell zzso cell cycle checkpoint zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity, and gene expression by flow zzso and Western zzso The viability of cells decreased in a zzso and zzso zzso Cell cycle analysis revealed a significant increase of the proportion of cells in zzso phase and zzso phase zzso to zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso increased the expressions of zzso B, zzso and zzso zzso indicating the zzso zzso We also demonstrated a concurrent decrease of the zzso membrane potential, release of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso was totally blocked by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso Taken together, we demonstrated that zzso zzso inhibited proliferation through zzso arrest of the cell cycle and induced zzso via zzso cascade in the human lung cancer cell line zzso zzso of the biological effects of specific major zzso zzso on zzso potential or zzso of human zzso warrants further zzso
