zzso mouse zzso cells form zzso tumors and are deficient in zzso zzso a zinc zzso zzso factor required for zzso differentiation and bone zzso Our previous studies showed that replacement of zzso suppresses zzso bone zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been shown to stimulate zzso zzso We showed that zzso production by zzso cells was significantly suppressed following zzso zzso through a zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso zzso through an zzso site on the zzso zzso zzso zzso by small interfering zzso in two cell lines zzso and zzso that expressed high levels of zzso led to enhanced zzso promoter activity and protein production and altered the zzso from zzso to zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso zzso expression in mouse zzso cells via zzso repression of zzso and this may in turn affect the zzso activity of the tumor zzso
