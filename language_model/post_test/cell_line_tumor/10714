zzso is the main zzso filament bundling protein in zzso Because of the important role zzso play in cell migration, zzso is emerging as a major target for cancer drug zzso However, an understanding of the mechanism of bundle formation by zzso is critically zzso zzso consists of four zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso contains two major zzso sites, coinciding with regions of high sequence conservation in zzso zzso 1 and zzso The site in zzso is located near the binding site of the zzso inhibitor zzso and comprises zzso zzso whose zzso by protein zzso C zzso zzso bundling and formation of zzso The site in zzso is related by zzso symmetry to that in zzso The two sites are zzso zzso apart, resulting in a distance between zzso filaments in the bundle of zzso zzso zzso zzso in both sites disrupt bundle formation in zzso as assessed by zzso with zzso and electron zzso and severely impair formation of zzso in cells as determined by rescue experiments in zzso zzso zzso of other areas of the zzso surface also affect zzso bundling and formation of zzso albeit to a lesser extent, suggesting that, in addition to the two major zzso sites, zzso makes secondary contacts with other filaments in the zzso In a high resolution crystal structure of zzso molecules of zzso and zzso zzso are bound in pockets located within the two major zzso zzso These molecules could guide the rational design of new zzso zzso zzso
