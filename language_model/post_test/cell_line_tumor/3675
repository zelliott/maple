The human zzso cell line, zzso was used to examine the effects of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Treatment for 24 h with zzso zzso or zzso at 100 zzso 1 zzso and 10 zzso resulted in a zzso zzso of zzso zzso Exposure of cells to 10 zzso zzso for zzso 5 and 24 h resulted in a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso receptors by zzso and zzso was blocked by treatment with zzso zzso consistent with an zzso zzso Sensitive zzso binding studies with a zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso was able to induce zzso of zzso receptors naturally expressed in zzso zzso zzso produced a more rapid zzso of zzso receptors than zzso but zzso zzso blocked the zzso induced by each of these zzso This study demonstrates that, like zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors in a zzso and zzso zzso This study also demonstrates that zzso as well as zzso can induce zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso receptors in zzso zzso These results may help zzso the ability of zzso zzso to regulate the number and responsiveness of their zzso
