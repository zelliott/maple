A zzso zzso zzso was prepared by chemical synthesis and shown to possess zzso properties which are particularly zzso for the promotion of zzso zzso zzso including a very low zzso quantum yield of zzso zzso and zzso (110 to 400 zzso excited state zzso as well as the presence of intense zzso bands at zzso longer than 800 zzso This allows the possibility of zzso zzso by means of a zzso laser operated in a pulse zzso The zzso was accumulated in comparable amounts by zzso zzso melanoma cells and zzso transformed zzso however only the zzso cells could be extensively damaged by zzso zzso with the zzso which was zzso distributed as suggested by observations at the optical zzso the efficiency of the zzso could be enhanced by formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, only a modest zzso of zzso cells was induced by zzso zzso possibly zzso to the zzso of the zzso at the periphery of such zzso The zzso also exhibited a good selectivity of zzso melanoma targeting in zzso mice, bearing the zzso zzso transplanted in the zzso zzso the ratio of zzso concentration in the melanoma and the surrounding zzso districts was as large as zzso at 1 h zzso The zzso underwent a fast clearance from the zzso since only traces of the zzso were observed in all the studied zzso at 3 h after zzso zzso Thus, zzso were performed at zzso times shorter than 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso efficiency was obtained at 10 zzso after injection with a 50% cure zzso Thus, zzso therapy zzso appears to be a very promising and efficient zzso of zzso zzso
