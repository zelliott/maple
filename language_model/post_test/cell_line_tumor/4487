The scaffolding protein zzso is an established zzso marker in several zzso Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso in zzso remain zzso Here, using a comprehensive breast cancer tissue zzso it was shown that increased levels of zzso protein significantly correlated with the transition from zzso in zzso to invasive zzso Similarly, it was shown that zzso zzso is a hallmark of highly invasive breast cancer zzso Moreover, zzso expression is crucial for the zzso zzso invasion of cancer cells at the primary site but not at the zzso zzso zzso of zzso is sufficient to suppress invasion of tumor cells in zzso and in zzso leading to decreased circulating tumor cells and lung zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso localized to invasive zzso and was required for local zzso zzso zzso of zzso impaired invasion of cancer cells through zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by excess zzso on the cell zzso zzso of zzso is accompanied by reduced zzso activity of soluble zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso is sufficient to restore the activity of zzso and the invasive properties of breast cancer cells in zzso and in zzso zzso these findings uncover critical steps in zzso invasion of breast cancer zzso 

This study provides a zzso basis for potential therapeutic interventions to prevent zzso
