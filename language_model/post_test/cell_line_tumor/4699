zzso are zzso zzso structures associated with zzso zzso zzso degradation that collectively form the invasive machinery of aggressive cancer zzso zzso is a prominent component and a specific marker of zzso zzso of zzso is associated with poor prognosis in head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso possibly because of its activity in zzso Although the role of zzso in zzso has been attributed to signaling and zzso zzso it is incompletely zzso We made zzso cells deficient in zzso by zzso interference zzso zzso In these zzso zzso cells, zzso were reduced in number and lost their ability to degrade zzso In the reverse experiment, zzso of zzso dramatically increased zzso degradation, far above and beyond the effect on formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as plasma membrane delivery of zzso correlated closely with zzso expression zzso zzso inhibitor treatment of control cells zzso the zzso zzso zzso with abolished zzso degradation and fewer zzso suggesting a positive feedback loop in which degradation products from zzso activity promote new zzso zzso zzso these data suggest that a major role of zzso in zzso is to regulate the zzso of zzso and point to a novel mechanism zzso dynamic zzso assembly to the zzso machinery, producing enhanced zzso degradation and zzso Furthermore, these data provide a possible explanation for the observed association between zzso zzso and enhanced zzso and poor prognosis in zzso zzso
