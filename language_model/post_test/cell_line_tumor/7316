The zzso tumor zzso is a key zzso of the cellular response to zzso zzso induced by multiple zzso zzso has been proposed to be essential for zzso stabilization, interaction with zzso zzso and zzso of zzso target zzso However, genetic studies suggest that zzso zzso may not be essential for zzso zzso We therefore investigated the role of zzso zzso on six key zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso using zzso a recently developed small zzso zzso zzso We show here that zzso does not induce the zzso of zzso zzso of the activity of zzso and zzso zzso induced by the zzso drugs zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso cells revealed no difference in their zzso DNA binding and ability to zzso zzso target genes and to induce zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso on six major zzso sites is not required for zzso of zzso target genes or biological responses in zzso
