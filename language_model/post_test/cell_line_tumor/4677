The aim of the present study was to identify proteins zzso regulated by zzso in human prostate cancer cells in order to better understand the role of zzso in prostate cancer zzso The zzso of zzso zzso prostate cancer cells, that do not express zzso and of genetically engineered zzso cells that stable and zzso express zzso zzso zzso were zzso Using two-dimensional zzso followed by mass zzso analysis, 13 proteins that were zzso expressed between these two cell lines were zzso These proteins represent a dominant reduction of expression of zzso zzso including zzso zzso protein zzso zzso A3 zzso zzso precursor and zzso zzso Furthermore, regulation was observed for zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso a nuclear protein and proteins involved in zzso Our data indicate that zzso of zzso protein is correlated with reduced protein expression of certain zzso This suggests a possible involvement of zzso in zzso stress, and possibly in zzso in zzso zzso prostate cancer zzso
