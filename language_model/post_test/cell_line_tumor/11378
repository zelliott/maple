zzso zzso are well known to regulate cell zzso through zzso of a variety of downstream zzso zzso including zzso zzso proteins and zzso zzso The three closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all have the potential to interact with the same downstream zzso yet they have substantially different effects on cell shape and migratory zzso Here I review the different ways in which zzso zzso and zzso expression is regulated in cancer and how they play distinct roles in cancer zzso I describe their main zzso known to contribute to cell zzso Recent results from our laboratory and others indicate that zzso zzso and zzso can be activated by specific stimuli and act through different zzso to control distinct aspects of cancer cell migration and zzso This suggests that they each make unique contributions to cancer by participating in different protein zzso
