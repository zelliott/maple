zzso zzso is the zzso treatment for zzso zzso zzso patients with zzso liver zzso Nevertheless, the rate of zzso recurrence at 5 years is as high as zzso and this gravely zzso the therapeutic zzso Clearly, new approaches are needed for preventing the zzso of this deadly zzso Taking advantage of a zzso zzso zzso model of zzso we examined the role of zzso the first systemic drug approved for advanced zzso patients, in the prevention of zzso zzso We found that zzso suppressed the development of zzso zzso recurrence and abdominal zzso and consequently led to prolonged zzso survival of mice in this zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso zzso signaling caused by elevated levels of growth factors associated with zzso liver zzso enhanced the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso this provides a plausible explanation for the observation that zzso tumors are more responsive to growth zzso by zzso 

Our results strongly suggest that by effectively reducing zzso zzso zzso has a potential application in zzso zzso patients who have undergone zzso with zzso zzso
