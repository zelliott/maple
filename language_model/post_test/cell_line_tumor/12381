The zzso signal zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso or deletions of zzso have been observed in up to zzso of melanoma cell lines, resulting in zzso zzso The zzso family of zzso factors induce zzso in their zzso forms and were recently reported to be a zzso of zzso zzso In the present study, an zzso expressing a triple zzso zzso of zzso which cannot be zzso by zzso was assessed for its ability to induce zzso in melanoma zzso zzso zzso of zzso was evident in the zzso cell line 24 hours after infection with zzso by Western zzso zzso The expression of zzso TM was moderately delayed in zzso zzso zzso of zzso can efficiently inhibit melanoma cell growth and result in rapid loss of cell zzso Cell cycle analysis showed zzso of zzso in both melanoma cell lines resulted in development of a zzso population, indicating zzso by zzso zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso inspection, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso After zzso infection, the expression of zzso and zzso did not differ zzso whereas zzso and zzso levels decreased zzso zzso of zzso 3 and 6 in zzso zzso was demonstrated by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso as well as fragmentation of the zzso 6 zzso zzso B in zzso cells as early as 24 hours after zzso TM infection, but those events were delayed 72 hours in zzso In addition, we found that zzso was zzso in zzso cells at 24 hours after treatment with zzso This zzso was observed in zzso cells until 72 hours after infection with zzso Our data suggest that zzso expressing a zzso triple zzso could be a useful zzso for gene therapy of zzso resistant to chemotherapy and zzso induced by zzso of zzso
