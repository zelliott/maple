The present study focuses on the expression pattern of the stem cell markers zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso of oral zzso The study also aims to investigate the correlation of zzso and zzso expression with zzso zzso 

zzso analysis was done to investigate the expression pattern of zzso and zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso was studied using zzso zzso 

A gradual increase in the expression of zzso and zzso was observed from normal to zzso to zzso In addition, the expression of zzso and zzso shows significant difference between the stages and zzso types of oral zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso and zzso was observed in oral zzso and zzso zzso 

A gradual increase in the expression of zzso and zzso from normal to zzso to zzso suggests the possible involvement of these 2 proteins in oral zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso in advanced stages and also in poorly differentiated tumors reveals their relationship with invasion and differentiation status of oral zzso zzso Moreover, the significant positive correlation between zzso and zzso expression suggests that they might have a functional relationship in oral zzso cells, which needs further zzso
