The zzso activity of natural killer zzso cells has recently been shown to be zzso at a zzso level via flow zzso detection of zzso We used this novel method to zzso zzso and characterize zzso zzso cells in patients undergoing zzso or zzso conditioning and zzso zzso stem cell transplantation zzso zzso of zzso cells in the peripheral blood of 34 patients after zzso zzso zzso day zzso was determined by evaluating zzso expression after zzso of the cells with tumor zzso The percentage of zzso zzso cells was higher after zzso conditioning than after zzso conditioning ( zzso indicating a higher zzso state and increased zzso activity of zzso cells after zzso zzso We were able to analyze zzso cell zzso separately and found that zzso zzso cells following zzso are functionally different from zzso zzso cells in healthy donors, as indicated by a high percentage of zzso zzso cells in response to tumor targets in patients after zzso The zzso zzso is a new and feasible method to zzso and characterize zzso zzso cells after zzso Using this method, we found that zzso cells had high zzso zzso activity after zzso zzso which may contribute to the effectiveness of zzso zzso
