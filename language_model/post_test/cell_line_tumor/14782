The zzso zzso is an zzso zzso with promising zzso properties but some side effects that zzso its full clinical therapeutic zzso We hypothesized that this zzso could interact with plasma membrane zzso channels and zzso their zzso 

Using cell zzso zzso patch zzso zzso and zzso binding experiments, we studied the effects of zzso on the migration of breast cancer zzso cells, zzso by the small zzso zzso zzso zzso channel, zzso 

zzso (1 zzso caused plasma membrane zzso by substantially zzso activity of zzso channels, which we had previously demonstrated to play an important role in cancer cell zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso binding to this zzso zzso rather, it reduced the calcium sensitivity of zzso channel and dramatically decreased zzso zzso zzso probably by zzso in the plasma zzso as suggested by zzso K zzso zzso reduced cell migration to the same extent as known zzso channel zzso In contrast, zzso channel zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso decreased cell migration and totally abolished the effect of zzso on zzso cell zzso In contrast, transient expression of zzso protein in a zzso cell line increased cell migration and made these cells responsive to zzso 

Our data clearly establish zzso as an inhibitor of cancer cell migration by acting on zzso channels and provide insights into the future development of a new class of zzso zzso zzso
