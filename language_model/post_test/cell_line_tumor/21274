The poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer and poor sensitivity to current zzso associated with resistance to zzso urge the search for new zzso We previously described the induction of zzso zzso death in leukemia cells by zzso zzso and zzso Here, we explored whether these compounds induce a similar zzso in human pancreatic zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso induced zzso and DNA synthesis zzso in all cell lines and zzso in all lines, except for zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso activity zzso experiments showed that zzso was mainly induced through zzso in zzso and through a zzso process in zzso Moreover, in zzso or zzso cell lines, both zzso and zzso cell death mechanisms zzso Cell death was associated with zzso oxygen species zzso production, zzso zzso zzso c and zzso factor zzso release, zzso nuclear zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso production, zzso pore zzso zzso or zzso zzso partially prevented cell zzso Moreover, zzso B zzso or zzso by small interfering zzso partially blocked cell zzso In conclusion, zzso and derivatives trigger zzso zzso and zzso death in all tested human pancreatic cancer lines, irrespective of their degree of zzso sensitivity, becoming the only active zzso mechanism in the zzso zzso zzso This mechanism may overcome the resistance to zzso observed in pancreatic zzso when treated with current zzso zzso
