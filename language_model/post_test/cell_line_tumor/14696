zzso zzso plays important roles in the development of many disease conditions, including pancreatic zzso zzso Although the processes involved in the zzso regulation of zzso are well zzso some key zzso especially zzso zzso are still zzso In our previous study, we identified a novel zzso element located in promoter region of mouse zzso In this study, we isolated several zzso proteins from zzso cells via DNA affinity zzso the most prominent among these proteins was zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso can bind to the zzso element zzso in the promoter region of mouse zzso both in zzso and in zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso significantly inhibited promoter activity and decreased zzso zzso zzso repression of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso plays an important role in the regulation of zzso expression via binding to the zzso zzso zzso our findings provide new important information on the zzso regulation of zzso in pancreatic zzso
