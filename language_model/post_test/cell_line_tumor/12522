zzso resistance of zzso is one of the most important factors that leads to chemotherapy zzso A zzso breast cancer cell line, zzso was established from the zzso parent cell line zzso The biological properties of zzso including its drug resistance profile and profile of zzso binding zzso were zzso and compared with the parent cell zzso A number of zzso binding proteins were present in zzso cells but absent from zzso cells, namely heat shock protein 90, zzso and zzso zzso The identification of differential zzso binding proteins between the zzso zzso cell line and the parent zzso cell line zzso provides insight into possible mechanisms involved in resistance to these chemotherapy zzso
