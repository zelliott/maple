zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key regulator in zzso zzso metabolism and is a potential therapeutic target for zzso We reported previously that human zzso zzso is a highly sensitive gene zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that induction of zzso expression is one of the mechanisms underlying the decrease in zzso and zzso of HDL observed with zzso zzso zzso However, the mechanism of zzso regulation of zzso by zzso zzso remains zzso To clarify whether the zzso promoter is regulated directly by zzso we zzso the zzso promoter region by transient zzso zzso in the human zzso zzso cell line, zzso zzso zzso of unilateral deletions of zzso promoter construct with human zzso showed that the region from zzso to zzso of the zzso promoter includes key sites for zzso by zzso zzso analysis suggested three putative zzso response elements zzso in this zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso showed that a zzso located from zzso to zzso can bind to zzso Moreover, zzso zzso experiments indicated that the zzso zzso plays an essential role in zzso regulation of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that zzso binding of zzso to zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that human zzso is regulated directly by zzso the zzso zzso
