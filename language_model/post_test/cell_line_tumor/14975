zzso of zzso can lead to medical disorders such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso developing zzso agents is important for both medical and zzso zzso In this report, we demonstrated for the first time that the zzso drug zzso is a potent zzso zzso zzso is a representative zzso drug possessing zzso activity towards human zzso it blocked the proper zzso modification of zzso resulting in a dramatic reduction of the zzso protein level by altering its stability and subsequently decreasing zzso zzso zzso another zzso drug that has a lower zzso effect on human zzso zzso compared with zzso did not cause any changes in either the zzso modification of zzso or the zzso protein level, indicating that zzso was the most efficient zzso agent among the widely used zzso zzso Considering that zzso was originally selected from the zzso derivatives in a screen for an oral zzso drug with a strong zzso activity towards zzso zzso and low cell zzso we propose an alternative strategy for screening compounds from zzso derivatives that show high zzso activity towards human zzso zzso and high cell zzso with the goal of obtaining zzso agents that are effective inside the zzso
