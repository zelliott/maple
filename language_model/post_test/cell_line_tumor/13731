The SAM and zzso domain zzso zzso gene was originally identified as a potential tumor zzso gene in breast cancer, mapped on zzso zzso The expression of zzso plays a zzso role in human colon zzso Its expression is frequently zzso in several human zzso However, the biological function of zzso in melanoma cells is yet to be zzso In this study, in order to investigate the tumor zzso effects of the zzso zzso an zzso stable melanoma cell line was established, zzso the zzso zzso The stable cell line was examined using proliferation zzso zzso zzso cell cycle analysis and real-time zzso The results indicated that the tumor zzso activity of zzso derived from zzso arrest in zzso cells, and that the zzso of zzso or the disruption of zzso binding may be responsible for the zzso zzso
