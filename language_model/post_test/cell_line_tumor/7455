In this paper we propose a zzso technique with a zzso ultrasound imaging system that enables images to be acquired at the fixed depth of field of a zzso focused zzso along the profile of an object zzso by simultaneously moving the zzso in the horizontal and vertical zzso The scanning path, which closely parallels the profile of the object zzso was determined from the intensity difference between an object and the background in a zzso zzso The zzso moved along the profile of the object zzso while maintaining a constant distance zzso between adjacent pairs of zzso signals in the horizontal zzso The image was then reconstructed by applying an alignment process to eliminate the zzso The performance of zzso technique was verified in zzso experiment using an zzso phantom and the results showed a percentage error of zzso for the zzso blood flow zzso Moreover, in zzso experiment on a subcutaneous tumor was also zzso The results indicated that the proposed technique can accurately estimate the blood flow information along the profile of the object zzso and avoid distortion of the zzso of blood zzso The zzso technique has potential for assessing superficial blood flows and zzso in the zzso and dermatology zzso
