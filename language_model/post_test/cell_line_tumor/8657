The progression to zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso However, as single agents, zzso or zzso zzso result in a zzso feedback zzso zzso we hypothesized that combination of an zzso inhibitor with an zzso might result in a more profound, long-lasting zzso of zzso Here, we report that the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso proliferation and zzso zzso in prostate cancer cell lines expressing the zzso and has zzso activity in zzso in zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso However, we found that the effect of zzso tumor growth zzso and zzso zzso zzso stabilization is transient and resistance occurs with increasing zzso after approximately 30 days of zzso zzso we found that single agent zzso zzso increase of zzso binding to zzso response element, zzso zzso activity, and zzso genes such as zzso and zzso zzso These effects were overcome by the combination of zzso with the zzso zzso resulting in synergistic zzso of cell proliferation and induction of zzso in zzso and zzso of tumor growth zzso and zzso stabilization in zzso in zzso This study provides a zzso zzso that combination of an zzso inhibitor with zzso results in prolonged disease stabilization in a model of zzso
