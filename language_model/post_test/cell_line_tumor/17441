Early embryonic lung branching zzso is regulated by many growth zzso zzso Bone zzso protein 4 zzso is one of the zzso that stimulate zzso branching in mouse embryonic lung zzso zzso To further understand the molecular mechanisms of zzso lung development, we studied the biological role of zzso regulatory factor 1 zzso an zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso during mouse lung zzso The zzso expression pattern of zzso in mouse embryonic lung was first determined by quantitative real-time zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in airway zzso cells by zzso introduction of zzso zzso zzso dramatically inhibited embryonic day zzso zzso lung zzso growth in zzso This zzso of lung zzso branching was restored by zzso of zzso or by addition of soluble zzso zzso into the culture zzso Studies at the cellular level show that zzso of zzso reduced zzso cell proliferation and zzso as documented by reduced zzso cell index and by reduced zzso levels for zzso protein C and Clara cell protein 10 zzso Further studies found that zzso of zzso reduced zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso protein zzso Thus zzso of zzso specifically promotes zzso and zzso zzso and degradation in embryonic lung zzso thereby modulating the effects of zzso on embryonic lung zzso
