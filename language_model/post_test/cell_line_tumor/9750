Treatment of patients with relapsed or zzso low grade zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso has resulted in approximately 50% response zzso The mechanism underlying the failure of zzso to affect the remaining 50% of the patients is not clear, though their tumors express zzso The in zzso zzso functions of zzso include zzso zzso and seldom zzso In addition, we have reported that zzso signals the cells and zzso several zzso cell survival pathways that are responsible for the zzso and zzso effects of zzso on resistant zzso cell zzso The objective of this study was to develop novel and fully humanized zzso zzso zzso with enhanced zzso functions and molecular signaling that may zzso their therapeutic zzso Novel humanized zzso zzso zzso were derived from a zzso form of zzso zzso zzso shown to exert a more potent zzso zzso and zzso activities compared to zzso A representative humanized zzso zzso zzso was used to examine its biological effect and molecular signaling using Ramos zzso cell line as a zzso The studies were also performed in parallel with zzso treatment for zzso Ramos cells were treated with various zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of cell proliferation was observed in a zzso manner, suggesting cell signal zzso must have zzso Compared to zzso cells, treatment with zzso inhibited both the zzso activated zzso and zzso zzso zzso as assessed by zzso of both zzso and zzso and zzso respectively, but not the zzso zzso zzso significantly induced the expression of the zzso zzso and immune surveillance cancer gene product, zzso zzso inhibitor protein zzso These zzso resulted in zzso of zzso gene products and zzso Ramos cells to zzso by zzso In comparison with zzso zzso showed qualitative and quantitative differences in the above zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso triggers zzso expressing zzso cells resulting in a significant zzso of several gene products that regulate cell growth and zzso
