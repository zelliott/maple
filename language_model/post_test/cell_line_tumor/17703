zzso extracts of edible zzso zzso leaves were recently reported as potent zzso of cultured zzso zzso The mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso zzso cell growth has not been previously zzso The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of zzso zzso on the activities, DNA zzso and subsequent cell growth of zzso zzso protein zzso 1 and 2 zzso zzso Treatment of cells with various zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso extract zzso inhibited zzso activities, DNA synthesis zzso zzso zzso and cell growth zzso zzso zzso in a zzso fashion, both in the absence and presence of zzso The growth rate of cells zzso with 10 zzso zzso zzso for 48 zzso before transfer to zzso zzso medium was not significantly different zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso at least at zzso up to 10 zzso exhibits zzso action to zzso the growth of human breast cancer zzso In addition, the zzso signaling pathways may be one or more of the zzso targets for zzso zzso zzso zzso
