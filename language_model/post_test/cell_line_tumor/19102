zzso zzso are important regulators of signaling pathways relevant to both diabetes and zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso is both a tumor zzso and a negative regulator of insulin zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates insulin signaling and its genetic knockout prevents high-fat zzso obesity in zzso zzso also regulates zzso zzso and zzso zzso This and the fact that both zzso and zzso act on the same zzso suggest a potential role for zzso in zzso Here we report that, in direct contrast to zzso zzso protein expression is elevated in a number of breast cancer cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells suppresses zzso growth factor zzso zzso levels by means of enhanced zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso in zzso breast cancer cells supports in zzso cell zzso increases cellular sensitivity to drugs targeting the zzso and supports cancer development and zzso in nude zzso In addition, significantly high proportions zzso P zzso zzso of clinical specimens of breast cancer zzso in comparison with zzso breast zzso contain elevated expression of zzso zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that zzso is a clinically relevant novel zzso target that links zzso metabolism to cancer zzso
