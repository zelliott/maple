The zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso factor zzso family of proteins links the zzso zzso zzso to cell zzso zzso zzso is involved in regulation of zzso zzso differentiation and stress zzso It has a role in development of several zzso but no information for zzso cell zzso zzso is zzso 

zzso profiles for zzso were investigated in 121 samples of human zzso of various zzso plus paired normal kidney prepared in tissue zzso in comparison with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso function was tested in zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso short interfering zzso zzso was used to inhibit expression of zzso in zzso cells zzso or treated with cancer therapies known to induce zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso 

In patient samples, zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso in normal kidney and was significantly decreased in clear cell zzso as one group zzso and all other zzso zzso grouped together zzso There was little zzso identified in any zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso caused significant reduction in zzso expression and a concurrent decrease in zzso and increase in zzso activity (both zzso in the zzso zzso cells treated with radiation and zzso 

zzso may have a zzso zzso role in zzso The low zzso expression in zzso zzso patient samples compared with normal zzso and the zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso from which many zzso zzso may indicate a potential for targeted therapy in zzso
