During the past decade, many clinical trials with both zzso zzso and small molecules that target the zzso growth zzso 1 zzso zzso have been zzso Despite the important role of zzso signaling in zzso studies of such agents in combination with zzso are lagging zzso zzso the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the small zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso on the intrinsic zzso of prostate cancer zzso 

The effect of zzso on cell zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso cell cycle distribution, and double strand break repair was determined in three human prostate cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the importance of the zzso zzso status was explored by means of zzso experiments with zzso active zzso or inactive zzso zzso 

zzso inhibited cell proliferation and decreased cell viability in a zzso zzso manner in all three cell zzso zzso was observed in the zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso but not in the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso coincided with zzso of zzso levels and high levels of residual double strand zzso The importance of zzso status in the zzso effect was confirmed by zzso experiments with zzso active zzso or inactive zzso zzso 

zzso enhances the effect of zzso radiation in zzso zzso but not in zzso prostate cancer zzso Proper patient selection based on the zzso status of the tumor will be critical to the achievement of optimal results in clinical trials in which the combination of zzso and this zzso inhibitor is being zzso
