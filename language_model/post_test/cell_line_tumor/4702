zzso treatment was found to augment the expression of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso in cultured human breast cancer cell lines and in zzso tumors grown in zzso zzso zzso was also found to augment tumor expression of the zzso proteins zzso and zzso Growth of breast cancer cell lines on zzso an zzso extract containing zzso and zzso resulted in lower levels of zzso zzso as compared with zzso Moreover, tumors formed by injection of zzso mice with zzso cells mixed with zzso were significantly more zzso resistant and displayed lower levels of zzso compared with those that formed in the absence of zzso zzso zzso against zzso reversed zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, small interfering zzso suppression of zzso expression in breast cancer cells resulted in a zzso increase in zzso sensitivity as compared with control zzso Together, these findings point to a role for zzso in breast cancer zzso
