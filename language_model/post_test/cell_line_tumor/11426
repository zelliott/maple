zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso zzso zzso to zzso acid zzso Both zzso and zzso have been linked to zzso ranging from cancer to zzso zzso zzso of zzso production by zzso is therefore of therapeutic zzso Here we report the application of zzso zzso zzso models in a screening zzso that involves either zzso or zzso zzso as secondary filters to identify zzso zzso from previously zzso structural types, four of which have zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibit selectivity cliffs, characterized by structurally similar compounds exhibiting similar biological activities with respect to zzso zzso but very different biological activities with respect to zzso Thus, general zzso should not be used as an early filter to eliminate candidate zzso inhibitor scaffolds from further zzso zzso zzso using two zzso of vastly different sizes demonstrate that the tools developed to identify compounds binding outside the central core of the active site did identify compounds acting at an zzso zzso In contrast, tools developed to identify zzso directed compounds did not identify zzso directed zzso The stronger volume overlap imposed when selecting screening candidates expected to bind outside the active site is likely responsible for the stronger match between intended and actual target zzso
