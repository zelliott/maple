We report zzso a novel zzso active zzso for zzso labeling prepared by four step zzso It can be zzso to a target zzso containing an zzso functional group under weak basic conditions by way of zzso bond zzso We explored the application of zzso zzso by zzso to well known zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed good zzso yield and efficiency with an excellent zzso purity zzso zzso zzso in a short reaction time (10 zzso zzso zzso showed excellent in zzso and in zzso stability zzso zzso zzso specific tumor zzso was observed both in zzso and small animal zzso studies on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bearing zzso In general, successful application of zzso zzso for labeling of zzso zzso could facilitate the possibility of using this zzso for labeling peptides containing an zzso functional zzso
