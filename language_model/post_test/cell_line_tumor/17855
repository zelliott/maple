The cell division controller zzso plays a central role in the initiation of DNA zzso It was found that elevated levels of zzso were present in many of human cancer cells, and the zzso of zzso is required for cell zzso In this study, we have investigated the control of zzso expression and its effect on cell proliferation and death in human zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso are found in the zzso zzso and other cell lines that grow zzso zzso zzso via a zzso short hairpin zzso zzso causes the zzso of zzso populations with the decrease of S contents in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso profile from the selected genes shows the reduction of zzso zzso zzso A, and zzso with a zzso increase of the zzso inhibitor zzso indicating the suppression of tumor cell zzso Further, zzso zzso causes the increase of zzso zzso accompanied with the decrease of zzso zzso resulting in the increased cell zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso causes a sharp reduction of tumor zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso renders a zzso zzso zzso and this regulation is at zzso zzso zzso Our study indicates that human zzso functions in several pathways to control the cell proliferation and the cell zzso
