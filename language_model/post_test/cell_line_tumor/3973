zzso of zzso for zzso zzso zzso a breast cancer zzso zzso is tightly controlled in normal zzso but elevated in many tumors, contributing to zzso and zzso However, how the expression of zzso is regulated remains zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso widely used for zzso have been found to also have zzso effects, but little is known of the specific targets and zzso Moreover, zzso signaling zzso plays crucial roles in organ size control and cancer development, yet its downstream zzso targets remain zzso Here we show that zzso expression is regulated by zzso and zzso pathways zzso onto zzso protein zzso which binds zzso promoter at specific sites and controls its zzso and consequently breast cancer cell migration and invasion zzso and that zzso zzso zzso via targeting zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is dependent on zzso and sensitive to zzso which zzso zzso zzso by modulating zzso zzso and zzso zzso Further, zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso requires zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but is largely independent of zzso and zzso zzso zzso These findings from in zzso and in zzso investigations link zzso and zzso pathways with zzso as a downstream zzso a zzso and zzso target, and a cancer zzso zzso uncover a mechanism regulating zzso expression and cancer zzso and reveal a mode zzso zzso exerts zzso zzso providing potential targets for cancer therapeutic zzso
