Over the past 15 years, some potential zzso and zzso effects of antioxidants have been zzso zzso are known to act as powerful zzso zzso Free zzso are able to induce DNA strand breaks and zzso modifications of DNA bases and are not only produced naturally in the cell following a stress or zzso but also following zzso zzso The present study was undertaken in order to explore whether some antioxidants naturally present in the food or in the beverages could enhance zzso in zzso cells submitted to zzso zzso zzso zzso a potent zzso present in tea was tested on three human zzso cell zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso from chronic zzso zzso and zzso zzso from multiple zzso The parameters investigated were cell zzso zzso changes, cell cycle effects and zzso When given alone, zzso induced a decrease of cell proliferation and an increase of zzso as well as the appearance of zzso cells in the three cell zzso All these effects were zzso Taking into account the various zzso zzso cells appeared as the most radiation sensitive and zzso cells as the least radiation sensitive, while zzso cells exhibited an zzso radiation zzso zzso had no effect on cell zzso while it induced a zzso increase of zzso in the three cell zzso zzso cells were again most sensitive to this effect, while zzso and zzso cells were slightly less zzso A combined treatment by zzso and zzso resulted in a significant enhancement of zzso correlated with a decrease of proliferation in zzso and zzso cells and at a lesser extent, in zzso cells, compared to treatments by either zzso or zzso radiation zzso In conclusion, these preliminary results show that depending on the concentration and on the cell line, zzso could act as a radiation zzso on zzso cell zzso
