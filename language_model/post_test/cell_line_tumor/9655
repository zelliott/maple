The aim of this study was to determine whether normal human embryonic stem cells zzso would zzso factors that arrest growth of human zzso cancer cell zzso 

Cell proliferation was examined using the zzso zzso then zzso cell zzso zzso with zzso zzso followed by flow zzso was used to detect cell cycle zzso Heat zzso and molecular zzso experiments were also zzso 

We found that zzso zzso medium zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso cell zzso Similar results were also obtained when we used breast and prostate cancer cell lines, whereas little or no zzso effect was observed when human zzso were zzso Moreover, a zzso model confirmed that zzso of cancer cell proliferation is zzso by soluble factors produced by zzso We also determined that the proportion of cancer cells in zzso phase was increased by zzso CM treatment, accompanied by decrease in cells in S and zzso zzso suggesting that the factors slow progression of cancer cells by cell cycle zzso Heat zzso and molecular zzso experiments indicated a low molecular weight zzso factor was responsible for these zzso 

Our findings provide evidence that the human embryonic zzso contains soluble zzso that are capable of zzso growth of cancer cells, and that exposure to such factors may represent a new cancer treatment zzso
