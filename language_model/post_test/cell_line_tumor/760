The present research investigates whether infrared zzso can be related to the biological characteristics of zzso cell zzso We used nine human zzso cell lines for which a series of in zzso and in zzso biological features had already been established zzso 36 (2001) zzso and were able to show that their characteristic infrared zzso reflect their in zzso migration zzso zzso and zzso properties and their in zzso zzso More particularly, the infrared data evidenced correlations at the level of the zzso zzso These relationships were found to be zzso when controlled on seven pancreatic zzso cell zzso We also showed that zzso and zzso tumor cells, whose identification remains difficult, can easily be identified by their infrared zzso in the zzso zzso chain region as well as in the zzso acid zzso We concluded that infrared zzso could zzso complement information provided by more conventional diagnostic and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
