zzso are widely used as industrial zzso and chemical zzso but can cause serious damage to human zzso Nevertheless, few studies have addressed the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso of industrial zzso with the notable exception of zzso The goal of our current study is to zzso the molecular mechanism of zzso caused by primary alcohols containing longer carbon chains than zzso We find that zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso zzso including nuclear zzso and membrane zzso both of which are features of zzso zzso Moreover, a decrease in the zzso membrane potential, the zzso release of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso 9 and 3 was observed, thus revealing the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso The addition of zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso suppressed the membrane zzso and zzso zzso zzso In comparison zzso a zzso zzso did not inhibit membrane zzso but did prevent cell death following exposure to zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso of zzso and membrane zzso are parallel phenomena that occur downstream of zzso This zzso thus plays an essential role in zzso zzso and subsequent cell death in zzso zzso
