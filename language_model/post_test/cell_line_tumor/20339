zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scan is routinely performed for lung zzso imaging and for the assessment of in zzso distribution of zzso zzso prior to selective internal radiation treatment for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging is superior to gamma zzso in terms of sensitivity, spatial resolution and accuracy of zzso This study reported that zzso zzso zzso zzso is an ideal PET imaging surrogate for zzso 

zzso was prepared from the commercial zzso kit via a zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso The zzso study and zzso imaging were conducted in normal zzso rats after intravenous injection of zzso A comparison study of these two zzso was performed after zzso via the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso rat zzso 

The optimal condition for zzso preparation is zzso zzso zzso with zzso at zzso for 5 zzso in a zzso buffer of pH zzso zzso was prepared in 60 zzso with high zzso yield zzso and high zzso purity zzso The in zzso distribution of zzso after intravenous injection meets the specifications of zzso depicted in European zzso Our study demonstrated excellent correlation between zzso and zzso in the regional distribution of zzso liver and lungs zzso zzso and zzso respectively), and also in the zzso and zzso ratio zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso rat zzso The organ zzso derived from animal zzso and zzso imaging after administration of these two zzso were in accordance with those obtained in the distribution zzso 

Starting from commercial zzso zzso an efficient preparation of zzso was successfully zzso zzso zzso almost zzso regional distribution of zzso and zzso in both normal rats and zzso rats was zzso The findings, taken together, demonstrate that zzso is an ideal surrogate for zzso for clinical PET zzso
