zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso is a new member of the zzso zzso In this paper, we report the zzso zzso and preparation of a zzso form of the zzso domain of the TRAIL zzso without zzso zzso which may selectively induce zzso of tumor cells in zzso To obtain zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso region for zzso was cloned between zzso and zzso in zzso The zzso zzso fusion proteins were expressed in the form of inclusion bodies in zzso coli host strain zzso zzso The expression level was more than zzso of total cell zzso zzso bodies were zzso washed, and isolated at pH zzso and were completely dissolved in a buffer containing 2 M zzso at pH zzso After zzso zzso metal affinity zzso gel zzso zzso and zzso the zzso fusion proteins with a purity of zzso were zzso zzso L proteins were zzso by zzso to both zzso and zzso fragments, which then were separated by zzso exchange zzso Cell proliferation experiments proved that the zzso zzso zzso retains its zzso zzso zzso This result suggested that the zzso zzso may have cancer therapeutic zzso
