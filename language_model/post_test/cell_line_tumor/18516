zzso zzso an analogue of zzso was one of the first molecules proposed to have zzso zzso This concept was based on its ability to inhibit both zzso proliferation in zzso and tumor growth in zzso in a number of zzso zzso Yet, subsequent investigations indicated that the zzso activities associated with zzso are not selective for zzso zzso Moreover, recent evidence suggests that this agent zzso tumor growth in zzso but without a corresponding decrease in zzso zzso we performed a detailed comparison of zzso to a validated zzso agent, a zzso inhibitor termed zzso using a zzso model of zzso zzso Treatment with zzso for 5 weeks significantly suppressed zzso growth zzso Surprisingly, this zzso was not associated with a decrease in zzso but instead with an increase in tiny zzso To determine whether this was a direct effect of zzso on tumor vessels, we examined its effect in a short-term zzso using large tumors with established zzso In contrast to treatment with zzso which led to rapid vessel zzso and tumor zzso tumors exposed to zzso for 1 day displayed increased zzso zzso with significantly increased zzso density, vessel zzso and branch zzso zzso did not induce tumor zzso as demonstrated by minimal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso did, however, cause a marked increase in zzso of tumor zzso Our results indicate that the zzso effects of zzso cannot be attributed to prevention of zzso but instead to its direct action on tumor zzso
