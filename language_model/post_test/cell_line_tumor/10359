zzso gene transfer is limited by biological barriers such as skin and cellular zzso complex approaches are required to overcome these biological zzso zzso zzso systems that separate zzso zzso from zzso zzso have been used to overcome skin and cellular zzso respectively, however, do not provide sufficient doses of the gene to local zzso resulting in inefficient gene transfer zzso Although integrated systems for zzso gene transfer are available, their safety has been questioned and it is difficult to transfer sufficient amounts of genes due to cumbersome zzso procedures and the small size of the zzso Here, we demonstrate zzso zzso zzso zzso release, and zzso zzso using a hybrid zzso zzso which designed as a monolithic hybrid assembly of a zzso zzso and an zzso zzso Furthermore, as zzso we use the zzso for zzso zzso transfer of zzso to successfully treat zzso subcutaneous tumors in a mouse zzso The zzso described zzso holds great promise for zzso gene therapy of zzso and for zzso
