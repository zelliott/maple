Reduction of bare carbon dots zzso in zzso zzso solution is a facile and effective approach to enhance their zzso without any surface zzso CDs are treated with dilute zzso zzso solutions, enhancing their quantum yields zzso successfully from zzso % to 16 % which is comparable to zzso zzso in zzso zzso If pristine CDs are treated zzso prior to reduction by zzso zzso reach zzso zzso This value is among the highest zzso reported for bare CDs in the zzso The approach to enhance zzso through chemical reduction is generally zzso to other kinds of CDs zzso by various zzso zzso of the chemical structure of the CDs by zzso is analyzed by zzso C zzso X-ray zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which demonstrate that the zzso group content is decreased after zzso whereas the number of zzso carbon defects is zzso The zzso zzso zzso near the surface related to the surface energy bands of the CDs are estimated by zzso zzso data show a zzso layer on the surface of the CDs, and the zzso of the CDs decrease with increasing zzso zzso The layered zzso structures in the zzso of the CDs are clearly observed by transmission electron zzso zzso CDs could perhaps be regarded as zzso surface zzso layers formed by chemical erosion over zzso zzso zzso Chemical reduction by zzso changes the zzso bands of the CDs, thus, enhances their zzso The zzso properties of zzso zzso CDs are also studied for possible biological zzso
