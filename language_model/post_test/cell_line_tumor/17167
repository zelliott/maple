zzso cancer zzso has a propensity to zzso to the zzso inducing an zzso response in the zzso Recent zzso studies have suggested that circulating zzso may be important for both the zzso and dissemination of zzso We have zzso that tumor zzso zzso in conjunction with zzso zzso contributes to the zzso zzso characteristic of zzso zzso 

To test this thesis we studied the established zzso PC progression model consisting of three genetically related human PC cell zzso 

Using zzso we found zzso zzso media zzso of zzso and zzso had no measurable zzso whereas zzso was easily detected in CM from zzso cells at 24 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso showed that zzso expressed zzso more zzso zzso than zzso zzso In addition, zzso expression of zzso zzso was substantially increased in the presence of zzso zzso to nearly zzso While zzso and zzso were not zzso in the CM of any PC line, all cells zzso zzso zzso cells produced zzso more zzso than zzso or zzso cells zzso at 167 zzso 43 zzso cell zzso zzso a product of bone zzso cells, was also zzso zzso zzso had zzso higher zzso zzso compared to zzso and zzso and at least equivalent protein zzso 

Our results suggest that PC cells that have zzso to bone have an zzso zzso regulatory zzso This suggests an activated zzso axis contributes to the zzso interaction in promoting zzso zzso
