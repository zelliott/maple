The zzso zzso are an extensive class of small zzso zzso zzso zzso with important roles in the regulation of gene zzso Although a large number of zzso have been identified in a variety of zzso systems, the function of the vast majority of these molecules remains zzso To study the functions of zzso it is crucial to determine their spatial and zzso expression zzso Although there are some existing methods that can analyze the expression of zzso it is not an easy task for routine zzso zzso In this study, we have established a simple method to detect the expression of mature zzso Total zzso was zzso by zzso zzso and then zzso was zzso by a specific reverse zzso zzso primer and reverse zzso using the zzso total zzso as zzso The expression of several mature zzso was zzso by this zzso The expression profile of two zzso determined by the zzso chain reaction zzso zzso was identical to that determined by Northern zzso All these data show that the zzso zzso is a convenient method to detect the expression of zzso
