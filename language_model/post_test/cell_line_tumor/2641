Recent discoveries have indicated that the hormone zzso plays a major role in the control of iron zzso zzso regulates the iron level in the blood through the interaction with zzso an iron exporter zzso causing its zzso and zzso As a result, zzso increases cellular iron zzso and decreases the iron concentration in the zzso Only mature zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso has biological zzso however, zzso the zzso form, is also present in the zzso In this study, we aimed to identify new zzso interactions of zzso zzso and zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were carried out on a human liver zzso zzso zzso screening gave the following zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed strong interactions with zzso We further confirmed and examined the zzso zzso binding in zzso zzso zzso pull down, zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso binds zzso within the cell during zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso binds zzso significantly in the zzso This observation may explain the presence of zzso in the zzso as well as the zzso regulation of the mature hormone level in the zzso In addition, the lack of zzso protection in patients with zzso zzso zzso may be the reason for the zzso in their iron zzso
