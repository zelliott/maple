A series of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were designed on the basis of a model of the zzso binding site and zzso They are characterized by a zzso zzso capped with a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso are also zzso In an in zzso zzso with the zzso zzso a good correlation of the activity with the zzso energy was zzso In human zzso zzso zzso cells, selected compounds produced significant zzso of zzso and zzso Most compounds showed an zzso activity comparable to that of zzso At zzso zzso the tested compounds were more effective than zzso in inducing zzso cell zzso zzso selected for in zzso evaluation exhibited a significant zzso activity on three tumor models at well tolerated doses, thus suggesting a good therapeutic zzso
