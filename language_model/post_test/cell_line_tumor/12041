The complexes zzso zzso zzso and zzso where zzso and zzso is zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, have been prepared and structurally characterized by means zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso The crystal structures of the complexes zzso zzso and zzso have been determined by X-ray zzso The metal zzso geometry of zzso and zzso is described as distorted square zzso and the two complexes are zzso via zzso stacking interactions and zzso hydrogen zzso In these two cases molecular recognition of the hydrogen bonds leads to zzso and a zzso assembly of infinite two-dimensional zzso The metal zzso geometry of zzso is described as distorted zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zinc complexes have been evaluated for zzso activity in zzso against the cells of two human cancer cell zzso zzso zzso breast cancer cell zzso zzso zzso cancer cell line) and a mouse zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso activity shown by these compounds indicates that zzso of zzso and zzso to zzso metal center result in metallic complexes with important biological properties since they display zzso values in a zzso range similar to or better than that of the zzso drug zzso and are considered as agents with potential zzso activity candidates for further stages of screening in zzso and/or in zzso
