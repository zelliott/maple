zzso zzso B virus zzso infection is a major cause of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso large zzso surface protein zzso zzso which contains an zzso deletion of approximately 17 zzso acids in zzso is highly associated with risks and zzso of zzso zzso It was previously reported that zzso zzso interacts with the zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso a zinc zzso This promotes the degradation of the cell cycle regulator zzso and is believed to be the major mechanism for zzso zzso zzso In this study, it was found that the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso is facilitated by zzso metal zzso zzso The binding of zzso to zzso zzso requires the zzso zzso zzso zzso motif and zzso zzso that binds to zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso binds directly to zzso zzso in a zzso binding zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso which also contact zzso zzso are also indispensable for zzso zzso zzso degradation in human zzso zzso These results suggest that developing drugs that interrupt interactions between zzso zzso and zzso can be used to mitigate zzso zzso risks for zzso
