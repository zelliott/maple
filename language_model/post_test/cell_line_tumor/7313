zzso zzso is a member of the zzso protein family; these zzso proteins are involved in diverse biological processes such as cell zzso zzso zzso and either growth arrest or growth stimulation depending on the cellular zzso We studied the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso were decreased in zzso tumors compared with normal zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso interference in a well differentiated zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso its cellular zzso zzso zzso of the protein in the zzso zzso zzso cancer cell line decreased their growth zzso with increased zzso in liquid zzso These same cells had decreased zzso capacity and a nearly complete loss of zzso in zzso Furthermore, partially zzso zzso suppressed growth of zzso cancer zzso The increased zzso in these zzso cancer cells with forced zzso of zzso was associated with elevated expression of the zzso proteins zzso zzso and TRAIL zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso In zzso zzso cancer cells have decreased expression of zzso compared with normal zzso and this lowered expression may provide the transformed cells a growth advantage over their normal zzso
