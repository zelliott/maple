zzso zzso zzso zzso cells express high levels of zzso zzso 2 zzso Analysis of zzso samples of the zzso and of the paired normal zzso tissue confirmed that zzso transcripts for zzso 2 zzso were significantly more numerous in the zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso High levels of zzso zzso were not associated with age, sex, zzso size or zzso zzso zzso zzso was not zzso expressed throughout the zzso but was significantly higher at the zzso invasion zzso zzso growth factor zzso can zzso the expression of zzso zzso A marked increase in zzso zzso levels was observed in zzso primary zzso cultures after zzso stimulation zzso zzso zzso and in two zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso zzso involvement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was suggested by the observation that zzso an inhibitor of the zzso activity of zzso zzso caused a zzso reduction of the zzso growth zzso zzso zzso The possibility that zzso interactions also had a zzso role in the zzso of zzso in zzso was investigated in 30 zzso samples, where it was found that there was a statistically significant correlation zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso in the levels of expression of zzso and zzso zzso The biological role of zzso in zzso cells was investigated by treating the zzso cell lines with the specific zzso inhibitor zzso It was found that zzso treatment significantly reduced the migration zzso and zzso zzso of zzso cells, but did not alter cell zzso Our data suggest that the increased expression of Met protein in zzso cells has a role in zzso the expression of zzso which in turn contributes to the invasive capacity of zzso zzso
