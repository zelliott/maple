In the zzso era, a prediction of response to treatment could lead to better dose selection for patients in zzso To identify a zzso gene signature and zzso related signaling zzso four different zzso experiments were zzso before zzso 

zzso profiling data using zzso zzso and gene expression profiling data from four published zzso platforms applied to zzso cancer cell panel were zzso The survival fraction at zzso zzso range from 0 to 1) was calculated as a measure of zzso and a linear zzso model was applied to identify genes or a gene set with a correlation between expression and zzso zzso zzso signature genes were identified using significant analysis of zzso zzso and gene set analysis was performed using a global test using linear zzso zzso Using the zzso signaling zzso and identified zzso a genetic network was zzso According to zzso 31 genes were identified as common to all the zzso platforms and therefore a common zzso zzso In gene set analysis, functions in the cell cycle, DNA zzso and cell zzso including adherence and gap junctions were related to zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways were overrepresented in zzso zzso genes including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are zzso molecules that were identified by both SAM and gene set analysis, and showed interaction in the genetic network with the zzso signaling zzso 

zzso of four different zzso experiments and gene selection using gene set analysis discovered possible target genes and pathways relevant to zzso Our results suggested that the identified genes are candidates for zzso zzso and that zzso signaling via zzso molecules could be a target for zzso
