Lung cancer is one of the most common fatal diseases in the developed zzso The disease is rarely cured by currently available therapies, with an overall survival rate of zzso zzso novel proteins that offer crucial insights into the processes of lung zzso invasion and zzso may therefore provide much-needed zzso zzso and influence therapeutic zzso zzso function of the zzso family of zzso cell surface receptors is a common theme in zzso into novel zzso activity regulators may offer crucial insights into the processes of zzso invasion and zzso and may reveal insights into potential therapeutic zzso We previously described that depletion of the novel zzso domain protein zzso located at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reducing cell zzso We now show that depletion of zzso also now known as zzso causes zzso independence and a switch to a reduced zzso mode of cell zzso a novel zzso for this zzso zzso zzso lung zzso cells show increased rates of migration by zzso zzso zzso and increased capacity to invade into zzso despite having decreased zzso zzso We confirm greatly depleted zzso expression in small cell lung cancer zzso lines where a form of reduced zzso migration, zzso zzso migration, is a known zzso We propose that loss of zzso expression may cause increased cell migration and zzso in lung zzso
