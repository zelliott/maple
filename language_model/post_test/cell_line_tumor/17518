zzso zzso compounds showed interesting zzso properties on experimental models of solid zzso In line with the interesting results with zzso platinum complexes, which proved to overcome zzso resistance, we thought it worthwhile to test the pharmacological properties of some zzso zzso complexes to ascertain the possible advantages due to the introduction of a second metal zzso over zzso and its zzso zzso These compounds belong to the general formula zzso or zzso where L is a nitrogen donor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and X a zzso We focused on parameters related to zzso ability such as zzso activity, detected by zzso and invasive potential, measured by means of a zzso zzso These activities were correlated to the ability to inhibit zzso zzso in zzso All zzso complexes, except compound zzso zzso decrease the number of zzso cells that cross a zzso barrier, and inhibit zzso zzso activity at zzso lower than that of zzso and of other zzso zzso zzso In zzso compounds zzso zzso and D7 zzso zzso show zzso activity, at two dose levels, with mild or zzso effect on primary zzso zzso compound zzso is the weakest zzso All compounds tend to accumulate in liver and zzso rather than in zzso and zzso However, compound zzso the most active in zzso on invasion and zzso and active in zzso on zzso is better concentrated in the lungs than compound zzso which is less active or inactive in zzso and in zzso zzso analysis show liver, as well as kidney zzso that limit in zzso zzso These data thus suggest zzso zzso complexes as promising zzso agents for cancer zzso
