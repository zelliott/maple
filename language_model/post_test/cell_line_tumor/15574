An in zzso zzso zzso model system was used to study the effect of transforming growth zzso zzso on zzso in human zzso zzso zzso and primary human zzso zzso cells were cultured on zzso zzso zzso Administration of different zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to these cultures demonstrated a zzso dose response with zzso zzso zzso increasing the calcium content compared to control zzso zzso with zzso and zzso cultures were zzso An optimal dose of zzso zzso was provided to the cultures either in one single dose or multiple zzso Continuous administration of zzso zzso caused zzso zzso and zzso zzso increases in zzso compared to the control and zzso single dose zzso Single administration of the zzso dose at zzso had no significant effect on the calcium content in either cell culture compared to zzso Two weeks continuous administration of zzso zzso in both cell cultures resulted in significant increases in the expression of bone specific zzso zzso proteins which included alkaline zzso Type I zzso and zzso as measured by Northern zzso analysis and zzso At 4 weeks, the zzso level of Type I collagen was still significantly higher in the zzso treatment group compared to zzso In conclusion, zzso enhances zzso of zzso on implant zzso
