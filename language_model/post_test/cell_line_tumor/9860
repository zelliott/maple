The zzso a zzso zzso is responsible for the generation of most zzso class I zzso zzso a zzso zzso is clinically approved for treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell zzso In the present study, we investigated the effect of zzso on viral zzso zzso of zzso mice with the zzso zzso virus zzso led to a decreased zzso T cell response to several zzso zzso T cell zzso zzso treatment caused a reduced expansion of zzso T zzso and increased viral zzso in zzso zzso Administration of zzso during expansion of zzso T cells had no influence on the zzso T cell response, suggesting that zzso interferes with zzso of zzso T zzso Indeed, determination of zzso load in zzso 4 days post infection, revealed a reduced presentation of zzso zzso T cell zzso on zzso class I zzso In zzso we show that zzso zzso with zzso led to an increased zzso to viral infection, and demonstrate for the first time, that zzso zzso can alter zzso processing in zzso
