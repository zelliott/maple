A zzso zzso zzso zzso was designed and employed for zzso gene delivery in zzso and in zzso Initially, a new zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso terminal group zzso as zzso was zzso by zzso reaction of an excess amount of zzso zzso and 1, zzso The zzso was then chemically zzso with 5 zzso zzso zzso to yield zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso This zzso was capable of binding genes to form zzso zzso with a zzso surface zzso Moreover, a sufficient gene release from the zzso in response to an zzso reducing environment was zzso In zzso zzso against zzso and zzso cells showed that zzso zzso effectively zzso the cells with comparable efficiency to that of 2 zzso zzso or linear zzso as positive zzso Besides, intravenous administration of the zzso zzso in nude mice afforded zzso gene expression largely in the zzso zzso the zzso revealed low zzso in zzso as determined by zzso zzso and caused no death of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso holds high potential as a zzso zzso for gene zzso
