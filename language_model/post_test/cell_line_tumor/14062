A significant problem encountered in the treatment of cancer patients is that cancer cells often evolve resistance to zzso zzso One of the mechanisms responsible for drug resistance is gene zzso The study of the behavior of genes zzso drug resistance is very important to determine future treatments for cancer patients that will minimize the effect of gene zzso One of the best methods to investigate this phenomenon is to use zzso zzso to directly access the amplified gene or zzso In the present study, zzso zzso and fluorescent zzso zzso zzso were applied for the identification of genes residing in a zzso zzso region zzso in drug-resistant cell zzso developed by treatment of the zzso leukemia cell line zzso with increasing levels of the zzso zzso We have demonstrated that the selection by zzso actually elevated the level of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso We argue that the breakage fusion bridge zzso cycle offers a plausible explanation for this zzso The DNA prepared from the amplified regions by zzso zzso provides a resource for future investigations looking for the possible presence of novel genes contributing to drug zzso
