New zzso strategy should be investigated to enhance clinical management in human zzso Recently, zzso acid zzso as a naturally occurring zzso zzso has exhibited a potent zzso activity in various zzso cells but remains uncertain in human zzso zzso Here, we examined whether zzso could suppress the proliferation of human zzso cell line zzso and if so, its possible molecular zzso Cell survival, zzso and molecular targets were identified by multiple detecting techniques, including zzso blue dye exclusion zzso electron zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The results showed that zzso of zzso suppressed proliferation and induced zzso of zzso cells in zzso and zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso of zzso and markedly suppressed levels of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The expression of programmed cell death 4 zzso which is a zzso targeting zzso zzso has also been enhanced by zzso And zzso of zzso in zzso cells abolished the enhancement of zzso protein by zzso More importantly, zzso zzso as critical upstream regulators of zzso has also been suppressed by zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso cell growth via causing zzso in zzso cells by a zzso zzso zzso This study provides an evidence for testing zzso efficacy in zzso and zzso future investigations examining the clinical potential of zzso in human zzso
