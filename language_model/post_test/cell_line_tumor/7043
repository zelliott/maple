To investigate the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso in liver zzso cell line zzso 

Growth zzso by zzso was analyzed using 3- zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were detected using zzso zzso zzso and confirmed by flow zzso analysis and DNA fragmentation zzso The expression of zzso A and B1 were determined by flow zzso and Western zzso zzso V zzso was measured by flow zzso zzso 

zzso induced zzso and then inhibited cell proliferation in liver zzso cell line zzso zzso treated with zzso 50 zzso for 15 h were arrested in zzso with zzso expression of zzso A and a little change in zzso zzso Almost all the zzso occurred in cells undergoing the zzso after treatment for 24 zzso 

zzso induced zzso specific zzso in zzso involving zzso zzso
