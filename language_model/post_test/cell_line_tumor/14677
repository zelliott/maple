Given the fact that zzso zzso zzso zzso causes complex zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso ducts during male embryonic development, we examined whether zzso could affect similar cell properties such as migration and invasion that could contribute ultimately to zzso of zzso arising from zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing cell lines found to be invasive and migratory in zzso are examined in an in zzso zzso that is zzso 

We designed in zzso and in zzso experiments to determine if zzso inhibited the movement of cancer lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso in cell culture zzso chamber zzso and in chick zzso zzso zzso 

zzso at zzso below those that inhibit cell zzso blocked in zzso invasion and in zzso migration of zzso cancer cells that express the zzso zzso 

While our laboratory has previously established zzso as an inhibitor of cancer cell proliferation using in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso we now show that zzso can also inhibit in zzso tumor zzso
