In previous studies, we have shown that the zzso rat zzso zzso zzso is capable to induce zzso of advanced symptomatic rat and human zzso in a rat model, when the virus was injected in the tumor zzso or zzso zzso with zzso did not provoke any pathology in zzso zzso This study addresses the question whether also zzso application of this zzso virus is suitable and sufficient for treating zzso in this animal zzso 

zzso zzso or human zzso zzso cells were grafted zzso in the brain of rats zzso or zzso respectively), and after development of tumors visible by zzso zzso was instilled zzso zzso zzso was monitored by zzso and survival was analyzed by zzso zzso zzso from sacrificed animals were analyzed for zzso zzso presence of viral DNA and proteins and infectious zzso In addition, distribution of virus to other zzso was zzso 

A single zzso zzso of zzso was sufficient to induce efficient zzso of rat zzso leading to significant zzso of survival without any toxicity for other zzso It is shown that the virus reaches brain and other zzso and that the viral zzso (and zzso regulatory proteins are exclusively expressed in the tumor zzso In rats with zzso of human zzso zzso activity of zzso was less zzso however, leading to significant zzso of zzso 

In view of an ongoing clinical trial on the use of zzso for zzso zzso of zzso the option of applying the virus zzso may be a valuable alternative to invasive routes of zzso
