We here report that zzso cluster is a novel target for zzso zzso repression under zzso We found the expression levels of zzso cluster were reduced in zzso cells containing zzso zzso but were unchanged in zzso zzso zzso The repression of zzso cluster under zzso is independent of zzso zzso reporter zzso mapped the region responding to zzso repression to a zzso site in the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and gel zzso zzso revealed that the binding sites for zzso and the zzso protein zzso overlap within the zzso zzso these proteins were found to compete for zzso Finally, we show that zzso expression correlated well with zzso status in zzso zzso zzso zzso cluster markedly zzso zzso zzso whereas blocked zzso and zzso sensitize the cells to zzso zzso These data indicated that zzso repression of zzso expression likely has an important function in zzso zzso and thus further our understanding of the zzso zzso function of zzso
