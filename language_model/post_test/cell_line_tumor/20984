Breast zzso zzso human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso have been reported to have higher zzso and zzso activity in the presence of zzso zzso zzso indicating potential cooperation between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso during breast cancer zzso zzso can induce the zzso zzso of zzso which stimulates zzso protein zzso zzso zzso To determine if this zzso of zzso by zzso contributes to zzso therapy resistance we examined the potential of combining zzso with a zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso as a novel therapeutic zzso Two zzso human breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso that zzso zzso and zzso to different degrees were chosen for this zzso The zzso status of zzso and zzso of zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso were examined in response to zzso zzso or a combination of the two in either the absence or presence of zzso zzso As a single agent, zzso was more effective than zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was superior at blocking zzso and zzso zzso zzso was also able to directly inhibit the zzso zzso The combination of zzso and zzso had an additive zzso effect on zzso and zzso zzso confirming that the zzso signaling is a zzso zzso shared by both zzso and the zzso Combination of zzso and zzso also zzso inhibited cell proliferation in zzso and in zzso as measured by zzso of the growth of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso nude zzso We conclude that an zzso and zzso regimen may offer a new approach to treat zzso breast zzso
