zzso zzso agents are widely prescribed drugs for the treatment of systemic zzso zzso however, since their introduction into the market, increasing zzso of zzso have been zzso zzso we examined here the ability of three structurally different zzso drugs, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to induce the zzso an zzso known to play an important role in chemical zzso of zzso to toxic zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso induced the zzso in zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso cells at the zzso protein and activity levels in a zzso and zzso zzso The increases in zzso zzso levels zzso by zzso and zzso were completely blocked by the zzso synthesis zzso zzso D, whereas the level of existing zzso was not altered, zzso a requirement of de zzso zzso synthesis through a zzso zzso The ability of these drugs to directly activate the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso transformation and hence zzso responsive zzso binding was strongly correlated with their abilities to induce zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso and zzso in addition to being zzso zzso are zzso and competitive zzso This study provides the first evidence for the ability of zzso and zzso to induce the zzso gene expression through an zzso zzso and suggests a novel mechanism of the zzso and zzso zzso
