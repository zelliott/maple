zzso zzso is a highly lethal and aggressive disease with early zzso strong invasion and poor zzso Most patients with this disease are at the advanced and zzso stage and should be considered for zzso treatment such as chemotherapy and zzso Unfortunately, reports of chemotherapy and zzso for gallbladder zzso are zzso We investigated the influence of zzso zzso on zzso zzso gene proteins zzso and zzso of human gallbladder zzso zzso cells in zzso 

zzso cell lines of human gallbladder zzso were cultured by the cell culture zzso The experiment was divided into zzso group and control zzso The zzso zzso zzso was used to evaluate cell zzso The zzso complex method was used to determine the expressions of zzso gene proteins zzso and zzso of human gallbladder zzso zzso zzso 

zzso inhibited the growth and proliferation of zzso cells from 10 zzso or after 6 hours in a zzso zzso manner, with the zzso value of zzso zzso at 48 zzso After treatment with zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins were decreased zzso 

zzso zzso the proliferation of human gallbladder zzso zzso cells in zzso and the expression of their zzso gene proteins zzso and zzso
