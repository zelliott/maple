zzso drugs induce zzso to cancer cells and also exhibit zzso toxicity to normal zzso Therefore development of novel agents triggering zzso and have low toxicity towards normal cells is most zzso zzso acids suppress zzso cell growth through zzso but the underlying mechanism is poorly zzso zzso we describe the zzso potential of a zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso which zzso zzso through generation of both zzso and NO in zzso resistant zzso zzso zzso zzso Present study zzso that zzso selectively kills zzso cells irrespective of their drug resistant zzso We also determined the crystal structure of zzso to understand the structural requirements for zzso the study reveals that the presence of zzso zzso acid groups zzso zzso the generation of NO possibly through auto zzso Along with the induction of zzso 3 zzso intrinsic zzso zzso also activates zzso dependent zzso cascade and zzso zzso expression in a time dependent manner possibly due to increased zzso and NO production and simultaneous decrease in cellular zzso zzso Thus zzso and NO zzso downstream zzso are essential for the zzso effect of zzso Therefore zzso having a structurally relevant zzso provides important insight into the development of new zzso and zzso generating chemicals inducing zzso dependent zzso
