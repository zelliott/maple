zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso are zzso by the human gut zzso zzso studies have disclosed a link between the formation of the zzso zzso zzso and prostate cancer zzso We evaluated the effects of zzso zzso and five zzso on two prostate cancer cell lines by determining DNA integrity and cell zzso zzso cells contain the zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas Los Angeles prostate cancer zzso cells express the zzso zzso both of which may affect responses to zzso DNA integrity was determined using the comet zzso Cell growth was assessed by zzso DNA with zzso zzso zzso steroid hormones, but not zzso induced DNA strand zzso zzso zzso the growth of both cell zzso zzso increased the growth of zzso but not zzso cells, pointing to an involvement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso did not stimulate growth in either prostate cancer cell zzso However, the growth of zzso and zzso cells was suppressed by zzso zzso concentration 50 % zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the growth of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso but not of zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso do not damage DNA or promote growth of zzso prostate cancer zzso Several zzso including the reduced zzso zzso zzso and zzso suppress cancer cell zzso Taken together, these data suggest a contribution of zzso zzso zzso to the beneficial effects of dietary zzso on prostate cancer zzso
