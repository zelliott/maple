The properties and regulation of zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso cells have been zzso zzso zzso release from both cell lines was almost completely inhibited by zzso zzso , was more effective at zzso zzso zzso release from zzso than from zzso zzso On the basis of comparing zzso zzso and zzso zzso time courses, it appears that zzso zzso zzso does not zzso zzso zzso channels in zzso 231 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso release from zzso cells but not from zzso zzso The effect of zzso was zzso by zzso and was dependent upon external calcium and inhibited by zzso However, zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso from both zzso and zzso cells even in the absence of zzso added zzso suggesting that it acts directly on the zzso zzso zzso and/or is zzso the effect of zzso released from the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso cells was zzso by zzso In contrast, zzso had no effect on zzso release from zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso regulate zzso transport in zzso 231 cells via more than one type of zzso
