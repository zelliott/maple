zzso zzso complexes of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso acids of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were obtained in zzso zzso the first two in acid, the other two in alkaline zzso They were characterized by infrared and zzso zzso zzso zzso and differential zzso zzso data and magnetic zzso zzso The complexes were found to be zzso possessing the zzso zzso and the thorough analysis of the spectral data allowed the determination of the characteristics of the zzso zzso The biological activities of these complexes on the zzso differentiation and zzso consumption were tested on zzso cells in zzso Comparisons of these effects and those of the zzso zzso zzso and the free zzso were zzso Different behaviors could be observed for the complexes obtained at zzso or alkaline zzso as well as for the different cellular zzso The free zzso did not show any biological zzso
