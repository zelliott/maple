zzso is a zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso factor with a high expression level in adult zzso The activity of zzso is inhibited by growth factors through zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso and decreases the level of zzso in the zzso In the present study, we examined the regulation of zzso by zzso zzso factor zzso in zzso acid zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso caused a rapid and zzso decrease of nuclear zzso with a corresponding increase of zzso zzso The rate of the zzso zzso zzso was consistent with the time course of zzso zzso of zzso and was zzso by the zzso signaling zzso Active zzso rapidly increased the level of zzso zzso zzso in differentiated zzso cells, and zzso decreased the zzso increase of zzso through zzso of both zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso agent, significantly decreased zzso of zzso and increased nuclear and decreased zzso zzso suggesting that zzso activates zzso Treatment with zzso completely reversed and blocked the zzso zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso In addition, protein zzso zzso zzso increased zzso of zzso decreased nuclear zzso and blocked zzso activity of zzso The regulatory effect of zzso on zzso and its target genes may play a significant role in the zzso zzso survival, zzso and zzso
