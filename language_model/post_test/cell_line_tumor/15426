zzso I zzso zzso DNA zzso by forming transient zzso complexes zzso zzso and downstream of zzso zzso zzso can be trapped by zzso and zzso DNA zzso and by zzso resulting in zzso zzso Here, we undertook zzso analysis of zzso cells at zzso zzso zzso samples from zzso and zzso cells were analyzed with the zzso zzso zzso platform, allowing high-resolution mapping along zzso zzso Long genes that are highly expressed were the most susceptible to zzso whereas short genes were zzso zzso Along the body of zzso zzso was most important toward the zzso and increased with the number of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes were selectively zzso Parallel analysis of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso platform revealed that zzso was highly induced by zzso More than zzso of the zzso genes were targets of this zzso zzso Our study shows the profound impact of zzso on zzso zzso especially at zzso junctions and on transcript stability by zzso zzso zzso
