zzso repressive complex 2 zzso and its core member zzso of zzso zzso 2 zzso mediate the zzso gene zzso mark: zzso of zzso 27 on zzso 3 zzso zzso is characteristic of the zzso at genes involved in zzso regulation in zzso zzso zzso of zzso has been found in several cancer types such as breast, zzso melanoma and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso is associated with highly zzso and aggressive types of breast and prostate zzso We have analyzed the abundance of zzso and zzso using zzso in two large and zzso breast tumor data sets encompassing more than 400 zzso The results have been analyzed in relation to the molecular zzso of breast tumors zzso zzso A, zzso B, zzso and zzso as well as in zzso defined by clinical markers zzso negative, zzso zzso and zzso and were validated in representative breast cancer cell lines by western zzso We found significantly different expression of both zzso and zzso across all zzso with high abundance of zzso in zzso triple negative and zzso tumors, and high zzso in zzso A, zzso and zzso zzso zzso the two markers show an inverse zzso particularly for the zzso and triple negative zzso zzso high expression of zzso was associated with poor distant zzso survival whereas high expression of zzso was associated with better zzso Additionally, none of 182 breast tumors was found to carry a previously described zzso zzso affecting zzso Our observation that increased expression of zzso does not necessarily correlate with increased abundance of zzso supports the idea that zzso can have effects beyond zzso zzso of target genes in breast zzso
