To evaluate the diagnostic and zzso potential of a new zzso contrast zzso zzso for zzso characterizing tumor zzso by zzso and monitoring response to zzso zzso 

Dynamic zzso zzso zzso was performed in an experimental cancer model with the use of the novel zzso agent zzso a low molecular contrast agent zzso and a zzso contrast zzso zzso zzso a human cancer cell line, was implanted in 22 zzso zzso Animals were assigned randomly to a control zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed at baseline and after nine days of zzso The zzso zzso zzso and the fractional blood volume zzso were estimated from the kinetic analysis of dynamic MR data using a zzso zzso zzso growth was also measured from zzso zzso 

zzso grew more slowly, although not significantly zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso determined for zzso decreased significantly in the zzso group compared to baseline zzso zzso and progressed significantly in the control zzso However, no significant changes were resolved with the use of zzso or zzso 

With the use of appropriate contrast media, the therapeutic effects of an zzso zzso on tumor zzso can be monitored by dynamic zzso The dynamic range of zzso to zzso and the sensitivity to change of this zzso suggest a potential application in the clinical zzso
