It is generally accepted that the availability of vitamin K in zzso depends on its zzso the biological activities of which would differ among zzso To test this hypothesis, we examined the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso compounds in two cultured human cell lines zzso and zzso zzso extracts were prepared from the cells and media after 1, 3, and zzso of zzso The detection of the vitamin K zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was carried out with zzso as previously zzso The zzso of vitamin K was replaced with atmospheric zzso during the formation of vitamin K zzso with a zzso zzso zzso As a result, a significant difference was observed between zzso and zzso in the amounts taken up into the zzso The zzso zzso was rapidly and remarkably well absorbed into the cells and zzso to the zzso form via a zzso form as compared to the zzso zzso The difference in zzso of zzso and zzso was not affected by treatment with zzso although the metabolism of both compounds was markedly zzso This methodology should be zzso to clarify some of the actions of vitamin K in target cells and facilitate the development of new vitamin K zzso
