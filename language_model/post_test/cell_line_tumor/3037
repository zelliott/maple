zzso in protein expression associated with zzso resistance in a panel of zzso derived from the poorly differentiated zzso cell lung zzso zzso were investigated using zzso zzso Of the 80 proteins identified as being zzso zzso 32 correlated to zzso zzso zzso proteins showed positive correlations with drug resistance, 11 correlated directly with increase in the resistance (including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso while 13 proteins (including zzso K and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased to a similar level in all drug-resistant zzso Fewer proteins showed an inverse correlation with zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1) displayed a similar decrease in all zzso and six (including zzso zzso and zzso correlated zzso with zzso Three proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso 1) correlated with the invasive status of these zzso Some expected targets of zzso action showed correlation with resistance including zzso zzso for DNA damage zzso while others proteins involved in protection from zzso production (such as zzso zzso and zzso did zzso The zzso analysis revealed a large number of changes in protein expression that may contribute to a more zzso zzso Many of these changes could provide novel targets for overcoming zzso
