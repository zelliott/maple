The zzso tumor zzso protein is involved in zzso and cell cycle zzso We have shown recently that zzso also zzso base zzso repair zzso To further examine zzso involvement in the regulation of zzso we chose to focus on zzso DNA zzso zzso DNA zzso the first zzso acting in the zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso activity was found to be modulated by the zzso zzso This zzso was dependent on the type of zzso stress zzso zzso damage resulted in zzso of zzso which was enhanced by zzso zzso and hydrogen zzso zzso treatment, although inducing zzso stabilization, did not cause the zzso of zzso zzso oxide zzso resulted in zzso of zzso DNA zzso zzso this zzso was down regulated by zzso zzso The down regulation of zzso DNA zzso activity was due to trans repression of zzso zzso by zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso zzso zzso activity was not altered by zzso Our study provides evidence for a possible zzso role for zzso following exposure of cells to NO zzso In the absence of zzso NO exposure results in zzso of zzso DNA zzso activity that results in zzso in the number of zzso sites in zzso At the same time, zzso activity does not rise and removal of the zzso sites is not further processed resulting in a zzso zzso When zzso is present, it down regulates the zzso of zzso DNA zzso This provides a new model by which zzso prevents the creation of a zzso zzso
