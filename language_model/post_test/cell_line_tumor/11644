zzso is a soy zzso that has zzso activity both in zzso and in zzso It has been shown that zzso zzso many type of zzso including prostate cancer zzso by regulating several cell signaling pathways and zzso zzso Recent studies suggest that the long zzso zzso zzso are also involved in many cellular zzso At present there are no reports about the relationship between zzso zzso and zzso In this study, we focused on zzso zzso that are regulated by zzso and investigated their functional role in zzso 

zzso zzso zzso Human GE zzso was used for expression profiling of zzso treated and control zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso migration, invasion, zzso and cell cycle zzso were performed with the zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso Both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso models were used for growth zzso zzso reporter zzso were used for binding of zzso to zzso 

zzso profiling showed that zzso was highly regulated by zzso and its expression was higher in zzso zzso cell lines than in normal prostate zzso zzso zzso of zzso decreased zzso cell zzso migration and invasion and induced zzso and cell cycle zzso zzso was also zzso by zzso and may directly target zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Our results indicated that zzso inhibited zzso cell growth through zzso of zzso zzso that is also targeted by tumor zzso zzso These findings enhance understanding of how zzso regulates zzso zzso and zzso in zzso
