The efficacy of many zzso agents can be attenuated by expression of the zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso 7 and 9 zzso that zzso inhibit expression of zzso We have investigated the ability of zzso and zzso to sensitize a panel of leukemia cell lines to zzso and zzso Both drugs acutely zzso most of the leukemia lines to zzso with zzso zzso in 4 zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso freshly isolated chronic zzso leukemia cells to zzso This rapid induction of zzso was attributed to zzso zzso of zzso because zzso zzso and zzso failed to induce zzso when combined with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso activity and prevented zzso zzso zzso did not zzso zzso induced by zzso which does not activate zzso in these zzso and zzso zzso cells failed to activate zzso in response to zzso and were not sensitive to combinations of zzso and zzso or zzso The rapid induction of zzso by this combination in multiple cell systems but not in normal zzso provides justification for performing a clinical trial to assess the efficacy in zzso
