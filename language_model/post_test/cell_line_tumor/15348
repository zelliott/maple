Patients with zzso typically present when tumors are at an advanced zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso chemotherapy are currently the standard of care for zzso However, due to the zzso and zzso nature of the zzso recurrence rate remains high and typically results in very poor zzso Efforts to treat the primary tumor are, therefore, zzso rather than zzso From a practical perspective, controlling growth and zzso of the recurrence may have a greater impact on zzso zzso In order for cells to zzso they must first zzso from the zzso Preventing detachment may keep tumors that recur more localized and perhaps more amenable to zzso Here we introduce a new perspective in which a quantifiable mechanical property, namely tissue surface tension, can provide novel information on tumor zzso The overall theme of the discussion will attempt to integrate how zzso molecules can alter a zzso mechanical properties and how, in turn, these properties can be modified to prevent tumor cell detachment and zzso
