The human serum zzso tissue inhibitor of zzso 2 zzso is known to possess zzso activity, which has been attributed to its ability to inhibit zzso cell proliferation by binding to zzso zzso In this study, a fusion zzso zzso zzso zzso formed by zzso zzso with a zzso zzso and its zzso and zzso compounds, were zzso and evaluated with in zzso tumor imaging using single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso bonding of the zzso zzso to the side chain zzso groups of zzso from a zzso reaction involving from zzso with zzso zzso This zzso improved the zzso effect of zzso in cancer zzso The zzso and zzso fusion proteins were prepared and subsequently injected into the tail veins of mice bearing human zzso cancer zzso zzso for zzso and PET imaging and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was high in both the PET images and in the zzso studies at 3 h after zzso These studies demonstrated that the new fusion protein has potential not only as an zzso agent but also as a zzso for the diagnosis of zzso
