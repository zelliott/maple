We developed and describe a practical method by which primary prostate cancer specimens can be screened for zzso zzso zzso which is a potential source of fusion zzso as well as a process by which identified zzso can be mapped to define the genes zzso 

A series of 7 prostate cancer cell lines and 25 zzso established primary cell cultures, which were zzso from tissue harvested at 16 radical zzso and 9 channel zzso prostate zzso were screened for zzso zzso using zzso in zzso zzso zzso A series of zzso in zzso zzso based zzso mapping experiments were performed to identify candidate genes involved in regions associated with zzso zzso 

Our analysis identified the repetition of 2 zzso in prostate cancer lines, that is zzso and zzso at a frequency of zzso and zzso zzso More significantly 4 of the 25 subsequently established primary cultures zzso also revealed a zzso zzso Using the zzso cell line the zzso involved were mapped to the zzso region and a number of candidate genes were zzso 

We found that the zzso zzso is also a repeat event in primary cell cultures from zzso prostate zzso zzso mapping showed that the gene zzso loses its promoter and first zzso as a direct result of the zzso in the zzso zzso As such, we identified it as a possible contributor to a putative fusion gene in prostate zzso
