zzso a zzso factor, has been reported to induce zzso T zzso zzso In the present study, we zzso zzso genes into a gastric cancer cell line zzso and analyzed the effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso We revealed that zzso zzso show significantly stronger adherence and zzso to zzso zzso cells zzso than to their parent zzso zzso We also demonstrated that mice zzso with zzso cells in the zzso cavity have a significantly better survival rate than those zzso with zzso cells zzso test, zzso zzso findings showed that zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso but can scarcely be observed in the zzso associated with zzso zzso These findings indicate that the zzso may play an important role in suppressing zzso zzso by the mechanism of enhanced zzso and that zzso gene zzso might be effective against zzso zzso of gastric zzso
