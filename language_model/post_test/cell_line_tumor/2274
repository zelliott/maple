zzso imaging can provide a level of zzso that is not possible in what might be termed traditional zzso zzso This is due to the fact that the current state-of-the-art zzso screening systems take the approach of zzso single cell zzso and are therefore based on essentially pictorial measures as zzso zzso Such zzso analyses have become extremely zzso advancing screening enormously, but this approach can still be somewhat zzso We describe the development, and zzso of a zzso zzso screening platform that combines zzso zzso zzso imaging with zzso lifetime imaging zzso This functional approach allows objective, quantitative screening of small zzso libraries in zzso interaction zzso We discuss the development of the zzso the process by which information on zzso resonance energy transfer zzso can be extracted from zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging and cross-checking of this zzso using lifetime imaging by zzso zzso zzso Imaging of cells expressing protein zzso where zzso and zzso are linked with zzso chains of various lengths zzso 19 and 32 zzso zzso shows the two zzso to be highly zzso We validate our approach using a small-scale inhibitor screen of a zzso zzso zzso probe expressed in zzso cancer cells zzso in a 96 zzso zzso We also show that zzso zzso zzso can be used to measure variations in zzso in zzso zzso We demonstrate this using a screen of zzso of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso These zzso enable us to demonstrate all the capabilities of the zzso image processing and zzso techniques that have been zzso zzso correlation between zzso zzso and donor zzso is observed for zzso zzso providing an opportunity to rapidly screen zzso interacting on the zzso scale, using zzso zzso
