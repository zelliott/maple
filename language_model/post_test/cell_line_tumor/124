The zzso zzso zzso drug, zzso has previously been shown to inhibit plasma membrane electron transport and cell proliferation and promote zzso in a range of cancer cell lines and in zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso cells and human zzso vein zzso zzso 

We determined the effects of zzso on plasma membrane electron zzso zzso responses and viability of activated and resting human T zzso In addition, we evaluated the effect of zzso on the viability of zzso cell lines and primary zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

We demonstrated that zzso inhibited plasma membrane electron transport and cell proliferation zzso 46 zzso and zzso zzso zzso and promoted zzso of rapidly zzso human T cells but did not affect resting T zzso zzso also induced zzso in T cells zzso in zzso zzso mixed zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells in the mixed zzso reaction remained viable and could be zzso in a third party mixed zzso reaction, in the absence of zzso In addition, we demonstrated that zzso blasts from patients with primary acute zzso leukemia zzso and acute zzso leukemia zzso were sensitive to zzso The zzso zzso blasts were more sensitive than the zzso zzso blasts to 10 zzso zzso exposure for zzso zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, zzso 

The ability of zzso to kill rapidly zzso zzso makes this drug a promising candidate for the treatment of zzso zzso such as those in acute zzso zzso or diseases driven by zzso proliferation such as zzso diseases and zzso zzso
