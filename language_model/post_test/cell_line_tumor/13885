The large zzso zzso toxin A and toxin B from zzso zzso are major zzso factors known to cause zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both toxins zzso and thereby zzso small zzso of the zzso zzso Recently, it was reported that toxin B, but not toxin A, zzso pore formation in zzso of target cells under zzso zzso Here, we zzso data on pore formation of toxin A in cells derived from human colon zzso Treatment of zzso cells with native or zzso toxin A resulted in an increased zzso of radioactive zzso induced by an zzso zzso The efficacy of pore formation was dependent on membrane cholesterol, since cholesterol depletion of zzso with zzso inhibited zzso zzso and cholesterol zzso zzso zzso activity of toxin zzso Similar results were obtained with toxin zzso zzso zzso treatment delayed intoxication of cells in a zzso zzso In black zzso zzso toxin A induced zzso pores only in cholesterol containing zzso and at low zzso In contrast, release of zzso structures by zzso specific zzso C treatment did not reduce cell sensitivity toward toxins A and zzso These data indicate that in zzso cells toxin A zzso pore formation in an zzso environment zzso zzso similar to that reported for toxin B and suggest that pore formation by zzso zzso toxins depends on the presence of zzso
