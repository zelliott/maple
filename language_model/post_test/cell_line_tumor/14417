zzso of gene expression is essential for understanding the role of a given gene in normal cell growth or disease zzso Recently, newly described zzso have been shown to play a key role in the regulation of gene zzso in particular, deregulation of zzso is often associated with a variety of human disorders including zzso Although zzso are small zzso molecules with about zzso zzso in length and detection of their expression is believed to be challenging, with the introduction of modified zzso such as locked zzso acid, the specificity and sensitivity of detection have been greatly zzso There are many methods developed for zzso zzso but our focus in this chapter is on in zzso zzso zzso detection of zzso We have successfully used zzso to detect several zzso in zzso tumor specimens or zzso in zzso
