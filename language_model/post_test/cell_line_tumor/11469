Currently, no clinical imaging zzso is used routinely to assess tumor response to cancer therapies within hours to days of the delivery of zzso Here, the authors demonstrate the efficacy of ultrasound at a clinically relevant frequency to zzso detect changes in tumors in response to cancer therapies using zzso mouse zzso 

Conventional zzso and corresponding zzso ultrasound zzso from 4 to 28 zzso were used along with quantitative zzso and signal envelope statistical analyses on data obtained from zzso tumors treated with chemotherapy, zzso radiation, as well as a novel vascular targeting zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso indicated significant changes in zzso associated parameters in responsive zzso zzso changes in the zzso fit, spectral zzso and zzso intercept zzso were investigated for different types of treatment and demonstrated zzso related zzso The zzso fit and zzso intercept zzso derived from zzso data demonstrated increases ranging approximately from 0 to 6 zzso and 0 to 8 zzso respectively, depending on treatments zzso These data paralleled results observed for zzso ultrasound zzso zzso analysis of ultrasound signal envelope was performed as an alternative method to obtain zzso zzso and provided zzso zzso zzso analysis of tumor specimens indicated up to zzso cell death present in the tumors depending on treatments zzso consistent with quantitative ultrasound findings indicating cell zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a good correlation with zzso zzso findings indicative of cell death zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso the results provide zzso evidence, for the first time, that quantitative ultrasound used at a clinically relevant frequency, in addition to zzso zzso can detect tissue changes associated with cell death in zzso in response to cancer zzso
