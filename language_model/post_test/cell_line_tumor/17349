zzso hormone receptors zzso in human zzso zzso are potential targets for diagnostic zzso and zzso One such zzso is the zzso Y zzso zzso zzso primarily feeding behavior in the brain but shown recently to play a role in breast zzso In this study, the presence of zzso receptors was evaluated in another group of zzso tumors, namely zzso tumors, using in zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso selective zzso zzso all 10 investigated zzso zzso cell tumors, zzso cell tumors, and zzso cell tumors expressed zzso zzso In contrast, receptors were found in only seven of 22 zzso zzso zzso zzso characterization of the expressed zzso zzso zzso in the various tumors revealed the presence of zzso zzso or zzso In addition, zzso receptors were observed in zzso and zzso blood vessels as zzso zzso receptors were not expressed in three zzso zzso three borderline tumors, four zzso and zzso and one zzso This is the first time that zzso receptors are described in human zzso zzso They may play a role in the zzso and also in the zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, the high zzso and density of zzso receptors in sex zzso tumors suggest that these receptors represent a new potential target for the diagnostic and therapeutic administration of zzso zzso in these zzso
