zzso cancer has the highest mortality rate of all zzso zzso zzso a novel member of the inhibitor of zzso protein family, has been found to be expressed in various zzso and is suggested to have poor zzso zzso However, no data are available concerning the significance of zzso in zzso zzso In the present study, we detected the expression of zzso zzso in human zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso using zzso zzso and western zzso zzso The data indicated that zzso expression positive ratio was much higher in cancer zzso compared to those in benign zzso tumors and normal zzso zzso To determine the role of zzso in the process of zzso cancer growth, zzso interference zzso by zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso was applied to induce a long-lasting zzso of zzso gene expression in zzso human zzso cancer cell zzso Cell zzso and zzso were evaluated by zzso zzso and flow zzso respectively, following zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso of molecular markers of the zzso zzso signaling zzso was investigated by zzso zzso zzso with zzso enhanced spontaneous and drug-induced zzso in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso resulted in profound zzso and zzso effects, and was associated with the zzso of zzso zzso In conclusion, these data suggested that zzso plays an important role in zzso the zzso of zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression could promote cell zzso enhance chemotherapy sensitivity and may be a promising target for further research in clinical chemotherapy of zzso zzso zzso
