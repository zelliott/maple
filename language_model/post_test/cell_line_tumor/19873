The association between zzso zzso and zzso is still zzso The anatomical zzso of zzso by zzso zzso could be a factor for reducing pregnancy rates and increasing miscarriage zzso However, pregnancy and zzso rates were found to be significantly lower in women with zzso zzso zzso when there was no zzso of zzso zzso This could be due to other biological factors such as increased zzso of inflammatory cells within zzso tissue and corresponding zzso that might impair zzso zzso we tried to investigate the pattern of zzso zzso zzso in different zzso zzso and the production of zzso and zzso zzso by these zzso 

The selection criteria of zzso zzso were based on the zzso of European Society of zzso zzso specimens were collected from respective zzso and zzso zzso of 20 women with zzso zzso zzso 29 women with zzso and 18 women with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified in these zzso by zzso A fraction of corresponding zzso were zzso and levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and corresponding zzso of women with zzso and zzso was significantly higher than that of women with zzso or control women ( zzso and zzso zzso This tissue zzso of inflammatory cells was independent of the sizes of the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The tissue concentration of zzso corresponded to increased zzso zzso and was significantly higher in women with zzso and zzso than that in women with zzso ( zzso for zzso A positive correlation was observed between zzso concentration and accumulated zzso numbers in the zzso of women with zzso and zzso but not in women with zzso The tissue levels of zzso were also significantly higher in the zzso and corresponding zzso of women with zzso and zzso than that in zzso or control women ( zzso for zzso 

Higher production of zzso could be responsible for the increased zzso of zzso in women with zzso and zzso The zzso inflammatory reaction in zzso and increased zzso levels might be zzso to zzso outcome in women with zzso or zzso
