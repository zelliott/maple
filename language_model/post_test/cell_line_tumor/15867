zzso suppression by zzso and zzso involves regulation of cell cycle, zzso and DNA repair and is influenced by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein fragments are zzso recognized by zzso zzso of zzso identifying the zzso domain as a novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso cooperate with zzso and zzso to induce expression of the critical cell cycle and proliferation regulator zzso in response to DNA zzso This induction was severely attenuated by elimination of zzso or its zzso activity, or by zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity led to failure of cells to arrest in the zzso phase of the cell cycle in response to DNA zzso zzso zzso activity was required for induction of some zzso target genes zzso and zzso but not others zzso by DNA zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso region of the zzso promoter in response to DNA damage required zzso of zzso zzso of zzso by zzso Thus, zzso zzso may be crucial for zzso the tumor zzso function of zzso and other zzso domain zzso
