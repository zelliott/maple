zzso play an important role in tumor growth and zzso and zzso of these molecules is strongly correlated with poor prognosis in a variety of zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso with potent zzso We previously reported that a tandem zzso format zzso showed enhanced binding ability with zzso compared with the zzso zzso zzso In this study, the zzso activities of zzso on zzso zzso zzso were evaluated zzso and zzso By zzso analysis, it was found that partial fusion protein zzso existed as zzso the results of zzso and zzso demonstrated that the fusion protein zzso could efficiently bind to zzso cells zzso The apparent arrest of cell cycle at zzso phase and induction of zzso at zzso levels indicated that the zzso was very potent against zzso In zzso experiments, zzso shown enhanced zzso effects compared to those of zzso Administration at mouse tolerable dosage level, the zzso rate of tumor growth was zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso on zzso zzso in mice ( zzso and, zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso on zzso zzso in zzso mice ( zzso Small animal optical imaging showed that the zzso zzso zzso localized in the tumor site in less than zzso which demonstrated remarkable zzso zzso Taken together with the above findings, the zzso fusion protein zzso showed potential application as a new agent for therapeutic zzso in zzso
