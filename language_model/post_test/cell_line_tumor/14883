zzso zzso zzso with the aim of zzso zzso therapy zzso of tumors do not always fulfill their potential when tested in zzso and in zzso in different tumor zzso The zzso zzso zzso a zzso resistant pump expressed at variable levels in zzso cells, can bind and zzso a wide range of structurally different classes of compounds including several zzso used zzso and clinically such as zzso and zzso zzso may lower zzso levels of zzso zzso below the threshold for cell death in tumors treated by zzso leaving resistant cells to repopulate the zzso To determine some of the structural factors that affect zzso affinity of zzso for zzso we used an zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso and its zzso counterpart, and zzso zzso zzso zzso in a simple flow zzso zzso to identify zzso zzso by the zzso zzso We tested a series of zzso of zzso zzso with different groups attached at different positions on the zzso zzso to examine whether a change in affinity for the pump occurred and whether such changes depended on the position or the zzso of the attached zzso zzso without zzso including zzso and zzso were generally zzso for zzso but zzso groups zzso at positions 8, 12, 13, and 17 but not at position 3 zzso zzso affinity regardless of structure or linking zzso At position 3, affinity was retained with the addition of zzso zzso chains and zzso but not with zzso This suggests that structural characteristics at position 3 may offer important contributions to requirements for binding to zzso We examined several tumor cell lines for zzso activity, and found that although some cell lines had negligible zzso activity in bulk, they contained a small zzso side population zzso thought to contain cells which are responsible for initiating tumor zzso We examined the relevance of the SP to zzso resistance with zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso in the zzso zzso tumor zzso We show for the first time in zzso that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso (a zzso zzso of zzso selectively preserved the SP which was primarily responsible for regrowth in zzso The SP could be targeted by addition of zzso zzso a zzso zzso inhibitor which zzso the zzso activity of zzso and prevents zzso of zzso A zzso resistant SP may be responsible for zzso observed both zzso and zzso To prevent zzso zzso resistance, choosing zzso zzso or administering an zzso inhibitor alongside a zzso zzso might be advantageous when treating zzso tumors with zzso
