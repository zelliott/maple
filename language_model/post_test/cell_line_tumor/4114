zzso zzso of zzso regulate blood zzso zzso by the zzso of the hormone zzso Like many neuroendocrine cells, the zzso between zzso zzso in the zzso is critical for the dynamics of hormone zzso We have examined how this zzso architecture regulates the electrical dynamics that zzso insulin zzso by utilizing a zzso zzso method to generate clusters of a zzso line with defined sizes and zzso We measured the dynamics of zzso activity zzso and insulin zzso and compared these zzso with a percolating network zzso We observed that the zzso dimension was critical for regulating zzso dynamics and insulin zzso zzso zzso led to zzso suppression of zzso at low zzso and robust synchronized zzso zzso at elevated zzso whereas two-dimensional zzso showed poor suppression and less robust zzso with significant zzso The zzso and zzso of zzso at high and low zzso could be accurately described with the percolating network model, using similar network zzso As such this could explain the fundamentally different behavior and zzso observed under each zzso zzso This study highlights the dependence of proper zzso function on the zzso architecture that will be important for developing therapeutic treatments for diabetes such as zzso transplantation zzso Furthermore, this will be vital to gain a better understanding of the general features by which cellular interactions regulate coupled zzso zzso
