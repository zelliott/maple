Single strand zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed on zzso DNA from 97 human breast cancer samples and 10 breast cell lines to screen for zzso in the single zzso zzso zzso Three C zzso T transitions resulting in silent zzso were detected in three individual breast cancer zzso One breast cancer sample also contained a G zzso T zzso zzso The zzso cell line contained an A zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in a nonsense zzso zzso All zzso identified in zzso DNA zzso were in highly zzso regions of the zzso zzso This study indicates that zzso zzso in the coding region of the zzso gene are relatively uncommon in human breast zzso
