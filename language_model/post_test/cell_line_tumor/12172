The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether zzso has zzso effect against pancreatic cancer and whether this effect is zzso with levels of zzso which is reportedly zzso in pancreatic zzso We also investigated whether the effect is zzso in combined therapy with zzso 

Using zzso and zzso we analyzed zzso expression in 16 pancreatic cancer cell zzso The in zzso zzso effect of zzso alone and in combination with zzso was examined by zzso zzso zzso The in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was investigated by zzso release zzso The in zzso zzso effect of zzso alone and in combination with zzso was evaluated in nude mouse zzso zzso The survival benefit was evaluated in a zzso zzso implanted nude mouse zzso 

zzso expression of zzso or more was observed in 10 and of zzso in 2 of the 16 cell zzso No in zzso zzso effect of zzso was found in any cell line, but zzso induced zzso zzso zzso in proportion to zzso expression zzso zzso inhibited tumor growth in zzso zzso zzso zzso and prolonged survival in the zzso zzso These effects were increased by combined therapy with zzso In contrast, zzso exhibited no zzso effect against zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso effect of zzso in pancreatic cancer with high zzso expression was shown in zzso and in zzso Clinical application of zzso is expected in pancreatic cancer with zzso zzso zzso
