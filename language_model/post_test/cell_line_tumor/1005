zzso was attached to zzso via a zzso zzso arm by a zzso zzso zzso synthesis of zzso zzso synthesis of zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were characterized by zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso zzso The reaction yields were over zzso and the purity of products over zzso zzso release and degradation from zzso occurred at a faster rate at pH zzso than zzso After 30 h of incubation at pH zzso and zzso the released free zzso was about 40 and zzso zzso In plasma both drug release and degradation were found to occur at a higher rate than in buffer at pH zzso suggesting that an zzso mechanism could be zzso The zzso release and degradation from zzso were negligible at pH zzso and zzso and very slow in zzso Investigation carried out using zzso zzso cell line showed that the zzso zzso maintains partial pharmacological activity of zzso The zzso of the zzso (over 40 zzso as compared to free zzso (about 1 zzso was correlated to the slow drug zzso Finally a zzso study carried out by intravenous zzso of the zzso zzso to mice demonstrated that the zzso zzso modify dramatically the in zzso fate of the zzso The zzso disappeared from the zzso much more quickly as compared to both free drug and naked zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the liver zzso of the zzso was found to persist throughout 1 zzso
