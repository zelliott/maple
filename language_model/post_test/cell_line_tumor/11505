zzso zzso zzso zzso recognizes zzso zzso IX zzso zzso on clear cell zzso cell zzso zzso zzso is currently under clinical investigation for the detection of zzso However, the zzso label is rapidly zzso from the tumor cells after zzso of the zzso zzso We hypothesized that labeling zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso would lead to higher tumor zzso and more sensitive detection of zzso zzso 

zzso mice with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso were zzso injected with zzso or zzso To determine specificity of zzso zzso in zzso one control group was zzso injected with zzso zzso zzso PET images were acquired using a small animal PET camera and the zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso 

The zzso zzso were clearly zzso after injection of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso was significantly higher compared with zzso in the zzso tumor model zzso zzso zzso injected dose per gram zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but in the zzso the difference in tumor zzso was not significant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors were not zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as small as 7 zzso were zzso with zzso zzso 

zzso imaging with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso This confirms the potential of zzso zzso in the diagnosis and zzso of zzso PET imaging of zzso tumors with zzso could be more sensitive than zzso
