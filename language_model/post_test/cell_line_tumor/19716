Many beneficial properties have been attributed to zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso on the function of zzso protein 78 zzso which is associated with the zzso resistance zzso of many types of cancer zzso Our investigation was directed at zzso the mechanism of the zzso and zzso interaction and providing evidence about whether zzso zzso the activity of zzso drugs through the zzso of zzso zzso We found that zzso directly zzso with zzso at the zzso site of protein and regulated its function by competing with zzso zzso resulting in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso binding caused the conversion of zzso from its active zzso to the inactive zzso and zzso zzso Further, we showed that zzso zzso with the formation of the zzso zzso complex, which resulted in an increased zzso zzso in cancer zzso We also showed that zzso significantly suppressed the transformed zzso of breast cancer cells treated with zzso Overall, these results strongly suggested that zzso could prevent the zzso effect of zzso which usually suppresses the zzso cell death pathways in zzso cancer cells, contributing to the development of drug zzso
