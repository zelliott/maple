Although single zzso zzso may be potentially important zzso zzso of cancer therapy, functional evidence regarding their relevance is currently zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene is associated with changes in cellular composition of zzso We hypothesized that this zzso may zzso the zzso effect of zzso zzso and zzso zzso two commonly used zzso agents for colon and breast zzso because the modes of action of zzso and zzso are critically dependent on cellular composition of zzso 

Human zzso colon and zzso breast cancer cells were zzso zzso with zzso or zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso folate zzso growth rate, and zzso zzso zzso activity were zzso In zzso zzso to zzso and zzso was determined using the zzso B zzso In zzso zzso of zzso cells to zzso was determined in nude zzso 

Compared with cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso had decreased zzso activity, zzso zzso changed zzso folate distribution, accelerated cellular growth rate, and increased zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso increased zzso of colon and breast zzso to zzso but decreased zzso of breast cancer cells to zzso In nude mice, zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso grew faster, but were more sensitive to zzso than zzso expressing the zzso zzso 

Our data provide evidence that the zzso zzso zzso affects the concentration and zzso distribution of zzso and changes the growth and zzso of colon and breast cancer zzso The zzso zzso zzso may be a useful zzso zzso for providing rational and effective tailored zzso
