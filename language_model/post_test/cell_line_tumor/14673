A novel growth hormone zzso type zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was functionally zzso in rat zzso zzso cell line, zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso The antagonism profile of zzso was compared with that of zzso zzso zzso another zzso zzso zzso recently zzso The activity of both compounds was also evaluated at rat zzso zzso zzso The characterization of the two zzso was performed by zzso calcium zzso zzso by using zzso imaging plate reader zzso technology and zzso zzso zzso turnover zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso with rat zzso receptors virus were zzso In zzso cells, zzso and zzso depressed the zzso zzso response in zzso zzso as result of zzso zzso When using the zzso zzso zzso both compounds behaved as competitive zzso with zzso values of zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso In rat zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the calcium response induced by zzso with zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not show intrinsic activity in both zzso expressed and zzso rat zzso zzso The new zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potent competitive zzso in rat zzso zzso cells zzso expressing zzso receptors when equilibrium conditions between zzso and zzso are reached in the test zzso zzso represents a useful tool to investigate the zzso relevance of the zzso system in rat zzso
