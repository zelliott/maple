An zzso biodegradable, dual zzso and zzso zzso system zzso with functional group zzso was prepared in order to enhance tumor zzso The Dynamic light scattering zzso zzso showed that these zzso zzso form zzso in PBS buffer with a size of around 50 zzso by heating of an zzso zzso solution from below to above the cloud point zzso zzso drug, zzso was incorporated into the inner core of zzso by hot shock zzso The size and stability of the zzso were controlled by the zzso composition and is fine tuned to zzso pH of zzso The mechanism then caused pH change and at body temperature which induce zzso release from zzso and have strong effects on the viability of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cancer zzso Our in zzso results revealed a clear distribution of zzso mixed zzso zzso and efficiency targeting tumor site with particles increasing size in the tumor zzso space, and the particles could not diffuse throughout the tumor zzso In zzso tumor growth zzso showed that zzso exhibited excellent zzso activity and a high rate of zzso drug in cancer cells by this zzso
