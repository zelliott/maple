zzso effects of zzso have been identified in reproduction and pregnancy, particularly in the zzso where it works as an zzso zzso In this work, we demonstrated that human zzso zzso zzso added to zzso cell line or to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We also found that zzso increased zzso zzso levels in zzso cells in a zzso manner, zzso zzso response element zzso activity and the zzso with an expression zzso of a dominant negative zzso of zzso caused a significant zzso of zzso stimulation of zzso promoter zzso These results demonstrate that zzso indeed activates zzso pathway, and that this zzso is involved in zzso zzso Nevertheless, we found zzso induction by zzso is dependent on zzso zzso Treatment with zzso in combination with low and non zzso zzso zzso led to an increase in zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso showed the opposite zzso We found that specific zzso zzso by zzso caused a significant increase of zzso zzso zzso suggesting that probably high zzso levels might inhibit zzso zzso It was found that zzso enhancement of zzso zzso expression involved the zzso zzso In this work, we demonstrated that zzso zzso induction through the zzso signaling zzso is inhibited by zzso We observed that zzso zzso increased when zzso treatment was combined with zzso In view of these results, the involvement of the alternative zzso signaling zzso was zzso We observed that a zzso analogue that specifically activates zzso zzso zzso zzso expression by zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso and zzso proteins increased zzso promoter activity and enhanced zzso In conclusion, we provide evidence suggesting that zzso induction of zzso gene expression in zzso is zzso not only by zzso of the zzso signaling zzso but also by the alternative zzso signaling zzso
