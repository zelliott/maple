If ultrasound zzso is applied to cells, zzso across the cell membrane temporarily increases, making it easier for drugs to be taken into the cells from around the cell zzso Moreover, when used in combination with zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso an ultrasound imaging zzso even zzso ultrasound can facilitate drug delivery into zzso In the present study, we constructed a new drug delivery system zzso involving zzso use of US and zzso with zzso zzso a key drug in the chemotherapy of zzso and demonstrated both in zzso and in zzso that it markedly inhibited the proliferation of zzso zzso Furthermore, this system achieved an equivalent zzso effect at about zzso the dose of zzso agent employed in zzso with zzso These findings suggest the possibility of reduction of adverse zzso In this experiment, US and zzso were tested, both of which are already in use in clinical zzso US and zzso are both very safe in the zzso The zzso composed of these elements we designed can be applied in simple and zzso fashion and is therefore promising as a new, clinically feasible method of zzso
