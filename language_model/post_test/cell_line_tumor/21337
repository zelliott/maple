Human genes coding for zzso and zzso acid zzso have recently been linked to the onset of zzso zzso was proposed as an zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso In the brain this zzso zzso a potent zzso of zzso zzso We have investigated the zzso regulation of zzso by zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso and zzso are both expressed in zzso of the human cortex, where they most likely zzso considering their partial overlapping zzso distribution and their zzso We demonstrated that the specific in zzso interaction of the two proteins yields a complex composed of 2 zzso zzso and 2 zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not affect the kinetic properties and zzso binding ability of zzso instead, a zzso loss of zzso activity in the presence of an excess of zzso was zzso The binding affects the zzso structure of zzso altering the amount of the active zzso We finally demonstrated that zzso of zzso in zzso cells decreases the levels of zzso an effect that is zzso when zzso is zzso These data indicate that zzso acts as a negative zzso of zzso zzso a decrease in the synaptic concentration of zzso as the result of an anomalous increase in zzso activity related to zzso of zzso may represent a molecular mechanism by which zzso and zzso are involved in schizophrenia zzso
