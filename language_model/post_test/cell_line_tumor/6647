zzso zzso zzso zzso is a negative zzso of zzso zzso However, the mechanism underlying this effect is not well zzso We show here that the effects of zzso on the activity of this complex in zzso cells are independent of its zzso activity and its interaction with zzso As presented in this report zzso also binds zzso with similar affinity as zzso although this interaction does not involve equivalent zzso in the two zzso Moreover, zzso association with zzso enhances the interaction of this zzso with zzso and prevents its binding to zzso These effects were observed with the zzso form of zzso which has higher affinity for zzso and zzso than processed zzso These results provide a new explanation for the effects of zzso on gene zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso
