To identify whether zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso protein zzso zzso pathways are implicated in the zzso of gastric cancer and to explore the possible zzso 

zzso cancer cell lines zzso and zzso were exposed to zzso zzso or zzso Cell cycle distribution and cell zzso were detected using flow zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso viability was determined by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was detected using zzso zzso zzso Western zzso was exploited to evaluate the level of zzso zzso and expressions of zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso suppressed the viability of zzso and zzso cells in a zzso and zzso manner; zzso and zzso were able to enhance the zzso of zzso The zzso levels of cells treated with zzso or zzso were significantly higher than those of cells treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and expression of zzso were significantly induced by zzso in a zzso manner; moreover, there was a weak effect on the expression of zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso elevated the level of zzso expression zzso however, only zzso suppressed the zzso trend of zzso expression induced by zzso 

zzso zzso activated zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso protein zzso zzso zzso which decreased the chemotherapy sensitivity of gastric cancer cell lines zzso and zzso via suppressing the expression of zzso and enhancing the expression of zzso This may be one of the molecular mechanisms of gastric cancer zzso
