To investigate the effects of the essential oil of zzso zzso zzso on growth zzso and on the induction of zzso in human zzso cancer zzso 

The zzso effect of drugs on zzso cells was measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA fragmentation was zzso by zzso gel zzso Cell cycle and zzso zzso potential zzso zzso zzso were determined by flow zzso zzso zzso C zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and active zzso protein levels were measured by zzso using zzso zzso Human zzso zzso 

Treatment with zzso inhibited the growth of zzso cells in a zzso manner, and the zzso of zzso was approximately 70 zzso zzso was found to inhibit the growth of zzso cells by inducing a cell cycle arrest at zzso DNA fragmentation was evidently observed at 70 zzso after 72 h of zzso During the process, zzso zzso zzso C zzso showed a markedly stronger green zzso than in control cells in a zzso fashion, and zzso also caused zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the results clearly demonstrated that both, activity of zzso zzso and protein levels of zzso zzso significantly increased in a zzso manner after treatment with zzso 

zzso exhibits an zzso effect in zzso cells by inducing zzso This growth zzso is associated with cell cycle arrest, zzso C zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation, and loss of zzso membrane zzso This process involves a zzso dependent zzso zzso As zzso is an important zzso therapeutic target, these results suggest a potential of zzso as a zzso zzso
