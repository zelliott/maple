zzso zzso A zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso are zzso proteins whose serum zzso increase not only during inflammatory disorders, but also in the course of zzso zzso 

In this study we analyzed serum levels of these inflammatory markers along with zzso zzso zzso in patients with benign zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso localized prostate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso prostate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso 

We found that in comparison to healthy individuals zzso zzso zzso patients with zzso zzso and zzso have elevated serum levels of zzso zzso and zzso in addition to elevated levels of zzso zzso differences with respect to inflammatory zzso were found between localized and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting a zzso value of these zzso In addition, serum zzso of zzso and zzso positively correlate with zzso in zzso patients zzso zzso zzso and in patients with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but not with zzso levels, zzso score, or tumor stage, emphasizing a role of zzso and zzso as circulating zzso of inflammation rather than of zzso zzso In contrast to zzso which differed significantly between zzso and localized zzso patients zzso zzso zzso such a difference was not found for zzso zzso and zzso In order to zzso whether the elevated levels of zzso and zzso can be caused by cancer zzso zzso in zzso studies were zzso These analyses demonstrated the expression of zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso prostate cell lines, which can be further zzso by zzso zzso in a cell zzso zzso This might suggest that, in addition to the zzso origin, zzso and zzso can also be zzso and zzso by zzso cancer tissue zzso 

The results of the present study emphasize the utility of zzso zzso and zzso as circulating zzso of inflammation during zzso development and zzso zzso
