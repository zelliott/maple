To perform gene expression profiles comparison so that to identify and understand the potential differences in zzso between the pandemic and seasonal A zzso influenza zzso 

zzso cells were infected with zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively at the same zzso of 2 and collected at 2, 4, 8, and 24 h post infection zzso Gene expression profiles of zzso cells were obtained using the 22 K Human Genome zzso zzso and zzso expressed genes were analyzed at selected time zzso 

zzso results indicated that both of the viruses suppressed host immune response related pathways including zzso production while pandemic zzso virus displayed weaker suppression of host immune response than seasonal zzso zzso Observation on similar zzso events such as zzso of zzso inhibitor and zzso of key genes of zzso pathways in both infections showed that activities of promoting zzso were different in later stage of zzso 

The zzso and zzso events of pandemic zzso virus were similar to those seen by seasonal zzso zzso The pandemic zzso virus had an ability to inhibit biological pathways associated with zzso responses, zzso zzso and zzso zzso
