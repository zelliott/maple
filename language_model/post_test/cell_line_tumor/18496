Development of synthetic molecules that provide external control over the zzso of a given gene represents a challenge in medicinal and zzso zzso Here we report design and analysis of zzso a zzso synthetic zzso that zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso association of zzso factor zzso with its zzso zzso The zzso part of the compound mimics the zzso interface of the zzso domain of zzso and the zzso region accepts chemical modifications for a range of zzso A zzso handle permitted zzso study in zzso zzso a zzso handle verified the selectivity of the interaction, and a fluorescent handle confirmed the cell zzso of the zzso The case study of zzso zzso the promise and the challenge of targeting zzso interactions in the nucleus and may lead to the development of unique synthetic zzso of gene zzso
