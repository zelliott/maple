It has been reported that the zzso apparatus zzso is fragmented in some neurodegenerative zzso However, the significance of the zzso fragmentation or zzso in zzso is still zzso To clarify the involvement of this zzso in zzso of zzso cells, we examined the zzso changes in the zzso induced by zzso a zzso that produces selective zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells, a zzso zzso treatment zzso zzso promoted cell zzso zzso cells showed round zzso diffuse signals of the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso Nevertheless, these type of cells without nuclear fragmentation did not show any zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in the early stages of the zzso zzso
