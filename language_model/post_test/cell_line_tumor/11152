Gap zzso zzso communication plays a significant role in zzso zzso bystander zzso However, the level of zzso itself is influenced by zzso radiation, which could modify the bystander zzso Here we have investigated several cell lines for the zzso of zzso expression 24 h after zzso with 5 zzso zzso The mouse zzso cell line zzso revealed a significantly elevated level of zzso already 15 zzso after exposure to X-rays, whereas human hybrid zzso cells zzso exhibited a transient zzso of zzso zzso No obvious changes in the communication properties of the different cell lines could be observed after zzso The zzso zzso human zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso with zzso did not reveal any induction of zzso nor zzso in the zzso zzso transcript level upon exposure to 5 zzso Taken together, our data show a cell line specific zzso of zzso expression after exposure to zzso
