To zzso the zzso activities of human fatty acid zzso zzso promoter in breast cancer cell lines and normal zzso cell line in order to provide some theoretical evidence for the targeted therapy of breast zzso 

The expression of zzso protein in three breast cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso and normal zzso cell line zzso was examined by Western zzso and indirect zzso zzso The zzso zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso and zzso were constructed and their relative zzso activities in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines were zzso 

zzso protein was expressed in all the three breast cancer cell lines with different levels zzso but its expression in zzso was not zzso zzso protein was localized primarily in zzso zzso promoter showed relatively high zzso activities in breast cancer cell lines which were obviously higher than zzso promoter and zzso promoter, but it showed zzso in zzso activities zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso promoter was comparable to that of zzso promoter in zzso cells, but it was significantly higher than that in zzso and zzso cell zzso 

zzso promoter can drive therapeutic gene in a wider range of human breast zzso than zzso promoter and it exhibits a stronger activity than zzso zzso It may serve as a useful tool for zzso target of breast cancer gene zzso
