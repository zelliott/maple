For patients with advanced melanoma, no treatment options are available at present that provide either sufficient response rates or a significant zzso of overall zzso The present study examines the effects of two zzso and six organic zzso compounds on cell proliferation and cell invasion of melanoma cells in zzso 

The effects of zzso compounds on proliferation of human melanoma zzso cells and zzso melanoma zzso cells were examined by zzso zzso and zzso zzso incorporation zzso and the effects of the compounds on cell invasion were examined by the zzso chamber invasion zzso The amounts of active zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the culture zzso of zzso cells were determined by an zzso activity zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso ) inhibited the proliferation of zzso and zzso cells significantly at concentration ranges of zzso ( zzso while the organic compounds zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso acid, zzso and zzso oxide did not show any zzso effects even at zzso Cell invasion of zzso and zzso cells through a layer of collagen IV was significantly inhibited by zzso of zzso or zzso zzso ( zzso while the organic compounds did not inhibit cell zzso zzso or zzso zzso at zzso significantly inhibited the amount of active zzso and zzso zzso into the zzso cell culture zzso ( zzso 

Our findings show that the zzso zzso compounds zzso and zzso zzso inhibit cell proliferation and prevent the invasive properties of melanoma cells, possibly by decreasing zzso production from the zzso
