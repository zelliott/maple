The zzso zzso of nuclear zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in the differentiation and bone zzso activity of zzso Recently, the development of zzso agents from natural substances has become a subject of zzso zzso we evaluated the effects of 222 natural compounds on the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso a marker for zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso formation in zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso was one of the compounds zzso the zzso zzso it significantly inhibited the zzso zzso activity and formation of zzso zzso without any zzso Interestingly, zzso prevented zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso expression of zzso genes and zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso We also observed the zzso effect of zzso on the differentiation of mouse bone zzso zzso into zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited the bone zzso activity of mature zzso with the induction of zzso signaling cascade and the zzso of survival signaling pathways such as zzso zzso and zzso In conclusion, although further studies are needed to determine the precise mechanism and biological efficacy of zzso in zzso bone disorders, our results demonstrate that zzso potentially zzso zzso differentiation by preventing the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso factors that consequently affect the regulation of genes required for zzso and the bone zzso activity of mature zzso by zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways and triggering the zzso signaling zzso
