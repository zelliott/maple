zzso virus zzso strain Western Reserve protein C4 has been characterized and its function and contribution to virus zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that C4 is zzso in six zzso species and shares zzso zzso acid identity with zzso protein zzso a known zzso zzso A zzso zzso expressing a zzso zzso version of C4 showed that, like zzso this 37 zzso protein is expressed early during infection and zzso to both the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso reporter zzso under the control of a nuclear factor zzso B zzso promoter demonstrated that C4 zzso zzso zzso at, or downstream of, the inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with this, C4 inhibited zzso zzso of zzso into the zzso A zzso lacking the zzso gene zzso showed no significant differences from zzso virus in growth zzso or spread in cell culture, but had reduced zzso in a zzso zzso model of zzso zzso mice exhibited fewer symptoms, lost less weight and recovered 7 days earlier than animals infected with control viruses expressing zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso fluid from zzso mice had increased cell numbers at day 5 zzso which correlated with reduced lung virus zzso from this time zzso C4 represents the ninth zzso protein to inhibit zzso zzso and zzso in every case zzso loss of each protein individually caused an zzso in virus zzso despite the presence of other zzso zzso
