Human zzso I has been suggested to be implicated in the maintenance of zzso stability via its ability to regulate zzso zzso during zzso and zzso In the present study, we demonstrate by zzso array comparative zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis that zzso I zzso results in zzso zzso gain in the cervical cancer cell line, zzso In contrast, zzso zzso copy number remained unaffected by zzso I zzso in the zzso cell line zzso as demonstrated by FISH zzso zzso zzso gain is the most frequent genetic zzso in invasive cervical cancer, which leads to zzso of genes involved in proliferation and occurs primarily at late stages in cancer zzso The amplification of this region upon zzso I zzso specifically in zzso cells may indicate an important role of zzso I in preventing zzso progression of zzso zzso in the zzso
