We investigated zzso zzso liver X zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso cholesterol zzso and other zzso effects on cholesterol metabolism depend on zzso cholesterol zzso and zzso combined treatment with the zzso zzso zzso and the cholesterol zzso inhibitor zzso results in synergistic effects on cholesterol metabolism that could be beneficial for treatment of zzso Mice were fed zzso cholesterol and treated with zzso zzso or zzso zzso treatment elevated serum zzso and zzso zzso zzso effectively reduced the zzso cholesterol zzso and increased the zzso of zzso neutral zzso No changes in zzso zzso cassette (ABC) A1 or zzso protein expression were observed, despite increased zzso zzso while zzso zzso was slightly zzso The combined treatment caused a pronounced zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and reduced zzso and zzso cholesterol zzso zzso did not affect the zzso cholesterol zzso but increased serum zzso and zzso zzso zzso also increased zzso zzso levels in primary mouse zzso and zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso cholesterol zzso zzso and zzso but did not affect the serum zzso or zzso zzso Thus, the zzso induction of zzso and zzso was independent of the zzso cholesterol zzso and increased expression of zzso or zzso zzso was not zzso zzso influx of cholesterol via zzso and/or low levels of zzso cholesterol prevented zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso despite increased zzso zzso Combined zzso zzso and blocked zzso cholesterol zzso induced effective zzso elimination of zzso
