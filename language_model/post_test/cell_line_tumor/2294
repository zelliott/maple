Cellular zzso are known to inhibit the zzso zzso protein A, 70 zzso zzso complex, and zzso increases cellular DNA repair in cancer zzso We hypothesized that regulation of zzso DNA repair might be responsible for the zzso of zzso in hypoxic zzso We have shown that, in cancer cells, zzso zzso the zzso complex, thereby enhancing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In normal cells, zzso binds to the zzso zzso zzso whereas this binding is disrupted in zzso zzso of zzso is a crucial event in zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso confirm that zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso complex in zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is shown to induce zzso zzso thus enhancing zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso gene zzso zzso significant increases in cellular zzso in the resistant hypoxic cancer zzso We have thus zzso a novel zzso showing how zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso complex, thus enhancing zzso repair, which causes resistance to zzso in hypoxic cancer zzso This novel finding may open new strategies in developing cancer zzso on the basis of the regulation of zzso zzso zzso
