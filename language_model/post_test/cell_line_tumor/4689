zzso zzso is one of the common mechanisms leading to gene zzso in various human zzso Using a combination of zzso zzso and zzso techniques, we identified 59 candidate zzso zzso including zzso a zzso zzso zzso in human zzso cancer zzso We further showed that zzso and zzso are commonly silenced genes in human zzso cancer cells, and this silence is predominantly related to promoter zzso We also found zzso and zzso gene zzso and loss of expression in primary zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso were identified in zzso but not in zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso and zzso genes into human zzso cancer cells leads to a decrease of colony formation zzso Further studies indicated that the zzso of zzso and zzso could antagonize Ras in zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso Thus, our current study suggests for the first time that zzso zzso genes can act as tumor zzso genes and exert their functions through the zzso of the zzso signaling zzso in human zzso zzso
