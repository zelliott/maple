To study the effect of zzso against bone cancer pain in bone cancer pain model rats induced by zzso tumor cells and its zzso 

The rat model of bone cancer pain was reproduced by injecting zzso tumor cells into the rat zzso zzso Ten days after the model establishment, 36 rats were selected and randomly divided into the model control group and the zzso treated zzso At the same time, other 10 rats with zzso were selected to be the normal control zzso Since the 15th day after the operation, rats in the treated group had been given zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 10 zzso The mechanical withdrawal threshold and the zzso withdrawal zzso of each group were measured before and after the zzso After the last treatment, the zzso and zzso observation shall be conducted for sick legs of all zzso The expressions of zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso in tumor zzso were detected by zzso 

zzso could significantly increase the mechanical withdrawal threshold and the zzso withdrawal zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso significantly relief the bone injury caused by zzso tumor cells zzso zzso zzso and notably zzso the zzso and zzso expressions in tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso has the effect in zzso pain and zzso tumor progression in bone cancer pain rats induced by zzso tumor zzso Its mechanism may be related to the zzso expressions of zzso and zzso
