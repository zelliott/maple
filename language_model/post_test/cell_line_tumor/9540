Based on our studies demonstrating first time evidence that the zzso zzso zzso is abundant within invasive human breast tumors, we developed a zzso derived human breast tumor cell clone designated as zzso zzso 10 by zzso of human zzso zzso into slow growing, zzso zzso zzso zzso human breast tumor zzso The present studies evaluated the biological characteristics of the zzso zzso 10 human breast tumors compared to the characteristics of zzso zzso control tumors when grown in zzso following injection of zzso tumor cells into zzso fat pads of zzso female zzso mice implanted with slow release zzso zzso zzso At 60 days after tumor cell injection, zzso zzso 10 human breast tumors were zzso greater zzso zzso zzso in volume than zzso zzso control zzso zzso zzso 10 human breast tumor zzso were highly zzso based on zzso observation of zzso blood vessels, which was confirmed by zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso of mean vessel zzso zzso zzso 10 human breast tumor cells were present within regional zzso zzso adjacent to zzso fat pads with their local invasion confirmed by Western zzso of zzso This unique zzso breast tumor model rapidly produces large, zzso locally invasive human breast tumor zzso in zzso fat pads of zzso female zzso mice at zzso days which zzso human breast zzso zzso This unique model may be invaluable as a means to evaluate zzso safety and efficacy of novel zzso therapies for women with zzso breast cancer including zzso zzso antagonists, newly developed zzso therapies, as well as other novel approaches for targeting and destruction of human breast tumors and their zzso
