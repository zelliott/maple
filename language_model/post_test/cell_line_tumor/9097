zzso of zzso has been demonstrated in the zzso breast cancer zzso and nests of tumor zzso In this study, we have zzso the production of zzso and the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso degrading zzso zzso in a panel of breast cancer cell zzso The analysis revealed that highly invasive breast cancer cells produce high amounts of zzso and express zzso zzso zzso whereas less invasive breast cancer cells produce low amount of zzso and express zzso and zzso zzso We explored the importance of zzso expression for breast cancer zzso by specifically zzso the zzso gene using zzso interference zzso suppression in the invasive breast cancer cell line zzso This led to a less aggressive zzso of the breast tumor cells, as assessed by cell growth, both in zzso and zzso zzso zzso knock down of zzso in zzso breast tumor cells led to an zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso resulting in only a 50% decrease in the net zzso zzso however, the zzso zzso was of lower size and more zzso compared to control zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso cells deprived of zzso migrated only half as efficiently as zzso expressing cells through zzso areas in a culture wounding zzso and through zzso zzso membrane as well as invaded a zzso zzso These results imply that zzso in zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso affect the zzso zzso of zzso breast cancer zzso
