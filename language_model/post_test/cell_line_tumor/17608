To improve the efficacy of tumor zzso and zzso cell zzso cancer vaccines, this study explored the potential of a new cancer vaccine strategy, that is, the use of zzso zzso tumor zzso cells to simultaneously deliver both zzso zzso zzso and maturation stimuli to zzso Materials from zzso or zzso human tumor cells, with or without surface zzso were zzso efficiently by immature zzso after zzso However, during the zzso process, only zzso with zzso zzso cells resulted in zzso optimal DC maturation and production of zzso zzso and zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These activated zzso were the most potent cells to support the growth of zzso zzso T cells, and to process tumor zzso for the generation of specific zzso T cells in zzso Animals vaccinated with zzso zzso zzso zzso were better protected against subsequent challenge of a zzso zzso tumor cell line than animals vaccinated with zzso zzso cells zzso Thus, our results strongly support the future clinical application of using zzso zzso with zzso zzso cells as a cancer zzso
