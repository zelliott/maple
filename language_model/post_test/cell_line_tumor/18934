To identify novel zzso zzso zzso zzso by laser capture zzso and a zzso zzso 

zzso from pooled zzso zzso and normal zzso zzso zzso zzso were separated by two-dimensional gel zzso and differential proteins were identified by mass zzso zzso of three differential proteins zzso zzso and zzso I) in the above two zzso as well as four zzso cell lines was determined by Western zzso zzso was also done to detect the expression of three differential proteins in 98 cases of primary zzso 30 cases of zzso and 20 cases of cervical zzso zzso zzso and the correlation of their expression levels with zzso features and clinical outcomes were zzso 

zzso differential proteins between the zzso and zzso were zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso I in the two types of zzso were confirmed and related to differentiation degree and/or zzso potential of the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso I were observed in zzso versus zzso and significant zzso of zzso and zzso I was also observed in zzso zzso zzso versus primary zzso In addition, zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso I were significantly correlated with poor zzso zzso advanced clinical stage, and zzso whereas zzso of zzso and zzso I was also significantly correlated with zzso zzso and distant zzso Furthermore, survival zzso showed that patients with zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso I had a poor zzso zzso analysis revealed that the expression status of zzso zzso and zzso I was an independent zzso zzso 

The data suggest that zzso zzso and zzso I are potential zzso for the differentiation and prognosis of zzso and their zzso might play an important role in the zzso of zzso
