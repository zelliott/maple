A zzso screening study for identification of zzso genes in invasive cervical cancer zzso was carried out to augment our previously discovered panel of three genes found to be useful for detection of zzso and its precursor zzso zzso zzso and silenced genes were zzso in four zzso cell lines by treatment with zzso and zzso A and identified on expression zzso Thirty-nine of the 235 genes zzso in multiple zzso cell lines were further examined to determine the zzso status of associated zzso zzso The diagnostic use of 23 genes that were zzso zzso in multiple zzso cell lines were then analyzed in DNA from zzso cells obtained from patients with or without zzso We show, for the first time, that zzso zzso of six genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is present in a high proportion of zzso clinical samples but not in normal zzso Of these zzso zzso and zzso showed the highest frequency of zzso zzso in zzso specimens zzso for zzso and together were zzso in all but one zzso cases zzso We conclude that expression profiling of zzso zzso genes followed by zzso analysis in clinical samples is a powerful tool for comprehensive identification of zzso zzso Several novel genes identified in our study may be clinically useful for detection or zzso of zzso and/or of its precursor zzso and provide a basis for better understanding of mechanisms involved in development of zzso
