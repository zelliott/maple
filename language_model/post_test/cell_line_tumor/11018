TRAIL zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso of cell death inducing zzso Interestingly, while zzso cells are responsive to zzso cell death when used alone or in combination with other agents, normal cells do not appear to be sensitive to this zzso making it a desirable therapeutic compound against many zzso including many zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso family, has been found to be at significantly higher level in the zzso from patients with zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated a role for zzso in blocking zzso ability to induce zzso in the zzso cancer cell line, zzso possibly by zzso the zzso TRAIL zzso expression and blocking zzso zzso In addition, we showed a member of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso is among the genes regulated in zzso cells by TRAIL and zzso The present study further investigates involvement of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso ability to block zzso zzso in the zzso surface zzso cancer cell line, zzso 

In this study we demonstrate that zzso as well as zzso play a significant role in zzso ability to block zzso zzso Through array analysis, as well as confirmation with other methods, we detected regulation of zzso and zzso following treatment of the cancer cell line with zzso or zzso We also tested two other zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso but did not find significant regulation by zzso or zzso We also examined zzso of the zzso zzso pathway, zzso as well as zzso and noticed zzso of the zzso following treatment with TRAIL and decreased activity when zzso was zzso With the use of specific zzso we were able to further confirm the role of this zzso in zzso zzso and zzso ability to block this zzso in zzso cancer cell zzso 

Taken together, these results further solidify the role of zzso in blocking the zzso zzso in these zzso zzso cells and provide new molecular insight into this potentially important therapeutic zzso
