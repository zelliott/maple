Most cancer cells are characterized by zzso an abnormal number of zzso We have identified a clue to the zzso origins of zzso through zzso zzso analyses of human zzso A diverse range of tumor types were found to harbor deletions or zzso zzso of zzso a gene zzso a zzso of the zzso complex, which regulates the separation of sister zzso during cell zzso Because zzso is on the X zzso its zzso requires only a single zzso zzso zzso a zzso human cell line with a stable zzso we found that targeted zzso of zzso led to zzso cohesion defects and zzso whereas in two zzso human zzso cell lines, targeted correction of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso led to enhanced zzso zzso Thus, genetic disruption of zzso is a cause of zzso in human zzso
