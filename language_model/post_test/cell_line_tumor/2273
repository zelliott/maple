zzso is known to promote cell migration, and increased zzso expression is associated with tumor progression and zzso In zzso zzso polarization and zzso of zzso are essential to promote zzso However, the role of zzso in migration of zzso cells remains poorly zzso Here, zzso participation in zzso cell migration was evaluated by zzso targeting of zzso zzso in zzso human breast cancer cells and zzso expression in zzso mouse melanoma zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells reduced, while expression in zzso cells promoted migration, polarization and focal zzso turnover in a sequence of events that involved zzso of zzso and zzso zzso In zzso cells, expression of a zzso zzso to zzso zzso failed to zzso the effects observed with zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso cells with the zzso family zzso inhibitor zzso reduced zzso zzso on zzso and cell zzso Surprisingly, unlike for zzso zzso polarization and zzso to the trailing edge were not observed in zzso zzso zzso Thus, expression and zzso but not polarization of zzso favor the highly mobile zzso of zzso zzso
