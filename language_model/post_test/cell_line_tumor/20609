A growing body of evidence suggests that components of the tumor zzso including zzso zzso zzso may zzso the treatment sensitivity of tumor zzso Here, we investigated the possible influence of zzso on the sensitivity of head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso cell lines to zzso an zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment caused a reduction in the proliferation rate of zzso cell lines, whereas the growth of zzso zzso cultures was zzso When tumor cells were zzso with zzso in a zzso system, the zzso growth zzso was reduced, and a complete protection from growth zzso was observed in one of the tumor cell lines zzso Media that had been zzso by zzso offered protection from zzso treatment in a zzso manner, suggesting that the resistance to treatment was zzso by zzso soluble zzso The zzso of zzso cell lines with zzso resulted in an elevated expression of zzso zzso zzso in both the tumor cells and zzso Moreover, the zzso resistance was partly abolished by the presence of an zzso zzso However, zzso treated with zzso targeting zzso still protected tumor cells from zzso treatment, suggesting that several zzso may cooperate to facilitate resistance or that the protective effect is zzso by another member of the zzso zzso These results identify a novel zzso zzso of zzso sensitivity and suggest that zzso zzso may improve the effects of zzso zzso
