A short tandem repeat zzso typing method is developed for forensic identification of individual zzso In our strategy, zzso zzso zzso zzso droplets are produced with a high frequency using a zzso zzso zzso zzso dilute single cells, along with zzso zzso are randomly zzso in the zzso zzso parallel zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso is performed to transfer zzso of desired zzso targets from the zzso zzso DNA onto the zzso zzso These zzso beads are subsequently harvested and zzso under statistically dilute conditions for conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso size zzso The zzso zzso profiles of single cells from both pure and mixed populations of zzso and zzso human zzso cells show that all zzso are correctly called and zzso zzso is not zzso The cell mixture study exhibits a good linear relationship between the observed and input cell ratios in the range of zzso to zzso Additionally, the zzso profile of zzso cells could be deduced even in the presence of a high concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our method will be valuable for the zzso analysis of samples containing zzso of zzso from multiple contributors and for zzso zzso
