zzso zzso is a primary zzso of the bone, with a tendency to zzso zzso Despite intensive chemotherapy and surgical zzso more than zzso of patients develop distant zzso and the prognosis of patients with zzso is essentially zzso Members of the protein zzso D zzso family are zzso zzso and have been studied in various zzso Among the three different zzso of this family, zzso is one of the best understood for its role in human zzso however, its role in musculoskeletal tumors has not been zzso In the present study, we investigated the role of zzso in human zzso We first analyzed zzso zzso expression in human musculoskeletal tumor tissue samples by quantitative real-time zzso zzso expression in zzso samples was significantly lower than that in benign zzso samples, and this was correlated with zzso zzso In in zzso studies, zzso of zzso by zzso zzso decreased zzso cell invasion, migration and zzso and significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased invasion, migration and proliferation of zzso cells, and zzso expression was markedly zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso significantly reduced in zzso tumor growth of zzso zzso These results demonstrated that low expression of zzso may contribute to increased cell invasion, migration and proliferation ability of human zzso Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that zzso may zzso regulate the zzso potential of human zzso and may be a therapeutic target for human zzso in the clinical zzso
