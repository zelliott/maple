A series of zzso zzso zzso derivatives with varying zzso side chain length with zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso group at the terminal end of the zzso side chain were zzso and screened against cancer cell lines SW zzso SW zzso zzso 160 zzso zzso which are zzso lung cancer cell lines, zzso zzso zzso zzso are breast cancer cell lines, 2008 zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso cancer cell lines, and human zzso kidney cell lines like zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso compounds showed zzso in the range of zzso to zzso and the zzso series in the range of zzso to zzso The compounds 4, 7, and 8 showed good zzso against the 60 human cancer cell line panel of the National Cancer Institute, zzso The compounds 14 and 15 showed a better zzso in most of the cancer cell lines compared to other compounds zzso The zzso properties of the compounds were evaluated based on their affinity or zzso with zzso measured with zzso zzso The compound 11 bearing zzso zzso ring linked with a zzso zzso side chain showed the highest binding affinity with a binding constant zzso of zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso of the compounds in cell lines with an zzso of various zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso or Breast Cancer Resistance zzso zzso showed that all compounds are not zzso for any of these zzso
