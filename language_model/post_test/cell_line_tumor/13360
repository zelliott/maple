The zzso zzso complex zzso zzso is zzso zzso to cancer cells when zzso with visible zzso zzso We show that the acute zzso can be switched off by low doses zzso zzso of the zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso experiments using spin traps show that zzso zzso the formation of zzso zzso probably by acting as an electron zzso zzso is well-known as a zzso of electron transfer between distant electron zzso centers in zzso and such properties may make the free zzso acid clinically useful for controlling the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso Since previous work has demonstrated the ability of zzso 1 to zzso DNA, this suggests that the high potency of such zzso platinum complexes is related to their dual attack on cancer cells by zzso and zzso zzso
