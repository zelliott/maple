A zzso zzso zzso reporter gene was tested for PET imaging of different zzso processes for potential clinical zzso 

The human zzso zzso zzso type 2 zzso reporter gene truncated at the N zzso zzso alone or fused with green fluorescent protein zzso was used for zzso evaluation in a mouse zzso The levels of zzso activity of zzso and zzso zzso proteins were assessed using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in subcutaneous tumors grown from the corresponding cell lines in nude zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in tumors and zzso studies were zzso 

zzso was successfully expressed in the zzso of zzso zzso A new zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The levels of zzso and zzso zzso in cells expressing zzso and zzso zzso were at least zzso higher than in zzso cells in zzso and about 6 times higher in zzso We determined that zzso is a more specific reporter zzso for zzso than zzso whereas zzso is not zzso by this zzso In addition, we showed that zzso zzso cells can be eliminated by treatment with zzso 

We have tested a zzso reporter gene that is likely to be zzso and potentially allows for long-term monitoring of different zzso processes by nuclear imaging techniques in zzso Using zzso zzso or zzso it should be possible to image zzso reporter gene expression with PET in zzso and clinical zzso
