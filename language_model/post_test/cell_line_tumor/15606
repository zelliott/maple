The zzso of zzso cell zzso is the highest among all human zzso zzso evidence indicates that ultraviolet radiation is the primary environmental cause for the zzso of zzso cell zzso However, the genetic changes caused by ultraviolet radiation that lead to zzso cell zzso formation remain zzso We and others have demonstrated that the zzso zzso of growth 1) zzso zzso plays an important role in cellular stress response to ultraviolet zzso such as DNA repair and zzso This study was designed to investigate whether zzso is zzso and/or zzso in human zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA sequencing were used to determine the expression and zzso status of the zzso gene in 54 zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso is zzso in zzso zzso human zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA sequencing revealed that only 1 in 54 zzso zzso cell zzso primaries contained a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso is located in zzso 2 and could thus potentially interfere with the structure of every zzso zzso and the functions of the zzso zinc finger zzso Our data indicate that zzso and zzso of the zzso gene are zzso in human zzso cell zzso
