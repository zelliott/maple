zzso mediates the zzso of the Ras signaling zzso that is present in many human zzso Here, we explored the involvement of zzso in the formation and maintenance of the prostate cancer zzso zzso expression was elevated in multiple human prostate tumor tissue samples and in the human zzso prostate cancer cell lines zzso and zzso 145 compared with the zzso prostate cancer cell line zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso 145 cells reduced zzso formation, inhibited cell zzso zzso cell migration, and induced zzso zzso growth of the zzso cells and tumor formation in mouse zzso of both cell lines were likewise zzso zzso of zzso expression reduced zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso and zzso the cells to killing by zzso zzso zzso zzso elevated zzso zzso zzso and provided resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells displayed a markedly enhanced rate of zzso tumor formation in both male and female mice compared with the parental zzso zzso of zzso expression in these cells inhibited downstream zzso responses, caused the cells to resume the zzso zzso and suppressed growth, confirming the functional role of zzso in the altered behavior of these zzso We conclude that zzso contributes to the zzso zzso of the prostate cancer cells and may constitute a novel therapeutic target for human prostate zzso
