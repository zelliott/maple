zzso membrane zzso zzso is considered the major zzso of zzso virus and is frequently expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes growth and migration of zzso cells, and the loss of zzso has been identified as a contributing factor to zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein that can also serve as a zzso factor in zzso zzso To determine the effects of zzso on the molecular and functional properties of zzso zzso was zzso in the zzso cell line zzso zzso did not affect zzso stability but did decrease zzso zzso The zzso decreased levels of nuclear zzso did not affect zzso activity or the amount of zzso bound to zzso Although zzso induced and stabilized zzso a protein with common binding partners to zzso the loss of zzso did not affect its association with zzso However, zzso did induce a zzso switch from zzso to zzso a process involved in cancer zzso and enhanced the association of zzso zzso with zzso zzso decreased overall levels of zzso zzso but the remaining zzso zzso was found associated with the induced zzso This increased association of zzso zzso with zzso was a distinguishing feature of zzso cells that have reduced migration due to restoration of zzso Low levels of zzso were also detected in human zzso zzso These findings reveal that the effects of zzso on zzso zzso and the initiation of a zzso switch likely contribute to zzso of zzso
