DNA zzso plays a pivotal role in the zzso regulation of the zzso of a number of zzso zzso thereby representing an important target for cancer prevention and zzso In our search for DNA zzso zzso zzso from zzso plants, by screening against a library consisting of 12 structurally distinct natural products, we identified zzso Q zzso as an inhibitor of zzso zzso with zzso of 7 zzso The effect of zzso Q on zzso zzso was validated by its ability to reactivate the expression of a DNA zzso zzso zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso Moreover, zzso Q suppressed the proliferation of zzso breast and zzso prostate cancer cells, in part, through zzso zzso The role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso effect was supported by the protective effect of zzso expression of zzso on zzso zzso cell zzso zzso modeling analysis suggests that zzso Q inhibited zzso activity by competing with zzso zzso a mechanism similar to that described for zzso zzso Relative to zzso zzso Q exhibits several desirable features for drug development, including chemical stability and increased zzso and might have therapeutic relevance to cancer zzso
