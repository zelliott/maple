zzso initiation factors 3 zzso complex is essential for initiation of protein synthesis for both cells and zzso It consists of 13 zzso zzso to zzso among which zzso serves as a major scaffolding zzso However, its functions in human zzso have not been explored zzso Here, we showed that zzso was expressed in human zzso zzso zzso and human zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso Loss of function analysis was performed on zzso cells using zzso zzso against zzso zzso expressing zzso could effectively zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression significantly inhibited proliferation of zzso zzso Further study showed that the proliferation zzso effect was associated with zzso in zzso cell number and an increased rate of zzso In conclusion, zzso promotes the proliferation of zzso cells and may play an important role in human zzso zzso
