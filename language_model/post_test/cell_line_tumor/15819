zzso cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death and often goes zzso with current zzso zzso zzso methods of detecting zzso and tumors during zzso could significantly improve zzso zzso we report a zzso zzso for zzso detection of zzso cancer, where zzso is physically zzso with zzso zzso zzso to form zzso with improved drug release in the cellular zzso The incorporated zzso molecules could complex zzso with zzso via zzso attraction, and the zzso diameter and zzso of the prepared zzso zzso was 115 zzso and 22 zzso respectively, enough to keep the zzso stable in zzso suspension without zzso When loaded with zzso acid zzso zzso loading zzso the zzso zzso displayed no differences in particle size or zzso compared to zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso were readily taken up by zzso cancer cells via folate zzso zzso zzso the loaded zzso was release in the zzso and this was promoted by the reduced attraction intensity between zzso and zzso via the zzso zzso resulting in a higher zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso These studies demonstrate that the zzso incorporated and zzso zzso zzso zzso are excellent zzso for zzso delivery of zzso for fluorescent zzso zzso
