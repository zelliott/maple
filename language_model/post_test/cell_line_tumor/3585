zzso zzso zzso provide an efficient approach for developing zzso zzso drugs, because they can inhibit gene expression sequence zzso To improve the therapeutic zzso of zzso two new types of the compounds have been zzso The first group of zzso zzso investigated contains base modified zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso into zzso increases cell membrane zzso zzso duplex stability zzso and zzso resistance zzso These properties were studied using a large number of model zzso The application of zzso has been found to be the best zzso Application of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso containing these zzso units instead of zzso increased the zzso zzso potency by one order of magnitude compared to that of parental zzso including zzso zzso The second group of the compounds investigated represents a new type of zzso zzso zzso by the zzso directed zzso therapy zzso zzso According to this principle, a zzso inhibitor zzso was zzso with zzso zzso and zzso by zzso bond at the zzso The zzso activities of zzso in comparison with that of zzso were tested in zzso human zzso and zzso human colon zzso cell zzso In zzso cell culture the zzso activity of zzso significantly increased with increasing length of the zzso zzso The zzso with one zzso unit was about 5 times, while the zzso analogue was almost 19 times more active than zzso zzso activity of the zzso containing six zzso units was extremely high zzso efficiency zzso zzso therefore, in zzso testing of this analogue seems to be reasonable and zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso with a zzso inhibitor increased by zzso times in zzso cells as compared to zzso administered in zzso zzso
