The purpose of study was to comparatively characterize the zzso zzso zzso and function of respiratory chain in zzso in human gastric corpus zzso undergoing transition from normal to cancer states and in human gastric cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso The tissue samples taken by zzso and the cells were zzso by zzso treatment to assess zzso function in zzso by high-resolution zzso Compared to the control group of zzso samples, the zzso capacity of zzso in the cancer group was almost twice zzso The respiratory chain complex zzso zzso zzso to complex zzso zzso was reduced that suggests zzso of complex I, but the respiratory control by zzso in the presence of zzso was zzso Similar changes were observed also in zzso adjacent to cancer zzso The respiratory capacity of zzso cells was higher than that of zzso cells, but both types of cells exhibited a zzso of complex I of the respiratory chain which appears to be an intrinsic property of the cancer zzso In conclusion, human gastric cancer is associated with decreased respiratory capacity, zzso of the respiratory complex I of zzso and improved zzso of zzso zzso to zzso in tumor tissue and adjacent zzso zzso zzso of these changes in zzso samples may be of diagnostic zzso
