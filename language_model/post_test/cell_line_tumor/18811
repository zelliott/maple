zzso zzso disease zzso comprises a group of neurodegenerative disorders for which currently there is no zzso In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of drugs approved for human use, and protein folding agents in reversing the zzso zzso of familial zzso zzso in a cell zzso For an efficient experimental zzso green fluorescent protein zzso zzso prion protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso were expressed in human zzso zzso We report that unlike zzso that is expressed on the cell surface, zzso accumulates in the zzso of zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso or zzso agents known to inhibit the replication of zzso zzso in experimental models, gave conflicting results; zzso reverted the zzso zzso of zzso cells, whereas zzso had no zzso The concentration of zzso used in these studies is well within the plasma concentration of patients receiving a zzso zzso dose two to three times zzso Interestingly, exposure of zzso cells to low temperature zzso degrees zzso or to the chemical zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso also reversed the zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso and protein folding agents may hold promise as therapeutic agents for familial zzso zzso and other familial disorders that share similar zzso zzso
