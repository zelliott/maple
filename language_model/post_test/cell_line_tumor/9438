To explore the role of zzso binding protein 1 zzso in the proliferation of human zzso prostate cancer cells by zzso its zzso zzso 

Four zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso including a negative control zzso were zzso and inserted into the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was identified as the most zzso The 4 zzso zzso zzso 81, zzso and zzso were then zzso to human zzso prostate cancer cells of the line zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso were used to detect the zzso efficiency of different zzso zzso method was used to detect cell viability and flow zzso was used to observe cell cycle zzso 

Western zzso showed that the protein expression of zzso in the zzso cells was lower by zzso compared to that in the zzso zzso Compared with the control cells, the A values of the zzso cells 60, 84, zzso and 132 hours after zzso were all significantly lower than those of the zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all P zzso zzso showing that the cell viability was zzso The proportions of cells in the zzso and S zzso 60, 84, and 108 hours after zzso of the zzso cells were all significantly lower than those of the zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all P zzso zzso 

The suppressed expression of zzso in prostate cancer cells zzso by zzso zzso cell proliferation significantly, which indicates that zzso may play an important role in the proliferation of prostate cancer zzso
