zzso have recently gained interest as zzso contrast agents in a variety of biomedical applications related to cancer detection and zzso The objective of this study was to determine the potential of zzso administered zzso zzso gold zzso zzso for imaging zzso cell zzso zzso of the skin using zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso images narrow wavelength bands to enhance contrast from zzso particles in a wide field portable and zzso device that is clinically compatible for real-time tumor imaging and tumor margin zzso 

We zzso zzso to zzso a clinically approved humanized zzso that targets the zzso growth factor zzso zzso which is zzso on the surface of many tumor cells, especially zzso We excised subcutaneous zzso of zzso zzso from Swiss zzso mice and divided the tumors into two groups: zzso the targeted group zzso zzso zzso and zzso the control group zzso zzso zzso After topical application of particles and incubation for zzso the tumors were washed and zzso using zzso In addition, we performed zzso imaging to zzso the binding of zzso targeted zzso in tumors and their depth zzso 

The zzso images showed a visual increase in contrast from tumors after topical administration of targeted zzso zzso zzso tumors showed increased contrast compared to tumors administered with the control zzso There was a statistically significant increase in mean zzso intensity zzso from targeted zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso images of targeted zzso confirmed their binding affinity to the zzso receptors over expressed in the zzso zzso 

We have demonstrated that a topical application of gold zzso targeted specifically to tumor growth factor receptors results in a significantly higher image contrast compared to zzso gold zzso These results demonstrate the feasibility of zzso zzso to image and zzso tumor margins during surgical zzso using topical administration of targeted zzso
