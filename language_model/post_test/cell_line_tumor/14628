The diagnosis and treatment of zzso which rank among the leading causes of mortality in developed nations, presents substantial clinical zzso The genetic and zzso zzso of tumors can lead to differential response to therapy and gross disparities in patient zzso even for tumors originating from similar zzso zzso DNA sequencing technologies hold promise to improve the diagnosis and treatment of zzso through efficient and economical profiling of complete tumor zzso paving the way for approaches to personalized zzso that consider the unique genetic composition of the patient's zzso Here we present a novel method to leverage the information provided by cancer zzso sequencing to match an individual tumor zzso with commercial cell lines, which might be leveraged as clinical surrogates to inform prognosis or therapeutic zzso We evaluate the method using a published lung cancer zzso and genetic profiles of commercial cancer cell zzso The results support the general zzso of this matching approach, thereby offering a first step in zzso zzso approaches to personalized zzso using established cancer cell zzso
