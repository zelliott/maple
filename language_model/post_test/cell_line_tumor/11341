We assessed the contribution of zzso zzso in the efficacy and toxicity of zzso zzso zzso of small volume zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso that target zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 

zzso nude mice bearing 2-3 zzso zzso tumor zzso were zzso injected with similar activities zzso zzso and 1480 zzso 37 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso or with equivalent amounts of zzso zzso or with zzso zzso volume was monitored by zzso and survival was zzso Hematologic toxicity and body weight were zzso zzso of zzso zzso and absorbed zzso relationships using zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso zzso as revealed by white blood cells and zzso zzso was reported in mice treated with the highest activities of zzso zzso The median survival zzso was significantly higher in mice injected with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than in animals treated with the same activity of zzso zzso or with zzso zzso zzso zzso was even not reached after 130 days when follow-up was discontinued in mice treated with zzso zzso of zzso The later efficacy was unexpected since final absorbed dose resulting from injection of zzso zzso was higher for zzso zzso zzso than for zzso zzso zzso These results also highlight the lack of absorbed zzso relationship when mean absorbed dose was calculated using zzso zzso and the requirement to perform small-scale zzso 

These data indicate that it might be an advantage of using zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso in the therapy of small volume zzso zzso They support clinical investigations of zzso zzso as an zzso treatment after zzso surgery in patients with zzso zzso
