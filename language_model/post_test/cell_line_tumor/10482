zzso is a zzso zzso that binds with high affinity to zzso zzso that is over expressed in zzso of breast zzso In this study, we developed a method for indirect labeling of zzso with zzso and performed all zzso qualifications in production of a zzso agent for zzso of breast zzso 

The zzso purity and in zzso stability of zzso labeled zzso was determined by instant thin layer zzso The zzso and cell toxicity of the complex were tested on zzso cell zzso The zzso and zzso studies were performed in zzso mice with breast zzso 

The zzso purity was zzso after 2 zzso The in zzso zzso in zzso buffer and human blood serum were zzso and zzso at 96 zzso zzso The zzso of the complex was zzso The cell toxicity study showed that the complex inhibited zzso growth of zzso cells at a concentration of zzso zzso after 96 zzso The zzso and zzso studies showed the zzso of the complex at the site of tumors with high sensitivity and zzso 

The results showed that one may consider zzso as a potential zzso for therapy of human breast cancer, which needs further zzso
