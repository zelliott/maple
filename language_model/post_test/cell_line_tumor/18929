zzso of some zzso receptors on tumor cells is associated with increased zzso zzso In this respect, limited information is available on zzso zzso in human zzso zzso 

Purpose of the study was to identify zzso receptors involved in bone zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells in view of the development of targeted therapeutic zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were isolated from the zzso of six patients by zzso zzso zzso Some experiments were carried out using a panel of human zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses were performed by flow zzso Cell migration zzso were carried out using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell proliferation were investigated by flow zzso 

In all zzso samples, zzso was expressed by the majority of primary zzso and zzso their zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso cells from all zzso samples expressed zzso but were not attracted by soluble zzso Studies performed with two zzso zzso cell lines showed that the mechanism zzso zzso did not migrate to zzso was likely related to defective calcium zzso zzso 

zzso is the first zzso zzso so far identified able to attract in zzso primary zzso zzso zzso zzso may be involved in retention of zzso zzso in the zzso through interaction with zzso expressing zzso cells in the absence of signal zzso
