zzso to enrich zzso types of zzso are critical for comprehensive mapping of the zzso zzso Taking advantage of the distinct binding affinities of zzso and zzso for zzso we designed a zzso immobilized metal zzso affinity zzso for the sequential enrichment of zzso In zzso B cells, the sequential zzso metal affinity zzso zzso strategy displayed a zzso superior zzso coverage compared to single zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, up to zzso of the zzso zzso were uniquely enriched in either the first zzso zzso or second zzso zzso The complementary properties of zzso and zzso were further demonstrated through the exclusive enrichment of almost all of zzso multiply zzso peptides zzso in the zzso whereas only zzso of zzso zzso zzso were commonly enriched in both zzso The application of sequential zzso to human lung cancer tissue allowed the identification of zzso unique zzso with only zzso zzso In addition to the zzso zzso and multiply zzso zzso this zzso ability was also demonstrated on the basic and zzso zzso zzso zzso sites were predominately enriched in the first zzso zzso while zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sites were enriched in the second zzso This strategy provided complementary mapping of different zzso zzso in multiple cellular pathways related to cancer invasion and zzso of lung zzso Given the zzso ability and ease of tip preparation of this zzso we propose that this strategy allows more comprehensive characterization of the zzso both in zzso and in zzso
