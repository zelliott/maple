zzso is a readily released stress zzso that can be zzso by zzso zzso zzso to generate either zzso oxygen species zzso to induce zzso or zzso or zzso during times of zzso zzso However, the contribution of zzso metabolism to zzso in hypoxic zzso has not been zzso In this study, we investigated the different functions of zzso under zzso and zzso zzso We found that zzso induced zzso expression in cancer cells in zzso and that zzso zzso zzso with hypoxic zzso in zzso In addition, the combination of zzso and low zzso showed additive effects on zzso zzso Similar to conditions of low zzso zzso zzso induction was dependent on zzso protein zzso zzso but was independent of zzso and zzso Under zzso and combined zzso and hypoxic conditions, zzso zzso by zzso was used zzso for zzso production, whereas under zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling for survival by generating zzso Although the specific mechanism was different for zzso and zzso zzso zzso consistently contributed to tumor cell survival under these zzso Together, our findings offer new insights into the zzso zzso of tumor cells present within a hostile zzso and suggest that zzso metabolism is a potential target for cancer zzso
