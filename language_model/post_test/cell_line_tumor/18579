Human zzso cancer cell lines, zzso and its zzso zzso zzso and zzso and its zzso zzso zzso were subjected to acoustic zzso The critical levels zzso which resulted in no immediate cell killing, were determined in four cell lines, zzso zzso were the same in four cell zzso After being zzso by zzso cell proliferation and clone forming of zzso were suppressed but those of zzso were not affected zzso cell reproduction of zzso was triggered but that of zzso was not influenced zzso flow zzso detected zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso These findings suggested that there were differences in the responses to ultrasound exposure between zzso and zzso human zzso cancer zzso
