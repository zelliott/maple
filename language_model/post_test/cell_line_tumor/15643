In this study, we report the unique role of zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of specific zzso immune zzso We previously reported an zzso zzso zzso with which human primary resting B cells in the mantle zones of zzso zzso are zzso zzso analyses enabled identification of an zzso zzso as zzso which was highly expressed by zzso and memory B cells surrounding zzso zzso Cellular growth of mantle cell zzso cells also seemed to depend on zzso zzso mice exhibited weak zzso responses specific to foreign zzso at the initial and recall zzso This was probably attributable to the low number of zzso and memory B cells and the functional loss of zzso responses of zzso B zzso Moreover, zzso mice could not fully foster the development of zzso B helper T zzso cells even after zzso with foreign zzso Further experiments indicated that zzso affected mortality in zzso induced zzso in zzso circumstances, indicating that zzso would zzso zzso zzso Our results illustrate the novel role of zzso in zzso zzso immunity by managing primary B cells and zzso cells in zzso
