As part of a systematic study of the effects of zzso beyond zzso on cancer zzso we investigated whether zzso zzso a citrus zzso stimulates DNA repair following zzso damage in zzso human prostate cancer zzso The zzso zzso to zzso zzso ratio was measured after cells were treated with 200 zzso of zzso zzso in zzso medium followed by zzso exposure for 24 h in growth zzso The results demonstrated that exposure to zzso zzso of zzso led to a significant decrease in the ratio of zzso to zzso zzso Because cells were treated with zzso after zzso zzso was removed, we conclude that we demonstrated an effect on DNA repair beyond zzso In support of this conclusion, we determined the induction of zzso expression over time after zzso stress followed by zzso administration of three major zzso in the DNA base zzso repair zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso beta zzso expression in cells after zzso exposure to zzso was increased significantly compared with control cells without zzso The zzso concentration of zzso after exposure to 80 zzso was 3 zzso zzso which is zzso achievable in zzso In conclusion, the zzso effects of citrus fruits demonstrated in zzso studies may be due in part to stimulation of DNA repair by zzso which by stimulating zzso processes may prevent zzso changes in prostate cancer zzso
