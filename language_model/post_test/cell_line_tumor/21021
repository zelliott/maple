The zzso regulated zzso protein zzso blocks processing of zzso family zzso zzso in embryonic zzso The molecular basis for this selective zzso processing block is zzso Here we find that zzso selectively binds the terminal loop region of zzso precursors in zzso and that the loop mediates zzso processing zzso in zzso Additionally, we identify the zzso of zzso required for this zzso These findings establish a regulatory role for the terminal loop of precursors in zzso maturation and provide insight into the mechanism by which zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso
