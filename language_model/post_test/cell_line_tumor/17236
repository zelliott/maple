zzso of zzso to zzso cells constitutes a crucial step in zzso zzso low density zzso zzso are supposed to facilitate the zzso zzso We investigated the molecular mechanisms by which mildly and extensively zzso LDL force zzso of zzso zzso and human zzso to human zzso zzso zzso zzso After zzso of zzso of zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso significantly increased to zzso zzso zzso in the presence of mildly oxidized zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the presence of extensively oxidized zzso Similar results were obtained with zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso to zzso zzso zzso using mildly oxidized low density zzso and to zzso zzso zzso using extensively oxidized low density zzso Native high density zzso and to a lesser extent zzso high density zzso significantly zzso the effects of low density zzso Prior incubation of zzso cells with modified zzso followed by their removal and subsequent incubation with zzso or zzso resulted in only minor changes of zzso This suggests that the direct contact of low density zzso with zzso followed by zzso of a respiratory burst with release of zzso oxygen species zzso the zzso zzso zzso the addition of antioxidants zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso medium was followed by a significant decrease in zzso zzso It is concluded that oxidized low density zzso respiratory burst zzso of zzso with subsequent release of zzso constitutes a crucial step in promoting the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso
