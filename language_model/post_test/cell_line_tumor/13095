Recently, there has been a surge of interest in developing compounds selectively targeting zzso for the treatment of zzso The critical role of zzso in cellular metabolism and zzso supports this therapeutic zzso zzso in the processes of energy production and metabolism contributes to zzso of response to zzso stimuli and increased zzso production both of which are implicated in the initiation and progression of most human zzso 

A zzso zzso screen of over 10,000 zzso small molecules for zzso activity identified the zzso zzso zzso 197 and zzso as having zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso treatment induced cell cycle arrest independent of zzso status, as determined by analysis of DNA content in zzso zzso stained zzso In a mouse model of human breast cancer, zzso mice showed significantly decreased tumor growth compared to vehicle or zzso treated zzso No zzso or organ damage were observed following zzso zzso zzso zzso of tissue sections from zzso tumors demonstrated a decrease in cellular proliferation and increased zzso zzso The fluorescent properties of analog zzso were exploited to assess zzso zzso of zzso compounds, demonstrating zzso zzso Following zzso zzso cells exhibited decreased oxygen consumption and zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of results from a 600 target zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso compounds significantly affected signaling pathways relevant to growth and zzso 

Through our continued interest in designing compounds targeting zzso zzso the Warburg effect, and zzso we recently discovered a series of novel, zzso compounds containing a zzso zzso that show remarkable activity in a panel of cancer cell lines as well as in a mouse model of human breast zzso The mechanism of action includes zzso zzso causing decreased oxygen consumption, increased zzso production and attenuated growth factor zzso
