The zzso zzso is a central control of cell growth, zzso zzso and survival, and is zzso in most zzso Cancer cells are addicted to increased activity of zzso zzso signaling zzso leading to numerous zzso of zzso signaling in zzso and clinical trials for cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso which targets zzso zzso zzso cancer cell growth in zzso Here we report that zzso reduces the zzso and proliferation of zzso both in zzso and in zzso In cultured zzso cell lines, zzso inhibited cell proliferation and arrested cells in the zzso phase of the cell cycle, accompanied with reduction of zzso and zzso With in zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso treatment resulted in the zzso of zzso signaling as demonstrated by the decreased zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with this finding, zzso significantly decreased the average tumor volume, zzso zzso of zzso and the number of zzso zzso Our data demonstrated that targeting zzso by zzso inhibited the growth of zzso in zzso and in zzso providing the basis for further development of zzso as a therapy for zzso zzso
