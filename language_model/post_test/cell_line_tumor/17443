Clinical studies with zzso zzso have shown that existing viruses are safe but lack zzso To selectively increase the toxicity of zzso zzso targeting colon zzso we have inserted the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso after the zzso gene in the major late zzso zzso was expressed using either an internal zzso entry site zzso or by alternative zzso of a new zzso analogous to the zzso long zzso zzso The zzso virus gave higher zzso expression on Western zzso Both approaches result in zzso expression restricted to the period after viral DNA zzso zzso burst size was reduced by less than approximately zzso by zzso zzso showing that expression of zzso as a late gene is compatible with virus zzso zzso effect zzso in colon cancer cell lines showed that both zzso viruses have approximately zzso increased toxicity in the presence of the zzso zzso which is converted to zzso zzso by zzso zzso was higher following addition of zzso immediately after zzso The largest gain in toxicity was seen in zzso colon cancer cells, which are the least zzso colon cancer cells for the parental virus, indicating that the new zzso viruses may have broader applications for colon cancer therapy than their zzso
