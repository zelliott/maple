zzso systems have been explored extensively for a diagnostic therapy in the forms of zzso zzso zzso devices, and zzso zzso In this work, we report zzso systems in zzso assembled by zzso chemistry responding to a zzso As a model zzso system on demand, zzso zzso zzso was zzso and decorated with zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso like 1 zzso specific zzso by simple mixing in zzso zzso The resulting zzso and/or zzso was successfully applied to the zzso of its zzso delivery to zzso cells with zzso receptors and its therapeutic signal zzso with elevated zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso human breast zzso zzso zzso Finally, we could confirm zzso and zzso stability of the highly specific zzso zzso The on-demand zzso platform technology using zzso chemistry can be exploited for various zzso zzso drug delivery, and tissue engineering zzso
