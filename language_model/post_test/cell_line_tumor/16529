zzso zzso and zzso acids are zzso acids derived directly from food intake or come from the gut metabolism of zzso In this study, the zzso activity of these compounds was at first evaluated in membrane models, where zzso acid behaved as a very effective zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso acids were only zzso of zzso zzso However, all three compounds acted as good zzso of zzso species in cultured cells subjected to zzso zzso stress produced by low level of zzso Many zzso cells are zzso by increased zzso levels compared with their zzso zzso zzso we investigated whether zzso zzso at low zzso comparable to those present in human zzso were able to decrease zzso zzso zzso zzso show that zzso acids reduced zzso in a zzso cell line zzso whereas no effect was observed in normal cells, such as zzso The compounds exhibited no toxicity to normal cells while they decreased proliferation in zzso cells, inducing zzso In the debate on optimal zzso strategies in cancer therapy, our work in zzso cells supports the zzso zzso zzso
