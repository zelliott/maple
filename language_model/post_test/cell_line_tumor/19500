In last couple of decades the use of natural compounds like zzso as zzso agents has gained much zzso Our current study focuses on identifying zzso zzso and their mechanism of action on human prostate cancer zzso Human prostate cancer cells zzso zzso zzso with zzso protein 1 zzso zzso reporter gene were treated with four main classes of zzso namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso The maximum zzso zzso induction of about 3 fold over control was observed with 20 zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and 50 zzso concentration of zzso At higher zzso most of the zzso demonstrated zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso for cell viability at 24 h showed that even at a very high concentration zzso zzso cell death was minimal for most of the zzso To determine the role of zzso zzso in the induction of zzso by zzso Western zzso of zzso zzso proteins was zzso Four out of the eight zzso namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used for the Western zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso activity was observed after two hour incubation of zzso cells with zzso However no induction of zzso activity was zzso Furthermore, zzso the cells with specific zzso of zzso reduced the zzso zzso activity that was induced by zzso while zzso with zzso inhibitor reduced the zzso zzso activity induced by zzso The pharmacological zzso did not affect the zzso zzso activity induced by zzso and zzso These results suggest the possible involvement of zzso zzso in zzso induced zzso activity while the zzso zzso seems to play an important role in zzso induced zzso zzso
