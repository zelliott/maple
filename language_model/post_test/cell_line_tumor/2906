zzso human cancer cell lines are routinely used as experimental models for human zzso Their zzso for such use is analyzed and discussed, with particular focus on zzso zzso Although cell lines retain some properties of the cells of origin, from the points of view of their zzso zzso and gene zzso they show clear differences in these properties compared to in zzso zzso This can be explained by a prior selection of initiating cells and a zzso evolution in zzso The properties of the cell lines are compared to those of the zzso cancer stem cells and their use as models in this regard are zzso Furthermore, other proper and possible uses of the cell lines are zzso
