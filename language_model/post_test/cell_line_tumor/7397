To study the effect of zzso B virus X zzso gene zzso on expression of human zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso in human zzso duct zzso cell lines zzso and to zzso the significance of zzso of zzso zzso by zzso gene on the zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso were cultured in zzso and zzso with zzso expression zzso containing the zzso coding region and cloning zzso containing enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso coding sequence using zzso gene zzso zzso Thirty six hours after zzso zzso zzso the indicator of successful zzso in cells, was zzso zzso zzso was applied to determine the zzso zzso zzso were harvested and total zzso was extracted with zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso in zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso protein in zzso was detected by zzso zzso and western zzso 

The zzso efficiency was zzso for both zzso expression zzso and zzso control zzso The expression of zzso zzso was significantly increased when zzso with zzso expression zzso than that zzso with zzso medium and zzso zzso The expression of zzso protein could only be found in the cells when zzso with zzso expression zzso by zzso zzso and western zzso 

zzso gene zzso may zzso the zzso expression of zzso zzso in zzso duct zzso zzso The zzso of zzso gene by zzso gene is primary mechanism for zzso of zzso zzso after zzso zzso
