Human zzso zzso zzso represent a cellular zzso of potentially zzso zzso zzso A growing body of evidence indicates that the zzso of zzso zzso sequences might be involved in the transformation of zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of ultraviolet radiation zzso on the expression of human zzso zzso type K zzso in melanoma cells and zzso cells in zzso zzso in melanoma cell lines, zzso with zzso zzso zzso resulted in a significant zzso zzso of the zzso pol gene as well as in an enhanced expression of the zzso envelope protein zzso In addition, zzso treatment induced the production of zzso particles in the zzso of melanoma cell zzso These data indicate that zzso expression can be activated by zzso zzso and suggest an involvement of zzso in zzso melanoma zzso
