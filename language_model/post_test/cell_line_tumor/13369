Hodgkin's zzso is frequently associated with mast cell zzso that zzso directly with disease severity, but the mechanisms underlying this relationship remain zzso Here, we report that mast cells promote the growth of Hodgkin's tumor by zzso the tumor zzso A transplantation zzso shows that primary zzso mast cells accelerate tumor growth by established Hodgkin's cell lines, and promote marked zzso and zzso Both mast cells and Hodgkin's cells were sensitive to zzso but mast cells were more resistant to zzso However, zzso inhibited zzso zzso rapid release of zzso and continuous release of vascular zzso growth zzso from mast cells even at the concentration that did not induce cell zzso zzso mast cells lost the ability to induce zzso and fibrosis, and did not promote the growth of zzso tumor in zzso These results provide further evidence supporting zzso relationships between inflammation and tumor growth, and demonstrate that zzso can target the tumor zzso
