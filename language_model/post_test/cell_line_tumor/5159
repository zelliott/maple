zzso disease is a primary cause of zzso death, and factors governing tumor cell zzso have not been fully zzso Here, we address this question by using tumor cell lines derived from mice that develop zzso lung zzso zzso to expression of zzso zzso and zzso Despite having widespread zzso genetic zzso the zzso tumor cells retained a marked zzso They zzso zzso between zzso and zzso states, forming highly polarized zzso spheres in three-dimensional culture that underwent zzso transition zzso following treatment with transforming growth zzso or injection into zzso zzso This transition was entirely dependent on the zzso zzso family, which decreased during zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso the capacity of these tumor cells to undergo zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso features of zzso tumor zzso We conclude that tumor cell zzso is regulated by zzso zzso which changes in response to contextual zzso zzso
