zzso lengthening is one of the key events in most zzso and depends largely on zzso zzso zzso zzso is a well-known phenomenon in zzso however, its mechanism remains zzso In this study, we investigated the presence of zzso in the promoter of the zzso reverse zzso zzso gene in a series of 546 zzso We found a high zzso of mutually exclusive zzso located at two hot spots, zzso and zzso in all zzso of zzso (55 zzso The frequency of zzso was particularly high among primary zzso zzso zzso and pure zzso tumors zzso zzso while relatively low in diffuse zzso and zzso zzso (19 and 25 zzso zzso The expression level of zzso in tumors carrying those zzso was on average zzso times higher than that of zzso tumors, indicating that the zzso promoter leads to zzso of zzso zzso promoter zzso were observed in almost all tumors harboring concurrent total zzso loss and zzso zzso zzso zzso Otherwise zzso promoter zzso were mostly observed among zzso zzso zzso Most zzso zzso zzso zzso were also associated with zzso promoter zzso Our data indicate that zzso of the zzso promoter is one of the major mechanisms of zzso zzso in zzso The unique pattern of zzso promoter zzso in relation to other genetic zzso suggests that they play distinct roles in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Our results shed a new light on the role of zzso zzso in the development of adult zzso
