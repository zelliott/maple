The effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso expression was analyzed in human prostate zzso zzso as well as cancer zzso zzso and independent zzso zzso The three cell lines expressed zzso zzso and zzso zzso as measured by zzso and zzso which supports an zzso action of zzso in the prostate zzso zzso levels were progressively higher from zzso to zzso and independent zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed that zzso zzso both zzso zzso and protein expression in a faster manner as prostate cancer stage progressed zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso induced higher levels of zzso protein expression in cancer cells as compared with zzso zzso The zzso agent zzso blocked zzso zzso expression in all cell lines studied supporting the involvement of nuclear zzso zzso in such a zzso In fact, zzso increased the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso to the nucleus and the binding of the active form to its target gene promoter, as measured by zzso and zzso zzso zzso provoked faster responses according to the most aggressive status in cancer progression zzso zzso These results together with the existence of two zzso sites in the zzso gene promoter together suggest that zzso may be a target for zzso in prostate cancer zzso On the other hand, zzso could be a zzso zzso acting through the zzso zzso
