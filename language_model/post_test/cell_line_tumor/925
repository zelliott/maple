The mouse zzso zzso has unique zzso zzso zzso that are zzso in response to zzso DNA breaks introduced by zzso zzso This suggests that zzso acts to maintain zzso zzso We constructed a zzso zzso zzso zzso and integrated it into zzso mouse zzso cells by zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, expression of the zzso zzso gene was zzso to zzso of the expression observed in zzso cells by the addition of zzso an analog of zzso zzso of cells with zzso zzso expression to zzso was increased zzso indicating that DNA repair was impaired by repression of zzso When we zzso injected zzso zzso cells into the zzso of mice, tumor growth was slightly suppressed by zzso in zzso tumors, whereas without zzso tumor growth did not differ by zzso zzso Thus, zzso might be a potential molecular target for zzso cancer cells to zzso to minimize required zzso zzso
