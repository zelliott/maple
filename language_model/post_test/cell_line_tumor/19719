Breast zzso commonly spread to zzso zzso zzso If the primary tumors are zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso positive, then the likelihood that zzso zzso express receptors exceeds zzso However, due to lack of zzso models, little is known about the role of hormones in breast cancer spread or the effects of the zzso zzso on hormone zzso We have developed zzso models using zzso labeled zzso and zzso human breast cancer zzso zzso are tracked in living mice by zzso imaging, and zzso or zzso are detected by zzso imaging or zzso zzso zzso growth is zzso dependent and required for zzso zzso Seventy-five percent of all tumors and zzso of larger tumors generate zzso zzso Occasionally more distant zzso are also zzso zzso of primary tumors, zzso draining zzso vessels, and zzso zzso from the same mouse show that zzso zzso as measured by zzso zzso is higher in the zzso than in the primary zzso zzso High zzso levels are extensively zzso by zzso in primary zzso However, there is partial failure of zzso zzso in zzso associated with zzso reduced zzso zzso This suggests that zzso are dysfunctional in the zzso zzso and perhaps hormone zzso zzso zzso is sparsely expressed in primary tumor cells but zzso zzso in cells zzso the zzso and zzso zzso We zzso that zzso expression targets tumor cells for transport to, and zzso in, zzso If so, the zzso zzso could be targeted zzso to slow or prevent zzso zzso
