zzso zzso zzso based on the similarity of their binding to the proteins zzso on the surface of blood cells, is essential for progress in zzso zzso and clinical zzso The collaborative efforts of researchers from many countries have led to the zzso of thousands of zzso into 247 clusters of differentiation zzso zzso is based on flow zzso and zzso zzso In preliminary zzso of zzso based on flow zzso data, the object requiring zzso (an zzso is described by a set of random samples from unknown zzso of zzso zzso An individual sample is collected in the experiment, where a population of cells of a certain type is stained by the identical zzso marked replicates of the zzso of zzso zzso are collected for multiple cell zzso The zzso problems of interest include identifying new CDs zzso discovery or zzso zzso and assigning new zzso to the known CD clusters zzso prediction or supervised zzso These problems have attracted limited attention from zzso We recommend a novel approach to the zzso process in which a computer zzso suggests to the analyst the subset of the zzso zzso zzso of an zzso in class prediction problems or the zzso zzso zzso groups of zzso in class discovery zzso The suggested zzso speeds up the analysis of a flow zzso data by a factor zzso This allows the analyst to focus on the interpretation of the automatically suggested preliminary zzso solutions and on planning the subsequent zzso zzso
