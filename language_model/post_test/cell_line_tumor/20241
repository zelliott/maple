The zzso growth factor zzso zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso is expressed in up to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso where it zzso with poor zzso The majority of zzso are diagnosed at an advanced stage, and at least 50% present zzso zzso High levels of zzso have been found in the zzso of zzso patients and correlate with shorter zzso zzso we investigated the signaling cascade led by zzso zzso in zzso and assessed whether zzso zzso could induce an zzso zzso characterized by zzso zzso In zzso analysis of zzso cell lines revealed that zzso zzso activated zzso zzso and induced zzso of zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso expression and zzso were strongly inhibited by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso A significant reduction of zzso zzso zzso was also obtained with the zzso inhibitor zzso Of 23 primary zzso tumors from zzso patients with zzso zzso at surgery, 12 zzso membrane zzso zzso and zzso by zzso both zzso and zzso were present in zzso of the corresponding zzso Analysis of a publicly available zzso data set from 204 zzso confirmed a significant correlation between zzso and zzso zzso and patients with the highest zzso and zzso zzso showed a significantly shorter zzso survival time zzso This suggests that zzso may have a significant impact on the therapy of a particular subset of zzso and that zzso zzso may be a novel zzso zzso
