To zzso the synergistic effects of zzso II A combined with zzso zzso acid zzso on the differentiation and zzso of human acute zzso leukemia zzso cell line zzso 

The zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso zzso II A combined with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively in zzso zzso differentiation was demonstrated by zzso and zzso reduction zzso The expression of zzso and zzso cell cycle and zzso induced by these drugs were measured by flow zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso rate of the combination of Tan II A with zzso was much zzso The differentiated cells accounted for over 90 percent, among them the band forms and zzso constituted more than 65 zzso zzso reduction and zzso expression were much higher, and expression of zzso was lower than that of Tan II A or zzso alone ( zzso zzso analysis also showed that combination of Tan II A with zzso arrested zzso cells in zzso phase and induced significantly zzso of zzso cells ( zzso There were no significant dose dependent effects induced by zzso in combination with Tan II A at zzso zzso to zzso zzso on differentiation and zzso of zzso zzso 

The combination of Tan II A with zzso has synergistic effects on differentiation and zzso of zzso zzso The effects do not increase with the dosage escalation of zzso
