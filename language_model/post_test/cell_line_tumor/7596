Acute zzso leukemia zzso is the most common zzso zzso in zzso Despite the advances in treatment, about zzso of patients zzso and/or die, indicating the need for different therapies for this zzso zzso zzso is a potent DNA zzso zzso inhibitor and has been associated with gene zzso and enhancement of tumor zzso This study aimed to evaluate the effects of zzso alone or combined with zzso zzso and zzso on childhood ALL cell zzso Cell zzso zzso and zzso capacity were studied in zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso was carried out to evaluate zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso zzso Gene expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was assessed using zzso Both cell cultures were sensitive to zzso showing a zzso and zzso response ( zzso zzso induced zzso and decreased zzso capacity in both cell zzso Combination with zzso resulted in a strong synergistic effect, whereas combination with zzso led to an zzso response in both cell zzso zzso treatment decreased gene expression of the three zzso and induced zzso gene promoter zzso and its zzso These results indicate that zzso may be a promising drug for the zzso treatment of zzso mainly when combined with zzso
