Agents stabilizing zzso have the potential to interfere with zzso replication by blocking the zzso step zzso by zzso or zzso mechanism and could therefore act as zzso zzso In this study, we found that zzso derivatives zzso zzso with zzso zzso structures and were novel potent zzso zzso Treatment with zzso derivatives zzso inhibited zzso activity in human leukemia zzso cells and colon cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (one of zzso zzso when added to zzso and zzso cell culture at zzso zzso zzso increased time of population zzso of zzso and zzso cells, induced a marked zzso in cell growth and cellular zzso zzso after 35 and 18 days, zzso Growth zzso was accompanied by a zzso of zzso zzso and induction of zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso However, another compound zzso with greater zzso for zzso had no obvious cellular effect in zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso derivatives as novel potent zzso interactive agents induce zzso and zzso zzso in cancer cells and therefore are promising agents for cancer zzso
