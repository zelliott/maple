The survival of patients with head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso remains unaffected despite recent therapeutic zzso To reverse this trend, reliable and clinically zzso markers of tumor aggressiveness must be zzso One such marker may be the zzso zzso zzso The authors hypothesized that zzso zzso contribute to zzso zzso and the objective of the current study was to prove this hypothesis using zzso expression analysis and a large cohort of clinical zzso 

zzso zzso analysis was performed on a prospective cohort of 20 patients with previously zzso oral cavity or zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and on normal zzso zzso from 4 zzso After determining whether zzso zzso were produced by tumors, zzso media from three zzso cell lines were used to zzso zzso migration in an in zzso zzso A zzso tissue zzso of 102 patients with previously zzso zzso zzso was stained zzso for zzso to identify tissue zzso and the results were correlated with zzso data and zzso 

zzso zzso protein 1 was zzso significantly in tumors compared with normal zzso zzso fold zzso All University of Michigan SCC tumor cell line zzso media caused a significant increase in zzso migration zzso zzso zzso zzso data revealed that zzso content of the primary tumor was associated strongly with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso spread zzso and advanced clinical disease stage zzso When it was evaluated along with other zzso data, the zzso content was found to be an independent predictor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso tumor zzso content is a strong predictor of tumor aggressiveness in zzso
