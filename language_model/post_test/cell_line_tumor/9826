zzso is the disorder of zzso cell development and is characterized by an zzso of cell proliferation and zzso There is a pressing need for the development of novel tactics for leukemia therapy as conventional treatments often have severe adverse side zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso basic zzso isolated from the dried roots of medicinal zzso plants zzso It has been reported to have various biological and pharmacological activities, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, its zzso effects and action mechanisms on zzso cells remain poorly zzso In this study, zzso was shown to suppress the proliferation of the zzso zzso leukemia zzso zzso cells in a zzso and zzso zzso It also significantly reduced the growth of zzso zzso cells in zzso in zzso zzso zzso However, it exhibited no significant direct zzso on normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed an obvious cell cycle arrest of the zzso zzso zzso cells at the zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, 4 and 6 genes in zzso zzso cells was found to be zzso at 24 h as measured by zzso zzso and functional studies revealed that zzso could induce differentiation in zzso zzso cells, as shown by the increases in zzso cellular zzso and zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso our findings suggest that zzso might exert its zzso effect on the zzso zzso leukemia zzso zzso cells by causing cell cycle arrest and by triggering cell zzso
