A number of zzso receptors are targeted to the nucleus and convincingly localized zzso However, what remains a conundrum is how these zzso receptors end up in the zzso In this study, we reported that the zzso zzso zzso zzso was located in a series of carrier zzso including zzso zzso near the plasma zzso large core zzso and small dense core zzso around the zzso as well as in the nucleus in human zzso cell line zzso using zzso and zzso zzso Meanwhile, we also showed that small dense core zzso zzso from large core zzso and zzso with the nuclear zzso zzso our results suggested that such a series of membrane compartments might be involved in the zzso of nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
