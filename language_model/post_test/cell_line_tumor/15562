In the past years, in our laboratory, several cell lines have been generated starting from a human liver zzso Some of them have been used successfully in studies of the infection with and propagation of zzso B and zzso C zzso Recently, several lines of evidence indicated that the origin of these cell lines was zzso zzso we now have determined the genetic characteristics of these cell lines in comparison to zzso cells received from zzso and to zzso zzso grown at other zzso zzso fluorescent short tandem repeat zzso typing and zzso were zzso In addition, some zzso characteristics of selected clones were zzso zzso all zzso cell lines were identical to zzso zzso However, some zzso functions varied between the different zzso zzso The zzso cell lines that were generated proved to be zzso lines of zzso The problem of zzso during cloning of cell lines appears to be not zzso We found that two out of six zzso zzso obtained from other laboratories were not derived from the same individual as the original zzso zzso zzso zzso typing should be applied as a rapid and sensitive technique to determine and monitor the origin of cell lines and to safeguard against zzso
