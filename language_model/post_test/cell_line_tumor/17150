zzso difference analysis, a zzso zzso approach, was used to identify genes that are expressed in acute leukemia but not in normal zzso zzso We isolated a zzso zzso from a cell line derived from a B cell acute zzso leukemia bearing two Philadelphia zzso The zzso derives from an orphan gene that was named zzso zzso is located in region zzso and encodes a major zzso transcript and several alternatively spliced minor zzso zzso expression of zzso was detected by zzso and quantitative zzso in bone zzso samples from B cell acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso was not or was scarcely expressed in other types of zzso zzso in normal zzso and in solid zzso
