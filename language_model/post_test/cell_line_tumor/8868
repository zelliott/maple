In zzso folk medicine, roots of chicory zzso zzso zzso have been reported to exert zzso zzso In zzso a natural zzso acid extract zzso from zzso zzso root has been shown to increase insulin zzso by pancreatic zzso and zzso zzso by muscle zzso 

In zzso experiments were designed to compare the effects of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to those obtained with zzso zzso and 100 zzso on the three major zzso implicated in zzso regulation zzso muscle and zzso In zzso experiments were performed in zzso rats submitted to a daily zzso injection of zzso zzso 15 or 30 zzso zzso for 4 zzso On the fourth day, an zzso zzso tolerance test zzso 1 g zzso was carried zzso 

Our results show that the three compounds we used are able each to induce an original zzso zzso acid mainly promotes a decrease in zzso zzso zzso acid elicits a clear increase of insulin release and a reduction of zzso zzso However, this compound zzso an zzso of muscle zzso zzso zzso provokes an increase of insulin release and zzso zzso without any effect on zzso zzso We could also show that none of these compounds implicates zzso zzso zzso in contrast to zzso acid, known as an inhibitor of zzso zzso and which is able to decrease zzso output from zzso Our results point out that zzso is able to decrease blood zzso without any effect zzso zzso Our in zzso experiments bring evidence that 4 daily zzso administrations of zzso improve zzso zzso tolerance in a zzso manner and mainly via an insulin zzso zzso 

We conclude that zzso presents an zzso effect essentially due to a peripheral effect on muscle zzso zzso
