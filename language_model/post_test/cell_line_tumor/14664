Multiple zzso zzso is a zzso disease mainly affecting young zzso A major pathological hallmark of zzso is the presence of zzso zzso in the central nervous zzso In the active phase of the disease, zzso become zzso migrate and contribute to local tissue zzso that ultimately can result in an zzso zzso This process is facilitated by zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with a ubiquitous tissue distribution and it has been shown that inflammatory zzso can induce zzso zzso In addition, zzso is known to mediate cell zzso and zzso We therefore hypothesized that zzso is present in zzso zzso and plays a role in cell zzso and/or zzso Our studies showed that zzso zzso appeared in zzso in active and chronic active zzso zzso These zzso positive zzso partly zzso with zzso Additional in zzso studies showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso to and migration on the zzso zzso protein zzso We therefore speculate that zzso mediates the enhanced interaction of zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso thereby contributing to zzso zzso and migration, and thus in tissue zzso and possibly zzso zzso
