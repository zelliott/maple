We studied whether acquisition of zzso resistance zzso by tumor cells can alter their zzso profile and zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso was selected for zzso yielding the zzso zzso Compared with the parental cells, the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso collagen zzso which correlated with decreased expression of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated significantly decreased activity of zzso zzso lower ability to invade zzso and attenuated zzso in zzso zzso We provide evidence for the first time that selection for zzso can be associated with zzso of zzso zzso supporting our recent proof of the zzso role of this zzso zzso 20 (2001) zzso Lack of zzso expression may link cell survival under toxic conditions with decreased zzso of the resulting drug resistant zzso
