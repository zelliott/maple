zzso zzso are zzso zzso that regulate expression of target zzso and are controlled by tumor zzso and zzso zzso expression of specific zzso in several tumor types and its association with poor prognosis parameters have been zzso Fewer data are available on its impact on patients' zzso We studied the impact of the expression of zzso zzso and zzso on survival and its correlation with the levels of their target zzso and host gene and zzso zzso We assessed in 110 colon cancer patients the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by quantitative real-time zzso and loss of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso survival zzso and overall survival zzso were examined in each zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso was associated with pathological tumor features of poor zzso zzso of zzso predicted shortened zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with zzso only at early stages zzso zzso zzso zzso correlations were found between zzso and zzso levels and their target zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso No correlation was found between zzso expression and its host gene levels, zzso zzso deregulation was revealed as a marker of zzso and zzso independent of tumor zzso The lack of association between expression of zzso and its host gene zzso suggests their regulation by independent zzso zzso correlation between zzso and zzso and zzso levels supports zzso as a target zzso for the two zzso
