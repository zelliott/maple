Recent zzso and clinical studies indicate beneficial effects from combining zzso with either zzso drugs or zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso To investigate the effect of combining these approaches, we evaluated in zzso the zzso efficacy of the zzso compound zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor that zzso among others vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso targeting the zzso and zzso zzso given alone and in zzso 

zzso were carried out using a zzso human head and neck tumor cell line, zzso with a high zzso content, growing as zzso zzso in nude zzso Three days after tumor cell injection, zzso (20 zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso both 5 zzso seven doses, and zzso (6 zzso 3 zzso four zzso were administered alone and in combination during 9 zzso 

zzso administration of drugs produced a marked and significant zzso decrease, and the addition of zzso completely abolished tumor zzso The drug association markedly reduced tumor cell proliferation zzso and the number of the vessels, but enhanced cell zzso 

The efficacy of this combination of zzso zzso and zzso may be of clinical importance in the management of head and neck cancer zzso
