zzso is a zzso zzso isolated from the bark of zzso zzso It exhibited in zzso zzso activity against zzso zzso and zzso cells with zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso cells treated with zzso underwent zzso In order to determine whether zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso pathway, zzso zzso proteins were zzso zzso treatment induced zzso expression through 12 to 72 h of exposure, while zzso expression was slightly decreased through 48 zzso and decreased more significantly by 72 zzso zzso zzso expression was detected at 72 zzso and zzso zzso was increased through 48 to 72 zzso zzso the large zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulting from zzso zzso was detected at 12, 24 and 48 zzso and especially at 72 zzso zzso zzso expression was also detected at 72 zzso Since zzso caused zzso zzso phase arrest of zzso cells as indicated by flow zzso analysis, the protein levels of cell zzso genes were zzso zzso treatment zzso zzso did not change zzso B after zzso to zzso zzso The expression of zzso was not changed and zzso zzso zzso increased after zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, protein zzso zzso which functions as a zzso zzso by zzso of zzso decreased in a zzso manner after zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso is a potent zzso drug that zzso zzso of zzso cells through the zzso zzso and its zzso cell cycle arrest is associated with the zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso
