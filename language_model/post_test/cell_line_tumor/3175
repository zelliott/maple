It has been speculated that zzso and zzso might be involved in the zzso development of zzso because cancer zzso is similar to the regulation of migratory activity in zzso Here, we aimed to examine the expression of zzso zzso zzso in oral zzso cell zzso zzso and to investigate its correlation with tumor development and zzso 

zzso of zzso was examined in 65 cases of zzso zzso 10 cases of normal oral zzso and two cell lines using zzso Western zzso and zzso The differences in zzso expression between various groups were evaluated using zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell proliferation zzso were zzso by zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell migration was zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was highly expressed on zzso compared to normal zzso In zzso positive zzso expression was significantly correlated with cervical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso tumor size zzso zzso zzso and clinical stage zzso zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso and Western zzso also confirmed positive zzso expression in zzso and zzso cell line, and negative zzso expression in normal oral zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso was a potent zzso for zzso and zzso cell lines, and completely inhibited by the selective zzso of zzso receptors zzso zzso induced migratory activity of zzso cells in a zzso zzso 

Increased expression of zzso may play an important role in the formation and zzso of zzso
