A variety of cellular and viral processes are zzso regulated during zzso zzso infection to achieve optimal virus zzso The Ad late gene product zzso has been associated with disparate activities during infection, including the regulation of late gene zzso viral DNA packaging, and infectious virus zzso We generated and characterized two zzso zzso viruses to further explore zzso functions during viral zzso Our results show that zzso is indeed important for zzso control of viral gene expression not only because it activates late gene expression but also because it suppresses early gene zzso We also show that the zzso protein binds to viral packaging sequences in zzso and is essential to recruit two other packaging zzso zzso and zzso to this zzso The elimination of zzso gave rise to the production of only empty virus zzso and not mature zzso which confirms that the zzso protein is required for Ad zzso zzso Finally, zzso contributes to zzso cell death by regulating the expression of the zzso death zzso Thus, the zzso zzso protein is zzso and an integral component of crucial aspects of zzso
