In response to stress, zzso binds and zzso the internal zzso promoter, thus regulating the expression of its own zzso zzso Here, we report that, in addition to zzso at least four zzso zzso regulate zzso expression at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso This regulation occurs through direct zzso to the internal zzso promoter as demonstrated by zzso zzso and the use of zzso zzso zzso The promoter regions involved in the zzso zzso were identified using deleted, zzso and zzso zzso reporter zzso In addition, we observed that transient expression of zzso family members zzso zzso zzso expression at both zzso and protein zzso We also report zzso variation of zzso and zzso expression during zzso differentiation of zzso cells and induced zzso stem cells derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, proliferation zzso indicated that zzso zzso regulates the zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Overall, this study shows a strong interplay between zzso zzso and zzso zzso to orchestrate cell fate zzso
