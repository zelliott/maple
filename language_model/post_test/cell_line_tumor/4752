zzso line zzso in the mismatch repair zzso genes zzso and zzso account for approximately zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, there is increasing evidence for an involvement of zzso gene expression in the response of cells to zzso skin zzso The link between zzso and skin cancer suggests an involvement of zzso gene expression in the response of skin cells to zzso DNA zzso In this report, we have used two reporter gene zzso to examine the role of zzso and zzso in the repair of zzso DNA damage induced by UVA light and DNA damage caused by zzso blue plus visible light zzso UVA and zzso produce zzso in DNA that are repaired by base zzso repair zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that expresses the zzso zzso reporter gene under the control of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso We show a reduced host cell zzso for zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso human colon zzso cells compared to their zzso counterpart zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso human colon zzso cells compared to zzso zzso zzso We have also reported previously that enhanced expression of the undamaged zzso reporter gene is induced by the zzso of cells with lower levels of the zzso agent and to higher expression levels in zzso repair zzso compared to zzso zzso Here we show that zzso of cells with UVA or zzso enhanced expression of the undamaged reporter gene to a higher level in zzso compared to zzso cells but there was little or no difference in zzso compared to zzso zzso These results suggest a substantial involvement of zzso but little or no involvement of zzso in the repair of zzso and zzso zzso DNA damage by zzso
