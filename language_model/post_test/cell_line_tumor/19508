zzso zzso is zzso in a variety of zzso and is closely correlated with zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso A zzso has been shown to induce zzso in many cancer cells at zzso zzso However, the mechanism remains zzso This study was to investigate the underlying mechanism of zzso A on zzso of zzso cells by characterizing the global gene expression profiles before and after zzso zzso 

zzso zzso flow zzso zzso and DNA zzso were used to observe the effect of zzso on zzso of zzso cells and normal human peripheral blood zzso cells zzso zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and Western zzso were used to detect the zzso expressed genes of zzso cells after incubation with zzso 

zzso could induce zzso in zzso cells in a dose and zzso zzso Besides, the dose of zzso within the time duration which could induce significant zzso in zzso cells did not demonstrate apparent zzso to zzso After incubation with zzso for 9 hours, 313 genes were detected zzso by zzso zzso zzso by these genes included signal zzso zzso zzso factors, zzso zzso which were involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The changes of the three genes were confirmed by zzso and the changes of zzso and zzso were further confirmed by Western zzso 

The zzso of cell growth and induction of zzso by zzso in zzso cells may be due to the changes of zzso genes and zzso zzso
