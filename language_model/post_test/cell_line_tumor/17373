Cellular stress responses induced during viral infections are critical to the health and survival of zzso In higher zzso zzso zzso mediate the innate zzso response in part through the action of zzso zzso a uniquely regulated zzso zzso L is activated by zzso zzso zzso zzso produced from zzso and double stranded zzso zzso We show that viral zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family of zzso zzso and viral induction of zzso are both deficient in mouse cells lacking zzso zzso Also, zzso zzso in response to zzso was greatly reduced in zzso zzso mouse zzso In addition, zzso treatment of the human zzso zzso cell line, zzso resulted in specific zzso zzso zzso products coinciding with zzso zzso Furthermore, suppression of zzso activity with the chemical zzso zzso prevented zzso induced by zzso In contrast, zzso of alternative zzso zzso zzso and zzso failed to prevent zzso zzso Short interfering zzso to zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso while also suppressing zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso cells were highly resistant to the zzso effects of zzso and zzso These findings suggest that zzso and zzso L function in an integrated signaling zzso during the zzso response that leads to elimination of zzso cells through zzso
