zzso a small zzso inhibitor of zzso was reported to induce zzso in human zzso lung cancer zzso zzso However, zzso zzso in zzso cells has rarely been zzso The aim of this study was to zzso the molecular mechanisms zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Here we reported that zzso zzso was accompanied with an increase in the conversion of zzso to zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso we also found that small interfering zzso against zzso induced zzso cell zzso while promotion of zzso by zzso growth factor zzso suppressed zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso suppressed zzso cell death, suggesting that zzso zzso caused cell zzso Further study showed that zzso and zzso were activated after zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso activities decreased zzso zzso and blocking of zzso by the specific inhibitor zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso zzso expression through induction of zzso zzso but zzso did not induce zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso of zzso induced zzso cell death, which was associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
