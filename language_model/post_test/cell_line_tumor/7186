Here we present zzso a novel method that allows accurate zzso of the zzso level of a specific zzso within a complex zzso This method relies on the well-established treatment of zzso DNA with sodium zzso which converts zzso into zzso without zzso zzso zzso The region of interest is then zzso and zzso of the zzso status of a specific zzso is performed by zzso real-time zzso with zzso Green I using one of the zzso whose 3' end discriminates between the zzso states of this zzso The presence of a locked zzso acid at the 3' end of the zzso primer provides the specificity necessary for accurate and sensitive zzso even when one of the zzso states is present at a level as low as zzso of the overall zzso We demonstrate that accurate zzso of the zzso status of specific zzso can be achieved in biological zzso The method is zzso zzso relatively simple and does not require any specific equipment other than a real-time zzso zzso
