We mapped 226 unique integration sites in human zzso cells following gene transfer with a zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso integrated across the entire length of the zzso zzso zzso data indicated that zzso integration favored actively transcribed zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso within zzso units occurred in genes regulated by the zzso zzso zzso DNA in regions of zzso zzso sites exhibited a zzso structure and a pattern of duplex zzso favoring strand zzso zzso integration preferences are more similar to those of zzso zzso and distinct from those of zzso zzso leukemia virus, avian zzso zzso virus, and zzso zzso
