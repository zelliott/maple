The zzso zzso zzso family of zzso regulates the initial steps of zzso zzso zzso might show novel patterns of zzso zzso on zzso zzso which could influence cancer biology, but its mechanisms are zzso We investigated the association of zzso and zzso expressions with zzso features and zzso of patients with zzso cell zzso zzso 

Expressions of zzso and zzso molecules were zzso zzso in 254 zzso zzso samples of patients with zzso 

Of 138 zzso cases, 46 revealed significant zzso with zzso zzso expression showed a close relationship to poor clinical performance and large zzso size, or zzso high zzso zzso and presence of vascular invasion and zzso The zzso potentially suppressed adhesive effects with a significantly low zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses showed the zzso group, but not the zzso group, to have significantly worse survival zzso 

zzso expression independently predicts high-grade zzso and poor prognosis in patients with zzso and may offer a therapeutic target against zzso
