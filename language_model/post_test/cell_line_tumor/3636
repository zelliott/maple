To describe the zzso and gene expression differences in zzso and zzso cultures zzso 

zzso oral zzso cells zzso primary head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso cell lines were used to create and study modeled zzso zzso Using zzso zzso analysis, zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell lines were zzso 

zzso zzso and both together can be modeled with zzso differentiation and zzso characteristics analogous to in zzso zzso Modeling of primary zzso resulted in a zzso of invasive zzso with areas of direct collagen invasion and zzso zzso Gene array analysis suggests that the individual cell lines themselves are the primary gene expression predictor and not the presence of zzso tissue zzso 

This tissue culture modeling system zzso the differentiation and zzso structure of in zzso zzso and that raft modeled zzso zzso does not have a significantly different gene expression profile than the corresponding zzso zzso
