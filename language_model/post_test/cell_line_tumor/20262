zzso real-time zzso of chemotherapy response at the cellular level provides us with direct evidence of what happens on the tumor zzso of zzso zzso We zzso the response of zzso tumor cells and host zzso cells to zzso on liver zzso zzso in living mice using zzso zzso laser scanning zzso zzso Red fluorescent zzso human zzso cancer cells zzso was zzso to the zzso of green fluorescent zzso nude zzso zzso or zzso was zzso administered after the formation of zzso liver zzso zzso zzso was performed at multiple zzso for zzso imaging of liver zzso zzso in the same zzso Under the 1st zzso zzso cells were zzso in zzso zzso at the single cell zzso Liver zzso zzso consisting of viable cancer cells and surrounding zzso with tumor vessels were zzso under the 2nd zzso After chemotherapy, tumor cell zzso zzso swelling and zzso zzso were observed under the 3rd zzso There was no obvious zzso difference in tumor response between these zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging on the zzso tumor zzso may be useful for screening and evaluating new zzso with less zzso zzso
