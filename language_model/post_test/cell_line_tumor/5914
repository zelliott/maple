A novel zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso analogue zzso zzso was zzso and evaluated for its zzso zzso Whereas zzso substantially lost its zzso potential in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso cell cultures, zzso markedly kept its zzso activity in zzso zzso cells, and thus is largely independent of zzso zzso activity to exert its zzso zzso zzso was found to inhibit zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso cell lines at drug zzso that correlated well with its zzso activity in these zzso zzso does not seem to be susceptible to zzso by zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These findings are in line with our observations that zzso but not zzso substantially loses its zzso potential in the presence of zzso zzso in the zzso cell zzso zzso we propose zzso as a novel zzso zzso zzso that zzso may circumvent potential resistance mechanisms of zzso cells zzso decreased zzso zzso and zzso is not zzso by zzso zzso such as zzso which is often zzso in zzso cells or expressed in zzso zzso zzso
