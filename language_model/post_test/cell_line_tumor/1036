To study the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso in cultured human zzso zzso cells zzso zzso by high concentration of zzso 

The effect of high concentration of zzso on the expression of zzso by zzso was detected by in zzso zzso and cell zzso The zzso migration induced by the zzso media of cultured zzso was zzso by a modified zzso Chamber zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso of zzso zzso on zzso migration was detected as zzso 

The zzso zzso was only zzso expressed in zzso cultured under the condition of low concentration of zzso Following a stimulation of high concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso from the 8th hour and reached the maximum at the 16th zzso zzso medium of cultured zzso zzso with high concentration of zzso had marked zzso for zzso which was inhibited by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso by high zzso may highly express zzso and produce zzso factors for zzso
