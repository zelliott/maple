The zzso complexes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were prepared and their zzso activity was examined in relation with their coordination zzso All these complexes were obtained as a mixture of zzso and zzso zzso due to rapid zzso of the initially formed zzso to the zzso more stable zzso The zzso mixture with the mole ratio of zzso exhibited excellent zzso activity while the pure zzso was only marginally zzso zzso in order to prevent the linkage zzso of the active zzso to the inactive zzso we have designed zzso zzso zzso acids as a leaving group and prepared a new series of complexes, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and characterized by means of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to coordinate to zzso zzso through only the zzso mode, and their zzso complexes were chemically stable in zzso zzso The present zzso complexes of zzso zzso zzso acids showed excellent zzso activity against both zzso leukemia zzso and human tumor zzso zzso the highly zzso zzso complex, zzso exhibited an outstanding in zzso activity zzso zzso on the human stomach cancer cells which are not responsive to zzso and zzso
