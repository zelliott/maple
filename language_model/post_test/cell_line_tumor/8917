The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of induction and knocking down of zzso factor zzso and/or zzso on tumor biology in zzso insensitive prostate cancer cell zzso 

The induction patterns of zzso and zzso after treatment with zzso were evaluated in zzso and zzso zzso Both cell lines were zzso with zzso targeted against zzso and/or zzso and the expression patterns of these 2 zzso zzso were zzso We next performed cell counting zzso zzso zzso and zzso invasion zzso Potential additive effects of zzso blockade to chemotherapy zzso or target agents zzso and zzso were zzso In addition, gene expression changes were determined in zzso zzso cells using Western zzso 

zzso affected the expression of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso expression was increased within the first 3 hours but then zzso zzso in which zzso and/or zzso had been knocked down using zzso showed decreased cell zzso Invasion abilities were increased by zzso treatment in both cell lines zzso zzso However, invasion zzso were decreased in response to treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso prominently zzso the zzso effects of target zzso The underlying mechanism could be associated with zzso zzso IGF-1, and zzso 

Our results demonstrate that zzso and zzso are important for cell proliferation and invasion ability in prostate zzso Together, our results indicate that combinations of target agents with zzso zzso may represent a promising strategy for the treatment of prostate zzso
