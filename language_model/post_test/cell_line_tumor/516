zzso is used to introduce a gene of interest into a zzso To interpret the downstream results, understanding which effects are the true biological responses to the gene and which, if any, are zzso effects can be zzso In order to discriminate true biological effects from zzso effects, we zzso a breast cancer cell line, zzso with a zzso zzso either a reporter gene or the identical zzso without the reporter gene zzso Both resulted in similar numbers of zzso expressed zzso suggesting that very few of the responses were directly due to the introduction of the reporter zzso We zzso that many zzso expressed transcripts are the result of the introduction of foreign DNA, as the biological processes associated with these genes are primarily associated with an immune response to a viral zzso Interestingly, different zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso difference in the number of zzso expressed zzso This suggests the importance of testing multiple zzso and selecting the best zzso zzso along with the appropriate zzso within the context of the experimental model system to ensure that the majority of the observed responses are biological effects of the gene of interest and not based on a particular zzso process zzso
