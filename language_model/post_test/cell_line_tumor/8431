zzso zzso causes serious infections in the urinary zzso respiratory zzso and zzso zzso zzso also known as membrane zzso have been linked to the zzso of bacterial zzso However, whether zzso zzso affect zzso zzso zzso into host cells remains zzso Here, we show for the first time that zzso zzso was zzso into lung cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso inhibited pathogen zzso zzso host zzso A deficient zzso of capsule zzso zzso showed a higher zzso rate than a zzso strain, indicating that zzso may inhibit bacterial entry to host zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso may affect the function of zzso regulated zzso zzso and knocking down zzso via short, interfering zzso increased zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso cells after zzso To gain insights into bacterial zzso we evaluated the impact of zzso zzso on DNA integrity, and showed that raft zzso also affect DNA damage and DNA repair responses zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso through the regulation of zzso oxygen zzso zzso cells zzso zzso demonstrated reduced zzso during bacterial zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso zzso may zzso bacterial zzso thereby affecting DNA damage and repair, which is critical to host defense against zzso zzso
