zzso zzso is a novel zzso inhibitor of zzso which acts by binding to zzso and preventing its membrane zzso and has promising zzso zzso zzso In this study, we reveal a novel function of zzso in regulation of cellular zzso protein zzso levels and zzso zzso independent of zzso zzso zzso effectively induced zzso in tested cancer cell lines including zzso of zzso and zzso It reduced the levels of zzso without increasing the expression of death zzso 4 zzso or zzso zzso it zzso with TRAIL to induce zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso did not zzso zzso zzso but inhibited its ability to enhance zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso of zzso mediates enhancement of zzso zzso by zzso but is not sufficient for zzso zzso zzso reduction of zzso could be blocked by the zzso inhibitor zzso Moreover, zzso increased zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso These data together suggest that zzso zzso zzso by zzso its zzso and zzso zzso Because other zzso zzso including zzso and zzso had minimal effects on reducing zzso and enhancement of zzso zzso it is likely that zzso reduces zzso and enhances zzso zzso independent of its zzso zzso
