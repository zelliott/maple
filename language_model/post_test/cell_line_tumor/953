Human zzso zzso cells metabolize and zzso NO via a zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso that yields zzso zzso catalyzing NO zzso zzso with zzso and are enriched in zzso zzso NO metabolism shows apparent zzso values for zzso zzso and zzso of zzso 9, and 2 zzso respectively, values similar to those determined for intact or zzso zzso Similar to cellular NO zzso zzso NO metabolism is zzso and sensitive to zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso garlic zzso Selective zzso of several zzso zzso and zzso zzso fail to inhibit the activity, indicating limited roles for a subset of zzso zzso zzso in NO zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibit NO zzso suggesting a role for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is demonstrated by the specific zzso of the NO zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso In zzso the results suggest roles for a zzso zzso and zzso NO zzso in NO zzso detoxification, and signal zzso in zzso zzso
