zzso of protein zzso C zzso decreases the activity and cell surface expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, zzso zzso were used as a model system to define the mechanisms that contribute to this decrease in cell surface expression and to determine the fate of zzso zzso As was previously observed, zzso zzso zzso zzso caused a decrease in zzso zzso This effect was blocked by zzso or by zzso with a zzso zzso of zzso 1, and it was attenuated by zzso with a zzso zzso of the zzso heavy zzso zzso of cholesterol with zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clone zzso or zzso with zzso zzso zzso had no effect on the zzso loss of zzso zzso zzso treatment with zzso caused a zzso loss of zzso zzso and decreased the levels of zzso zzso zzso of zzso degradation zzso or ammonium zzso or zzso with a zzso zzso of a small zzso implicated in trafficking to zzso zzso prevented the zzso decrease in protein and caused an zzso zzso of zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso of zzso is dependent upon zzso zzso These studies identify a novel mechanism by which the levels of zzso could be rapidly zzso via zzso zzso The possibility that this mechanism may contribute to the loss of zzso observed after acute insults to the zzso is zzso
