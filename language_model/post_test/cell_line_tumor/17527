Two panning strategies have been used to isolate zzso zzso clones that zzso an zzso zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso library was panned against a zzso zzso synthetic zzso zzso and zzso the zzso library was panned against native zzso isolated from whole cell zzso of zzso cells, followed by selection with the synthetic zzso zzso Four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated and used in a preliminary zzso study of zzso expression on frozen zzso zzso and zzso zzso The three zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed a similar zzso pattern, zzso all zzso and zzso A zzso but only zzso zzso B and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso similarly bound to zzso zzso but only zzso zzso A zzso and no zzso of a more advanced zzso No zzso with normal zzso zzso was observed but zzso with zzso zzso was zzso These new zzso zzso are likely to prove useful as screening tools in the detection of zzso zzso
