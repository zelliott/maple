The zzso zzso zzso zzso profoundly affects cell growth and zzso but its mechanism of action is poorly zzso zzso a protein isolated by its binding to zzso zzso cell growth and zzso zzso of zzso cell cycle zzso Since zzso shares 38% identity with a zzso zzso zzso zzso we zzso that zzso could bind zzso consensus elements in an zzso manner, leading to zzso zzso We show here that zzso bound to the DNA sequence bound by the zzso zzso zzso Whereas zzso alone failed to bind zzso promoter zzso zzso contained in nuclear zzso associated with zzso consensus sequences in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was recruited to the zzso promoter in zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso zzso bound zzso consensus zzso in association with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso regulated the association of zzso with zzso promoter sequences and enhanced the ability of zzso to repress zzso Our findings suggest that zzso by linking zzso zzso of membrane receptors to zzso gene activity, may be a downstream zzso of the effects of zzso on cell cycle zzso
