zzso zzso is a devastating disease with a poor zzso Recent data have shown that zzso growth zzso zzso zzso may play a role in zzso zzso Our aim was to evaluate the effect of a novel zzso zzso zzso on cell growth and zzso associated zzso 

zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso previously shown to activate the zzso zzso were grown in zzso The adherent cells, initially zzso at 5 zzso zzso zzso were treated for 72 hours, in zzso with varying concentration of zzso zzso 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 zzso zzso cells were counted every 24 zzso Additionally, separate cultures in zzso medium were treated with zzso then zzso with zzso and zzso collected for zzso zzso 

In both cell lines, 0, 1, 5, and 10 zzso showed an zzso or zzso effect, while 20 and 50 zzso were zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso of zzso was inhibited by zzso at higher zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso and zzso downstream zzso zzso zzso were also shown to be zzso by drug zzso 

zzso has a zzso zzso effect on zzso cells in zzso zzso acts by zzso of zzso zzso zzso effects zzso of downstream zzso in a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso decreases viability of zzso cell zzso Further evaluation of zzso and other selective zzso zzso may play an important role in zzso treatment of zzso zzso
