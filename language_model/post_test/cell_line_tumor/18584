To facilitate zzso of cellular zzso responses to various zzso agents, a zzso technology, zzso has been developed to provide analysis of cells without any need for labeling or cell zzso zzso is defined as the analysis of the motion of cells, where the motion is either induced or modified by a moving optical zzso field, which produces radiation pressure forces on the cells in an zzso zzso zzso of the induced motion provides a basis for distinguishing one population of cells from zzso One zzso technique, Fast zzso measures the distribution of distances traversed by a population of cells when exposed to a fast-moving optical zzso Fast zzso was validated using a zzso model of chronic zzso leukemia treated with zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso protein zzso The zzso zzso were zzso comparable to reference zzso with regard to drug selectivity and potency and to target zzso demonstrating the suitability of this technology for pharmaceutical and clinical zzso
