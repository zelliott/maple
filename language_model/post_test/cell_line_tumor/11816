We report and demonstrate biomedical applications of a new zzso zzso allows control of the density and composition of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on gold zzso zzso We first establish zzso zzso by zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso at increasing zzso ratios from zero to zzso This causes the zzso layer thickness to zzso increase up to 26 zzso The controlled, gradual increase in zzso density is revealed after zzso based on the ability to zzso the zzso and increase the zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso we zzso differential zzso binding to zzso revealing that it is highly efficient until zzso zzso is zzso Furthermore, the zzso potential zzso changes from zzso to zzso zzso and becomes constant upon zzso Using zzso zzso we prepare zzso with different ratios of zzso zzso zzso and zzso them with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, demonstrating that targeting zzso density is critical to maximizing the efficiency of targeting of zzso to cancer zzso We also zzso control the zzso density to develop zzso zzso zzso positively charged zzso at increasing ratios to zzso containing zzso charged zzso to reduce zzso by zzso zzso This ability to minimize zzso zzso by healthy cells could further improve targeted zzso zzso
