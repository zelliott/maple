The zzso tumor gene zzso is zzso or deleted in patients with zzso syndromes associated with the development of zzso tumors, but is infrequently zzso in sporadic zzso zzso By comparing the zzso profiles of zzso versus sporadic zzso tumors and zzso zzso zzso cells, we identified zzso protein 16 zzso a zzso zzso as a zzso expressed gene and a candidate zzso target zzso zzso induction in zzso zzso cells led to strong induction of zzso expression and its promoter activity was responsive to the zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso tumors, but not in normal human zzso fetal zzso suggesting that the ability of zzso to regulate zzso in tumors represented an zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso in two zzso tumor cell zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso on both synthetic and zzso zzso zzso short hairpin zzso zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso led to decreased growth of zzso tumor zzso These data suggest that zzso and zzso in certain cellular context including sporadic zzso tumors, may support cell zzso
