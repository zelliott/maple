zzso zzso growth zzso growth factor zzso a member of the zzso family, is zzso as a type I zzso precursor zzso zzso shedding of zzso yields an zzso soluble zzso of zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso consisting of the zzso and zzso zzso We previously showed that the zzso zzso from the plasma membrane to the nucleus and plays a role as a signaling zzso zzso showed that zzso can associate with zzso a zzso zzso in zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso efficiently with zinc fingers 4-6 of zzso A zzso reporter zzso showed that the nuclear zzso of zzso following shedding reversed zzso repression of zzso zzso by zzso Additionally, the level of zzso zzso protein increased and zzso interaction with the zzso zzso promoter decreased in parallel with the shedding of zzso at all zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso is a potent regulator of gene expression via its interaction with the zzso zzso zzso
