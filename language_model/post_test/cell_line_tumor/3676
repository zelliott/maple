The zzso 1 zzso zzso represents a unique zzso site that is distinct from any other zzso We examined zzso expression in human breast cancer and assessed the activity of zzso zzso in breast cancer cell zzso zzso nine breast specimens from normal breast, benign breast disease and cancer were examined with zzso or zzso and six different cell lines were also zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso of breast zzso compared to normal breast zzso zzso showed positive zzso cell zzso in zzso of invasive and zzso of in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and in zzso of normal zzso The pattern of expression was more diffuse in invasive breast zzso compared to other conditions zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was neither a zzso nor a zzso factor for efficacy of zzso chemotherapy but the study only included 58 cancer patients and therefore the statistical power is zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells all expressed zzso protein by Western zzso The zzso zzso zzso haloperidol, reduced zzso and zzso produced a zzso zzso of the growth at high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also showed additive zzso effects when combined with zzso zzso , zzso and zzso in zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated the least growth zzso activity and showed no interaction with zzso These results demonstrate that some normal and most zzso breast zzso cells and cell lines commonly express zzso High zzso of zzso inhibit the growth of these cells and zzso the effect of chemotherapy in zzso
