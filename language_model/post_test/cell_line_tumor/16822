To investigate the effects of zzso on zzso transition zzso in human lens zzso cells and its molecular zzso 

Experimental zzso The zzso expression zzso was designed and zzso zzso into zzso cells and the zzso expression zzso was zzso into the zzso The expression of zzso was detected by western zzso zzso The expression of zzso was detected by western zzso analysis and the location of zzso was detected by zzso zzso The expression of zzso protein as zzso zzso and zzso protein as zzso zzso was detected by Western zzso zzso The mobility of zzso cells was assessed by scratch zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso significance was determined by zzso zzso 

The zzso cells were obtained by zzso of zzso zzso expression zzso in zzso cells and the zzso cells were used as the zzso The zzso zzso expression zzso triggered zzso as a zzso zzso accumulated and zzso into the nucleus, which induced the decreasing expression of zzso proteins and increasing expression of zzso zzso and resulted in zzso in lens zzso zzso zzso healing zzso in zzso showed that the migration distance of zzso cells was zzso zzso zzso zzso at 24 hours after zzso significantly increased as compared to the control cells zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso After 48 hours of incubation in zzso migration zzso the number of migratory cells across zzso membrane in zzso cells was zzso zzso zzso which was much more than the control cells zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The mobility and migration of zzso cells was zzso 

zzso activates zzso signaling pathway, zzso zzso in lens zzso cells and then increases mobility and migration of lens zzso zzso
