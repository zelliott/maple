Greater than zzso of breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen exhibit de zzso or acquired tumor zzso Recent clinical evidence indicates that loss of expression of zzso is an independent marker for tamoxifen zzso In direct corroboration with clinical zzso suppression of zzso expression in the zzso zzso and zzso breast tumor cell lines resulted in resistance to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso expression was lost in three independent zzso models of acquired tamoxifen zzso The zzso zzso domain zzso is an independently signaling nuclear protein that functions as a potent zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso functions as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso interaction between zzso and zzso while promoting zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and tamoxifen zzso of zzso independent of zzso further supports a role for zzso during zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso but not zzso with a zzso zzso domain, restores tamoxifen sensitivity to zzso zzso cells in a zzso zzso zzso breast cancer patients with tumor expression of nuclear zzso responded to tamoxifen therapy with no clinical failures reported after 14 years of zzso whereas zzso of patients lacking nuclear zzso expression succumbed to their disease within 10 years of zzso Our identification of the zzso zzso protein as a critical zzso of tamoxifen action provides a clinically important role for zzso in human cancer and reveals a potential tumor marker to predict patient response to tamoxifen zzso
