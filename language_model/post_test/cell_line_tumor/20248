zzso comprise a large family of zzso zzso zzso receptors that mediate diverse processes involved in zzso and zzso interactions such as cellular zzso and migration, cell survival and zzso It is now well documented that zzso play a crucial role in cancer zzso and zzso The zzso zzso appear to have an important zzso role in zzso progression and zzso and, thus, have been often proposed as potential targets for cancer diagnosis and zzso In this study, we evaluated the in zzso and in zzso properties of zzso mouse melanoma cells with low expression of zzso zzso zzso rate, adhesive properties and the ability to migrate and zzso were zzso Over zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression was achieved as a result of the zzso with zzso No changes in the proliferation rate were observed in zzso zzso zzso however, they showed impaired ability to bind to zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso expression caused almost complete impairment of the ability of zzso cells to migrate through zzso and zzso The mean number of lung zzso colonies in mice zzso zzso with zzso expressing low levels of zzso zzso was decreased to 14 colonies compared to 101 in the control zzso These results provide evidence for a direct role of zzso zzso in the zzso migration and zzso processes of mouse melanoma cells and point to the potential therapeutic advantages of zzso
