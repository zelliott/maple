zzso zzso zzso contribute to several aspects of the zzso of zzso arthritis zzso and have been implicated most prominently in the progressive destruction of zzso zzso zzso the invasive zzso of zzso has therefore gained increasing attention, but the precise measurement of their invasive capacity and the evaluation of potential treatment effects constitute a challenge that needs to be zzso This study used a novel in zzso invasion zzso based on the breakdown of zzso electrical resistance to determine the course of zzso invasion into zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso resistance invasion zzso zzso was used to assess zzso from patients with zzso in comparison with zzso from patients with zzso zzso The zzso were grown on a commercially available collagen mix that was placed onto the upper side of a zzso zzso zzso In addition, freshly isolated cartilage extracts were studied to assess the conditions in zzso Under this zzso a zzso of zzso cells was seeded to create a high electrical zzso 

Invasion of zzso into the zzso affected the integrity of the zzso zzso and led to a measurable decrease and subsequent breakdown of electrical zzso Unlike in the zzso with zzso which did not achieve a breakdown of resistance up to 72 hours, zzso exhibited a pronounced zzso in this zzso with a 50% breakdown after 42 zzso Treatment of zzso with either a zzso zzso inhibitor or zzso against zzso zzso significantly reduced the zzso of zzso 

The zzso zzso is a valuable and sensitive zzso zzso system that can be used to determine precisely the invasive potential of zzso in zzso and thus would be suitable for screening zzso zzso
