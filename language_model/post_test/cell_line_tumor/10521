zzso plays a significant role in cancer by providing increased blood supply to the affected zzso and thus bringing in growth factors, zzso and various nutrients for tumor zzso zzso is the most prominent zzso agent that is markedly induced in zzso zzso of zzso has been widely studied but as cancer cells are quite adept at acquiring new alternative processes to circumvent surrounding environmental pressures, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating zzso expression in cancer, especially in zzso breast cancer cells, remains zzso Here, we present evidence of a novel mode of zzso induction in zzso zzso breast cancer cells that is regulated by serum zzso A zzso factor 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso short hairpin zzso profoundly reduces zzso expression along with reduction in zzso cell proliferation and zzso By both in zzso and in zzso molecular studies, we show that the effect of zzso is zzso through its direct interaction with the zzso zzso In zzso zzso activity of zzso is found to be significantly higher in zzso breast cancer zzso zzso of several breast cancer samples further revealed that zzso is zzso in clinical breast cancer zzso Taken together, these findings reveal that zzso is a zzso zzso participant in inducing zzso expression in zzso breast cancer cells, an aggressive form of breast cancer that currently lacks effective treatment zzso zzso of zzso activity in these cells can inhibit zzso zzso providing a possible new method to control zzso
