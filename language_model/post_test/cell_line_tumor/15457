zzso zzso has been reported to be therapeutic against zzso liver tumors in zzso However, little is known regarding the efficacy of combined zzso using zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we evaluated the zzso effect of the combination therapy of zzso and zzso zzso against liver tumors of zzso colon cancer zzso The liver weights of zzso mice treated with the combination were significantly lower than those of zzso mice and of mice treated with zzso or zzso zzso No toxic effects on the liver and zzso functions were observed in any of the treatment zzso zzso treatment induced significant zzso of liver zzso cells in zzso but zzso treatment did zzso zzso treatment resulted in a significant zzso of zzso zzso molecules zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso cells, but zzso did zzso The zzso activity of zzso liver zzso cells against zzso zzso cells was significantly higher than that against zzso zzso The increase of the zzso activity induced by zzso partially depended on zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells significantly inhibited the zzso efficacy of zzso against zzso liver tumors, which suggested that the zzso effect of zzso partially depended on the zzso activity of zzso zzso These results demonstrated that the combination therapy of zzso and zzso produced synergistic zzso effects against liver tumors by increasing the expression of zzso zzso molecules on cancer zzso This study suggests a promising new zzso against zzso liver zzso
