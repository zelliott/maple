To observe if zzso alpha gene can be induced by zzso in zzso alpha negative human breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso and the synergistic zzso effects of zzso and zzso on these two cell lines in zzso 

The status of zzso island zzso of zzso alpha gene in zzso alpha negative zzso and zzso human breast cancer cell lines and 20 cases of breast cancer tissue was studied by zzso the expression of zzso alpha zzso was inspected by using zzso after these two cell lines were treated with zzso Cell proliferation was evaluated by zzso zzso distribution of cell cycle and rate of zzso were determined by flow zzso after these two cell lines were treated with zzso or zzso alone, or in combination in zzso 

The zzso island is zzso in the core zzso of zzso alpha gene in zzso alpha negative zzso and zzso human breast cancer cell lines and the zzso rate is zzso zzso zzso zzso in 20 cases of breast cancer tissue of stage I, II, III, IV, zzso The expression of zzso alpha zzso was induced in these two cell lines after treated with zzso zzso array showed the proliferation activity of these two cell lines was obviously reduced in zzso group and the zzso effect on proliferation was enhanced when zzso combined with zzso compared with control group, the induction of zzso was zzso and zzso respectively by zzso while the rate of zzso is zzso and zzso when these two cells were treated with zzso combined with zzso 

zzso can zzso zzso alpha by zzso and sensitive zzso alpha negative human breast cancer cell lines to zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibit proliferation and induce zzso in zzso alpha negative human breast cancer cell lines, thus offer a new way for the treatment of zzso alpha negative breast zzso
