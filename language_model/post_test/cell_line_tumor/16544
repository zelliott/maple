The zzso complex zzso is an zzso zzso zzso which controls zzso and degradation of multiple cell cycle regulatory zzso During infection, human zzso zzso a widespread zzso not only zzso the zzso zzso zzso via the zzso viral zzso zzso it also promotes degradation of zzso zzso via an unknown zzso Using a zzso approach, we found that a recently identified zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso we determined that expression of zzso was necessary and sufficient for zzso degradation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso This resulted in zzso disruption and required zzso binding to the zzso We have identified the zzso zzso acid pair at zzso zzso in zzso to be critical for its ability to bind and regulate the zzso A point zzso virus in which zzso were zzso to zzso zzso grew at zzso zzso However, a double zzso virus in which the viral ability to regulate the zzso was zzso by both zzso point zzso and zzso deletion was markedly more attenuated compared to the zzso deletion virus zzso This suggests that these zzso are zzso zzso and that zzso exploits two viral factors to ensure successful disruption of the zzso to overcome its restriction on virus zzso This study reveals the zzso protein zzso as a novel zzso regulator and zzso a unique viral mechanism to zzso zzso zzso
