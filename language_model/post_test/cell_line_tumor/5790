The zzso zzso zzso has a zzso domain that consists of two zinc zzso zzso While zzso of the first module make most of the zzso zzso the second module functions as a zzso interface zzso This explains why the zzso response elements zzso are organized as two zzso motifs separated by three zzso zzso zzso can be located near the promoters of zzso zzso but are also at considerable distances either upstream or zzso so the initial steps in locating zzso can be zzso Traditionally, zzso sites were identified by DNA cellulose competition zzso zzso or by in zzso zzso zzso However, the advent of the zzso zzso zzso made it possible to identify zzso fragments to which the zzso binds either directly or indirectly zzso To enable identification of zzso in such zzso fragments, we developed an in zzso approach involving a weight zzso based on all known zzso zzso This will point out candidate zzso which will still need experimental validation involving a direct interaction zzso and a zzso zzso We describe here the methods most fit to describe an zzso the zzso mobility shift and the zzso zzso
