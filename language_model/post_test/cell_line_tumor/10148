zzso interactions are increasingly recognized to influence tumor zzso To understand the competitive dynamics of tumor cells in diverse zzso we zzso zzso a hybrid zzso mathematical model with zzso trait data from a set of related zzso cell lines with normal, transformed, or zzso zzso Surprisingly, in a resource-rich zzso with few limitations on proliferation or migration, transformed (but not zzso cells were most successful and zzso other cell types in zzso tumor zzso zzso constrained zzso with limitations on space and/or growth factors gave a selective advantage to zzso derived from zzso cell zzso Analysis of the relative performance of each zzso in constrained versus zzso zzso revealed that, although all cell types grew more slowly in zzso zzso the most aggressive cells were least affected by zzso zzso A game theory model testing the relationship between zzso resource availability and competitive cellular dynamics supports the concept that zzso independence is an advantageous cellular trait in zzso zzso
