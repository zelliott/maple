The purpose of this study was to identify the affect on the proliferation zzso cells treated with oxidized zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso 

zzso cell were cultured in the presence of zzso and cell proliferation tested by zzso and cell zzso was monitored by the proportion of zzso and cell cycle by flow zzso We simultaneously evaluated the level of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso and zzso 

zzso were zzso and activate zzso zzso combined with zzso significant enhanced the proportion rate of zzso on a time and dose zzso The expressions of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and protein were down zzso zzso the expressions of the promoting zzso zzso and zzso genes zzso and protein were up zzso 

These results suggested that zzso have zzso and activate zzso on the zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso have a synergistic effect on the zzso induced zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso may contribute to the improvement of clinical chemotherapy of cancer need to make further zzso
