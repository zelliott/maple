zzso has been shown to have a strong zzso effect on various cancer models via programmed cell death zzso However, the fundamental mechanisms of these effects are still zzso In the present study, we examined the question of whether or not zzso can inhibit proliferation of pancreatic zzso cells, via zzso We used three human pancreatic zzso cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso in our zzso In zzso pancreatic zzso cells, typical features of zzso were zzso zzso increased the expression of the zzso protein zzso and decreased the expression of the zzso protein zzso with a zzso increase in the levels of zzso and zzso zzso after treatment for zzso zzso inhibited zzso proliferation and vessel growth in zzso zzso In addition, the concentration of zzso in the zzso medium from human pancreatic zzso cells was zzso by zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso with zzso could decrease the zzso structure formation by zzso which was analyzed by a zzso zzso The abatement of zzso zzso was related to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso which may be regulated by zzso the zzso activity of nuclear zzso factor zzso
