The present investigation reports an extensive evaluation of in zzso and in zzso zzso efficacy of orally administered zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a breast cancer induced animal zzso zzso shaped zzso were prepared with an zzso efficiency and particle size of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, and zzso with zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso as investigated on zzso cell line, revealed insignificant differences between the zzso of free zzso and zzso treated cells in the first 24 zzso while higher zzso was demonstrated by zzso following 72 h of zzso zzso laser scanning zzso zzso imaging zzso that zzso were efficiently localized into the nuclear region of zzso zzso The cellular zzso profile of zzso revealed both time and concentration dependent increases in the zzso cell zzso as compared to the free zzso zzso Further, zzso significantly suppressed the growth of breast tumor in female zzso zzso rats upon oral zzso Finally, orally administered zzso showed a marked reduction in zzso when compared with zzso injected free zzso as also evident by the increased level of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and reduced levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The reduced zzso of orally administered zzso was also confirmed by the major zzso changes in the heart tissue after the treatments of zzso injected free zzso and orally delivered zzso
