Cellular response to zzso is zzso both by zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso response element zzso and by zzso actions like zzso of signal zzso zzso The main aims are to study if zzso signaling zzso can be activated by zzso zzso via zzso action and to investigate the relationship of the action of zzso and zzso in zzso cancer cells expressing with different status of zzso The levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and total zzso were examined by western zzso and zzso zzso activity was measured in cells after stimulation with 1 zzso zzso at different time zzso zzso role of zzso on zzso of zzso induced by zzso and its zzso zzso zzso were also zzso zzso was used as a measure of zzso of zzso We found that maximum zzso and zzso zzso activity took place at 30 zzso in zzso cells and 15 zzso in zzso cells and the zzso persisted for at least 2 h after stimulation with 1 zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso gradually with increasing doses of zzso zzso zzso zzso stopped the zzso zzso in a zzso manner and 50 zzso zzso completely blocked the zzso of zzso induced by zzso zzso could block the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells but not in zzso cells with zzso zzso This study demonstrated that zzso is able to promptly activate zzso signal zzso in zzso cells in an zzso manner and zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso cascade may become a potential and effective way to control zzso zzso especially in zzso zzso which show no response to zzso zzso
