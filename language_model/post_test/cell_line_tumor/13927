zzso zzso of the zzso protein synthesis apparatus has been documented in a wide range of solid tumors, including zzso zzso but zzso linkage has only been established in breast zzso In this report, we sought to determine if targeted disruption of zzso zzso translation abrogates zzso and enhances cell death in zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso cell lines were zzso zzso with either zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells with enhanced zzso repression showed pronounced cell death following treatment with zzso In addition, zzso zzso and zzso proteins suppressed growth in a cloning efficiency zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso also show decreased zzso in zzso zzso zzso tumors expressing zzso were significantly smaller than control zzso This work shows that zzso of the zzso machinery is necessary for maintenance of the zzso zzso in zzso identifies the molecular strategy used to activate translation, and supports the development of lung cancer therapies that directly target the zzso translation initiation zzso
