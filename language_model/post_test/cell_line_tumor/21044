Nerve damage, a characteristic of zzso is the cause of patient zzso and a consequence of zzso cells zzso infection by zzso zzso Although zzso of SC in human diseases like zzso is difficult to study, many in zzso models, including SC lines derived from rat and/or human zzso have been zzso zzso is one of the cell lineages used by many researchers as a model for zzso zzso zzso However, it is necessary to establish the values and limitations of the generated data on the effects of zzso zzso in these zzso After evaluating the cell line zzso in the present study, it is close to zzso zzso making this lineage an ideal model for zzso zzso zzso It was also observed that both zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso induced low levels of zzso in zzso by a mechanism independent of zzso family zzso
