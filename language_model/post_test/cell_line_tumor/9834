Lung zzso with zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso show good clinical response to zzso and zzso selective zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso but these tumors invariably develop drug zzso Host zzso cells have been found to have a considerable effect on the behavior of cancer zzso Little is known, however, about the role of host cells on the sensitivity of cancer cells to zzso zzso We have therefore assessed the effect of zzso between zzso cells and lung cancer cells harboring zzso zzso on zzso to zzso 

We evaluated the zzso sensitivity of lung cancer cells with zzso zzso zzso and zzso when zzso with zzso and zzso into severe combined zzso zzso We also examined the effect of lung cancer cells to zzso zzso 

Both human zzso cell lines and primary cultured zzso produced various levels of zzso growth factor zzso Lung cancer cells markedly recruited zzso The lung cancer cells became resistant to zzso when zzso in zzso with zzso zzso and zzso into severe combined zzso zzso zzso combined use of zzso plus zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso successfully overcame the zzso zzso resistance both in zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was detected in both zzso tumors in mouse model and lung cancer patient zzso 

These findings indicate that zzso to zzso zzso plays a critical role in lung cancer resistance to zzso and may be an ideal therapeutic target in lung cancer with zzso zzso
