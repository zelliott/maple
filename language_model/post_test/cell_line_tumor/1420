The key zzso features of Alzheimer's disease are abnormal deposition of zzso plaques and zzso zzso peptides in zzso brain and zzso zzso zzso induced by abnormal zzso zzso zzso is one of the factors that bridge these zzso and zzso zzso pathological zzso zzso acid zzso a naturally occurring zzso fatty acid, was discovered as a zzso inhibitor by screening a chemical library using a zzso specific zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso and reversed zzso zzso cell zzso In addition, zzso scavenged zzso and reversed the levels of zzso proteins induced by zzso in zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso activity with better potency than the known zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso These results suggest that zzso is a novel zzso zzso inhibitor with good cell zzso and potent zzso zzso
