zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into carbon zzso zzso and free iron which mediate its protective effect against zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to determine the expression level and activity of zzso in Korean colon cancer zzso and cell zzso zzso protein expression was higher zzso in tumor zzso than in adjacent normal zzso in 14 of 20 colon cancer patients, and zzso protein expression was closely correlated with zzso zzso activity in cancer zzso zzso data confirmed that zzso protein was expressed at a higher level in colon cancer zzso than in normal zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and protein expression and zzso activity were higher in the colon cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso than in the normal fetal human colon cell line zzso Treatment with the zzso inhibitor zinc zzso decreased the viability of colon cancer cell zzso These data indicate that zzso may serve as a clinically useful zzso of colon cancer and as a target for zzso cancer zzso
