To correlate dynamic zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with microscopic zzso zzso of vascular zzso growth factor zzso in zzso 

This study compared tumor zzso from two different human cancer cell lines, zzso tumors zzso and zzso zzso reported to express respectively higher and lower levels of zzso Dynamic zzso was enhanced by a zzso zzso contrast medium zzso zzso zzso estimates of tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso obtained using a zzso kinetic model, were correlated with zzso zzso of zzso in each zzso 

Mean zzso was zzso times greater in zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso than in zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso ( zzso zzso the zzso of zzso in zzso tumors was zzso times greater zzso zzso zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Considering all tumors without regard to cell type, a significant positive correlation zzso zzso was observed between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso to a zzso and zzso zzso of tumors support the hypothesis that zzso is a major contributor to increased zzso zzso in zzso When applied zzso the zzso zzso approach could help to zzso the appropriate application of zzso therapy on an individual patient zzso
