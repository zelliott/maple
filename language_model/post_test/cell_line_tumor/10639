zzso zzso zzso is the most frequent form of zzso zzso zzso zzso which can deteriorate from patch stage to zzso tumors and systemic involvement in zzso The interaction of zzso in the skin with zzso cells might have implications for the zzso of the zzso In this study, we show by zzso analysis and zzso zzso that the zzso zzso is present in skin biopsy specimens of patients with zzso and its precursor form zzso en plaque but not in healthy zzso In addition, the serum levels of zzso were increased zzso in zzso patients compared with those in healthy zzso In skin, zzso was specifically expressed by zzso zzso zzso at the invasive margin of the tumor and not expressed by mature zzso zzso cells in the center of the zzso The zzso zzso was, by contrast, zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso promoted the zzso but not the proliferation of zzso zzso zzso inhibited proliferation of tumor cells and abolished the zzso growth of a zzso cell zzso These data link the increased expression of zzso with zzso and suggest an zzso effect of the zzso in the zzso of zzso
