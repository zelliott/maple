Three different series of zzso zzso derivatives containing zzso a zzso zzso ring zzso zzso a zzso ring with no zzso zzso or zzso a six zzso zzso ring zzso as ring A were zzso using a convenient zzso zzso zzso Further variation on ring E was done by decorating it with zzso and zzso groups at different zzso zzso of zzso values of these compounds indicates them to be better soluble than corresponding zzso zzso These novel zzso derivatives were screened for their zzso and zzso activities on National Cancer Institute's 60 human tumor cell lines to study the structure activity zzso The overall zzso activity of these compounds was in the order of zzso Furthermore, the compounds having zzso and zzso substitution at ring E were the most active within the zzso The zzso of all the active compounds was low, while their zzso (or zzso activity was high, providing a wide therapeutic window for their potential application as zzso zzso
