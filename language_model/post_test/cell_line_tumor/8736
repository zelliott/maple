A number of recent reports have demonstrated that attenuated zzso zzso are capable of targeting both primary and zzso zzso The use of bacteria as a vehicle for the delivery of zzso drugs requires a mechanism that precisely regulates and zzso gene expression to ensure the appropriate timing and location of drug zzso To integrate these functions into bacteria, we used a zzso zzso zzso system, in which the expression of a therapeutic gene and an imaging reporter gene were controlled by divergent promoters zzso and zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was transformed with the expression plasmids zzso zzso A, a therapeutic zzso and zzso zzso zzso 8, an imaging reporter zzso and administered zzso to zzso zzso The engineered zzso successfully localized to tumor tissue and gene expression was dependent on the concentration of zzso indicating the feasibility of peripheral control of bacterial gene zzso The zzso signal permitted the zzso of gene expression from the zzso The engineered bacteria significantly suppressed both primary and zzso tumors and prolonged survival in zzso zzso engineered bacteria that carry a therapeutic and an imaging reporter gene for targeted zzso therapy can be designed as a zzso zzso
