The aim of the study was to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso functions in rat zzso zzso zzso and rat skeletal zzso For that purpose zzso fiber technique and multiple zzso inhibitor zzso were adapted to tumor zzso In our animal tumor model zzso functional abnormalities of zzso were found compared to skeletal zzso In zzso the state 3 zzso of zzso + zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso whereas the state 3 zzso of zzso + zzso was zzso 36 zzso zzso versus 19 zzso zzso P zzso zzso In zzso the zzso zzso reached higher levels than the zzso zzso zzso whereas in normal muscles the converse was zzso Additionally, the obvious difference between the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso indicates an increased part of leak zzso in zzso By now, the high feasibility of these techniques is appreciated for the investigation of muscles and zzso for tumors, zzso
