zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an aggressive zzso of zzso cancer characterized by an innate resistance to chemotherapy and poor zzso In this study, we evaluated the expression of zzso in primary zzso cell lines and the in zzso ability of zzso zzso zzso a fully human zzso zzso against zzso to inhibit zzso cell zzso and zzso 

The surface expression of zzso belonging to the zzso including zzso zzso and zzso was evaluated in 6 primary zzso cell lines using flow zzso zzso To test the ability of zzso to inhibit zzso cell zzso and migration, zzso zzso in the presence of zzso and migration zzso through an zzso pore zzso membrane also were zzso 

We found high expression of the zzso on the cell surface of all 6 primary zzso cell lines tested zzso positive zzso mean zzso intensity range, zzso When the expression of single zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed on zzso zzso and zzso of cells zzso zzso intensity range, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in functional zzso low doses of zzso were effective in zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and migration zzso zzso P zzso zzso of primary zzso cell zzso 

The zzso are zzso on the cell surface of primary zzso cell zzso zzso may significantly inhibit zzso cell zzso and migration pathways and may therefore represent a novel treatment option for patients harboring this rare but highly aggressive zzso of zzso zzso
