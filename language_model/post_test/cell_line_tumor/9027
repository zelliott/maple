zzso zzso arises from the embryonic neural crest and is the most common zzso solid tumor in children under 5 years of zzso zzso expression of zzso has recently been shown to be in correlation with poor prognosis in zzso zzso This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms that could lead to the zzso of zzso in zzso We used zzso prediction to identify potential zzso zzso zzso in zzso One of the zzso that were predicted to target zzso was zzso We measured the levels of zzso in 43 primary tumors using real time zzso Following the zzso of zzso the levels of zzso cell zzso cell proliferation and migration capability were zzso zzso analysis identified zzso as an independent zzso marker for zzso in zzso patients zzso We were able to show through a dual zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis that zzso directly binds the 3' zzso of zzso on positions zzso and zzso An increase in cell zzso proliferation and migration rates were evident in zzso cells zzso with zzso Yet, there was a significant decrease in proliferation when zzso cells were zzso with an zzso We suggest that zzso might be a key player in zzso by regulating zzso zzso
