zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso toxicity and the way in which this zzso interacts with living organisms is a critical point since zzso represents a well-known risk to zzso and human zzso We used a quantitative zzso approach based on stable zzso labeling by zzso acids in cell culture in combination with zzso and zzso zzso for analyzing the differential protein expression of zzso cells associated to zzso zzso zzso proteins were found zzso by more than zzso We identified a number of proteins involved in different essential biological processes including zzso zzso dysfunction, cellular trafficking and energy zzso Among these zzso we found several molecules whose zzso has been already related to zzso exposure, thus confirming the usefulness of our discovery approach, and new ones that helped to gain a deeper insight into the zzso mechanisms related to zzso zzso zzso of several zzso and the zzso zzso zzso itself showed the zzso system as a molecular target of toxic zzso As for the interaction networks, the top ranked was the zzso acid zzso where many of the identified zzso proteins are zzso
