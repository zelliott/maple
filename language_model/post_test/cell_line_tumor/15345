zzso resistance zzso poses a serious impediment to the success of chemotherapy for zzso zzso To identify zzso and zzso associated with zzso of human zzso cancer zzso cells, we developed a zzso human zzso cancer zzso designated zzso by exposing zzso cells to zzso increasing zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed to compare the zzso and zzso expression profiles of zzso and zzso zzso Compared to zzso cells, zzso cells were more resistant to chemotherapy drugs zzso zzso more resistant to zzso zzso more resistant to zzso and zzso more resistant to zzso and had a longer doubling time zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso higher percentage of cells in zzso phase zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso of zzso 123 zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A total of 7 zzso and zzso zzso were zzso expressed between the two cell zzso Of the zzso expressed zzso identified, regulator of zzso signaling 10, zzso requirement protein zzso and nuclear protein 1 were found to be the putative targets of the zzso expressed zzso zzso These findings may open a new avenue for clarifying the mechanisms responsible for zzso in zzso zzso
