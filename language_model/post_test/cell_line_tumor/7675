The authors hypothesized that circulating tumor cells zzso in patients with gastric cancer are associated with prognosis and disease zzso In this study, they evaluated zzso in gastric cancer and clarified the clinical impact of zzso 

In total, 265 consecutive patients with gastric cancer were zzso Fourteen patients were excluded from the analysis, including 12 patients who another cancer and 2 patients who refused the zzso The remaining 251 patients were divided into 2 groups: 148 patients who underwent zzso (the zzso zzso and 103 patients who did not undergo zzso (the zzso zzso zzso blood samples were collected before zzso or zzso A proprietary test for zzso zzso and counting zzso in blood was used for the isolation and zzso of zzso 

zzso were detected in 16 patients zzso from the zzso group and in 62 patients zzso from the zzso zzso The overall survival rate for the entire cohort was significantly lower in patients with zzso than in those without zzso zzso zzso In the zzso group, zzso and overall survival in patients with zzso was significantly lower than in patients without zzso zzso zzso It was noteworthy that the expression of zzso was an independent factor for determining the overall survival of patients with gastric cancer in zzso analysis zzso In the zzso group, the overall survival rate was significantly lower in patients with zzso than in those without zzso zzso 

The evaluation of zzso in peripheral blood may be a useful tool for predicting tumor zzso zzso and the effect of chemotherapy in patients with gastric zzso
