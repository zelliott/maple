To investigate the potential role of small zzso zzso protein A zzso in zzso zzso and Western zzso were performed to detect the expression of zzso in clinical zzso zzso zzso samples, adjacent zzso liver zzso and zzso cell zzso In addition, expression of zzso was correlated with zzso variables and zzso and zzso survival analyses were performed to determine the zzso zzso Moreover, the biological significance of the zzso expression of zzso was investigated in zzso Both zzso evaluation and Western zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso was zzso in zzso zzso compared with adjacent zzso liver zzso zzso of zzso directly correlated with the zzso grades of zzso and high expression of zzso was associated with a poor zzso zzso depletion by zzso inhibited cell zzso blocked zzso and zzso entry in zzso zzso Western zzso analyses showed that zzso depletion decreased zzso A and zzso B zzso Taken together, zzso to zzso of zzso in zzso and its important role in predicting poor prognosis and the development of zzso zzso could be a potential zzso marker and therapeutic target of zzso
