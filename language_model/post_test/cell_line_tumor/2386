The zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso creates a zzso surface zzso We developed a strategy exploiting zzso bonding for lead discovery to stabilize the zzso with small zzso We designed zzso zzso libraries zzso as starting points to complement classical zzso From screening of zzso and subsequent zzso design, we developed zzso zzso as zzso zzso Crystal structures of their complexes highlight two key features: zzso a central scaffold with a robust binding mode anchored by zzso bonding of an zzso with a zzso zzso and zzso an zzso zzso enabling the targeting of an additional zzso in the zzso The best zzso showed induction of zzso in a human cancer cell line with zzso zzso zzso Our structural and zzso data suggest a more widespread zzso of zzso in drug zzso
