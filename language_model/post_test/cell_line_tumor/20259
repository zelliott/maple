The aim of this study was to investigate the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso on zzso human breast cancer cells zzso with 89 zzso zzso zzso The 50% zzso concentration zzso was calculated from results of an zzso zzso The concentration of zzso less than zzso zzso was selected for subsequent zzso zzso were treated with zzso and zzso zzso changes of cells were observed under an zzso zzso The zzso enhancing ratio zzso was zzso based on a clone formation zzso Cell cycle distribution and zzso were measured by flow zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso at both the zzso and protein levels was assessed by zzso and western zzso The zzso of zzso at 24 h was zzso zzso zzso of zzso (1 and 2 zzso were used in combination treatments and zzso values were zzso and zzso zzso zzso significantly suppressed cell growth, caused zzso arrest, enhanced cell death and zzso induced by zzso and decreased expression of the zzso zzso Since expression of zzso was unchanged following treatment, zzso effectively reduced the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhances the zzso effects of zzso on the zzso human breast cancer cell line by inducing zzso phase delay and promoting zzso through the reduction of the zzso zzso
