Models for human prostate cancer can facilitate the study of resistance to zzso therapy, aid drug discovery, and zzso zzso 

zzso thought relevant to the growth in zzso nude mice of zzso an zzso zzso zzso cell line derived from a primary prostate zzso and its two zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been assessed zzso 

The zzso of the parental zzso line are moderately differentiated with both zzso and zzso regions, zzso zzso and abundant zzso figures and are extremely zzso The cells express zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso possessed a more zzso zzso and displayed significantly lower growth rates, reduced blood vessel density zzso decreased zzso zzso and zzso expression and increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso expression was demonstrated in the zzso line zzso zzso of mice bearing zzso zzso rapidly induced the appearance of zzso zzso in the cells, zzso levels decreased initially but recovered to below zzso levels whilst reduced zzso and loss of zzso expression was seen in the long-term zzso 

zzso and its zzso offer additional in zzso models to study the factors involved in the progression of zzso cancer to zzso
