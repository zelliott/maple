Gene therapy for a wide variety of disorders would be greatly enhanced by the development of zzso that could be targeted for gene delivery to specific populations of zzso We describe here zzso targeted zzso based on a novel targeting strategy that exploits the ability of zzso to incorporate host cell proteins into the surface of the viral particle as they bud through the plasma zzso zzso zzso particles produced in cells engineered to express the zzso form of stem cell factor zzso zzso both human cell lines and primary cells with high efficiency in a strictly zzso zzso zzso zzso The availability of efficient targeted zzso provides a platform for the development of a new generation of therapies using in zzso gene zzso
