A vast amount of zzso derived from zzso association studies are represented by zzso ones, therefore zzso the need for effective identification of regulatory zzso zzso among zzso However, this task remains challenging since the regulatory part of the human zzso is zzso much poorly as opposed to coding zzso Here we describe an approach zzso the whole set of zzso zzso data in order to search for zzso and provide the experimental evidence of its zzso Its zzso is based on the assumption that the enrichment of a zzso region with zzso factor binding zzso zzso zzso indicates its regulatory function, and thereby zzso located in this region are more likely to influence zzso zzso To ensure that the approach preferably selects functionally meaningful zzso we performed enrichment analysis of several human zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso It was shown that all samples are significantly enriched with zzso falling into the regions of multiple zzso zzso as compared with the randomly selected zzso For experimental zzso 40 zzso falling into overlapping regions of at least 7 zzso binding zzso were selected from zzso The effect of zzso on the binding of the DNA fragments containing them to the nuclear proteins from four human cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso has been tested by zzso A radical change in the binding pattern has been observed for 29 zzso zzso 6 more zzso also demonstrated less pronounced zzso Taken together, the results demonstrate the effective way to search for potential zzso with the aid of zzso data provided by zzso zzso
