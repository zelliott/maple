This study tested the hypothesis that controlled flow through zzso can cause zzso zzso loading of cells with zzso The overall goal was to design a simple device to expose cells to fluid zzso stress and thereby increase plasma membrane zzso zzso prostate cancer cells were exposed to fluid zzso stress in the presence of fluorescent zzso molecules by using a zzso zzso device or high-velocity flow through zzso Using a syringe zzso cell suspensions were flowed through zzso of zzso zzso diameter drilled through Mylar sheets using an zzso zzso As zzso by flow zzso zzso zzso and loss of viability correlated with the average zzso zzso zzso results were observed when exposing the cells to high zzso stress for short zzso in zzso channels, which yielded zzso to over one-third of cells while maintaining viability at approximately zzso This method was capable of loading cells with molecules including zzso zzso zzso large zzso weight zzso zzso zzso and bovine serum zzso zzso zzso These results supported the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso could be generated by flow of cell suspensions through zzso and further led to the design of a simple, zzso and effective device to deliver molecules into zzso Such a device could benefit biological research and the biotechnology zzso
