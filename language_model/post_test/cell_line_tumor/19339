The zzso zzso is a suspected zzso factor in the development of Parkinson's disease zzso zzso was therefore used to reproduce zzso syndromes in lab animals, in which it produces zzso zzso However, the factors or mechanisms by which zzso kills zzso zzso are not fully zzso Based on reported evidence that zzso increases zzso protein levels and zzso zzso function, it was hypothesized that zzso zzso cell death in zzso zzso through a mechanism in which zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso To explore this possibility, zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso for 48 h and zzso responses were investigated, as well as zzso of the zzso intrinsic zzso of zzso zzso significantly increased protein levels of zzso and one of its target zzso zzso By 24 zzso zzso decreased zzso complex I activity and zzso zzso potential and induced the release of zzso c from zzso In addition, zzso increased the activities of zzso 9 and zzso Finally, nuclear zzso and DNA fragmentation occurred 48 h after zzso The decrease of zzso functions, the release of zzso zzso the increase of zzso 9 and 3 activities, and DNA damage that were produced by zzso were inhibited by a specific zzso zzso zzso These findings support the conclusion that zzso produced zzso in zzso cells through the zzso intrinsic zzso associated with zzso
