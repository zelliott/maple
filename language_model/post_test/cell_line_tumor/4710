The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in a large proportion of breast zzso and in some systems interferes with zzso zzso signaling through zzso zzso zzso We therefore sought to examine whether zzso is a zzso of breast cancer zzso using zzso human zzso zzso cells, and zzso and zzso breast zzso zzso zzso or stable zzso of zzso reduced zzso zzso and DNA fragmentation while enhancing viability in the face of treatment with zzso agents zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This zzso was associated with suppression of zzso zzso and zzso blockade alone induced similar zzso In contrast, reduction of zzso levels using a small interfering zzso or its targeted zzso enhanced sensitivity to these drugs, and this was associated with increased zzso zzso zzso reduction of zzso by zzso with a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso by zzso enhanced active zzso levels, and increased zzso zzso zzso Combination treatment with zzso and zzso had similar effects, and the enhanced efficacy of this regimen was abolished by forced zzso of zzso These results suggest that the clinical efficacy of combinations of zzso agents and zzso are due to the ability of the latter to target zzso Moreover, they support the hypothesis that zzso is a significant zzso of breast cancer zzso and provide a rationale for development and translation of other agents targeting zzso into the clinical arena to overcome resistance and induce zzso
