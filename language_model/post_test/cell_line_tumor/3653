zzso acid zzso overcomes the maturation block in zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso leading to zzso zzso Patients receiving zzso alone invariably develop zzso zzso zzso cells can serve as useful models for the development of treatments for both zzso and other zzso Previously, we showed that zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso promote zzso differentiation of the zzso cell line zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here, we report that combining zzso with zzso leads to maturation of several zzso zzso cells along a zzso pathway, whereas zzso a zzso zzso cell line, showed characteristics of zzso zzso We found distinct differences in gene regulation between zzso cells and cells showing zzso zzso Although zzso was zzso by zzso and zzso in all cells tested, expression of zzso and zzso correlated with zzso zzso Furthermore, synergistic induction of zzso DNA binding and zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso was observed only in cells zzso into zzso Using zzso zzso against zzso or its zzso we found that zzso this zzso strongly reduced zzso expression in response to zzso and zzso suggesting that this zzso is essential for their zzso in zzso leukemia zzso
