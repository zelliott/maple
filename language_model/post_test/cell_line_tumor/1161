It is well known that small cell neuroendocrine zzso zzso arising at zzso sites has a poor prognosis and an interesting biological zzso To understand biological characterization and zzso of the origin of the zzso of zzso we report the establishment of a new zzso cell line and characteristics of neuroendocrine properties including zzso differentiation by treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We established a new cell line zzso derived from zzso of the zzso zzso by a modified zzso method, and verified neuroendocrine properties including zzso differentiation by zzso and zzso zzso 

The established cell line showed zzso or zzso shape in zzso culture and was positive for zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was also demonstrated in the cultured medium and zzso neuroendocrine zzso were detected zzso in the zzso Treatment of cells with zzso markedly induced the development and zzso of zzso zzso which formed a zzso zzso zzso of these zzso zzso processes revealed them zzso intensely with high zzso zzso and a zzso increase of zzso zzso in cell zzso 

These findings indicated that this cell line possesses the capability to differentiate into zzso cells, and supported the hypothesis that zzso zzso might be derived from a zzso stem zzso
