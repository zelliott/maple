zzso zzso high toxicity and drug resistance associated with existing zzso agents mandate a need for novel therapeutic strategies for highly aggressive zzso Cancer zzso zzso zzso exhibits potent zzso effects against various cancer cells and has emerged as an attractive candidate for use in complementary or preventive cancer zzso However, the knowledge regarding the therapeutic potential of zzso in PC is still limited and needs to be zzso We studied the effect of zzso on PC cell growth, zzso and invasion and zzso the molecular mechanisms associated with its zzso zzso Treatment of zzso and zzso PC cells with zzso resulted in zzso and zzso growth zzso and decreased colony zzso Further, zzso treatment induced zzso and cell cycle arrest as assessed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Increased zzso following zzso treatment was accompanied with Bad zzso and its zzso to the zzso increased zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, zzso treatment decreased zzso and invasion of PC cells by zzso zzso organization, zzso zzso of zzso and zzso signaling and decreased zzso zzso More importantly, zzso treatment decreased zzso zzso expression in zzso and zzso cells through zzso regulation by zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, our results support the utility of zzso as a potential therapeutic agent for lethal zzso
