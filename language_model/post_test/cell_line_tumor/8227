zzso and differentiation of zzso zzso is a tightly regulated process, whose zzso are implicated in human zzso zzso The zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso may play an important role in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso is a poorly zzso component in this zzso 

Using complementary in zzso and in zzso human and zzso models, expression zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso and regulation of zzso were investigated in the normal zzso and zzso zzso In zzso analysis of the human zzso promoter was performed together with reporter and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso expression was detected in the zzso with specific protein zzso in the zzso region of the zzso and in the surface zzso of the zzso In human zzso and zzso cells, zzso zzso levels increased with spontaneous and induced zzso together with zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso zzso infection with human zzso induced zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso was observed in differentiated zzso after zzso infection with short hairpin zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso mice and in zzso zzso of zzso and patients with familial zzso zzso zzso The human zzso promoter region presents several zzso sites where zzso zzso in zzso zzso reporters were functionally activated via zzso and blocked via a zzso zzso zzso 

Combining zzso and zzso approaches, an intriguing scenario is presented zzso zzso is significantly expressed in the zzso zzso compartment and is directly controlled by zzso in normal zzso and zzso
