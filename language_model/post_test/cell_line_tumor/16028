Our previous genetic and zzso studies demonstrated that zzso 1 is significantly associated with nicotine dependence zzso in human smokers and its expression is highly modulated by nicotine in the brains of zzso To provide further molecular evidence for the involvement of zzso 1 in the zzso of zzso we investigated the regulatory effect of nicotine on the expression of zzso 1 using both in zzso and in zzso zzso With quantitative real-time zzso we found that zzso 1 zzso was significantly zzso by zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, of zzso rats ( zzso for all three zzso Further, zzso 1 protein was zzso by nicotine in the zzso zzso area zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We also determined the effect of nicotine on human zzso cells and found that zzso 1 zzso was significantly zzso by nicotine after treatment zzso zzso and a consistent decrease in the amount of the protein was also observed zzso zzso Taken together, our findings provide further molecular evidence for the involvement of zzso 1 in the zzso of zzso
