It has been well documented that zzso consisting of zzso affects breast cancer zzso However, the mechanisms by which cancer cells and zzso the major cell type in zzso interact with each other during tumor development remains to be zzso Here, we show that the human zzso zzso zzso had higher activity in enhancing breast zzso compared to the normal zzso zzso zzso isolated from the same zzso The expression level of zzso growth factor zzso in these zzso was positively correlated with their ability to enhance breast zzso in zzso zzso of zzso using a zzso zzso reduced zzso colony formation of human breast cancer cells, indicating that zzso enhanced cancer cell colony formation mainly through zzso zzso zzso with human breast cancer zzso cells in a zzso system enhanced zzso to secret zzso as well as promote zzso The newly gained ability of these zzso zzso became irreversible after continuing this process till fourth zzso These results suggested that breast cancer cells could alter the nature of its surrounding zzso to zzso zzso to support its own progression through zzso zzso
