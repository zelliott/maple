zzso zzso are reported to be crucial for virus zzso but are not yet addressed in Human zzso 71 zzso Here we describe the specific association of heat shock zzso zzso but not alpha form zzso with zzso viral particles by the zzso with zzso using zzso density zzso zzso and by the zzso with viral zzso as assessed by zzso electron zzso The reduction of the zzso protein using zzso interference decreased the correct assembly of viral zzso without affecting zzso replication zzso Tracking zzso expressed zzso protein associated with zzso zzso revealed that zzso protein was transmitted to new host cells through its direct association with infectious viral zzso Our findings suggest a new zzso strategy in which zzso zzso protein is targeted to decrease the zzso of zzso and other zzso without affecting the broader functions of this zzso expressed molecular zzso
