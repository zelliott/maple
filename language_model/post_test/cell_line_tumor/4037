We construct a novel zzso surface enhanced zzso scattering zzso zzso and magnetic zzso for live cell zzso To zzso this zzso single walled carbon zzso zzso is used as the building scaffold while gold zzso zzso zzso zzso iron oxide zzso zzso and quantum dots zzso are employed as the building zzso Here, zzso zzso serve as the zzso zzso and zzso act as the fluorescent zzso zzso zzso and zzso are first zzso on the zzso via zzso zzso Then a zzso layer is coated on the zzso Finally, zzso are attached on the zzso zzso With such a structure, various optical signals can be readily zzso to the zzso simply by using different zzso molecules and zzso with different zzso zzso Experimental results show that the zzso zzso exhibits well zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, in zzso experiments demonstrate that the zzso can fulfill magnetic field guided zzso and zzso dual mode imaging of live zzso As a fascinating optical zzso material and a zzso zzso the presented zzso holds genuine potential in future zzso zzso
