zzso derivatives are a class of new promising zzso zzso A representative member of this family is the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso which has been demonstrated to induce cellular zzso zzso and cell death through the zzso zzso This work aims at characterizing drug response of human cancer cell lines to zzso After a first screening revealing that zzso interferes with cancer cell survival, we focused our attention on zzso colon zzso cells, which are zzso resistant to a panel of zzso zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso we found that this process was zzso given that the final steps of this process, zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso were not zzso Thus, we addressed zzso zzso of cell death and we observed that zzso promotes the induction of the zzso II zzso as well as of zzso Finally, we explored the possible impact of zzso of cell response to zzso providing the evidence that zzso is activated in our experimental zzso On the whole, our results defined the zzso reactions triggered by zzso and zzso its multiple effects, thus adding further complexity to the intricate network leading to drug zzso
