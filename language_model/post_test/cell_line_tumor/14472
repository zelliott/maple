The present paper reports on an zzso method for the routine analysis of zzso zzso acids zzso A rapid method for the zzso extraction and determination of zzso was zzso zzso samples were extracted with zzso zzso and the zzso obtained were determined by gas zzso zzso zzso and gas zzso with flame zzso detector zzso zzso levels in cell growth incubation media were determined by zzso Confirmation analysis of zzso was carried out by zzso in selected zzso monitoring zzso and total zzso current zzso zzso The compounds were identified on the basis of retention time and comparison of primary and secondary zzso The results showed that this method provided a simple, rapid and sensitive way of analyzing zzso in different zzso
