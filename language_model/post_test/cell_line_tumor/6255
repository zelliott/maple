The zzso zzso 4 zzso is zzso in 23 types of cancer in which it plays a role in, among others, the zzso zzso For this reason it is a potential zzso for the field of diagnostic zzso The zzso zzso zzso which binds to zzso has been zzso to zzso zzso zzso to allow for zzso zzso The zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes that can be zzso with one, two or three targeting zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso lifetime imaging zzso zzso showed that the zzso complex zzso can be used to zzso zzso expression in tumor zzso The zzso zzso affinity and specific cell binding of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso derivatives were assessed by using flow zzso The three derivatives possessed zzso zzso affinity and could distinguish between cell lines with different zzso expression zzso This yields the first example of a neutral zzso complex zzso with peptides for zzso zzso of a cancer associated membrane zzso
