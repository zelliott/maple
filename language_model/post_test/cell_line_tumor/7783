The aim of the present study is to zzso and evaluate new potential zzso zzso zzso Several zzso zzso zzso and zzso steroid derivatives were obtained using zzso zzso 1 as starting zzso The structure of the novel steroid derivatives was confirmed using the zzso and spectral zzso The most pure and structurally promising compounds zzso zzso zzso 18 and 23 were evaluated as zzso zzso The in zzso zzso activity was evaluated against zzso cell lines using zzso zzso Also the in zzso zzso activity was evaluated against zzso zzso zzso zzso The results of the in zzso study showed that at incubation time zzso in olive oil, compound zzso was the most effective zzso compound with zzso of 30 zzso while the effects of compounds 18 and 23 were approximately similar with zzso of 37 zzso and 35 zzso zzso While the tested compounds when dissolved in zzso showed approximately the same zzso at both 48 and zzso incubation period, compound 23 was the most effective zzso with zzso 42 zzso at zzso and 40 zzso at zzso The results of the in zzso study showed that all the tested novel compounds at zzso were effective against zzso Our novel steroid derivatives are promising candidates as zzso agents, none of the mice treated with our novel derivatives showed any toxic symptoms, but they also completely inhibited tumor growth and retained the zzso content, body weight, and zzso near normal values and similar to what obtained for the standard drug zzso
