We analyzed the pattern of zzso and zzso zzso on zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso We also assessed the expression of important regulatory zzso related to zzso and zzso synthesis in relation to zzso and zzso zzso in human zzso cell zzso The significance of zzso zzso regulation was further evaluated with regard to cell zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso patterns in zzso in 11 patients and in 5 zzso cell lines were zzso We evaluated the gene expression of zzso zzso related to zzso and zzso synthesis in a cell line with the highest zzso zzso and another cell line with the highest zzso zzso They included zzso II, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and fatty acid zzso In a cell line with high zzso zzso the zzso activities of zzso and zzso were blocked using respective small, interfering zzso zzso and the impact on zzso zzso and cell viability was zzso 

In all 11 patients and 4 of the 5 cell lines, the zzso patterns of the 2 zzso were zzso zzso and zzso were highly expressed in a cell line with low zzso zzso and high zzso zzso whereas only zzso was expressed in a cell line with high zzso zzso and low zzso zzso zzso acid zzso expression was seen in cells with high zzso or zzso zzso These findings indicate the possibility that both zzso and zzso can be a zzso carbon source for zzso synthesis in zzso zzso zzso with zzso or zzso zzso in cells with high zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso and cell zzso 

The patterns of zzso and zzso zzso seemed to complement each other in both human zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso acid zzso expression was seen in cells with high zzso or zzso zzso suggesting zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to be important in zzso zzso and zzso zzso synthesis for the growth of cancer cells with a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in these cells may be promising for zzso zzso
