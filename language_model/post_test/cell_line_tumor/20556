The zzso of the zzso growth zzso zzso embryonic zzso zzso has recently been reported in several different human zzso In this study, we examined the expression of zzso in a series of benign and zzso human breast zzso to determine the clinical significance of this expression and whether zzso could represent a potential therapeutic target in breast zzso 

zzso sections from 431 zzso zzso patients diagnosed with benign or zzso breast disease were stained for zzso by zzso and zzso in a blinded zzso The degree of zzso zzso was subsequently correlated with available clinical data, such as diagnoses and disease zzso These tissue findings were further explored in breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso treated with a zzso blocking zzso to determine biological effects for target zzso 

A variable degree of zzso zzso was detected in all zzso The intensity of zzso zzso was significantly greater in zzso advanced stage, invasive breast cancer compared with benign breast disease or early stage breast zzso Treatment of human breast cancer cells in zzso with zzso blocking zzso significantly reduced proliferation and zzso ability in soft zzso zzso with increased zzso 

These data suggest a potential role for zzso as a zzso for disease progression and a promising target for zzso therapy in breast zzso
