zzso a bone zzso protein zzso zzso is zzso in various zzso zzso but its role in zzso has not been zzso Here, we report that zzso binds various cancer cell lines and this interaction is inhibited by our newly developed zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to cancer cells was unaffected by the presence of zzso zzso and zzso In addition, the binding was independent of vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso expression on the cell zzso zzso of zzso to zzso cells induced a zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso In a scratch wound healing zzso zzso cells incubated with zzso or zzso with zzso showed increased migration, which was inhibited in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells also exhibited increased zzso as well as an increased growth zzso These effects were also inhibited by the addition of the zzso zzso In conclusion, this study demonstrates that zzso directly interacts with cancer cells in a zzso and zzso manner and can induce cell migration, invasion, and zzso
