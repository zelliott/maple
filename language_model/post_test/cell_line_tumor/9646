Many tumor zzso efforts are focused on zzso the expression of zzso by transferring genes into immune cells or tumor zzso In this study, we sought to study whether zzso expressed in normal tissue cells, zzso the growth and zzso of zzso The expressing zzso zzso was constructed and was used to treat established melanoma in zzso model and zzso tumor model mice, respectively, with injecting directly into the skeletal muscle of the zzso site and zzso administering zzso with the zzso zzso zzso Administration of zzso resulted in high-level expression in the muscle and zzso Treatment of zzso mice with zzso zzso DNA significantly suppressed the growth and zzso of melanoma without significant zzso compared with mice treated with zzso zzso This treatment with zzso zzso in zzso induced an zzso of zzso zzso into the tumor milieu and an increase of levels of zzso and zzso Our study suggests that zzso expressed in normal tissue cells has significant zzso activity and may have therapeutic potential as an zzso agent in the zzso Directly intramuscular injection zzso and zzso intravenous injection may provide promising immune zzso approaches for different tumor clinical zzso
