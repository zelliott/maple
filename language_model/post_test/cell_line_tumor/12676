The development of zzso has paved the way for the double copy zzso zzso which substitute the deletion in the zzso with either transgenic or zzso zzso However, the limits of this approach remain zzso Previous results have demonstrated that zzso efficiencies of zzso carrying large zzso zzso in their zzso were impaired in a zzso zzso We wondered if this was also true for zzso zzso and whether they remained functional upon integration into the zzso zzso we designed a series of zzso with increasing zzso sizes containing different zzso zzso zzso cells were scored for both zzso efficiency and insert zzso We found that the zzso efficiencies indeed were impaired in a zzso zzso Efficiency with zzso below 1 zzso zzso decreased with size, while sizes between 1 and 2 zzso showed a further decrease to a minimum of zzso of an original zzso zzso However, we did not find an zzso size that completely abolished zzso Moreover, we demonstrated that all zzso remained functional regardless the zzso combination zzso zzso we conclude from our data that zzso indeed remain functional, but zzso efficiencies drop radically when zzso larger than 1 zzso are being zzso
