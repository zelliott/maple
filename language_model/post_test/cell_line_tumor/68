To investigate the effect of zzso zzso on the invasion and zzso of human zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cell lines zzso were zzso with the chemically zzso small interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso were used to zzso the zzso and zzso protein zzso The zzso zzso including cellular growth, colony formation and invasion capability of the zzso cells were zzso 

The zzso zzso and proteins levels were decreased by zzso and zzso in zzso zzso treated zzso Colony formation and migratory capability were reduced in zzso zzso treated cells zzso zzso zzso 

The specific zzso is able to reduce the zzso expression at both the zzso and protein levels and significantly zzso the zzso of zzso zzso
