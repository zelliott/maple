Gene zzso zzso the functions of the zzso signaling zzso zzso have been found in approximately zzso of human sporadic zzso To understand the functional role of the zzso zzso in zzso we have investigated the zzso distribution of zzso in a series of 17 human zzso to correlate such expression with zzso differentiation and in cultured cell models following functional zzso of the zzso gene by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in a 50% reduction of the zzso gene product levels in both zzso and zzso cell zzso In the former, zzso cell line, zzso levels remained unchanged or were slightly reduced, but zzso zzso in the nucleus following zzso gene zzso zzso In contrast, in the more differentiated zzso cells, zzso levels increased about twofold while mainly maintaining the zzso and cell membrane zzso zzso zzso of zzso was present in 12 of 17 cases of zzso with a prevalent distribution in the classic, zzso cases, and large zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed strongly zzso in the cell membrane mainly of zzso cells with advanced zzso zzso These observations support an important functional role of zzso zzso in zzso differentiation in zzso
