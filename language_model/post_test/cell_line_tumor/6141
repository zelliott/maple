In zzso cancer, the reported rate of zzso expression varies between zzso depending on assessment method and data on patient outcome are zzso 

In this study we investigated zzso expression and its zzso value in a cohort of 121 invasive zzso zzso using a novel zzso against the zzso domain of the zzso We further evaluated an association between zzso the nuclear zzso zzso as well as zzso Furthermore, we evaluated zzso expression in ten zzso cancer cell lines and incubated cancer cells with zzso B, a zzso specific zzso 

We observed a zzso and zzso zzso expression in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was an independent zzso factor for poor overall survival in zzso cancer patients zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso which was also found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso We further observed a significant association of zzso with zzso and nuclear zzso expression zzso test for trends, p zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso In addition, combined zzso zzso expression was significantly related to zzso overall survival zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso cell culture, we observed a suppression of zzso protein levels after exposure to zzso B in zzso and zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that the zzso interaction might be involved in progression of zzso cancer and patient zzso zzso it is an interesting zzso target for a combination zzso Further studies will also be needed to investigate whether zzso is also zzso for benefit from zzso targeted zzso
