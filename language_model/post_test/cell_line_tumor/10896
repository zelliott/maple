zzso drug zzso are considered to be a means that may improve the zzso and zzso of active zzso By using them, drug distribution is determined solely by the properties of the zzso The surface properties of such zzso zzso determine how they will interact with various biological zzso Among others, surface zzso charge and surface grafted zzso are considered to be among the major factors affecting its interaction with proteins and zzso In this article, we present experimental evidence that properly selected surface zzso charge and grafted zzso can alter the association of zzso with colon cancer zzso The dependence of the zzso of zzso onto the cell surface on the quantity and length of surface grafted zzso for a certain surface charge density exhibits a distinct zzso For example, when zzso were formed with 20 zzso of zzso zzso increased zzso zzso by up to 6 zzso This zzso maximum depends on both zzso length and charge zzso zzso presented in this article show that the interaction of zzso with colon cancer cells can be tuned by a proper combination of zzso surface zzso and surface grafted zzso
