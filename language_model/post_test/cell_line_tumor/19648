While conventional zzso flow zzso have proven highly successful, there are several types of zzso zzso that would benefit from a more comprehensive and flexible approach to spectral analysis including, but certainly not limited to spectral zzso of overlapping zzso zzso zzso resonance energy transfer zzso zzso dye analysis, free versus bound dye resolution, and zzso zzso 

Our system zzso a zzso grating to disperse the collected zzso and zzso light from cells or zzso passing through the interrogation region over a zzso zzso image zzso The flow cell and collection zzso are taken from a conventional flow zzso with minimal modifications to assure zzso of the zzso 

zzso of the zzso spectral analysis flow zzso included wavelength characterization and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the system demonstrated a single zzso intensity sensitivity of zzso zzso of zzso Single particle zzso taken with our instrument were validated against bulk solution zzso and conventional flow zzso zzso zzso of variation of integrated spectral zzso intensity of several sets of standard fluorescent zzso ranged from zzso to zzso on the spectral zzso zzso discrimination of free versus zzso bound to cells is also zzso 

It is demonstrated that the flow zzso has sufficient sensitivity and wavelength resolution to detect single cells and zzso including zzso labeled zzso The capability to use both standard mathematical zzso techniques for data analysis, coupled with the feasibility of integration with existing flow zzso will improve the accuracy and precision of zzso zzso enable the analysis of more discrete zzso bands within a given wavelength range, and allow more precise resolution of the relative contribution of individual zzso in zzso samples, thereby enabling a range of new applications involving the spectral analysis of single cells and zzso
