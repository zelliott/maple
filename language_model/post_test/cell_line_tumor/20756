After zzso stress, proteins that are zzso modified are zzso by the zzso zzso However, several studies have documented an enhanced zzso of yet unknown zzso Because zzso is a prerequisite for degradation by the zzso zzso in an zzso manner this raises the question whether these proteins are also oxidized and, if not, what proteins need to be zzso and zzso after zzso zzso By determination of oxidized and zzso proteins we demonstrate here that most oxidized proteins are not zzso zzso However, we were able to confirm an increase in zzso proteins 16 h after zzso zzso zzso we isolated zzso proteins from hydrogen zzso cells, as well as from control cells and cells treated with zzso an irreversible zzso zzso and identified some of these proteins by zzso tandem mass zzso As a result we obtained 24 different proteins that can be zzso into the following groups: zzso energy zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso The special set of identified, zzso proteins confirms the thesis that zzso upon zzso stress is not a random process to degrade the mass of oxidized zzso but concerns a special group of functional zzso
