zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso is the principal zzso of zzso zzso zzso effects on normal and cancer zzso zzso we investigated whether the enhanced expression of zzso could inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells, and, if so, the mechanisms that might be zzso 

zzso expression levels were determined by zzso in several tumor cell zzso Then, a zzso zzso zzso was constructed and zzso zzso into zzso cells zzso After zzso zzso was identified by zzso zzso zzso and a zzso binding zzso the zzso cells were analyzed by zzso zzso for zzso and cell cycle arrest was tested by flow zzso for zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso The zzso proliferation of zzso cells was zzso by zzso 

The human breast cancer cell line zzso expresses a lower level of zzso thereby partly accounting for the decreased response to zzso The zzso of zzso in zzso cells resulted in zzso zzso and zzso cell cycle zzso Furthermore, the expression of zzso together with zzso zzso was markedly decreased in the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso expression played an zzso role in zzso cells through inducing zzso and zzso cell cycle arrest, and also by decreasing zzso zzso thereby zzso the zzso effect of zzso Our data seem to indicate that developing a new therapeutic agent capable of zzso zzso expression could potentially be a way to block tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
