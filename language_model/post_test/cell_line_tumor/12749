The present work was aimed at identifying strains of zzso acid bacteria zzso from zzso with properties suitable for use as starter cultures in yogurt zzso 

A total of zzso zzso strains were obtained from two different sources, one group consisted of commercial zzso strains from zzso and the second group consisted of those strains isolated from various types of zzso The zzso strains from both groups were screened for resistance to biological barriers zzso and zzso zzso and the four most promising strains were zzso Further analysis revealed that zzso of the four selected strains displayed the greatest ability to reduce the growth of the cancer cells, zzso The in zzso efficacy of strains in zzso zzso induction zzso was zzso and the extent of DNA strand breakage in individual cells was investigated using the comet zzso zzso zzso was identified as zzso zzso by zzso zzso sequence analysis, showed protection against zzso initiation and imparted zzso as well as protection against DNA zzso 

zzso zzso which showed zzso characteristics reducing cancer cell growth, could be a suitable starter culture for yogurt zzso because of its strong acid production and high acid zzso 

This is the first report to describe a zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso which has the zzso characteristics and the acid tolerance needed for its use as a starter culture in yogurt zzso
