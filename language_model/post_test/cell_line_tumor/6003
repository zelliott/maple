Recent studies have shown that genetically engineered stem cells zzso produce suicide zzso that convert zzso zzso to toxic zzso which selectively migrate toward tumor sites and reduce tumor zzso In the present study, we evaluated whether these zzso are capable of zzso to lung cancer cells and examined the potential therapeutic efficacy of zzso zzso zzso therapy against lung cancer cells in zzso A modified zzso migration zzso was performed to determine the migratory capacity of zzso to lung cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso engineered to express a suicide zzso zzso zzso zzso selectively migrated toward lung cancer zzso Treatment of a human zzso cell lung zzso cell line zzso a lung zzso derived from human lung zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso or zzso cells resulted in the zzso of lung cancer cell zzso Based on the data presented zzso we suggest that zzso expressing CD may have a potent advantage for selective treatment of lung zzso Furthermore, zzso expressing fusion genes zzso CD and zzso may have a zzso zzso effect on lung cancer zzso
