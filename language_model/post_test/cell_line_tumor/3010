In zzso and zzso DNA double strand breaks are repaired by zzso end joining, whereas in S and zzso they are also repaired by zzso zzso The human zzso protein controls double strand break zzso zzso an event that occurs effectively only in zzso and that promotes zzso zzso but not zzso end zzso Here, we mutate a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso target motif in zzso and reveal that mutating zzso to Ala zzso zzso whereas mutating it to zzso to mimic zzso zzso does zzso Moreover, we show that unlike cells expressing zzso zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso even after zzso zzso Finally, we establish that zzso zzso to either Ala or zzso affect zzso repair efficiency, cause hypersensitivity toward zzso agents, and affect the frequency and nature of zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso control of zzso in human cells operates by mechanisms similar to those recently established in zzso
