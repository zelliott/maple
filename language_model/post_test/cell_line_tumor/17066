zzso of zzso activity can selectively induce zzso in cells expressing a zzso activated zzso zzso We demonstrate that continued expression of zzso activity is required in zzso zzso because zzso zzso zzso the loss of viability in zzso cells occurring following zzso zzso Studies utilizing gene transfer or viral zzso demonstrate that transient expression of zzso zzso activity is sufficient for induction of zzso by zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso of zzso by growth factor is not sufficient to induce zzso zzso the zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso is dependent upon zzso zzso with a concurrent loss of zzso membrane potential zzso zzso A, which prevented the loss of zzso also inhibited zzso DNA fragmentation in cells expressing an activated zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso in human tumors with zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso caused increased zzso in zzso a human pancreatic tumor line containing a zzso zzso zzso when compared to zzso a human pancreatic tumor line with normal zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso induced zzso in zzso a human zzso tumor line containing an zzso zzso zzso but not in a zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso zzso had been zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso tumor growth in zzso in a nude mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso these studies suggest the therapeutic feasibility of targeting zzso activity in tumors expressing an activated zzso zzso
