zzso zzso are the most widely used across the world; they are zzso in different zzso Their zzso are frequent pollutants in the zzso In addition, these zzso are spread on most eaten transgenic plants, modified to tolerate high levels of these compounds in their zzso Up to 400 zzso of their zzso are accepted in some zzso We exposed human liver zzso cells, a well-known model to study zzso zzso to four different zzso and to zzso which is usually tested alone in chronic in zzso regulatory zzso We measured zzso with three zzso zzso Blue, zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso zzso (on zzso zzso and zzso effects (on zzso using gene reporter zzso We also checked zzso to zzso conversion by zzso activity and zzso All parameters were disrupted at zzso doses with all zzso within zzso These effects were more dependent on the zzso than on the zzso zzso First, we observed a human cell zzso disruption from zzso zzso on the zzso zzso in zzso cells for the most active zzso zzso then from 2 zzso the zzso activities on both zzso receptors were also inhibited on zzso zzso zzso and activity were disrupted from 10 zzso zzso effects started at 10 zzso with zzso Blue zzso (the most zzso and DNA damages at 5 zzso A real cell impact of zzso zzso zzso in food, feed or in the environment has thus to be considered, and their zzso as zzso is zzso
