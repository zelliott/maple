Our previous study suggested that the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso which affects zzso instability, sensitivity to zzso agents, and migration of tumor cells by zzso regulation between zzso and zzso Here, we further investigate that a zzso containing zzso acid sequences zzso acids zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso interaction between zzso and zzso through primary interaction with zzso SP restored the inhibited zzso repair activity and downstream zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso of zzso was inhibited by SP, which resulted in decreased zzso stability and zzso zzso However, these phenomena were only shown in zzso zzso cells, not in zzso zzso From these results, it is suggested that interfering with the protein interaction between zzso and zzso might be an effective strategy for zzso cancer cells and zzso tumor migration, especially in both zzso and zzso cancer cells with functional zzso
