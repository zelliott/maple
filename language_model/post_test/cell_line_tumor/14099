zzso acids have significant biological and pharmacological properties and some have demonstrated remarkable ability to alter zzso zzso However, the zzso mechanisms of zzso acids on zzso zzso expression have not been zzso In the present study, we investigated the effects of zzso acids on the expression of the Phase II zzso of zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso and western zzso data revealed that zzso acid induced increase in zzso expression at the zzso and protein levels, zzso This induction was also marked by an increase in zzso zzso zzso D and zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso acid is a requirement for zzso and de zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with a reporter zzso of the upstream region of the human zzso gene caused a significant increase in reporter gene activity after zzso acid zzso Moreover, zzso acid increased the nuclear levels of zzso a zzso factor governing zzso response element zzso zzso mobility shift zzso showed increased binding of nuclear proteins to ARE consensus sequence after treatment with zzso zzso While investigating the signaling pathways responsible for zzso zzso we observed that zzso acid activated the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso protein zzso Similarly, zzso acid also caused an zzso of zzso Moreover, the protective effects of zzso acid on zzso zzso toxicity was partially blocked by zzso zzso and zzso zzso further demonstrating that zzso acid zzso zzso stress through a zzso that involves zzso zzso and zzso These results indicate that zzso acid is a potent zzso of zzso and that zzso induction is responsible for the zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso
