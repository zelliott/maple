We report here that the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in phase II metabolism of many zzso and zzso agents and in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso by the zzso protein zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso resulting in a significant enhancement of its zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso was zzso zzso whereas zzso by zzso did not require but was significantly enhanced by zzso In the presence of zzso the zzso of zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso incorporated zzso per mole of zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein was zzso in the presence of zzso by eight different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso belonging to the three major zzso zzso albeit with various zzso The zzso efficiency, zzso of the zzso zzso was more than double that of the zzso zzso In zzso human zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso resulted in a significant increase in the level of zzso of the zzso protein and was accompanied by a zzso and zzso increase, respectively, in specific zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso analyses and both zzso and zzso kinetic studies with zzso proteins zzso at candidate zzso acid zzso established zzso and zzso as putative zzso zzso for both zzso in the zzso zzso Together, these findings show zzso and zzso zzso as a significant zzso mechanism of regulation of zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso suggests that under high zzso zzso conditions, such as is present in most drug-resistant tumors, the zzso protein will exist in a zzso and zzso more active zzso In normal cells, the functional zzso of the zzso protein by zzso and zzso zzso could represent a potentially important mechanism of cellular protection, whereas in tumors, increased phase II metabolism of zzso drugs by the more active zzso zzso protein could contribute to the drug resistance and therapeutic failure frequently associated with increased activities of these zzso zzso
