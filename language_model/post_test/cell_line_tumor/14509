zzso are a class of zzso zzso compounds with various applications in zzso We reported previously that certain members of zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were able to bind with tumor cellular copper to inhibit tumor growth through the zzso of zzso activity and induction of cancer cell zzso Since the zzso is an irreversible inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso its zzso activity might potentially affect its usefulness as an zzso zzso For the purpose of selecting potent zzso compounds that are not zzso zzso and mapping out preliminary zzso relationship trends for these novel compounds, we zzso a series of zzso zzso and chose three novel compounds to study their zzso activity, zzso activity as well as the cancer cell zzso zzso The results showed that compared to zzso compound 9 has less zzso zzso activity, and the in zzso results also proved the positive effects of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso induction in breast cancer cells, suggesting that 9 as a lead compound could be developed into a novel zzso inhibitor zzso zzso
