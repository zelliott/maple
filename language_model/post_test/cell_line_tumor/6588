zzso zzso zzso zzso are promising vaccine candidates because they zzso zzso cells zzso in zzso and prime zzso zzso Here we examine their stimulation of zzso zzso T cells, critical for protective immunity against tumors or infectious zzso We constructed zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso which was zzso zzso zzso zzso or fused to either zzso chain zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting the zzso class II presentation zzso zzso DC infected with the various zzso could stimulate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells and all except zzso could also stimulate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells in zzso zzso injection of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso into mice resulted in a zzso T cell response, as shown by expansion of zzso transferred zzso T cells and zzso of zzso on these zzso The zzso zzso was the most potent zzso of zzso zzso and zzso T cells and was the only zzso to protect mice completely from challenge with zzso tumor zzso Therefore directly injected zzso can stimulate zzso T zzso both zzso and zzso responses can be enhanced by targeting the zzso to the zzso class II zzso
