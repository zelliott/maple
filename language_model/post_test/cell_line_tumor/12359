Human leukemia cell lines are of great value in investigating basic and applied aspects of cell biology and clinical zzso There have been 37 leukemia cell lines carrying zzso zzso and zzso zzso however, cell lines harboring with zzso have not been zzso We report here for the first time a new acute zzso leukemia zzso cell line with zzso designated zzso and zzso describe its biological zzso zzso cells isolated from the zzso from a patient with zzso zzso zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso were isolated and zzso by liquid culture medium for a zzso zzso cells revealed typical zzso features in zzso and had a zzso zzso The zzso as determined by flow zzso showed that zzso cells are positive for zzso and zzso markers with zzso zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction analyses revealed zzso fusion transcript and zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso is a new zzso leukemia cell line with zzso zzso and fusion gene zzso The established cell line, zzso could provide a valuable model in the analysis of the zzso of zzso leukemia and in the development of new agents for this type of zzso
