zzso interactions have been proposed as a potentially important mechanism zzso zzso death in type 1 zzso Recent investigations suggest zzso zzso afforded by small interfering zzso zzso can provide specific and robust gene zzso in zzso zzso The current study attempted to investigate the effects of zzso zzso expression with zzso on zzso zzso in mouse zzso cells following zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso is capable of rapid zzso of zzso zzso zzso production and cell surface zzso zzso A complete suppression of the total zzso protein was only observed after prolonged incubation with zzso suggesting a slow zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso assessed by zzso and terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso the extent of which positively correlated with the level of cell surface zzso These observations provide additional evidence supporting a role for the zzso zzso in zzso destruction, and suggest that zzso targeting zzso may be of therapeutic value in preventing type 1 diabetes and improving zzso cell viability in zzso
