To assemble zzso zzso cells zzso zzso from a variety of sources including zzso and zzso We know little about how the regulation of zzso nucleation contributes to zzso zzso and zzso zzso The Aurora A zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso nucleation from zzso as well as for zzso zzso We use bacterial artificial zzso zzso to introduce point zzso that block the interaction between zzso and Aurora A into human zzso zzso zzso have very short zzso but, surprisingly, are still bipolar and segregate zzso zzso of zzso nucleation during zzso assembly shows that zzso fail to zzso from zzso Thus, zzso nucleation is not essential for zzso during human cell zzso when zzso are zzso Rather, zzso nucleation is involved in zzso pole separation and setting zzso zzso A second Aurora zzso function of zzso is required to zzso zzso
