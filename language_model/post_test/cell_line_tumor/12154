A mouse model of zzso zzso was used to evaluate the efficacy of zzso zzso zzso combined with the zzso zzso zzso in zzso studies showed that both zzso alone or combined, were able to inhibit the zzso zzso production of tumor necrosis factor alpha and zzso oxide by zzso zzso zzso For in zzso experiments, the main outcome measures were zzso quantitative blood cultures, and detection of tumor necrosis factor alpha and zzso 6 plasma zzso zzso mice were injected zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso units of live zzso zzso zzso zzso or with zzso zzso zzso zzso cells of the same zzso All animals were zzso to receive zzso zzso sodium zzso solution, zzso zzso alone or in combination with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso immediately and at 6 hours after bacterial zzso In in zzso experiments performed with live bacteria, all compounds reduced zzso rates and zzso when compared with zzso In general, zzso groups had significantly lower zzso when compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso rates and zzso were obtained when zzso was administered in combination with zzso or zzso In the experiments performed using zzso organisms, only zzso demonstrated significant efficacy on zzso rates and zzso plasma levels when compared with zzso zzso combined with zzso exhibited the highest efficacy on all main outcome zzso These data were observed on both immediate and delayed zzso These results highlight the capacity of zzso and zzso to reduce the septic effects of bacterial cell components and zzso and suggest their potential use in the treatment of severe zzso zzso
