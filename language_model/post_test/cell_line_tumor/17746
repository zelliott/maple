The zzso factor zzso is a zzso with zzso zzso that binds and activates zzso zzso zzso controls the expression of several key regulators of the cell zzso In this study, we examined the functional and molecular effects of zzso zzso Cell cycle progression is affected with a zzso zzso This is due to the inability of zzso of zzso zzso as evidenced by expression zzso zzso and zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso is also observed, with zzso zzso zzso A role of zzso and zzso family members is zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to functionally activate zzso in the absence of DNA zzso Failure to maintain a zzso level of zzso zzso of zzso genes contributes to impairment of zzso and zzso zzso Our data highlight the importance of fine balancing the zzso duo for cell survival by zzso maintaining zzso of zzso genes and zzso preventing zzso zzso that triggers the zzso zzso
