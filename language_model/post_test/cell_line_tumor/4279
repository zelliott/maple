zzso zzso zzso are agents being developed for cancer zzso They are composed of an zzso that binds to a cancer cell, fused to a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso that targets zzso a protein expressed on zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso and other zzso Because the protein zzso zzso family regulates a variety of cellular processes and zzso we hypothesized that zzso zzso might regulate zzso to zzso zzso To investigate their role, we used zzso to lower the level of expression of the 88 known zzso zzso We identified five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that enhance the activity of zzso when their level of expression is lowered by zzso We further investigated the zzso family member zzso in this zzso zzso down of zzso slightly increased zzso killing in zzso cells, but knocking down zzso substantially enhanced killing by zzso We investigated the mechanism of enhancement and found that zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso by zzso and lowered levels of zzso and raised zzso We then found that zzso zzso mimic the zzso effect of zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso enhanced zzso killing of zzso cells by zzso and zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso also enhanced the zzso effects of zzso and zzso in mouse zzso tumor zzso Our data suggest that the combination of zzso with zzso zzso zzso may be an effective way to treat some zzso
