We previously developed an artificially constructed promoter that was activated in response to X-ray zzso in zzso a prostate cancer cell zzso zzso drugs were examined to see whether some of them could stimulate the activity of the zzso It was found that zzso zzso treatment to zzso zzso with a gene cassette of the zzso gene under control of the zzso zzso activity in a zzso manner, indicating that the promoter could be controlled by zzso When the zzso gene was replaced with the zzso gene whose product zzso conversion of zzso into zzso that is highly toxic, zzso zzso the expression of the gene product, resulting in zzso of cell killing effect in the presence of zzso These results suggest that therapeutic gene expression controlled with an zzso drug may lead to a more effective cancer therapy with less hazardous side zzso
