zzso zzso protein 2 zzso has been proposed to function both as a zzso of zzso genes and as a DNA zzso Our previous data indicated that zzso of zzso inhibited zzso of human cancer lines and zzso mice were recently shown to be resistant to zzso zzso zzso is an attractive zzso target since zzso mice were previously shown to be viable and fertile and zzso of zzso was reported to have no effect on cellular growth parameters of zzso zzso In this paper we test the hypothesis that pharmacological zzso of zzso zzso cancer growth in zzso using human zzso lines implanted in mice as a zzso We develop zzso zzso zzso of zzso and we show that these agents inhibit zzso growth of human lung zzso and zzso zzso cancer cell lines in zzso and zzso growth of human cancer cell zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso does not inhibit the growth of normal and transformed cell lines and does not alter cell cycle parameters in zzso and does not exhibit overt toxicity in zzso in comparison with a scrambled control zzso as determined by measuring body mass, blood cell parameters and liver and kidney zzso Our data provide a proof of principle that zzso is a new zzso target and that pharmacological zzso of zzso by agents such as the zzso zzso described in this paper is a potential new zzso therapy, which in contrast to the vast majority of current approaches does not target normal progression of the cell zzso
