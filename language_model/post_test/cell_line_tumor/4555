Heat shock protein zzso is expressed in normal and stressed cells but is highly zzso Although zzso has long been suggested to be involved in the regulation of stress response, its interaction with the zzso gene is still unknown, under both zzso and stressed zzso The present study has aimed to investigate the effect of zzso on zzso gene expression in normal chicken liver, zzso and zzso Continuous infusion of zzso chicken zzso (8 zzso per zzso at a constant rate of 3 zzso for 6 h in zzso broiler chickens significantly zzso zzso zzso decreased food intake and zzso zzso levels in liver and zzso but not in zzso In an attempt to discriminate between the effect of zzso and of zzso food intake on zzso gene zzso we also evaluated the effect of food deprivation on the same cellular responses in two broiler chicken lines genetically selected for low zzso or high zzso abdominal fat pad zzso Food deprivation for 16 h did not affect zzso gene expression in any of the studied zzso indicating that the effect of zzso was independent of the zzso of food zzso Regardless of the nutritional status, zzso zzso levels were significantly zzso zzso zzso higher in the zzso of FL compared with zzso chickens consistent with higher zzso levels for zzso zzso zzso To zzso whether the effects of zzso were direct or zzso we carried out in zzso zzso zzso treatments did not affect zzso zzso levels in a zzso male zzso cell line or quail zzso cell line suggesting that the effect of zzso on zzso gene expression is zzso through the central nervous zzso Furthermore, zzso gene expression was zzso with significantly zzso zzso zzso higher levels in male than in female zzso
