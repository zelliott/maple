The high drug concentration and zzso time within tumor zzso are a key challenge in cancer zzso Here we prepare the zzso zzso bovine serum zzso zzso with the size of 70 zzso 110 zzso and 150 zzso and subsequently decorate particle surface with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrated that the drug zzso and particle residence time at tumor site can be significantly improved by incorporating zzso acid group into the bovine serum zzso zzso zzso particle size and decorating particle zzso We show that the zzso and surface zzso zzso lead to the zzso zzso at tumor site go beyond zzso injected dose per gram of tumor through such delivery system, which is zzso higher than that of free zzso zzso Based on the zzso tissue and cell level analysis, we demonstrated that the incorporated zzso acid group into the zzso enhances the recognition ability of zzso to cancer cells, and zzso the action time of zzso at tumor sites since the zzso acid group can zzso and rapidly react with zzso acid zzso which are zzso in cancer zzso These features make that this drug delivery system not only has significantly superior ability in zzso tumor growth, but also zzso distinct shrinkage and zzso of zzso
