The success of gene zzso is largely dependent on the development of a vehicle or zzso that can efficiently deliver a gene to cells with minimal zzso 

A liver zzso specific zzso zzso zzso was successfully zzso and linked with zzso zzso zzso to form a new targeted gene delivery zzso called zzso zzso The structure of zzso was confirmed by zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso and ultraviolet zzso The particle size of zzso DNA complexes was measured using laser zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso The zzso efficiency evaluation of the zzso zzso was performed using zzso activity zzso Cellular zzso of the zzso complex was observed under zzso laser scanning zzso The targeting specificity of the zzso coupled to zzso was measured by competitive zzso zzso zzso The liver targeting specificity of the zzso zzso in zzso was demonstrated by combining the zzso with a therapeutic zzso zzso and assessed by its abilities in suppressing the growth of zzso tumor in mouse zzso 

The results showed that the liver zzso specific zzso was successfully zzso and linked with zzso to form a new targeted gene delivery zzso called zzso The composition of zzso was confirmed and the zzso showed low zzso and strong targeting specificity to liver tumors in zzso The in zzso study results showed that zzso delivered by the new gene zzso zzso significantly enhanced the zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso control region mice as compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso and other controls, which further demonstrate the targeting specificity of the new zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso was proven to be an effective liver zzso zzso for therapeutic gene delivery, which could be a potential candidate for targeted cancer gene zzso
