About zzso of breast tumors express zzso zzso In addition, there is clinical evidence suggesting that zzso can inhibit zzso zzso zzso Vice versa, there is also significant evidence indicating that zzso can increase the risk of breast cancer via multiple mechanisms, zzso direct conversion to zzso that can bind to the zzso zzso and thereby stimulate cell zzso We examined the effect of testosterone zzso and zzso zzso on cell zzso zzso and zzso expression in three different breast cancer cell lines alone or in zzso with primary human breast zzso zzso zzso obtained from breast cancer zzso In the zzso T induced cell zzso zzso and zzso expression in the zzso zzso positive zzso zzso and zzso zzso This was not observed in the zzso zzso zzso The differences might be explained by the high expression of zzso which converts zzso to zzso in zzso followed by zzso cell zzso In line with this absence of increased cell zzso zzso and zzso expression was observed in the presence of zzso which is not a zzso for zzso In contrast, zzso caused a significant suppression of cell proliferation zzso and zzso zzso and zzso expression in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso More importantly, zzso decreased cell proliferation in zzso zzso cells by zzso The results suggest that zzso that cannot be zzso like zzso may provide a perspective for treatment of breast cancer patients, especially those with triple negative breast zzso
