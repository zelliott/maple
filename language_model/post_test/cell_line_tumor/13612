zzso acid has been demonstrated to inhibit the growth of several types of cancer zzso However, whether it zzso human zzso zzso cells to zzso has not yet been zzso zzso zzso zzso Colo zzso zzso and zzso cells were treated with zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso alone and in combination and then the viability was assessed by zzso blue zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso membrane potential by zzso with zzso zzso and changes in the levels of proteins involved in zzso by zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso inhibited cell proliferation of zzso Colo zzso and zzso cells, but zzso toward zzso cells seems not to be zzso by this zzso The combination also elevated zzso cell death of zzso and Colo zzso zzso The zzso membrane potential was lost in zzso zzso cells, due to increased B cell zzso zzso protein X zzso B cell zzso 2 protein zzso ratio and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso to zzso in at least three zzso cancer cell zzso The results indicate that zzso acid has potential as a novel agent zzso zzso cancer cells to zzso
