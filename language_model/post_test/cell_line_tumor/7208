zzso evidence indicates that signaling through the zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso center zzso and memory zzso zzso However, it is not fully understood at which stages of zzso development the zzso zzso is activated in zzso To address this question, we induced zzso signaling in human transformed zzso B cells in zzso and identified a zzso gene expression signature by DNA zzso zzso This signature was then investigated in the gene expression profiles of normal B cells and found in zzso and zzso B cells zzso and zzso but, surprisingly, not in zzso B zzso This finding was validated in zzso zzso by showing that the nuclear zzso zzso zzso factors, which zzso to the nucleus upon zzso zzso are retained in the zzso in most zzso B cells, indicating the absence of zzso zzso Nevertheless, a subset of zzso and B cells in the zzso showed nuclear zzso of multiple zzso zzso suggesting that a fraction of zzso and memory B cells may be subject to zzso signaling or to other signals that activate zzso Together, these results show that zzso expansion occurs in the absence of zzso zzso which may act only in the initial and final stages of the zzso zzso
