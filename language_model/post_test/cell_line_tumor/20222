The synthesis of zzso hybrid agents containing zzso acid zzso groups is zzso The most active derivatives and the unmodified parent compounds showed up to zzso higher activity in zzso cancer zzso and breast cancer zzso zzso cell lines than zzso zzso of cell proliferation at zzso zzso was observed in pancreatic zzso and zzso cell lung cancer cells zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Introduction of the zzso groups did not affect the zzso properties of the hybrids, which form the same zzso DNA zzso as the parent compounds, as demonstrated in a zzso unwinding zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso and zzso mass zzso zzso shows that the zzso zzso undergo zzso zzso in a zzso zzso manner to form zzso zzso Potential applications of the zzso zzso zzso as a zzso release mechanism for zzso delivery of zzso are zzso
