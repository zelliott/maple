To investigate the effect of zzso zzso channel 1 zzso on the cell zzso zzso migration and invasion of gastric cancer zzso 

zzso expression was evaluated in human gastric cancer cell lines zzso and zzso by real time zzso chain reaction zzso Four segments of small interference zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso and a zzso control segment were designed by zzso zzso zzso zzso was selected using zzso 2000 and zzso zzso into human gastric cancer zzso and zzso zzso The zzso efficiency was observed under zzso zzso After zzso zzso expression of zzso was detected with zzso and Western zzso was used to detect the protein zzso zzso was examined by zzso zzso zzso and zzso was detected with flow zzso zzso membrane zzso chamber and zzso were used for the detection of the changes of invasion and migration of the two cell zzso 

In gastric cancer cell lines zzso and zzso zzso was obviously expressed and zzso zzso could effectively suppress the expression of zzso protein and zzso zzso of cells zzso with zzso zzso was enhanced notably, and the highest proliferation rate was zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells at 48 zzso The zzso phase proportion increased, while zzso and S phase proportions zzso The zzso rate of the zzso zzso group obviously decreased in both zzso cells zzso P zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso P zzso zzso zzso of zzso led to the zzso of invasion and migration by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso However, there was no significant difference between the mock group cells and the negative control group zzso 

High zzso expression can efficiently inhibit proliferation and enhance zzso migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells in zzso zzso might be a promising target for the treatment of gastric zzso
