zzso in the zzso gene have been associated with clearance of zzso C virus zzso indicating a role for type III zzso zzso in zzso zzso Little is known about the function of type III zzso in intrinsic zzso innate zzso 

We used in zzso and in zzso models to characterize the role of the type III zzso in zzso infection and analyzed gene expression in liver biopsy samples from zzso chimpanzees and zzso zzso zzso and protein expression were studied in zzso zzso cell lines and primary human zzso 

zzso infection of primary human zzso induced production of zzso and type III zzso including zzso zzso and led to expression of zzso genes zzso zzso infected with zzso showed rapid induction of zzso type III zzso associated with zzso of zzso and minimal induction of type I zzso In liver biopsy specimens from zzso patients, zzso expression of zzso correlated with levels of zzso but not of type I zzso zzso infection produced extensive changes with gene expression in addition to zzso in primary human zzso The induction of type III zzso is regulated by zzso regulatory factor 3 and nuclear factor zzso Type III zzso zzso zzso with a different kinetic profile than type 1 zzso and induce a distinct set of zzso which might account for their functional zzso 

zzso infection results predominantly in induction of type III zzso in zzso of humans and zzso the level of induction zzso with zzso levels of zzso These findings might account for the association among zzso level of zzso and recovery from zzso infection and provide a therapeutic strategy for patients who do not respond to zzso zzso
