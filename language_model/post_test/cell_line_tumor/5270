The major zzso zzso zzso has been proposed to play a role in DNA repair and drug zzso However, no cellular evidence zzso this zzso Recent reports indicate zzso involvement in zzso To further understand its role, we studied zzso expression and functionality in zzso zzso tumor zzso We report that the expression and zzso of zzso are zzso zzso zzso and other DNA damaging agents induced both zzso protein and its zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso Using a zzso cell line, we performed zzso zzso and found no change in sensitivity of the cells to the agents upon zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may not play a role in DNA repair or drug zzso Nevertheless, zzso serves as a key zzso in the degradation of DNA from dying cells leading to less cellular zzso zzso expressed in normal zzso zzso may act in degrading DNA in all cell types undergoing a dying process before zzso zzso
