To establish and characterize zzso gastrointestinal zzso tumor zzso zzso Further provided an ideal experimental platform through the zzso zzso zzso to investigate the mechanism of resistance to zzso 

zzso zzso cells were injected under the skin of zzso nude mice to establish animal models of human zzso zzso The molecular and zzso features of zzso zzso were also zzso and compared with their counterpart of cell zzso 

The zzso tumor models had been established by zzso injection of zzso cells into nude zzso zzso results showed zzso expression was positive in zzso zzso zzso but negative in zzso In zzso tumor areas showing zzso differentiation were presented next to areas with classic zzso zzso The zzso component demonstrated consistently zzso for zzso and zzso whereas zzso was completely zzso The zzso profiles of these zzso tumors were the same as their counterpart of cell zzso 

Human zzso zzso with zzso in zzso have been established from zzso zzso zzso Those models will enable further studies on mechanisms of resistance, combination therapies and allow testing of novel targeted zzso
