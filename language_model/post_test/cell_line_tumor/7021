zzso zzso receptors zzso are zzso immune receptors with the characteristics of combining exquisite zzso specificity of a zzso zzso and zzso T zzso function by signal zzso zzso Compared to zzso zzso in zzso T cells immune response to target zzso significant potential advantage of zzso is the lack of major zzso complex zzso restriction and zzso zzso zzso is a zzso specific for zzso The current study is to investigate the efficacy of zzso redirect T cells in response to zzso in a zzso model of zzso breast zzso 

zzso T cells from zzso mice were zzso by negative selection over sterile brushed nylon zzso zzso by immobilized zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Then the zzso zzso zzso were zzso by zzso (1 300 g for 90 zzso at 32 zzso The zzso efficiency was indirectly zzso by green zzso protein zzso expression of T cells in control group tested by flow zzso Mice bearing 3 days or 8 days zzso or zzso were zzso into experiment group or control group to receive IV infusions of zzso activated zzso zzso T cells zzso with the zzso zzso zzso or a control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of T cells per zzso Each mouse was injected zzso with zzso of 3 zzso zzso zzso every 12 h for 10 zzso Mice were sacrificed at 11 days zzso 3 zzso or 13 days zzso 8 zzso after T cells transfer to zzso the lung zzso 

In Day 3 model, more than 200 lung zzso were present in mice in mock group, received zzso T cells group as well as zzso zzso T cells zzso Treatment of mice bearing zzso positive tumor with zzso zzso T cells resulted in a significant reduction in the number of lung zzso zzso In zzso zzso T cells failed to induce the zzso of zzso negative zzso pulmonary zzso zzso In Day 8 model, treatment with zzso modified T cells had a cell dose dependent effect on zzso lung zzso Compared with 4 zzso zzso zzso T cells, 107 of zzso T cells were not enough to reduce the number of lung zzso zzso zzso With increasing dosage of zzso modified T cells from zzso to 4 zzso zzso was a progressive decrease in the number of pulmonary zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Gene engineered T cells expressing zzso zzso zzso induced the zzso zzso of lung zzso in breast zzso Higher doses of zzso T cells were necessary to eliminate more advanced lung zzso
