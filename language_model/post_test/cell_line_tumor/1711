For more than a century oxygen has been known to be one of the most powerful zzso However, despite decades of zzso and clinical research aimed at overcoming tumor zzso little clinical progress has been made so zzso zzso radiation damages DNA through generation of free zzso In the presence of oxygen these zzso are chemically zzso and thus harder to repair while zzso protects cells from radiation zzso enhancement ratio zzso Breast cancer stem cells zzso are protected from radiation by high levels of free radical zzso even in the presence of zzso This led us to zzso that zzso exhibit an zzso of zzso Using four established breast cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso and primary breast cancer samples, we determined the number of zzso using cancer stem cell markers zzso low zzso zzso compared radiation zzso survival and zzso formation under zzso and hypoxic conditions, and correlated these results to the expression levels of key members of the free radical scavenging zzso The number of zzso increased with increased aggressiveness of the zzso This correlated with increased zzso zzso and decreasing zzso When cultured as zzso breast cancer cell lines and primary samples were highly zzso and not further protected by zzso zzso conclude that because zzso are protected from radiation through high expression levels of free radical zzso zzso does not lead to additional zzso of zzso
