To establish the inner zzso barrier zzso model in zzso by zzso zzso cells and zzso cells and to investigate the effects of zzso zzso zzso 200 zzso exposure on the zzso of the inner zzso model in zzso 

zzso cells and zzso cells were zzso on zzso and the characteristic of the inner zzso model was assessed by detecting zzso electrical resistance zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso model was exposed or sham exposed to the zzso zzso zzso 200 zzso for zzso 3, 6, 12, 24 h in zzso then zzso and the zzso of zzso were measured for studying the effects of zzso on the zzso of inner zzso model in zzso 

zzso value (145 zzso of the zzso inner zzso model significantly increased, as compared to that of zzso cells alone model zzso zzso zzso on the 6th day after zzso There was significant difference of zzso of zzso between the zzso inner zzso model and zzso cells alone model zzso zzso zzso The ability of zzso large molecular materials in the zzso inner zzso model zzso The zzso value decreased and the zzso of zzso increased as compared to the sham group at zzso 3, 6 h after the zzso 

The inner zzso model by zzso zzso cells and zzso cells in zzso is efficient and suitable to study the zzso of the restricted zzso function of the inner zzso zzso zzso zzso for 200 zzso could induce the enhanced zzso of the inner zzso model in zzso
