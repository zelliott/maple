zzso growth factor zzso a zzso involved in zzso and most zzso zzso cell migration by binding to the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso causes the breakdown of zzso zzso contacts leading to cell zzso While the breakdown of zzso contacts is immediate, zzso migration requires zzso To test the hypothesis that this de zzso zzso synthesis includes cancer zzso zzso we performed zzso zzso to isolate zzso transcripts from an zzso zzso zzso cell line, zzso zzso known to migrate but not to zzso with zzso zzso One novel zzso we call zzso is induced by zzso in zzso zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso before migration zzso zzso oral zzso cell, and colon zzso tumors but not normal zzso express zzso zzso did not induce zzso in normal primary zzso zzso zzso In addition, blocking zzso to zzso zzso inhibited zzso induction of zzso in zzso zzso Most importantly, zzso zzso zzso inhibited scattering of zzso cells in zzso These results are the first to demonstrate that zzso expression may be used as a cancer zzso target to inhibit cell zzso
