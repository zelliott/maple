Loss of zzso in zzso zzso melanoma line is accompanied by a faster growth rate, higher zzso and shorter animal survival zzso Thus, the zzso of melanoma increases during the zzso of zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso As changes in the ability to undergo a spontaneous or induced zzso and the role of zzso in this process during melanoma progression are not well zzso they were investigated in this zzso Our results show that the proportion of spontaneously early zzso zzso cells in the zzso line decreased in comparison to the Ma zzso zzso c release into zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso estimated by zzso degradation clearly showed that during the spontaneous death in the cells from both melanoma lines intrinsic way of zzso was zzso zzso and zzso flow analyses indicate that zzso zzso induced zzso with zzso zzso by the intrinsic way only in the zzso melanoma cells, even though cells of the Ma line also underwent zzso zzso (the content of zzso cells zzso Thus, our results suggest that melanoma zzso associated with a decreased ability to undergo spontaneous zzso but an increased zzso to zzso zzso relates to different levels of zzso zzso they also show that intrinsic way of zzso depends on the zzso of melanoma cells, being more pronounced in the zzso melanoma zzso On the other hand, zzso melanoma cells resistance to zzso zzso suggests that the zzso apparatus or zzso itself may have the protective effect on the ability of the melanoma cells to undergo zzso
