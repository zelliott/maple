The possibility of inducing immune responses to zzso zzso zzso and zzso and generating zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied in zzso and zzso zzso The minimal doses of zzso or zzso that could induce significant zzso responses with zzso of zzso were 20 zzso per injection with the total doses of 100 zzso The highest zzso in a range of zzso were achieved by triple zzso of zzso mice with 30 zzso of zzso per zzso zzso zzso were generated at an zzso serum zzso about zzso however, only zzso of primary zzso clones were zzso zzso cell zzso were successful at zzso of zzso and zzso with 50% of the primary clones zzso Both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and were zzso These data demonstrate that zzso and zzso mice may develop high zzso immune responses to zzso zzso zzso but fail to generate zzso zzso at the tested zzso
