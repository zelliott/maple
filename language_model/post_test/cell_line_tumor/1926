Growth factor receptors such as zzso growth factor zzso 1 and human zzso growth zzso 2 zzso are zzso in certain cancer zzso zzso against these receptors zzso zzso and zzso zzso have shown therapeutic value in cancer zzso The existing methods for the zzso of these receptors in tumors involve zzso or DNA zzso both in extracted tissue zzso The goal of the study was to evaluate whether an optical zzso technique can be used to zzso the expression of multiple growth factor receptors zzso 

The authors examined zzso expression using the zzso zzso zzso as a targeting zzso to test their zzso They zzso zzso to 2 different Alexa zzso zzso with different zzso and zzso zzso Two of the dye zzso were subsequently injected zzso into mice bearing zzso subcutaneous zzso An optical fiber was then inserted into the tumor through a zzso needle, and using a single laser beam as the zzso source, the zzso zzso by the 2 zzso was identified and zzso by zzso optical fiber zzso 

The 2 zzso bound to the zzso tumor competitively in a zzso fashion, but they failed to bind to a similar cell tumor that did not express zzso The concentration of the zzso present in the tumor as determined by zzso optical fiber zzso was shown to serve as an index of the zzso expression zzso 

These studies offer a minimally invasive technique for the zzso of tumor receptors zzso
