A zzso effect of low zzso doses on normal tissue and a possible zzso of tumor cells at higher zzso have been previously zzso However, systematic experimental and clinical data are zzso 

zzso cells were cultured for 14 days at different zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso 3 zzso and zzso zzso and zzso with 0 zzso to 20 zzso zzso efficiency and survival were determined using the colony zzso 

The overall zzso was low zzso zzso zzso cells exposed to increasing zzso zzso showed a lower zzso efficiency and, for doses zzso 2 zzso a lower survival than the zzso For zzso zzso of 0 zzso 2 zzso and 3 zzso respectively, zzso amounted to zzso zzso and zzso and zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso yielded a significant difference between the 0 zzso and 3 zzso zzso at 5 zzso zzso and 10 zzso zzso 

Our experiments suggest a zzso effect of zzso in zzso cells at zzso of 2-3 zzso
