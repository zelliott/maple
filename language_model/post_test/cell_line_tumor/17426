zzso cancer is one of the major causes of zzso deaths in zzso zzso It is known that pancreatic cancer is resistant to chemotherapy and that cancer cells are surrounded by zzso zzso zzso proteins including collagen I, collagen IV, zzso and zzso 

To examine the role of zzso proteins in acquired resistance to zzso drugs and proliferation regulation in pancreatic zzso 

We used an in zzso model of zzso zzso and cell proliferation of cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso with 3 different zzso grades and found that resistance to zzso drugs and proliferation regulation was dependent on zzso zzso zzso cancer cell lines, especially zzso zzso cells, adhering to any of the zzso proteins showed decreased zzso of zzso drugs, except for zzso zzso and zzso cells adhering to zzso collagen I, and collagen IV proliferated more than the zzso 

zzso proteins have important roles in acquired resistance to zzso drugs and cell proliferation regulation of pancreatic cancer zzso zzso the expression of zzso proteins in pancreatic cancer specimens could provide valuable information to aid zzso drug zzso and zzso would be useful for treatment of patients with pancreatic zzso
