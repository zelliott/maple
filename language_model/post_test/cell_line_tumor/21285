The expression of the zzso gene zzso is low or zzso in benign prostate zzso zzso High prevalence of zzso zzso in prostate cancer cells due to zzso zzso suggest for zzso roles of zzso protein in the zzso zzso zzso fusion junctions have been extensively studied in prostate zzso However, virtually nothing is known about the nature of full-length transcripts and zzso zzso This study focuses on qualitative and quantitative features of full-length zzso transcripts in prostate zzso 

zzso zzso transcripts were cloned and zzso from a zzso library generated from pooled zzso of six zzso zzso prostate zzso The zzso zzso proteins were analyzed in zzso zzso Copy numbers of zzso zzso zzso were determined by quantitative reverse zzso in laser capture zzso prostate cancer zzso 

Two types of zzso zzso were zzso type I, which encodes full-length zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and type II, zzso truncated zzso proteins lacking the zzso domain zzso and a new zzso zzso In zzso prostate tumor cells from 122 patients, relative abundance of these zzso was in the following order: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso with combined zzso rate of zzso in prostate zzso Increased ratio of type I over type II zzso forms showed a trend of correlation with less favorable pathology and zzso 

zzso and quantitative features of specific zzso zzso zzso defined here promise to enhance the utility of zzso as a zzso and therapeutic target in prostate zzso
