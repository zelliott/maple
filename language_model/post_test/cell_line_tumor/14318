Central nervous system zzso tumors are thought to be poorly zzso However, whether defective zzso immunity is a consequence of a relative failure of T cell zzso versus a deficient zzso phase of the zzso immune response is not zzso We zzso a zzso model system of zzso melanoma expressing the model zzso zzso to evaluate tumor zzso zzso and tumor rejection from the zzso versus subcutaneous zzso We observed that zzso cells implanted in the zzso were capable of inducing T cell zzso as measured by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso occurred in the absence of zzso systemic dissemination of the zzso Despite the induction of a T cell response, zzso tumors grew progressively and were zzso whereas the same tumor implanted in the flank was zzso To study the zzso phase of the immune response in more detail, in zzso primed zzso zzso transgenic zzso cells, which recognize the zzso zzso were zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso was modulated by zzso delivery of zzso While mice that received primed zzso cells alone showed an increase in survival, zzso of zzso zzso led to a marked zzso of survival, with zzso of mice surviving at least 120 zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso T cell zzso does indeed occur in response to a zzso zzso but that manipulation of the brain tumor zzso may be necessary to support the zzso phase of the zzso immune zzso
