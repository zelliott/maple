zzso zzso is toxic although it is one of the most successful and widely used gene delivery zzso with the aid of the zzso sponge zzso zzso development of new novel gene delivery carriers having high efficiency with less toxicity is zzso 

In this study, a zzso zzso zzso carrier based on zzso zzso zzso zzso and low molecular weight linear zzso was zzso Furthermore, we compared the gene expression of the zzso complexes using two delivery zzso intravenous administration as an invasive method and zzso as a zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso had a relatively small molecular weight zzso zzso zzso with 25 h zzso in zzso The zzso complexes were formed at an zzso ratio of zzso The particle sizes and zzso of the complexes were dependent on zzso zzso Compared to zzso zzso the newly zzso zzso exhibited high zzso efficiency with low zzso zzso zzso gene expression in the lung and liver was higher than that of the conventional zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso delivery induced higher gene expression in all zzso compared to intravenous method in an in zzso mice zzso Such an expressed gene via a single zzso administration in the lung and liver remained unchanged for 7 zzso 

Our study demonstrates that zzso zzso may be applied as an useful gene zzso
