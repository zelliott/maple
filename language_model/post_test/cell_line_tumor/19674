zzso zzso generated during the zzso phase are zzso Large very zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso are not as zzso as their remnants zzso Small and dense zzso are associated with cardiovascular zzso zzso zzso size is partly under genetic control and is considered as a relatively stable LDL zzso In this article, we present data on zzso zzso zzso correlated with the modification of LDL features in terms of size, density, and in zzso zzso binding affinity after an oral fat zzso Six zzso zzso zzso patients and 6 healthy controls were zzso zzso zzso size was assessed by zzso gel zzso and LDL density by density zzso zzso zzso zzso binding affinity was tested by in zzso competition binding zzso on normal human skin zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso parameters were estimated in CM and Rem zzso by zzso zzso zzso patients showed significantly higher zzso area and a slower CM fractional zzso zzso zzso LDL density increased both in zzso patients and in the control group with a significant difference between groups at 6 zzso zzso LDL size was lower in zzso patients vs controls but decreased similarly in the zzso zzso zzso zzso size and density zzso modifications were not correlated with any investigated zzso zzso zzso were zzso more efficiently by zzso than baseline LDL only in the zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso are smaller and denser compared with zzso zzso after an oral fat zzso zzso zzso also slightly increased their affinity to the zzso cell zzso
