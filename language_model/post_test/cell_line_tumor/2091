To explore the molecular mechanisms of Aurora zzso inhibitor zzso in inhibited proliferation and in zzso induced zzso of breast cancer zzso 

The in zzso cultured zzso cells in zzso growth phase were zzso The effects of zzso on cell proliferation were examined by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The variety of nuclear and zzso zzso was examined by zzso And zzso arrest was determined by flow zzso The zzso changes of zzso cells were observed by fluorescent zzso The levels of Aurora zzso relative protein expression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso protein expression zzso cell cycle zzso protein expression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso relative protein expression zzso zzso and zzso were detected by Western zzso The zzso rate was examined by flow zzso 

zzso obviously inhibited the proliferation of zzso cells after a 24 h or 48 h treatment in a zzso and zzso zzso Their zzso values were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso arrested in a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso promoted the dissection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso had no significant effects on the expressions of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso microscope showed that zzso significantly induced zzso zzso zzso showed the rate of zzso significantly increased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso effects of zzso may provide new therapeutic approaches of breast zzso
