zzso zzso cells zzso play a key role in Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammatory zzso disease which requires invasive examinations to be zzso The comparison of the cellular protein expression profiles of Crohn's disease patients and healthy subjects is fundamental for the identification of proteins clinically relevant as new zzso or as drug zzso For this purpose a differential zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso approach combined with targeted zzso analysis has been developed and applied to isolated zzso We report here a study of the protein variations in zzso from healthy subjects zzso and Crohn's disease patients zzso The method was previously validated using zzso zzso cell line, normal or treated with zzso as a model of zzso zzso zzso proteins were extracted from zzso and zzso and for each fraction zzso zzso was performed and the proteins subjected to zzso zzso The resulting peptides were zzso by zzso zzso zzso and the obtained zzso runs were aligned with zzso zzso The peptides differently expressed were statistically evaluated using the zzso Software Environment zzso and identified by zzso zzso zzso analysis and database zzso The preliminary results obtained allowed the identification of many proteins involved in the inflammation zzso
