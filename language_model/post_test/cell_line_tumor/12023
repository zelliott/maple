Many zzso including growth factors and zzso activate zzso acid zzso zzso zzso which are involved in cancer development and zzso We examined the effects of a series of pharmacological zzso of AA zzso zzso on zzso cancer cells to determine the role of AA zzso in this zzso 

Human zzso cancer cell lines were treated with various AA zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the growth suppression effects were zzso The zzso expression in cancer cells was examined by zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the growth of zzso cancer zzso The growth zzso effects were greatly abolished by zzso product, zzso but not by other zzso products zzso They were observed in four cancer cells that expressed zzso but not in one that did zzso Of a series of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was the strongest one to suppress the growth of cancer zzso 

zzso cancer cells frequently expressed zzso A zzso zzso zzso revealed the strongest growth suppression of those cells compared to other zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the growth suppression effects were considered to be due to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso may play a regulatory role in proliferation and/or survival of zzso cancer, and may be a therapeutic target for the zzso
