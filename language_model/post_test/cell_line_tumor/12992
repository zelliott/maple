zzso studies have shown that zzso targeting of zzso zzso protein zzso can elicit protective immunity in the absence of significant zzso zzso zzso protein is a product zzso by zzso zzso zzso and is the zzso component of the zzso in most types of zzso zzso zzso differ from normal adult tissue zzso and instead resemble transient fetal and wound zzso zzso zzso zzso are critical regulators of zzso but differ from tumor cells by being more genetically zzso zzso in comparison to tumor cells, zzso may represent more viable therapeutic targets for cancer zzso To specifically target zzso we constructed a DNA vaccine directed against zzso This vaccine significantly suppressed primary tumor and pulmonary zzso primarily through zzso zzso killing in zzso zzso Most importantly, zzso mice vaccinated against zzso exhibited a zzso increase in lifespan and no significant zzso These results suggest that zzso a product zzso expressed by zzso could function as an effective tumor rejection zzso
