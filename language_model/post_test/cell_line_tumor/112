zzso all 10 breast cancer zzso genes known today are directly or indirectly related to DNA zzso break zzso repair suggesting a critical role of zzso repair dysfunction in the zzso of this tumor zzso We and others had previously provided evidence indicating that the breast cancer zzso gene product zzso controls zzso zzso zzso with zzso expressed proteins showed that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and possibly also zzso end joining zzso Here, we systematically analyzed the role of different zzso zzso zzso expressed in a series of zzso zzso cell zzso We provide evidence that zzso zzso zzso zzso HR, particularly between short zzso that strengthens the idea of a quality control mechanism underlying zzso zzso To a lesser extent, zzso also zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our data also suggest that repression of zzso regulation may require the extreme zzso whereas the zzso and core zzso are involved in zzso zzso We show that depending on the individual zzso zzso zzso retain more or less partial zzso repair zzso activities when compared with loss of zzso All in all, relative effects on distinct zzso repair pathways and discrimination between zzso zzso with perfectly versus zzso zzso sequences represent good markers for a zzso zzso due to a specific zzso Thus, advanced zzso repair analysis may serve as a novel zzso for the functional zzso of zzso zzso
