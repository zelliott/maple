Despite the use of zzso zzso zzso treatments, a large proportion of patients with high-risk stage zzso zzso cancer will zzso Thus, novel therapeutic strategies are needed for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso disease from the primary tumor is a major cause of patient zzso 

To model zzso cancer tumor cell zzso we have generated invasive zzso zzso cancer cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso screens were used to identify novel proteins that zzso the zzso zzso zzso was assessed using the zzso zzso zzso from patients with zzso zzso cancer (N zzso zzso were examined for zzso zzso 

zzso zzso cancer cell zzso showed a transition from an zzso like zzso with significant increases in migration, invasion, zzso ability, and an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed significant increases in zzso levels in all invasive zzso zzso zzso treatment resulted in significantly increased migration and invasion, and targeting zzso using zzso zzso or zzso interference zzso approaches suppressed zzso and zzso migration and zzso zzso high zzso zzso and protein expression were found to be associated with poor overall survival in zzso zzso cancer zzso 

We have identified zzso as a poor zzso marker and important zzso of cell zzso in zzso zzso These findings provide support for the further investigation of zzso as a novel zzso zzso and therapeutic target in zzso cancer, in particular in the zzso disease in which zzso therapies have zzso
