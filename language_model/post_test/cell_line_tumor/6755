The zzso growth factor zzso zzso is zzso in the majority of zzso cell lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso produce zzso to zzso response rates in zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso prognosis and zzso and interacts with zzso The zinc finger zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression by recruiting zzso zzso zzso We identified a significant correlation between sensitivity to zzso and expression of zzso and zzso suggesting their zzso value for responsiveness to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into a zzso line increased its sensitivity to zzso zzso resistant cell lines with the zzso zzso zzso induced zzso along with zzso and led to a zzso and zzso effect of zzso similar to that in zzso zzso cell lines including those harboring zzso zzso Thus, combined zzso inhibitor and zzso treatment represents a novel zzso strategy for overcoming resistance to zzso zzso in patients with lung zzso
