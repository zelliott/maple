While zzso are resistant to the zzso effects of zzso little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying this intrinsic zzso Here, we describe the zzso of zzso zzso zzso to facilitate the analysis of genetic changes that are associated with zzso in human zzso A zzso growth phase human melanoma cell line, zzso was infected with a zzso zzso zzso zzso and subsequently selected for X-ray zzso zzso Several zzso clones were independently isolated and zzso Interestingly, these clones also displayed resistance to ultraviolet radiation and to the zzso drug zzso zzso By Northern and Western zzso we showed that the expression of zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso protein 2 zzso an zzso that functions in zzso zzso was significantly elevated in the zzso clones relative to the parental zzso zzso Moreover, the levels of zzso in a variety of human melanoma cell lines correlated with their relative levels of zzso and the enforced expression of zzso zzso increased resistance to zzso zzso An analysis of stress signaling induced by radiation as well other zzso zzso showed that resistance associated with zzso zzso applied specifically to treatments that activate the zzso zzso Indeed, zzso zzso in a melanoma cell line resulted in increased zzso zzso Moreover, zzso expression of zzso zzso in this melanoma cell line zzso zzso resistance suggesting that the zzso zzso downstream of zzso may play a critical role in radiation and drug zzso Overall, given that each zzso and zzso cell line also exhibited resistance to zzso and that zzso clones showed increased resistance to zzso zzso these results suggest a common mechanism underlying zzso and zzso which is zzso by zzso zzso
