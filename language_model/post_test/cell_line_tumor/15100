zzso high expression of zzso zzso zzso I and II have been implicated in zzso conversely, zzso zzso which zzso zzso I and II, should also influence tumor growth and zzso To explore the role of zzso against colon cancer and in promoting zzso we used colon cancer zzso cell lines, zzso or zzso zzso cell zzso Cell viability and tumor growth decreased in a zzso manner when treated with zzso zzso Treatment with zzso induced zzso in zzso zzso however, flow zzso showed that zzso significantly decreased in zzso zzso cell lines, but not in zzso zzso cell zzso In addition, the zzso zzso response was through zzso zzso from zzso to zzso In this study we showed zzso injected zzso to inhibit colon tumor formation in nude mice, and found zzso to inhibit tumor growth in colon cancer cells, mainly through zzso that depends on zzso of zzso to a zzso zzso zzso this implies a molecular mechanism for zzso against human colon zzso These results suggest that zzso could become a novel agent for prevention of colon zzso
