zzso acid zzso zzso is a zzso acid zzso generating zzso that plays an essential role in zzso zzso However, zzso is now being studied as an important regulator of cell growth and differentiation and as a potential therapeutic target in cancer since PA is necessary for the activity of key proteins such as zzso zzso and zzso In this report we determine the effect of zzso zzso with zzso in pancreatic zzso cell zzso We show for the first time that zzso zzso zzso proliferation and zzso growth of pancreatic cancer zzso This is associated with zzso of signaling by zzso as determined by levels of zzso and zzso zzso sites on zzso zzso and zzso Since PA regulates the activity of zzso by modulating its binding to zzso we explored the possibility that zzso might regulate zzso by affecting its association with zzso zzso studies of zzso with zzso show increased levels of zzso associated with zzso when zzso protein levels are knocked zzso Furthermore, depletion of zzso results in increased zzso 1 nuclear zzso which is associated with increased nuclear zzso a nuclear shape change that is dependent on zzso further confirming the ability of zzso to regulate zzso zzso Our results provide support for the hypothesis that PA generated by zzso regulates zzso zzso We discuss the implications of these findings for using zzso as a therapeutic zzso
