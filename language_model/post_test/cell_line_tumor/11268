zzso is a tumor zzso gene that is zzso in different zzso in part, because of promoter zzso However, the biological function of zzso in gastric cancer remains zzso It is known that small zzso zzso can induce gene expression by targeting promoter zzso In the present study, we examined the expression levels of zzso in gastric cancer zzso Several pieces of small zzso zzso were used for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis of gastric cancer indicated that zzso of zzso in gastric cancer tissue was dramatic compared with the adjacent gastric zzso zzso cancer cell lines also showed zzso zzso expression compared with a human immortalized gastric zzso cell zzso One out of four zzso produced zzso of zzso as assessed by real-time zzso and Western zzso Use of a cell counting kit 8 and zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso of zzso inhibited cell proliferation and zzso in gastric zzso zzso of zzso suppressed cell migration and induced cell cycle arrest in the zzso phase, as well as induced zzso These results suggest that zzso is a potential target of gene therapy against gastric cancer, and that zzso could function as a therapeutic option for zzso tumor zzso genes in gastric cancer and other zzso
