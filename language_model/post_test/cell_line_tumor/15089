The current treatment of acute zzso leukemia with zzso zzso zzso has increased long-lasting complete zzso however, a proportion of patients continues to die eventually as a result of disease zzso In an effort to enhance the effectiveness of the zzso treatment, we designed experiments to evaluate the effects of zzso in combination with the lead compound of zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso After combined treatments with zzso zzso and zzso decreased cell viability index with a zzso increase in zzso cell death was observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso induced by the combined treatments was accompanied by elevated zzso molecular ratio and enhanced zzso 3 zzso Our study has also demonstrated that the combined treatment suppressed zzso cell zzso capacity and inhibited zzso activity probably via zzso suppression of zzso and zzso In conclusion, this study may supply insight into the application of this new combination therapy to zzso cells zzso less sensitive to routine therapies and suggested a novel combination therapy for patients with more aggressive zzso those who may not respond favorably to the zzso zzso
