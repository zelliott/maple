The effects of zzso zzso zzso on the cellular function of embedded zzso cells and zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso cells embedded within zzso gel survived zzso zzso zzso zzso There was a gradual increase in cell number during the first zzso The cumulative zzso of zzso by zzso cells showed an almost linear zzso However, lower levels for the zzso zzso were observed when compared with zzso zzso cells attached poorly to zzso gels without collagen zzso reduction ranged from 36 to zzso and did not spread zzso The addition of collagen led to spread cells and zzso reduction levels of zzso (24 h after zzso On day 5, some detachment was noted through analysis of vascular zzso zzso zzso Finally, the zzso zzso was used to prepare zzso zzso containing zzso cells to show the utility of this material in modular tissue zzso A fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso SE, showed that embedded cells remained viable for more than 2 months, confirming the good zzso of zzso in the form of zzso The suitability of these zzso for preparing uniform, zzso and zzso zzso remains to be zzso
