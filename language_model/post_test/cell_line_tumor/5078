Cancer stem cells zzso are predicted to be critical drivers of tumor progression due to their zzso capacity and zzso zzso zzso An emerging area of research suggests that zzso may also support tumor progression by promoting tumor zzso To investigate how zzso contribute to tumor vascular development, we used an approach comparing tumor zzso of the zzso zzso cell line containing either a low or a high fraction of zzso Compared with zzso tumors, zzso tumors exhibited increased zzso density and blood zzso and induced increased zzso and tumor recruitment of bone zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso cell cultures also induced higher levels of zzso cell proliferation and zzso organization in zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso cultures and tumors expressed increased levels of the zzso factors vascular zzso growth factor and zzso factor 1, and when signaling by either factor was zzso all aspects of zzso observed in zzso cultures and tumors, including zzso density, zzso zzso zzso and stimulation of zzso cell activity, were reduced to levels comparable with those observed in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso contribute to tumor zzso by promoting both local zzso cell activity and systemic zzso processes involving bone zzso zzso in a vascular zzso growth zzso and zzso factor zzso zzso
