The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a G zzso zzso zzso that mediates diverse zzso functions when zzso by zzso zzso peptides such as zzso zzso zzso zzso responsiveness to zzso parallels increased zzso to zzso zzso among patients with localized juvenile zzso zzso To determine whether the recently identified zzso zzso in zzso patients are responsible for selective loss of zzso functions, we prepared and analyzed zzso cells expressing zzso bearing zzso to zzso zzso or zzso to zzso zzso replacement as well as a zzso double zzso zzso All zzso receptors were expressed normally on the cell surface, but were unable to mediate release of zzso upon zzso zzso zzso effectively zzso zzso zzso an indication of zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso exhibited markedly reduced ability to zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were defective in zzso and displayed reduced zzso zzso but zzso at both positions partially restored the ability to respond to zzso in zzso zzso and was nearly normal in zzso zzso zzso All zzso exhibited diminished zzso of zzso zzso zzso displayed a delayed and significantly reduced zzso zzso whereas zzso nearly lost the ability to zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate compromised signaling capabilities due to the zzso zzso but the loss of function is selective and could be partially rescued by zzso at both zzso
