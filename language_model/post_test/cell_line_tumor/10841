Previous strategies for stabilizing zzso were based on masking the zzso chain with a zzso zzso The zzso of the latter molecules were only ca 5 zzso longer than those of their parent zzso The novel zzso described zzso contain a zzso zzso group that zzso their zzso of zzso Their zzso were prolonged by ca zzso zzso when compared with their zzso zzso While they zzso slowly in zzso zzso their zzso decomposition was extremely zzso They blocked zzso zzso zzso in an isolated zzso zzso and in zzso breast cancer zzso Similarly, they all induced a zzso DNA damage and zzso cell cycle arrest in zzso cells, except the most stable compound zzso (a zzso zzso zzso (a zzso zzso was the most potent and zzso was the least active of the series against zzso zzso In selectivity zzso with zzso and zzso all compounds selectively blocked proliferation of zzso zzso exerted the strongest growth zzso potency of the zzso The results in zzso suggest that zzso despite being the most stable compound, could not zzso at a rate that permitted the generation of DNA damaging species, thereby behaving primarily as an zzso zzso Thus the study permitted the definition of an zzso zzso as one that zzso at a rate that is slower than that of zzso but rapid enough to generate strong zzso targeting potential and growth zzso Based on the latter criteria, zzso and zzso were tested in zzso and zzso has proven the more zzso
