The development of zzso procedures for zzso has proven to be difficult in part because cells within tissue are more susceptible to zzso ice formation zzso than are isolated zzso In particular, previous studies suggest that zzso interactions increase the likelihood of zzso by enabling propagation of ice between neighboring cells, a process thought to be zzso by gap junction zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso interactions on zzso using three genetically modified strains of the mouse zzso cell line zzso each of which expressed key zzso junction proteins zzso zzso and zzso at different zzso zzso video zzso was used to zzso the freezing process in pairs of adherent cells, revealing that the initial zzso event in a given cell pair was correlated with a zzso zzso precursor zzso penetration of zzso ice into zzso spaces at the zzso zzso Such zzso ice penetration occurred in the majority of cell pairs observed, and typically preceded and zzso with the zzso initiation zzso zzso ice penetration was generally not observed at temperatures zzso which is consistent with a penetration mechanism via defects in zzso barriers at the zzso zzso Although the maximum temperature of zzso penetration was similar for all four cell zzso genetically modified cells exhibited a significantly higher frequency of ice penetration and a higher mean zzso temperature than did zzso zzso A zzso zzso chain model was used to zzso the rate zzso of the zzso ice penetration process, the zzso zzso initiation process, and the zzso ice propagation zzso In the initial stages of freezing zzso junction protein expression appeared to only have a modest effect on the zzso of zzso zzso and even cell strains lacking the gap junction protein zzso exhibited zzso ice propagation zzso
