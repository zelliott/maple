We have observed that treatment of human zzso cells with zzso in the zzso range of concentration affects the zzso membrane zzso The effect is specific to zzso and is zzso by zzso zzso and is thus better observed on zzso cells treated with zzso moreover, the zzso impairment is not zzso by zzso or zzso treatment and is prevented by the zzso oxide zzso zzso inhibitor zzso We conclude that in cultured zzso cells, the zzso NO release decreases the zzso membrane potential, as one might expect based on the rapid zzso of the respiratory chain by zzso The identification of new zzso pathways involved in the mechanism of action of zzso opens additional zzso providing a novel rationale relevant to the therapy and zzso of zzso
