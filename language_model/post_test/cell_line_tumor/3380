We have addressed the question of zzso zzso mechanisms that may be involved in the zzso action of zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso did not induce a rapid zzso of either the zzso or zzso zzso zzso pathway, whereas the entry into the cell cycle was documented by the successive zzso of zzso D1 zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso activity of the promoter of the zzso A zzso and DNA zzso However, pharmacological zzso of the zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or of the zzso zzso did prevent the entry of the cells into the cell cycle and inhibited the late zzso phase zzso whereas the inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso had only a partial zzso effect in the early zzso zzso In agreement with these results, small interfering zzso targeting zzso strongly inhibited the zzso cell cycle progression monitored by the zzso of the promoter of the zzso A zzso The expression of small interfering zzso targeting zzso 1 and 2 also had a clear zzso effect on the zzso zzso of the zzso A promoter and also antagonized the zzso zzso directed by the zzso response zzso Finally, zzso of the zzso zzso into zzso zzso did not zzso to the cells sensitivity to a zzso action of zzso We conclude that the induction of the cell cycle by zzso does not require a direct zzso of zzso or zzso signaling protein zzso zzso but that these zzso appear to have a zzso role in the cell cycle zzso
