In the course of a screening program on quince zzso two complex preparations were in the focus of the present study, zzso a zzso quince wax extract zzso and an zzso fermented one zzso While the zzso composition has been described earlier, the intention of the current investigation was to complement these data with an extensive zzso screening of these preparations including their radical scavenging and reductive power as well as their zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso effectively scavenged the radical target species exhibiting zzso values equal to zzso zzso towards zzso and zzso zzso towards the zzso zzso zzso zzso wax extract zzso was more effective at preventing the formation of zzso zzso species than zzso exhibiting an zzso value equal to zzso zzso zzso the zzso effects towards human zzso zzso and zzso cell lines were zzso The two preparations exerted a different effect on the proliferation of the three tested cell zzso zzso zzso was almost always more active than zzso but, sometimes, its effects seemed to be strongly dependent on exposure zzso Data obtained demonstrate clearly that both zzso and zzso quince preparations are zzso and exert zzso zzso
