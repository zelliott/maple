zzso tumor cells use zzso to degrade and migrate through the zzso environment consisting of a zzso network of zzso zzso zzso In particular, zzso a zzso zzso is critical during cancer cell zzso zzso is stored in zzso compartments and then delivered to zzso the specialized plasma membrane zzso of invasive cancer cells endowed with zzso zzso zzso In zzso traffic of zzso zzso to zzso zzso requires zzso We previously found that in breast tumor zzso cells an increase of zzso and zzso zzso upon zzso of zzso zzso with a decrease of zzso degradation and invasion in three-dimensional collagen I zzso Here, we investigated the role of the recently identified zzso zzso 1 zzso in invasive zzso zzso We found that the dynamics and distribution of zzso zzso require regulation of zzso zzso We observed that zzso zzso zzso binds and regulates zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso with zzso at the adherent surface of the cells and it is required for zzso migration and invasive migration of zzso cells in collagen zzso All together, our data indicate that a balance of zzso and zzso by zzso zzso with opposite activities regulates the migratory and invasive capacities of breast tumor zzso
