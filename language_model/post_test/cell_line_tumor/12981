zzso zzso zzso were zzso with zzso for the targeting and imaging of colon zzso In this study, zzso zzso zzso zzso could specifically target colon cancer cells that expressed zzso on their cell zzso and specific zzso was zzso zzso produced significant zzso signal changes in a human colon cancer zzso mouse zzso zzso injection of zzso resulted in faster zzso as compared to zzso injection, indicating that zzso had different kinetic properties in tumors based on the method of zzso The local concentration of zzso in a tumor was amplified by the use of an external magnetic zzso These results demonstrate the potential application of zzso for the detection of zzso colon cancer using in zzso imaging zzso
