zzso zzso zzso are not only useful zzso but also represent a promising type of zzso due to their high affinity and exquisite specificity for their zzso A critical step in zzso generation is to identify zzso zzso Although zzso zzso zzso zzso has been broadly applied for zzso selection against zzso zzso an inherent disadvantage for zzso is the difficulty in identifying zzso that recognize the native zzso of cell surface zzso To overcome this zzso the authors have developed a zzso zzso zzso binding zzso using zzso zzso zzso technology zzso This method offers a homogeneous zzso for detection of zzso binding to its zzso on the cell zzso To distinguish zzso that bind to zzso on the cell surface from those that bind zzso to cells, the binding is assessed using both zzso cells and related cells devoid of the zzso zzso This zzso can detect zzso at a concentration as low as 5 zzso and cell surface zzso as low as zzso copies per zzso zzso demonstrate that the zzso method provides a sensitive and homogeneous zzso to detect zzso binding to cell surface zzso and is amenable for zzso zzso zzso
