Neonatal zzso and zzso zzso zzso syndrome is a liver disease caused by zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso In this syndrome, it is speculated that zzso is caused by zzso absence, leading to increased zzso zzso and liver injuries secondary to zzso zzso zzso We studied the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso A zzso liver and polarized rat cell lines forming zzso the zzso Can 10 and the zzso normal rat zzso zzso were zzso In contrast to zzso Can 10 does not express zzso Can 10 cells were zzso with a zzso zzso zzso and stable zzso clones were zzso zzso expression was silenced by zzso with short interfering zzso in Can 10 clones and with short hairpin zzso in zzso zzso expression was evaluated by quantitative zzso zzso chain reaction, zzso and zzso zzso zzso was assessed by zzso zzso passage in both lines and by zzso resistance zzso in zzso In the zzso liver, zzso was not detected in zzso or zzso In zzso expressing Can 10 zzso zzso was localized at the zzso and zzso zzso was zzso compared to parental Can 10 cells, this decrease zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso in Can 10 clones increased zzso zzso to a level similar to that of parental zzso Similarly, we observed an increase of zzso zzso in zzso cells silenced for zzso zzso 

zzso in zzso expression increases zzso zzso in polarized zzso cell lines, supporting the hypothesis that zzso zzso leakage through deficient zzso is involved in liver pathology observed in zzso zzso
