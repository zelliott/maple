Nuclear factor zzso B zzso is a central participant in the zzso and zzso of zzso cancer zzso However, it is not fully understood to what extent zzso contributes to induction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and sensitivity to the commonly used zzso zzso zzso in zzso Using the zzso human zzso cell line and two zzso signaling deficient zzso zzso we investigated zzso role in the induction of zzso and zzso sensitivity in zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a zzso role in zzso gene induction in zzso cells, as evidenced by the failure of tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso to induce zzso in either of the zzso signaling zzso zzso cells exhibit a zzso zzso zzso activity in response to zzso not seen in either of the zzso zzso cell lines, which instead demonstrate diminished, zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso and zzso promoter recruitment of the zzso zzso zzso revealed a significant reduction in zzso zzso as well as reduced and altered recruitment of zzso to the zzso gene promoter in the zzso compared to the parental zzso cell zzso zzso only activated zzso in the parental zzso cells through induction of zzso zzso activity and increased sensitivity to zzso is observed in both zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso induction of zzso gene expression is tightly regulated by zzso zzso of zzso and that zzso stimulates zzso and zzso zzso cell survival through induction of zzso zzso
