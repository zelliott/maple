Rosa zzso zzso zzso has been traditionally used for treatments of diabetes, chronic inflammatory diseases, pain, and zzso in zzso 

We investigate the zzso effect of zzso zzso activity from the methanol extract of stems of Rosa zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso 

For the present study, Rosa zzso methanol extract zzso was obtained from stem part of Rosa zzso using methanol zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed to measure the zzso effect on zzso reporter zzso real-time zzso and zzso zzso were performed to measure zzso zzso zzso regulation, and zzso test were performed to measure cell zzso 

zzso inhibited both zzso and zzso zzso at 100 zzso zzso We show zzso mediates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and suppresses zzso zzso zzso treatment also decreased zzso of zzso regulated genes and also reduced zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the promoters of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Finally, zzso treatment reduced the growth of zzso a human prostate cancer cell zzso 

These results demonstrate zzso is a potent zzso zzso which reduced zzso and zzso zzso leading to decreased zzso zzso and reduced zzso cell zzso
