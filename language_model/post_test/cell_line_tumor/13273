Renal cell zzso zzso is the third most common zzso zzso accounting for zzso of cancer in zzso The mortality and morbidity of zzso is strongly associated with its high propensity to zzso to specific zzso This may be attributed to the fact that the zzso G zzso zzso zzso on zzso cells mediates zzso toward zzso factor 1 zzso zzso by target zzso zzso interference zzso which has been proven to be a powerful tool for suppressing gene zzso may lead to novel strategies for treating zzso Our previous experiments confirmed that zzso zzso cells zzso zzso are associated with increased zzso In this study, we constructed zzso zzso plasmids and zzso them into zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and western zzso revealed that zzso was zzso in zzso cells compared with control zzso Our results from zzso and zzso migration zzso indicated that specific zzso of zzso inhibited cell growth, zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso of zzso in zzso cells by zzso interference induced cell zzso in zzso zzso Thus, zzso targeting of zzso can effectively inhibit the growth and zzso of zzso cells and may be a promising innovative zzso zzso
