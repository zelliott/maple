The cellular response to zzso involves several zzso pathways that mediate adaptation and zzso zzso zzso in development and DNA damage responses 1), a zzso zzso target zzso has a crucial role in zzso zzso target of zzso complex 1 zzso zzso during hypoxic zzso However, little is known about the zzso pathways and zzso modifications that regulate zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso is subject to zzso degradation zzso by the zzso zzso zzso complex and through the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso degradation is zzso required for the restoration of zzso zzso as cells recover from hypoxic zzso Our findings define a mechanism underlying zzso degradation and its importance for regulating zzso zzso
