zzso virus zzso has been implicated in the zzso of human zzso but its contribution to zzso is not well zzso zzso carriage is associated with increased zzso instability in zzso lymphoma, suggesting that viral products may induce this tumor zzso Using a panel of zzso zzso of the zzso line zzso expressing the viral genes associated with zzso infection, we show that the zzso nuclear zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso membrane protein 1, zzso independently promote zzso instability, as detected by zzso zzso zzso DNA breaks and zzso of zzso zzso zzso promotes the generation of DNA damage by inducing zzso oxygen species zzso whereas DNA repair is inhibited in zzso cells through zzso of the DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduction of zzso of its downstream targets zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso enhances the propagation of damaged DNA through zzso of the zzso zzso checkpoint and zzso zzso of zzso Thus, multiple cellular functions involved in the maintenance of zzso integrity seem to be independently targeted by zzso pointing to the induction of zzso instability as a critical event in viral zzso
