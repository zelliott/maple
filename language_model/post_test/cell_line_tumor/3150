We investigated the therapeutic efficiency of zzso zzso alcohol beads loaded with zzso zzso or zzso in zzso and in zzso in a model of experimental zzso zzso zzso In zzso cell proliferation was efficiently impaired by zzso drug zzso zzso zzso treatment while zzso zzso were less effective zzso zzso showed little effect for both zzso and free zzso zzso was not different between free zzso and the zzso form while more zzso induction was observed in cells incubated with free zzso and zzso Experimental PC was produced in zzso The therapeutic efficiency of either zzso and zzso zzso or free drugs were zzso Mice were treated either once on day 12 or by 3 repetitive applications on days 7, 10 and zzso Mice treated by zzso showed less weight loss and zzso zzso effect was determined by measuring tumor volume and tumor load on the day 15 after tumor zzso For the single application on the day 12, an advantage could be observed for the free zzso After 3 repeated injections of both free and zzso zzso no difference in tumor load or tumor volume could be zzso zzso tumor load and tumor volume was observed in mice that received 3 repeated injections of zzso zzso No animal survived 3 injections of free zzso We conclude that zzso zzso of zzso drugs may show the advantage of less toxicity in zzso spread of zzso zzso
