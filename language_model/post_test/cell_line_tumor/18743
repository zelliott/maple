We have previously shown a critical role of zzso zzso during maturation and zzso effects of zzso natural killer zzso cells in zzso and in zzso We extended that study by exploring the ability of human zzso cell lines zzso and zzso zzso to express zzso zzso zzso and to respond to zzso stimulation in zzso Both human zzso cell lines zzso expressed zzso on membrane and zzso zzso zzso cells contained higher level of zzso than zzso cells, which correlated to the enhanced capacity of the cells to zzso and to lyse target cells in response to zzso stimulation in the presence of trace amount of zzso or zzso in zzso Two differences between zzso and zzso in functioning on human zzso cells were for the first time zzso zzso zzso with zzso to improve proliferation of zzso cells in a zzso manner without double peak zzso like zzso Although zzso enhanced the zzso of zzso or zzso activated zzso cells, it exerted the function through zzso gene expression of zzso without influence of zzso in zzso zzso cells, while in zzso zzso cells, zzso did the function through zzso gene expression of both zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso increased expressions of zzso on membrane and of zzso zzso in cells, indicating that zzso zzso zzso cell function by improving positive feedback between zzso and zzso The similar results were also observed in network between zzso and zzso These data indicate a potential role of zzso in human zzso cell zzso
