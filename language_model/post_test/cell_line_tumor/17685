To determine whether exposure to zzso zzso radiation can induce DNA damage or zzso zzso T zzso cells were exposed with zzso fields at zzso and zzso of the type used by wireless communication zzso Four types of zzso forms were zzso zzso zzso code-division zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growing cells were exposed to zzso radiation for periods up to 24 h using a zzso transmission line zzso exposure zzso The specific zzso rates used were zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso or 24 zzso for zzso and zzso or 26 zzso for zzso The temperature in the zzso was maintained at 37 degrees C zzso zzso degrees zzso DNA damage was measured using the zzso gel zzso zzso The zzso V affinity zzso was used to detect zzso No statistically significant difference in the level of DNA damage or zzso was observed between zzso cells and cells exposed to zzso radiation for any frequency, zzso or exposure zzso Our results show that exposure of zzso cells to CDMA, zzso zzso or zzso modulated zzso radiation does not induce zzso in level of DNA damage or induce zzso
