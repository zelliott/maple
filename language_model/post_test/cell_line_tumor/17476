zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and one of the most abundant proteins zzso by the human prostate zzso zzso is used as a well-established marker of prostate zzso The involvement of zzso in several early events leading to the development of zzso prostate tumors has made it a target for prevention and zzso It is thought that zzso zzso zzso growth factor binding zzso zzso providing increased local levels of IGF-1, leading to tumor zzso Separately, there are data that suggest an zzso regulatory role for dietary zzso which is a zzso zzso zzso In this study we have addressed the use of zzso acid as a zzso inhibitor in an animal zzso We have previously reported that low zzso (6 zzso of zzso acid can partially inhibit the zzso activity of zzso zzso towards a synthetic zzso zzso Also, by Western zzso we have followed the degradation of zzso by zzso active zzso and have found significant zzso in the presence of zzso zzso We proposed that dietary supplementation with zzso acid would inhibit zzso and reduce the development and proliferation of prostate zzso in an animal zzso We tested this hypothesis using nude mice implanted zzso with zzso cells in zzso Two groups (10 zzso were zzso with zzso acid solutions zzso zzso zzso by zzso Control group received only zzso zzso sizes were measured weekly for 8 zzso zzso zzso and IGF-1 levels were determined at terminal zzso The size of tumors was decreased in mice exposed to the low and high dose of zzso acid by 38% and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels decreased by zzso and zzso respectively, as compared to the control zzso There were zzso differences between the tumors in control and zzso animals, including a significantly lower zzso of zzso figures in the zzso zzso zzso IGF-1 levels were not different among groups, though expression of IGF-1 in the tumors was markedly reduced by zzso treatment, which we have shown by zzso These data indicate that low-level dietary zzso supplementation reduced tumor size and content of a tumor zzso factor, zzso This promising model is being evaluated in further zzso
