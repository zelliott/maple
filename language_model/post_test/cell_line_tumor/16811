zzso are important zzso zzso proteins implicated in zzso membrane stabilization and signal zzso through interaction with zzso channels, receptors and signaling zzso Here we report the physical and functional interaction between zzso and zzso a zzso zzso channel zzso in zzso patients with zzso dominant zzso kidney zzso zzso zzso and zzso pull-down experiments demonstrated that the zzso of zzso zzso A, B and C directly bind to both the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso zzso and zzso are in the same complexes in zzso zzso cells and human melanoma A7 zzso We then examined the effect of zzso on zzso channel function by zzso studies with a zzso zzso zzso system and found that zzso substantially zzso zzso channel zzso Our study indicates that zzso are important regulators of zzso channel function, and further links zzso zzso dynamics to the regulation of this channel zzso
