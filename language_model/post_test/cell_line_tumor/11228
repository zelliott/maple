In this study, we investigated the zzso effects of saffron extract zzso and its major constituent zzso on 5 different zzso and 2 zzso prostate cancer cell zzso Using high performance liquid zzso zzso the purity and content of zzso were zzso All cells were incubated with different zzso of zzso or zzso for 48 zzso Cell cycle and zzso were also zzso In a zzso and zzso manner, both zzso and zzso reduced cell proliferation in all zzso cell lines with zzso values ranging between zzso and 4 zzso for zzso and between zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso cells were not zzso zzso zzso profiles revealed that most cells were arrested at zzso phase with a significant presence of zzso zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that the expression of zzso was zzso zzso whereas zzso was zzso Analysis of zzso activity indicated a zzso zzso with involvement of zzso zzso suggesting an intrinsic zzso Based on these findings, it can be concluded that both zzso and zzso can inhibit cell zzso arrest cell cycle zzso inducing zzso in prostate zzso zzso these agents could potentially be used as a zzso as well as a zzso agent for prostate cancer zzso
