zzso and zzso are well-known cancer zzso agents but their uses are limited with zzso and drug zzso Several zzso and zzso zzso acids were introduced into the zzso skeleton and numerous derivatives were zzso for the evaluation of zzso zzso The screening tests showed that zzso an zzso zzso was the most effective zzso to inhibit zzso effect of human zzso prostate cancer zzso cells zzso zzso In an extension zzso zzso displayed a potent zzso activity in various cancer cell lines, including zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso cancer zzso breast cancer zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso It induced zzso arrest at S and zzso but not zzso phase, in zzso zzso The comet zzso revealed that induction of DNA damage and zzso of zzso II were the primary zzso After the checkpoint arrest of the zzso zzso induced the zzso intrinsic zzso pathway, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso degradation and zzso zzso also contributed to zzso zzso Moreover, the assessment of zzso in zzso zzso and drug resistance in zzso cells demonstrated that zzso showed much lower zzso and zzso resistance than those of zzso zzso and zzso In conclusion, it is suggested that zzso is a potential zzso II inhibitor with reduced zzso and drug zzso It zzso zzso II activity and zzso zzso DNA strand breaks, leading to S and zzso arrest of the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso
