In the present study, the main natural zzso from zzso roots was studied by the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso in human prostate cancer zzso First, the natural products with zzso activity in zzso roots were screened by zzso transgenic zzso and zzso zzso was confirmed as the active zzso Further study showed that zzso significantly arrested the cell cycle in the zzso and zzso phase and induced zzso zzso fragmentation and the formation of zzso zzso Western zzso showed that zzso modulated the zzso zzso zzso and induced the zzso of zzso and zzso closely following the profile of zzso zzso Based on above results, we proposed a mechanism through which zzso could inhibit survival and proliferation of zzso cells zzso zzso by interfering with an zzso zzso pathway, following a process that could be dependent of the nuclear functions of the zzso Above all, we conclude that zzso represents a valuable natural zzso source and may potentially be zzso in health food zzso
