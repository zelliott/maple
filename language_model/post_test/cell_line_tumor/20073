zzso is known to participate in various cellular processes by targeting gene zzso We previously revealed a link between zzso and zzso of zzso invasion and zzso This study aimed to investigate the target zzso of zzso on the influence on the proliferation and migration of zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that, at the 3' untranslated region zzso of zzso zzso six bases are complementary to the seed region of zzso zzso zzso and zzso D1 zzso zzso zzso validated that zzso D1 zzso was the target of zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells reduced the level of zzso D1 zzso decreased cell proliferation and invasion, and increased cell number at the zzso zzso Furthermore, the increased expression of zzso also regulated the protein levels of zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso In conclusion, we found that zzso D1 may be a target of zzso in zzso cells, and demonstrated a negative regulatory role of zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso in proliferation and migration of the zzso
