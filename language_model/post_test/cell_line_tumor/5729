zzso cell resistance to chemotherapy constitutes a major problem in the treatment of zzso zzso We here investigated the role of zzso metabolism for the resistance of zzso cells to treatment with the zzso drug, zzso zzso triggers a marked release of zzso in zzso cells, while zzso cells that are resistant to zzso fail to accumulate zzso While the release of zzso is very similar in zzso and resistant zzso cells upon zzso resistant zzso cells rapidly consume zzso upon zzso treatment or zzso zzso zzso zzso or genetic zzso of zzso prevents zzso consumption in resistant cells and restores sensitivity of resistant zzso cells to zzso These data suggest that zzso cell resistance to at least some zzso drugs is zzso by rapid consumption of zzso to prevent cell zzso
