Our previous studies on rat zzso zzso zzso cells suggested that zzso channels similar to those in red blood cells zzso may be involved in the zzso zzso zzso Since zzso blocks these channels in both cell types, we studied the zzso by a selection of the synthetic zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso release and zzso from zzso zzso We tested the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the more zzso zzso acid derivatives zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso derivatives zzso zzso and zzso zzso They all inhibited zzso zzso release and zzso Their relative potency in zzso zzso zzso release was zzso zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These zzso suggest some zzso between zzso in zzso cells and zzso zzso and potency were well correlated in zzso but not in zzso zzso
