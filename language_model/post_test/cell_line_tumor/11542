Using a zzso zzso expression cloning approach, we identified the zzso 2 zzso zzso factor as novel zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells induced striking zzso changes, an increase in cell zzso zzso growth, and tumor growth in zzso By combining a zzso analysis and a zzso zzso analysis with various zzso zzso we identified the zzso growth factor zzso family member zzso as a novel zzso target zzso In breast cancer cell lines, zzso zzso of zzso expression or functional zzso of zzso using dominant negative zzso proteins zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso a striking reduction in cell zzso and zzso and zzso zzso characteristic of an zzso transition zzso thus zzso contradictory roles of zzso in breast zzso Interestingly, we could further demonstrate that expression of zzso is directly suppressed by the zzso factor zinc finger zzso protein 1 zzso which in turn is a direct target for repression by zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso form a double negative regulatory feedback loop in breast cancer zzso Finally, a comprehensive zzso analysis of zzso expression in primary breast zzso showed loss of zzso expression at the invasive front of primary zzso A zzso relevance of zzso in breast cancer zzso is further demonstrated by our finding of a statistically significant association between loss of zzso expression in primary breast zzso and zzso zzso zzso We thus demonstrate a crucial role of zzso in breast zzso
