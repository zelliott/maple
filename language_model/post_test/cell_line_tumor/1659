The efficacy of the zzso inhibitor zzso against chronic zzso leukemia zzso cells and its mechanisms of action are zzso In this study, the zzso effects of zzso on zzso and acute zzso leukemia zzso cell lines were compared to zzso the mechanisms underlying the zzso 

Human zzso cell lines zzso and zzso and the zzso cell line zzso were zzso Cell viability was zzso using zzso zzso zzso was determined using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which were followed by flow zzso and zzso zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso zzso and the expression of zzso genes were examined using Western zzso zzso was studied using electron zzso the zzso orange zzso method, and zzso was examined with zzso zzso 

In contrast to zzso cell lines, the zzso cell lines zzso and zzso (an zzso zzso cell line) were resistant to zzso zzso zzso in respect to zzso cell growth and inducing zzso zzso zzso 5, and 10 zzso inhibited zzso and its zzso in zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso Treatment with zzso (20 zzso resulted in zzso in zzso cells as shown by the increased formation of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso 10, and 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso 1 at the protein zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso by zzso (40 zzso significantly suppressed the cell growth and induced zzso in zzso cells treated with zzso (20 zzso 

Our results show that zzso cell lines were resistant to the zzso inhibitor zzso in zzso which is due to zzso protective zzso and zzso of zzso
