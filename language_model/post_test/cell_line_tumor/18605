The knowledge that Ras was readily zzso by protein zzso and that the zzso of this reaction has the ability to zzso the transformed zzso provided the rationale for the development of zzso as zzso zzso Studies have shown that zzso of Ras is the first, obligatory first step in a series of zzso modifications leading to membrane association, which, in turn, determines the switch from an inactive to an active zzso bound zzso Based on the zzso assumption that preventing Ras zzso might result in the zzso of Ras functions, a range of zzso have been zzso Their biology is fascinating since after substantial investigation and their use in several phase II studies and at least two phase III trials, the exact mechanism of action remains zzso zzso can block the zzso of several additional zzso such as zzso zzso A and B, zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso While the zzso clearly do not or only partly target zzso these agents appear to have clinical activity in leukemia and in some solid tumors regardless of their Ras zzso zzso Although zzso of zzso by these compounds has been well documented also in normal zzso their toxic effects seem to be zzso However, preliminary results of early Phase zzso studies suggest that the activity of zzso as a zzso is modest and generally lower than that obtained by standard zzso zzso zzso clinical studies are assessing the role of zzso for early stage disease or in combination with zzso agents or with other molecular targeted therapies for advanced stage zzso Further insights in the molecular mechanism of action of zzso might help in better define their optimal use in combination with standard therapies in the treatment of cancer zzso
