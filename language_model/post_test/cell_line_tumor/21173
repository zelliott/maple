zzso zzso zzso stress contributes to beta cell death in type 2 diabetes zzso zzso stress is characterized by increased level of zzso stress markers such as zzso zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso leads to its zzso into the nucleus, where it zzso cell zzso We previously reported nuclear zzso in pancreatic sections from zzso but not zzso and in human zzso zzso zzso zzso transgenic zzso pancreatic zzso These studies underscore the importance of studying nuclear zzso We have observed inconsistency in the detection of zzso zzso reported in the literature and also in our own zzso To investigate the specificity of zzso zzso we first induced zzso stress by zzso in rat zzso zzso cells and prepared nuclear and zzso zzso Then we examined zzso expression by Western zzso and zzso using seven commercially available zzso zzso in zzso cells and human zzso zzso transgenic zzso pancreatic zzso These studies show that three commercially available zzso zzso out of seven tested were zzso In conclusion, we give recommendations for zzso zzso selection and methods to verify zzso zzso zzso Also, we propose that the authors report the catalog and lot numbers of the zzso zzso zzso
