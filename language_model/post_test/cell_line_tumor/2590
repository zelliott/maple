zzso studies suggested complicated associations between type 2 diabetes zzso and breast zzso There is a significant inverse association between zzso zzso zzso and the risk and mortality of breast zzso However, HDL could be modified in various ways in diabetes patients, and this may lead to the altered effects on many different types of zzso In our study, we found that zzso and zzso levels are significantly higher in HDL from type 2 diabetes zzso patients compared to that from healthy zzso zzso HDL dramatically had a stronger capability to promote cell zzso migration and invasion of breast cancer (as examined both on zzso cells and on zzso zzso In addition, zzso and oxidized zzso which were produced in zzso acted in similar way as diabetic zzso zzso zzso zzso HDL and oxidized HDL also induced higher synthesis and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso It was indicated that zzso zzso and oxidized HDL promote zzso cell migration and invasion through zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso plays an important role as well in zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathways are also involved in zzso and zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso and oxidized zzso Our study demonstrated that zzso and zzso of HDL in diabetic patients could lead to abnormal actions on zzso cell zzso migration and invasion, thereby promoting the progression of breast zzso This will largely draw the attention of zzso treatments in diabetic patients especially those with breast zzso
