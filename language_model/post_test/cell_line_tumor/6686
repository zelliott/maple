The physical and biological properties of a zzso zzso contrast agent based on a complex of zzso zzso with zzso zzso were investigated, and its potential for experimental magnetic resonance zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso serum zzso and zzso were determined at zzso zzso zzso stability and zzso of zzso were assessed in zzso and by analyzing zzso and organ distribution in rats for up to 2 zzso For comparison, zzso and zzso zzso zzso of brain, chest, and subcutaneous tumors in rats were zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso higher than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and twice as high as that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the molecular weight of the zzso zzso zzso did not significantly change the zzso zzso In rats, 20 and zzso of the injected dose of zzso was detected at 24 and zzso h zzso zzso Upon a relatively rapid initial zzso zzso no specific retention in any organ was noted, with some exception for the zzso zzso No measurable release of zzso from the zzso complex or cell toxicity was observed during its incubation in zzso zzso Excellent display of rat and tumor zzso was achieved with zzso and zzso however, contrast of vessels was higher in zzso zzso zzso is considered a zzso contrast agent highly suited for experimental MR zzso
