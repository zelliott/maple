The zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in human zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a selective zzso zzso zzso that has been extensively used for research, therapy, and diagnosis of zzso For developing zzso with enhanced zzso zzso we here report the synthesis of a series of zzso agents in which the zzso a zzso a zzso zzso was zzso to zzso and the related zzso The cell zzso and in zzso zzso efficacy of the zzso were studied in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines whereas the in zzso zzso efficacy and zzso potential of the zzso were compared with the corresponding zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Compared to zzso the zzso zzso in which the zzso and zzso acid zzso were available for binding to two zzso of zzso zzso showed faster zzso enhanced tumor imaging and enhanced zzso efficacy at 2-4 h zzso zzso modeling studies also confirmed that the presence of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso does not interfere with specific recognition of zzso by zzso zzso Compared to zzso and zzso cells the zzso showed significantly low zzso efficacy in zzso zzso zzso tumor cells, suggesting possible target specificity of the zzso
