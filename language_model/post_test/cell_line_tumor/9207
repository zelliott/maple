To construct an zzso interference zzso to zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso gene and study the zzso interference effect on the cell cycle and growth of zzso zzso 

zzso of 64 base pairs for hairpin zzso targeting zzso were zzso chemically zzso zzso and cloned into the zzso zzso After identification by restriction zzso the correct zzso were zzso zzso into zzso cells, a human zzso cancer cell zzso The zzso zzso was detected by zzso The proteins were detected by western zzso and indirect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso method were applied to measure cell cycle, cell growth and zzso to zzso 

zzso cells had a high level expression of zzso The zzso of zzso zzso which can interfere with zzso gene was successfully zzso After transient zzso the expression of zzso protein was significantly decreased in zzso cells and the value of relative density was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 65, 1973 zzso 80 and 110 zzso 12, respectively zzso zzso zzso At the same time, the expression of zzso zzso was decreased accordingly and the value of relative density was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 57 and zzso zzso 78, respectively zzso zzso zzso The zzso results showed that, the zzso could increase the number of cells in zzso phase compared with parent cells and compared with the cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso the number in S phase decreased compared with parent cells and compared with the cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results showed that zzso could inhibit the growth and proliferation of zzso cells in a zzso manner, and inhibit the tumor cell zzso 

We successfully constructed an expressing hairpin zzso against the zzso zzso The zzso can effectively silence zzso zzso increase the number of cells in zzso phase, and slow down the growth of tumor zzso This may be a useful therapeutic strategy for zzso zzso zzso zzso
