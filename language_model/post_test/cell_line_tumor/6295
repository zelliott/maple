To investigate the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in oral zzso cell zzso zzso and observe the immune response against zzso by use of zzso induced zzso cells zzso in zzso and in zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso in different cell lines was zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso from the treated cells was presented by zzso zzso DC was then zzso with zzso T zzso to induce zzso specific zzso zzso zzso The immune response zzso by zzso against zzso was zzso 

A significant lower expression of zzso and zzso was observed in zzso cell zzso zzso exerted zzso effect for increasing the expression of these zzso zzso from the treated zzso cells was presented by zzso zzso were induced and generated a strong immune response in zzso and in zzso 

zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso zzso increased the expression of these zzso Use of zzso induced zzso could induce stronger immune response in zzso and in zzso
