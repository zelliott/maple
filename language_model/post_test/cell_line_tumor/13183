B cells are present within chronically inflamed liver tissue and recent evidence implicates them in the progression of liver zzso In addition, a large proportion of zzso zzso are of zzso zzso The molecular signals that regulate normal and zzso zzso recruitment into peripheral tissue from blood are poorly zzso leading us to study human zzso migration through zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso In such zzso human zzso B cells were captured from zzso flow without a previous rolling phase and underwent firm zzso zzso by vascular cell zzso zzso zzso Unlike T cells, which displayed vigorous crawling behavior on the zzso B cells remained zzso before a proportion underwent zzso migration zzso by a combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso zzso common zzso zzso and vascular zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell lines and primary zzso B cells from patients with chronic zzso leukemia and marginal zone B cell zzso also underwent zzso firm zzso involving zzso and/or zzso and demonstrated zzso zzso and crawling zzso Unlike primary zzso the zzso cells did not undergo zzso migration, which could explain why zzso are frequently characterized by the zzso zzso of zzso cells in the zzso zzso 

Our findings demonstrate that distinct combinations of signals promote zzso recruitment to the liver, suggesting the possibility of novel targets to zzso liver inflammation in zzso Certain features of zzso zzso are maintained in zzso recruitment to the liver, suggesting that therapeutic targets for zzso recruitment may also prevent zzso zzso zzso
