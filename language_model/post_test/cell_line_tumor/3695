zzso release a number of zzso that are potentially toxic to nerve zzso However, in a number of inflammatory conditions, such as asthma and inflammatory zzso disease, it has been shown that zzso zzso to nerves, and this is associated with enhanced nerve zzso In in zzso studies, we have shown that zzso zzso via zzso zzso leads to zzso of zzso zzso via an zzso zzso In this study, we tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso to nerves promotes neural survival by protection from zzso zzso Exposure of differentiated zzso zzso nerve cells to zzso zzso and zzso or culture in zzso zzso induced zzso zzso as detected by zzso V zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso zzso of human zzso to zzso nerve cells completely prevented all these features of zzso The mechanism of protection by zzso was by an zzso zzso of zzso which led to the induced expression of the zzso gene zzso zzso to nerve cells did not influence the expression of the related genes zzso and zzso Thus, prevention of zzso by zzso may be a mechanism by which these cells regulate neural plasticity in the peripheral nervous zzso
