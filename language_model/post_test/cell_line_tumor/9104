To study on the zzso effect of combining zzso gene with suicide gene therapy zzso for zzso zzso 

zzso was zzso into zzso zzso cells at zzso of zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso then zzso was zzso to zzso zzso cells of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, at zzso of zzso The zzso zzso cells zzso with both zzso and zzso were exposed to various concentration of zzso The cell survival rate was measured by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso model was established by injecting 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso cells into right zzso nucleus of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were injected into zzso on day 5 and 6, zzso On day 7, zzso zzso was zzso zzso at 15 zzso for 14 zzso The survival time of all rats was zzso The growth of zzso tumors was monitored zzso by enhanced zzso Cell zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene was identified by in zzso zzso and expression of zzso zzso gene was detected with Western zzso 

In zzso zzso significantly enhanced zzso effect of zzso The concentration of zzso for zzso of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso was 10 times lower than that for the cells of zzso group zzso zzso zzso while the concentration of zzso for zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was 100 and 10 times lower than that for the cells of zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells also could be induced by zzso with zzso gene zzso For in zzso study, the survival time of zzso rats treated with zzso or zzso combined with zzso was significantly prolonged and the zzso tumors were zzso and disappeared earlier in the combined gene therapy group than those in the zzso therapy group as shown in enhanced zzso However, only half dose of zzso for the rats treated with both zzso and zzso was needed to obtain the same efficacy as those rats treated with zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso of zzso zzso the effect of zzso zzso 

The combination of zzso system with zzso gene zzso is optimal for clinical therapeutic trials of suicide gene therapy for zzso zzso
