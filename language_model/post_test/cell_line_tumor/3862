zzso are initiated as a result of changes that occur in the zzso Identification of gains and losses in the structure and expression of zzso genes and zzso lies at the root of the understanding of cancer cell zzso Here, we show that the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso suppresses the growth of breast cancer, in which it varies in copy zzso A pervasive loss of zzso gene copy number in patients with breast cancer is associated with an impairment of zzso expression and protein level in zzso zzso To assess the functional role of zzso in breast cancer, we showed in an animal model that zzso activity is required for suppression of tumor zzso Active zzso enhanced expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso leading to increased zzso arrest in zzso phase of the cell zzso Our results reveal the functional significance of zzso as a tumor zzso and improve understanding of the dynamic role of the zzso zzso in tumor zzso
