zzso zzso zzso with modifications on the basic side chain region were prepared and evaluated for zzso activity in both in zzso and in zzso zzso The compounds generally maintained a high degree of selectivity for zzso over zzso similar to the original lead compound zzso Many of the compounds also maintained high potency in the zzso of human zzso zzso cell zzso However, all were less potent in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso This work demonstrates the sensitive nature of modification to the zzso basic side chain zzso
