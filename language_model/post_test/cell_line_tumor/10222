zzso zzso are the most frequent and zzso brain tumors in zzso zzso zzso are routinely used in the treatment of zzso for their capacity to reduce the zzso zzso Few in zzso studies have suggested that zzso inhibit the migration and invasion of zzso cells through the induction of zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso migration zzso factor zzso an zzso zzso zzso is zzso in zzso Recently, zzso has been involved in tumor growth and zzso and specific zzso zzso have been developed on their capacity to block its zzso zzso activity zzso In this study, we characterized several zzso cell lines for their zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were selected for their very low zzso levels of zzso We showed that zzso zzso the migration and invasion of zzso zzso cells, through a zzso zzso zzso dependent zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso increases zzso zzso migration and invasion through the stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and that this zzso is zzso zzso Finally, we used the zzso zzso zzso cells that are resistant to zzso and produce high levels of zzso zzso and showed that the specific zzso inhibitor zzso could restore zzso sensitivity in these zzso zzso our results indicate an intricate zzso between zzso expression and zzso zzso They suggest that zzso zzso could increase the response of zzso to zzso
