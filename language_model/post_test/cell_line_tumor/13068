A series of novel zzso zzso oxide zzso derivatives of zzso acid zzso were zzso zzso and evaluated for their in zzso zzso against human zzso zzso zzso and zzso liver zzso Five zzso hybrids, zzso zzso and zzso displayed potent zzso against zzso cells zzso zzso zzso against zzso cells and zzso zzso against zzso zzso but had a little effect on the growth of zzso cells, indicating that these compounds had selective zzso against zzso zzso Furthermore, these compounds produced high zzso of NO in zzso cells, but low in zzso cells and treatment with zzso partially reduced the zzso of the hybrid in zzso zzso Apparently, the high zzso of NO produced by NO donor zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso contribute to the zzso but the NO is a major player against zzso cells in zzso zzso our findings may aid in the design of new zzso zzso for the intervention of human zzso at zzso
