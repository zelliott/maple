zzso zzso is an aggressive brain tumor with a poor zzso The zzso zzso cells zzso represent a rare fraction of human zzso cells with the capacity for zzso zzso zzso and exact zzso of the original zzso Interestingly, zzso are more zzso compared with other tumor zzso In addition, the remarkable zzso of zzso has been known to promote zzso failure and therefore is associated with a significantly higher risk of a local tumor zzso Moreover, the zzso cell cycle checkpoint zzso zzso 1 and 2 play a pivotal role in the DNA damage response including radiation and chemical zzso Based on zzso we hypothesized that zzso of zzso or zzso might zzso zzso on zzso and thereby increases the efficiency of zzso In this study, we knocked down the expression of zzso or zzso in human zzso using zzso short hairpin zzso zzso to examine its effect on the zzso After radiation, the zzso rate and the cell cycle of zzso were measured with zzso zzso Compared with control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso arrest, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso increased the zzso rate zzso zzso zzso and decreased the degree of the zzso arrest zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso was not enhanced by zzso zzso in zzso These results suggest that depletion of zzso may improve the zzso of zzso via inducing cell zzso In zzso the therapy targeting zzso gene in the zzso may be a novel way to treat zzso
