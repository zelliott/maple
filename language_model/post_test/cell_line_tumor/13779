zzso zzso is a pediatric tumor that arises from muscle precursor zzso zzso cells express several markers of early zzso zzso but they fail to complete both differentiation program and cell cycle arrest, resulting in uncontrolled proliferation and incomplete zzso Previous studies showed that zzso which is involved in both differentiation and cancer zzso is zzso in zzso but a functional binding between its expression and its functional role in tumor formation or progression has not yet been zzso We hypothesized that zzso is a key regulator of muscular differentiation program in zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrated that zzso directly binds muscle specific genes in zzso zzso zzso of zzso promotes the recruitment of a zzso complex at zzso zzso their zzso zzso and protein zzso Moreover, we demonstrated that zzso is directly involved in zzso repression of zzso the main factor promoting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the recovery of its binding on zzso zzso
