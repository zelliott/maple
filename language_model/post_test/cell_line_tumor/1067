The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in a variety of zzso and pathological zzso in particular, zzso zzso is zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso and its level of expression is zzso correlated with patients' zzso To determine the role of zzso in the zzso properties of zzso we successfully zzso zzso by zzso interference zzso technology, in an zzso cell line at high level of zzso zzso zzso is a zzso process involving generation of small interfering zzso zzso that cause specific zzso of the target zzso zzso cells were zzso with a zzso promoter zzso coding for an zzso composed of two identical zzso sequence motifs in an zzso orientation, separated by a zzso zzso to form a hairpin zzso capable of zzso target zzso zzso zzso zzso cells showed a consistently decreased level of zzso zzso In biological zzso zzso zzso cells showed a reduction of migration, invasion, and zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso by zzso technology decreases the invasive capability of zzso cells, demonstrating that stable expression of zzso zzso could potentially be an experimental approach for zzso gene zzso
