We previously characterized the zinc finger protein gene zzso zzso known as zzso zzso finger protein zzso and demonstrated its important roles in zzso and zzso differentiation of zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated its effect on zzso and zzso differentiation of zzso zzso zzso zzso We observed zzso of zzso during zzso and zzso differentiation of the zzso zzso and demonstrated that zzso promotes zzso and zzso differentiation by zzso and zzso zzso Using a zzso reporter and zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated to bind to the zzso gene promoter and inhibit its expression in zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso the expression of the zzso gene in zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso decreased levels of the zzso protein were observed following zzso and zzso differentiation of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso partially rescued the differentiation zzso caused by zzso zzso The zzso of zzso also blocked the activity of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso and reduced further the level of zzso zzso family zzso zzso factor with zzso motif 1), a zzso of zzso zzso protein 1) transcription, which finally zzso the expression of zzso a central regulator of zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion the results of the present study demonstrate that zzso plays an important role in zzso and zzso via its regulation of the zzso zzso
