zzso is a zzso finger zzso factor that zzso gene expression and regulates zzso In this report, we further characterize the domain of zzso necessary for zzso We show that zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso complex zzso and confirm the functionality of the zzso zzso complex by showing that the complex possesses zzso zzso zzso is involved in global zzso repression and regulation of specific zzso zzso The mechanism by which zzso zzso proteins associate with zzso is not well zzso We have identified a highly zzso zzso acid motif in the zzso factor zzso that is sufficient for the recruitment of zzso Single zzso acid zzso defined the critical zzso acid zzso motif as zzso This motif probably exhibits a more general role in regulating gene zzso since other proteins containing this domain, including all zzso family members and an unrelated zinc finger protein zzso mediate zzso repression and associate with zzso These results also have important implications for the zzso of zzso a syndrome caused by zzso zzso
