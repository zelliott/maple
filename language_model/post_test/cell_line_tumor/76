zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso tumor cells under zzso conditions results in a substantial zzso zzso zzso reduction in cell volume within 25 zzso The cell shrinkage is paralleled by net loss of zzso which was significant within 8 zzso whereas no zzso increase in the zzso or zzso zzso could be zzso The zzso cell shrinkage was unaffected by the presence of zzso and zzso which blocks zzso and zzso zzso channels, respectively, and is unaffected by a raise in zzso zzso concentration to a value that eliminates the zzso driving force for zzso On the other hand, the zzso cell shrinkage was impaired in the presence of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso acid zzso following substitution of zzso for zzso and when the driving force for zzso zzso was zzso It is suggested that zzso activates zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso tumor cells and not zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso exposed cells zzso the regulatory volume decrease and the zzso net loss of zzso whereas no additional increase in the zzso and zzso zzso was zzso The effect of zzso on cell volume was blocked by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso A, indicating an important role of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, addition of zzso to adherent cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, a zzso of the zzso zzso tumor cells, and zzso mouse zzso increased the zzso and zzso zzso after zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and zzso channels in zzso and adherent cells, zzso
