The zzso zzso is strongly implicated in breast cancer progression but the role of this zzso in the biology of breast cancer zzso cells has not been zzso Recent attention has focused on targeting the zzso 2 zzso zzso downstream of the zzso zzso by blocking the activities of individual zzso E zzso zzso zzso E zzso 4 zzso is widely expressed in primary invasive zzso zzso of the breast and zzso this zzso with small zzso zzso or zzso directed to zzso zzso zzso potential in both zzso and zzso zzso Breast cancer zzso cells are defined as a zzso of cells that drive tumor growth, zzso treatment resistance, and zzso zzso breast cancer cells of human zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso origin of zzso zzso zzso and/or with heightened zzso capacity zzso expression of both zzso and zzso and are more zzso compared to the bulk zzso In contrast, zzso or zzso counterparts zzso zzso zzso do not increase zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso gene zzso but not with a zzso inhibitor zzso reduces both zzso capacity and the expression of zzso markers zzso zzso zzso of breast cancer stem zzso Finally, an orally delivered zzso zzso zzso reduces the zzso capacity and markedly zzso both the size of tumors arising from transplantation of zzso cells and zzso markers of stem cells in zzso These studies support the continued investigation of zzso as a potential therapeutic target and provide new insight regarding the role of zzso in supporting a breast cancer stem zzso zzso
