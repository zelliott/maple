A zzso zzso zzso zzso tailored to target zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso cells, was developed to promote the efficiency of zzso delivery of zzso through zzso zzso zzso were prepared by zzso film zzso and an ultrasound zzso zzso zzso zzso with affinity for the zzso zzso was chemically coupled to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso via a zzso bond and subsequently inserted into zzso zzso zzso The zzso was characterized in terms of its size, zzso density, drug zzso and leakage zzso The targeting nature and zzso effects of the zzso were evaluated in zzso using cultured zzso breast cancer zzso A protein zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso surface indicated that more than zzso of the zzso peptides were inserted into the zzso zzso Up to zzso zzso of stable zzso zzso loading was zzso with approximately zzso of this being zzso within the zzso In zzso cell culture studies revealed that the zzso zzso bound to their target cells had significantly higher affinity and better zzso efficiency than generic zzso zzso These events were presumed to occur through specific interactions of the zzso with its zzso receptors on the cell zzso It was concluded that the targeting properties of the delivery system would potentially improve the therapeutic benefits of zzso as compared with zzso zzso
