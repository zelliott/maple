A zzso bearing a zzso replication initiation region zzso and a zzso attachment region zzso was previously shown to be efficiently amplified to high copy number in zzso cells and to generate zzso zzso zzso regions zzso The amplification mechanism was suggested to entail a head-on collision at the zzso between the zzso machinery and the hypothetical replication fork arriving from the zzso leading to double strand breakage zzso that triggered zzso zzso The experiments described here show that such plasmids are stabilized if zzso involving not only zzso zzso but also zzso zzso are avoided, and stable plasmids appeared to persist as zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso sequence that promotes zzso generation may zzso to the sequence that supports replication initiation zzso Thus, we developed a zzso stability zzso that sensitively detects the activity of zzso generation in a test zzso The zzso was used to dissect two zzso regions, derived from the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso minimum sequences that efficiently promoted zzso generation were zzso They included several sequence zzso most of which coincided with reported zzso zzso These data and this zzso will benefit studies of replication initiation and applications that depend on zzso zzso
