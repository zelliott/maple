A series of zzso bearing various zzso has been zzso and the effects of zzso on the metabolism of the zzso by zzso human zzso zzso zzso was zzso A range of zzso were selected for study, and were specifically designed to probe the effects of zzso zzso at zzso A range of 28 zzso zzso was prepared using three general zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso the classical zzso synthesis and the zzso reaction of zzso One example of an zzso 30 was also prepared, and the reduction zzso of the zzso were measured by zzso zzso For simple zzso zzso at the zzso zzso the rates of zzso metabolism by zzso decrease for zzso approximately zzso For aromatic zzso the rate of reduction decreases dramatically for zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso are the best zzso and the rates decrease as zzso The toxicity toward human colon zzso cells with either no zzso activity zzso or zzso or high zzso activity zzso or zzso was also studied in representative zzso zzso that are good zzso for zzso are more toxic to the zzso containing or expressing cell lines zzso and zzso than the zzso deficient cell lines zzso and zzso
