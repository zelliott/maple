zzso is known to enhance the survival of zzso cancer patients, though the mechanisms involved are incompletely zzso zzso modes of action include blocking the zzso effect of tumors and zzso T zzso cell activity, both of which are thought to be zzso by zzso type 2 zzso zzso cell death may offer an alternative explanation for reduced cell zzso We aimed to examine the effects of zzso zzso and zzso on in zzso proliferation and zzso in two human zzso cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso A cell proliferation zzso was used as an index of cell zzso zzso zzso status was determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso via DNA zzso zzso show that zzso zzso to zzso zzso had no effect on the growth of either cell zzso The proliferation of zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso alone and in combination with zzso zzso zzso zzso only suppressed the growth of zzso in the presence of zzso The zzso zzso had no effect on zzso irrespective of zzso There was no zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells in response to zzso at a similar zzso zzso was induced in zzso by both zzso drugs, and only zzso caused zzso cell death in zzso zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso inhibit zzso cancer cells in zzso independently of the zzso zzso In addition, both drugs induce zzso in the same cell zzso Growth zzso and zzso are likely to contribute to the tumor zzso properties of zzso and zzso in zzso
