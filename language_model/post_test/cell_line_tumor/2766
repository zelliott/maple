zzso B virus zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso cells causes a moderate decrease in zzso activity of the zzso A highly zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor domain within 154 zzso acid zzso of zzso has been zzso In this study, a zzso chain derived from the zzso domain zzso was used to study its effect on the cell cycle and zzso of zzso cells, and investigated the function of zzso on the activities of zzso and zzso zzso which involves in the zzso protein degradation zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso was chemically zzso zzso zzso were used to determine the effects of zzso on zzso cell zzso Mouse zzso zzso was developed for Western zzso to detect the expression of zzso zzso activity of zzso was measured using a zzso zzso zzso activities of zzso were analyzed with various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso cell cycle phase and zzso 

zzso of zzso cells decreased in a zzso zzso zzso exhibited significant zzso in the presence of 15 zzso of zzso Western zzso analysis showed that expression of zzso was suppressed in zzso cells treated with zzso compared to zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso from zzso of zzso cells zzso with zzso was apparently zzso zzso activity of zzso in zzso cells was significantly inhibited by 10 zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso were less inhibited by zzso than zzso zzso The cell cycle phase of zzso cells treated with zzso for 36 hours was blocked largely at the zzso phase, while zzso control cells were mainly in S zzso zzso also significantly induced zzso 

The zzso derived from zzso domain of zzso protein zzso zzso cell growth arrest and zzso which may result from zzso of zzso zzso and decrease of both the zzso and zzso activities of zzso
