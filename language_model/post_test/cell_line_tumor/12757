As part of zzso bone surgery, according to the principles of tissue engineering and zzso the use of zzso aims to restore bone deficiencies by restoring both functionality and original zzso of the bone zzso Besides being zzso zzso and zzso the ideal scaffolding should possess an zzso zzso which depends on many zzso characteristics and, in particular, on a three-dimensional zzso and the placement of zzso which would determine pore size and zzso between zzso The purpose of this study was, therefore, to carry out an analysis with a scanning electron zzso in order to evaluate the effect of the diameter size of the scaffold pores on the zzso interaction between zzso zzso cells and four zzso with different pore zzso zzso acid, zzso bovine bone, zzso bone, zzso bone zzso zzso 

Through the observations made with zzso and X-ray zzso it is possible to zzso how the zzso the zzso ability, the zzso of zzso and the differentiation of zzso cells are influenced in different ways by the porous structure of the various zzso used as a zzso for zzso 

From among all of the zzso zzso zzso represented the best zzso for zzso in fact, there would be a more intense and precocious zzso of zzso zzso 

The strong zzso effect observed in human zzso seems to be related to the presence of the organic zzso while the zzso effect would be mainly attributed to the presence of zzso
