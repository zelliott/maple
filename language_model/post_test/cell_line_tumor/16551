Since the 7th amendment to the zzso cosmetics directive foresees a complete ban on animal testing, alternative in zzso methods have been established to evaluate the zzso potential of small molecular weight zzso To find out whether these novel in zzso zzso are also capable to predict the zzso potential of small molecular weight drugs, model compounds such as zzso and zzso - which are the most frequent cause of adverse drug reactions - were zzso with zzso zzso or primary zzso zzso cells for 48 h and subsequent expression of selected marker genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was studied by real time zzso zzso and zzso were recognized as zzso compounds because they are capable to induce the zzso expression of these genes in zzso and, except for zzso in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso zzso the expression of some marker genes in zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not affect the expression of these genes in zzso however, in zzso at least zzso was enhanced and there was an increase of the release of zzso These data reveal that novel in zzso DC based zzso might play a role in the evaluation of the zzso potential of novel drug compounds, but these systems seem to lack the ability to detect the zzso potential of zzso that require zzso zzso prior to zzso and zzso seem to be superior with regard to the sensitivity compared with zzso and zzso cell zzso
