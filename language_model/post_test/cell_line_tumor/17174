A novel zzso zzso model of mouse prostate cancer was developed using zzso zzso zzso zzso of mouse zzso cells derived by serial passage of the parental zzso line in mouse prostate zzso zzso cells grew efficiently in mouse prostate zzso and zzso zzso to draining zzso zzso Using this model, we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dramatically inhibited growth of zzso zzso zzso tumors and the development of zzso zzso Mice remained in zzso for several months following termination of zzso treatment but eventually relapsed and died of progressive zzso zzso treatment induced a pronounced mixed inflammatory cell zzso that consisted of zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and to a lesser extent T cells zzso and zzso zzso cells isolated from zzso tumors were zzso immature zzso zzso and this zzso was also zzso in peripheral zzso of mice treated with zzso alone or in combination with the DC maturation factor, zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso was also observed on zzso T cells, although these signaling proteins were zzso following in zzso culture with zzso The zzso complex remained intact on peripheral T cells except in mice treated with zzso where zzso loss was zzso In contrast to zzso cells, zzso zzso cells maintained expression of their zzso receptors but not zzso Thus, zzso tumors quickly establish a zzso that profoundly diminishes expression of molecules critical for normal zzso cell and T cell function, thus limiting the efficacy of zzso and zzso zzso Overall, these data suggest that long-term cures of established zzso tumors may not be achieved until therapeutic interventions are engineered to overcome this zzso zzso
