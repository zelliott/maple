zzso zzso an zzso that zzso zzso to form zzso has a role in regulating insulin zzso and proliferation in beta zzso zzso zzso zzso have been developed as new therapies for type 2 zzso In this study, we evaluated the proliferation and zzso actions of zzso a novel and potent zzso in zzso pancreatic zzso zzso treatment increased cell numbers at 3 zzso zzso via zzso of insulin zzso zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso zzso B zzso zzso also increased zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso by increasing zzso These zzso effects of zzso were attenuated by zzso zzso Moreover, zzso reduced zzso cells and expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced by zzso zzso inhibited zzso signaling via induction of zzso content, zzso membrane potential, and zzso zzso activity and was correlated with changes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso also increased interaction between zzso and zzso zzso channel zzso Our results suggest that the novel zzso zzso promotes beta cell growth and prevents zzso beta cell zzso zzso zzso may provide a therapy that compensates for beta cell loss in patients with type 2 zzso
