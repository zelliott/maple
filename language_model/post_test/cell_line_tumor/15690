zzso zzso protein 1) activity is strongly induced in response to numerous signals, including growth factors, zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso belongs to the zzso group of zzso factors and it is a crucial regulator of zzso zzso proliferation and zzso An important mechanism of zzso stimulation is zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain increases target gene transcription, but a molecular explanation was zzso Here we show that zzso but not zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso and thereby recruits the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso depletion in colon cancer cells increased zzso zzso at zzso zzso which resulted in increased target gene zzso The zzso stem cell marker zzso was identified as a novel target gene controlled by zzso zzso conditional deletion of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and increased zzso cell zzso In response to zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso and zzso mice showed markedly increased zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a single zzso of zzso reverted zzso and pathological zzso as well as the increased zzso in zzso zzso Thus the zzso domain of zzso recruits zzso to zzso target genes to mediate gene repression, and this repression is relieved by zzso zzso zzso zzso
