As described for a long time, zzso zzso cells form a polarized zzso in culture, whereas zzso cells are zzso and zzso but can form a polarized zzso when cultured in a zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso and zzso gene zzso as an index, we have studied the relationship between the differentiation state and the cell response to zzso We found that differentiated zzso and zzso cells were responsive to both zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso but that zzso zzso cells were unresponsive to zzso However, the expression of zzso zzso and zzso genes was zzso by these zzso in either cell lines differentiated or zzso zzso of zzso gene occurred when zzso or zzso was added to the zzso but not zzso surface of the differentiated zzso Finally, it appeared that in polarized zzso cells, the zzso zzso of zzso was connected to zzso zzso
