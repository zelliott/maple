The family of zzso proteins plays an important role in cancer biology by interfering with zzso zzso pathways and cell cycle zzso The zzso zzso acts as a tumor zzso and is often zzso during tumor zzso 

Here, we demonstrate enhanced zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso and zzso melanoma zzso compared with primary tumors, associated with dramatically reduced zzso zzso In line with this, treatment of different zzso melanoma cell lines with zzso zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso significantly zzso zzso protein zzso Additional treatment with zzso zzso inhibitor zzso acid zzso further enhances zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso treatment leads to almost complete zzso of cell zzso with cells predominantly arrested in zzso The zzso effect of zzso was reversed in zzso zzso zzso Similarly, melanoma cell lines zzso zzso zzso show dramatically reduced cell proliferation zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso zzso cells do not progress through cell cycle, but display a permanent increase in the population of zzso DNA containing zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso zzso zzso of melanoma cells and is involved in melanoma cell zzso under zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso supports migratory capacity of melanoma cells in zzso while zzso zzso has opposing zzso 

Taken together, the present report indicates that zzso zzso of zzso might contribute to tumor progression in zzso melanoma via loss of cell cycle control, impaired cellular zzso program and support of migratory zzso
