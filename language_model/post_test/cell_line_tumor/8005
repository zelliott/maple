Female zzso nude mice (age 4-6 weeks, zzso were zzso with 200,000 zzso zzso zzso cells by injection into the left zzso Animals were immediately zzso by zzso technique and placed into one of the following therapy groups: zzso zzso zzso + zzso acid, zzso zzso + zzso acid, or zzso acid zzso zzso zzso were given at 200 zzso and zzso acid 5 zzso with mice treated biweekly for zzso weeks and zzso zzso 

Combination therapy containing either zzso or zzso with zzso acid significantly reduced the number of secondary zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared to saline treated controls zzso zzso as assessed by zzso imaging ( zzso Additionally, zzso with zzso resulted in a significant reduction in tumor number zzso zzso zzso compared to control zzso Total body tumor burden over time were significantly less in groups treated with zzso and zzso + zzso acid combination as compared with the saline control zzso At day 33, both combination therapies and zzso acid zzso provided significant reduction in total tumor burden and tumor zzso of zzso by zzso ( zzso
