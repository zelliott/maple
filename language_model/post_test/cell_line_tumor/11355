zzso viruses zzso tumor cells in tissue culture but not against the same tumors in zzso We report that zzso can induce a powerfully protective zzso state in zzso and breast tumors, rendering them resistant to zzso zzso These tumors have activated zzso pathways and expression of zzso genes zzso is zzso Gene expression profiling zzso of human primary zzso and breast tumors confirmed zzso zzso of zzso The tumors were heavily infiltrated with zzso zzso Exposure of zzso tumor cell lines to zzso media from zzso or primary zzso activated zzso zzso zzso signaling and an zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies show that this effect is zzso by an extremely low concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso reversed the zzso zzso zzso This study points to a new role for zzso zzso in the induction of a zzso zzso state that shields tumors from viral zzso
