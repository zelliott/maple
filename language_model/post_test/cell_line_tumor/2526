zzso diseases such as Alzheimer's disease zzso should be more efficiently tackled by drugs which hit multiple biological targets involved in their zzso We have recently developed a new family of zzso zzso rationally designed to hit multiple targets involved upstream and downstream in the zzso cascade of zzso namely zzso zzso and formation as well as zzso zzso zzso 

In this study, the aim was to expand the pharmacological profiling of zzso zzso investigating their effect on zzso zzso receptors as well as their zzso effects against an zzso zzso 

zzso rat zzso zzso were used to assess the specific binding of two selected compounds in competition with 1 zzso zzso (for zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso (for zzso zzso For zzso studies, zzso cell cultures were subjected to 250 zzso hydrogen zzso insult with or without zzso with some zzso zzso 

A low zzso affinity and zzso selectivity has been found for the selected zzso zzso zzso are not zzso to zzso cells at a range of zzso from 1 to zzso zzso and some of them can protect cells from the zzso damage produced by hydrogen zzso at zzso as low as zzso zzso 

Even though it remains to be determined if these compounds act as zzso at zzso zzso as it is the case of the parent zzso Y, their low zzso zzso affinity and zzso effects expand their zzso profile and increase their interest as zzso zzso zzso
