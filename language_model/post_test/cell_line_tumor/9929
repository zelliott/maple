The complexity and zzso of the plasma zzso have presented significant challenges in the identification of protein changes associated with tumor zzso We used cell culture as a model system and identified zzso zzso zzso proteins which may constitute zzso zzso A stable isotope labeling by zzso acids in cell culture zzso approach was used to label the entire zzso zzso of the zzso zzso colon cancer cell line and normal young adult mouse colon zzso cell line, thereby creating a stable isotope labeled zzso zzso zzso This zzso standard was added to zzso zzso zzso colon cancer cell or normal zzso zzso colon zzso cell zzso zzso zzso A zzso approach combining zzso focusing zzso strong zzso exchange zzso followed by reversed phase liquid zzso was used for extensive protein and zzso zzso A total of zzso and zzso proteins were identified from the zzso and zzso cell lines, with zzso proteins common to both cell zzso Twenty highly abundant zzso expressed proteins from these groups were selected for liquid zzso reaction zzso zzso zzso analysis in zzso zzso zzso into the serum was observed for several proteins when zzso mice were compared with control zzso These findings were then confirmed by Western zzso zzso
