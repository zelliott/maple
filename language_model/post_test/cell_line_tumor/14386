zzso zzso a hallmark of cancer, has profound effects on zzso and tumor zzso We used a panel of 60 human cancer cell lines (the zzso as a model system to identify relationships among DNA copy number, zzso expression level, and drug zzso For each of 64 zzso zzso we calculated all zzso possible zzso correlation zzso relating DNA copy number zzso by comparative zzso zzso using bacterial artificial zzso zzso and zzso expression level zzso using both zzso and zzso zzso zzso The analysis identified an association of zzso zzso with zzso copy number, a finding supported by data from human tumors and a mouse model of zzso zzso When we examined the correlation between DNA copy number for all 353 unique zzso on the bacterial artificial zzso zzso and drug sensitivity for 118 drugs with zzso known mechanisms of action, we found a striking negative correlation zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso between activity of the zzso drug zzso and DNA copy number of genes near zzso zzso in the zzso cancer zzso Previous analysis of drug sensitivity and zzso expression had suggested an inverse relationship between zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso sensitivity in the zzso The zzso of zzso findings at the DNA and zzso levels strongly suggests further study of zzso for possible treatment of a zzso subset of clinical zzso zzso The DNA copy number database presented here will enable other investigators to explore DNA zzso relationships in their own zzso of research zzso
