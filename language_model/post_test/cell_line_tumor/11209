zzso and transgenic mouse models are important tools for the study of the biology of zzso While zzso mouse models are generated through the zzso in host animals of tumor cells from genetically and zzso compatible donors, transgenic mouse models are engineered to express genetic material with zzso properties in predetermined zzso We have developed a zzso mouse model of zzso cancer permitting in zzso imaging in zzso recipients by zzso zzso with zzso labeled cancer cells that derived from a spontaneous zzso tumor developing in a transgenic mouse zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso with a zzso fluorescent zzso This animal model combines the advantages of zzso and transgenic mouse models as it permits to both monitor tumor growth by in zzso imaging and to analyze the tumor zzso of an zzso zzso
