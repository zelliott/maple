Marine environment has frequently afforded a variety of biologically active compounds with strong zzso and zzso zzso In the present study, the mechanism of action of zzso B, an zzso zzso isolated from the marine sponge zzso zzso was zzso zzso B was able to zzso and zzso decrease the viability of zzso zzso and human zzso melanoma zzso On these cells, zzso B treatment triggered cell death by typical zzso as illustrated by zzso zzso the release of zzso c and zzso zzso These effects were associated with increased zzso zzso levels zzso to zzso zzso zzso Indeed, zzso B exposure strongly inhibited the activity of zzso zzso zzso an zzso that converts de zzso zzso into the membrane zzso zzso Moreover, whereas zzso zzso cell death was enhanced in zzso cells, it was strongly inhibited in cells that zzso zzso human zzso Finally, the zzso effects of zzso B truncated zzso were also shown to be dependent on zzso zzso Altogether, zzso B is able to kill melanoma cells by acting on zzso activity and consequently on zzso formation, and may represent a new class of zzso compounds with potential applications in zzso melanoma zzso
