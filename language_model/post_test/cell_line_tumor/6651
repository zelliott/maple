zzso zzso is an zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso chains of zzso zzso and its expression has been associated with increased cell growth, invasion, and zzso of tumors as well as with zzso and tissue zzso Since zzso cancer cells express zzso we have developed an zzso brain slice model to study zzso involvement in zzso zzso This model allows for the characterization of tumor cell invasion at both quantitative and qualitative zzso zzso melanoma cells zzso showed zzso levels of zzso protein expression in a zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso showed a significant increase in the number of cells that invaded into the brain zzso Finally, zzso zzso invasion depth in brain sections by zzso melanoma zzso We concluded that applying this brain slice model can be beneficial to investigate zzso related in zzso zzso in zzso melanoma and brain invasion in zzso These results also further emphasize the potential relevance of using this model to design therapies for controlling this type of cancer by blocking zzso zzso
