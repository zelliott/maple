zzso zzso gene expression profiling analysis has shown that zzso zzso high mobility group zzso box 4) is one of the most zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso relative to zzso tissue of zzso Here, we show that zzso protein is similarly zzso in zzso by zzso of 28 primary zzso and 20 normal zzso To zzso the functional significance of these findings, zzso interference zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso zzso expression in the zzso cell line, zzso With confirmed zzso of zzso zzso cell viability was reduced by zzso with a corresponding increase of zzso to zzso as compared to zzso in zzso zzso was confirmed by cell zzso DNA fragmentation and flow zzso zzso could be rescued from the zzso effects of zzso zzso by zzso with a construct expressing functional zzso zzso gene expression profiling of zzso zzso experiments shows that zzso of zzso expression of critical genes involved in zzso and cell cycle zzso Overall, our findings suggest that zzso contributes to the zzso zzso of zzso cells by promoting cell zzso
