zzso is an zzso zzso predominantly expressed on zzso cells zzso to which zzso targeting has been shown to induce robust zzso immune zzso To facilitate targeted delivery of tumor zzso to zzso we generated fusion proteins consisting of the zzso domain of human zzso or its rat zzso zzso fused to the zzso zzso variable specific for zzso zzso 

zzso of cellular and zzso immune responses and zzso activity of the fusion proteins zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso were tested in zzso zzso zzso tumor models and in transgenic zzso mice developing spontaneous zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso mice with zzso protected mice from subsequent challenge with zzso but not zzso zzso breast tumor cells, accompanied by induction of strong zzso zzso and zzso zzso In a therapeutic setting, injection of zzso caused rejection of established zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of such a fusion protein vaccine could be reproduced in zzso zzso mice, where zzso vaccination significantly protected against a subsequent challenge with zzso zzso breast tumor cells and markedly delayed the onset of spontaneous zzso zzso 

zzso protein vaccines for in zzso delivery of tumor zzso to zzso induce potent immune responses and zzso activities and provide a rationale for further development of this approach for cancer zzso
