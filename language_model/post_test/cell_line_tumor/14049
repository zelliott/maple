The zzso expressed molecular zzso zzso (78 zzso zzso zzso generally zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso is specifically induced in cells under the zzso zzso protein zzso which can be zzso by treatments with calcium zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso By using zzso zzso we have demonstrated that zzso was concentrated in the zzso region and zzso with the zzso marker zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in cells under normal growth zzso However, treatments with zzso and zzso led to diminish its zzso zzso resulting in zzso into a zzso zzso pattern, and overlapping with the zzso marker zzso Cellular zzso and zzso zzso of isolated zzso from zzso cells suggested that a significant portion of zzso is localized to the zzso and is zzso zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso were confirmed by using zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso mainly localized within the zzso and decorated the zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso studies indicated further that the zzso zzso is mainly located in the zzso space, inner membrane and zzso but is not associated with the outer zzso Furthermore, radioactive zzso followed by zzso zzso showed that a significant portion of the newly zzso zzso is localized to the zzso in cells under zzso Taken together, our results indicate that, at least under certain circumstances, the zzso zzso zzso can be zzso to zzso and thereby may be involved in zzso zzso zzso between these two zzso
