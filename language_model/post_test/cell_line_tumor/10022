The zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso gene involved in the regulation of cellular zzso levels plays an important role in different cellular processes including cell growth and zzso zzso expression of zzso has been found in a number of human solid tumors including zzso cell zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso is associated with tumor progression and an altered von zzso zzso gene zzso 

To determine the underlying mechanisms for the zzso zzso expression pattern in zzso the zzso promoter DNA zzso status was determined in 17 zzso cell lines as well as in 32 zzso zzso and corresponding tumor adjacent kidney zzso using combined zzso restriction analysis as well as zzso DNA zzso 

zzso expression was found in all 32 tumor adjacent kidney zzso zzso However, the lack of or reduced zzso zzso and/or protein expression was detected in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines and due to either a total or partial zzso of the zzso promoter zzso Upon zzso treatment an induction of zzso zzso and protein expression was found in zzso zzso cell lines, which was linked to the zzso degree of the zzso promoter zzso 

zzso zzso represents a mechanism for the zzso of the zzso gene expression in zzso and supports the concept of an zzso control for the expression of zzso during disease zzso
