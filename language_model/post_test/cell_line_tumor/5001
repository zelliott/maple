zzso are human dietary components that have been linked to the prevention of cancer in adults and the generation of specific types of leukemia in zzso While these compounds have a broad range of cellular activities, many of their zzso effects have been attributed to their actions as zzso II zzso However, the activities of zzso against the individual zzso of human zzso II have not been zzso zzso we characterized the activity and mechanism of action of three major classes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso against human zzso zzso and zzso zzso was the most active zzso tested and zzso zzso DNA zzso approximately zzso Generally, compounds were more active against zzso zzso DNA zzso with both zzso zzso required a zzso and a zzso and was enhanced by the presence of additional zzso groups on the zzso zzso Competition DNA zzso and zzso II binding studies indicate that the zzso group plays an important role in zzso zzso zzso while the zzso zzso contributes primarily to zzso zzso zzso do not require zzso cycling for activity and function primarily by zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso studies suggest that the zzso region of zzso II plays a role in zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso and zzso with activity against zzso zzso zzso and zzso enhanced DNA zzso by both zzso in human zzso leukemia zzso These data support the hypothesis that zzso function as zzso II poisons in humans and provide a framework for further analysis of these important dietary zzso
