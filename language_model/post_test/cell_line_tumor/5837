Human zzso zzso 1 zzso is involved in cell proliferation and zzso in a broad variety of different cancer zzso Due to its crucial role in zzso zzso is a potential target for diagnostic and therapeutic zzso zzso zzso can specifically interact with the zzso domain zzso of zzso a zzso located zzso binding zzso Recently, zzso zzso has been identified as zzso with high binding zzso However, a zzso version of this zzso showed only insufficient cellular zzso The present study investigated zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso The new zzso demonstrate superior zzso in different cancer zzso compared to the zzso zzso Furthermore, we could demonstrate binding of zzso zzso to zzso of zzso making the compounds interesting leads for the development of molecular zzso for imaging zzso in zzso
