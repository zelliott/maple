zzso zzso are short zzso zzso regulators that control gene expression mainly through zzso zzso We previously identified zzso in a signature for human cervical cancer using a deep sequencing zzso In this study, we confirmed that zzso expression was frequently higher in human cervical cancer than their matched normal tissue zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso promotes cell proliferation and migration in human cervical cancer zzso To further understand the biological roles of zzso we performed in zzso zzso and zzso 2 zzso of zzso zzso complexes followed by zzso analysis zzso to identify its potential zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso experiments, we identified a set of transcripts as potential targets of zzso Several targets are functionally involved in cellular proliferation and zzso Two of them, zzso and zzso were further validated by Western zzso analysis and zzso of zzso enrichment in the zzso zzso using zzso Furthermore, both zzso and zzso were zzso in cervical cancer zzso In zzso our findings reveal novel functional roles and targets of zzso in human cervical cancer, which may provide new insights about its role in cervical zzso and its potential value for clinical zzso
