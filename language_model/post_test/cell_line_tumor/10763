zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is critical for the initiation and progression of most colon zzso This zzso provokes the zzso of nuclear zzso and the induction of its target zzso zzso mice are the most commonly used model for colon zzso They harbor a zzso zzso zzso and develop zzso zzso and zzso during the first months of zzso This zzso is caused by the zzso of the second zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of nuclear zzso in the affected zzso Here we describe that vitamin D zzso zzso is a crucial zzso of nuclear zzso levels in colon cancer in zzso By appropriate breeding of zzso mice and zzso mice we have generated animals expressing a zzso zzso zzso and two, one, or none zzso wild type zzso Lack of zzso increased the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not that of zzso or zzso in either small zzso or zzso zzso colon zzso and tumors of zzso mice had increased nuclear zzso and the tumors reached a larger size than those of zzso Both zzso and zzso in zzso mice showed higher expression of zzso target zzso In line with this, zzso zzso in cultured human colon cancer cells enhanced zzso nuclear content and target gene zzso zzso zzso depletion zzso the capacity of zzso to promote the relocation of zzso from the nucleus to the plasma membrane and to inhibit zzso target zzso In conclusion, zzso controls the level of nuclear zzso in colon cancer cells and can therefore zzso the impact of zzso zzso that activate the zzso zzso
