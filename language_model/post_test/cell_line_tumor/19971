zzso expression responds differently to changes in zzso zzso levels in mouse zzso human zzso zzso Two zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso mediate the zzso effects of zzso Using transient zzso of a human zzso zzso cell line, zzso we showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso alone had little effect on zzso promoter activity, but antagonized the zzso zzso The region from 523 to zzso zzso upstream of the zzso start site was shown to be required for the P zzso zzso of two potential zzso element zzso zzso in this region partially inhibited the zzso response, and one zzso zzso disrupted binding of both zzso and zzso to a consensus zzso in an zzso These along with other studies indicated that multiple zzso elements in the zzso to zzso region cooperate to mediate P zzso and that zzso interaction with other zzso factors in this region is zzso Using zzso zzso zzso knockout zzso zzso and zzso mice, P antagonism of zzso zzso protein and zzso expression was shown to be dependent on zzso In zzso these data show that zzso zzso stimulates zzso expression in human zzso zzso cells, whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in both human and mouse zzso zzso zzso The differential zzso response to P in these two species may be due to dissimilar expression of the two zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
