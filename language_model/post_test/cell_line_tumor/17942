zzso zzso a recently discovered urine zzso in humans, was investigated for its zzso zzso and zzso disruptive effects in the cultured human zzso cell line, zzso and Syrian zzso zzso zzso In addition, the role of zzso zzso on the zzso effects of zzso was investigated in terms of the effects of zzso depletion and the effects of zzso added zzso zzso values of zzso for cells incubated for 48 h were zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso of cell zzso reduced the zzso effects of zzso The zzso effects of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were enhanced markedly when used in combination with 1 to 3 zzso zzso but decreased again when combined with 5 zzso zzso These results suggested that zzso zzso were generated by the interaction of zzso with zzso while an excessive amount of zzso suppressed the generation of these zzso zzso showed that zzso was an zzso of cells with zzso DNA and zzso zzso zzso The results also demonstrated that cells arrested in the zzso phase had abnormalities in their zzso organization and zzso zzso In addition, cells arrested in zzso by zzso had zzso structural zzso such as zzso gaps, zzso breaks and zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso effects of zzso may in part be associated with an zzso mode of cell death that was evaluated by the appearance of zzso level DNA zzso and an zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that the presence of zzso in human urine has implications for human health in terms of zzso metabolism and zzso
