zzso zzso of cell zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso has been well studied by using the zzso imaging zzso in various zzso tumor zzso A literature survey indicated no previous use of zzso zzso as contrast agents for in zzso optical detection of tumor zzso zzso we report the zzso zzso specificity of novel zzso zzso zzso acid zzso as a contrast agent in zzso in zzso and ex zzso The zzso exhibited intermediate affinity for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso led to elevated zzso zzso on zzso tumor cells and zzso cells and produced minimal cell zzso when zzso with zzso In zzso imaging with a zzso three-dimensional zzso imaging system zzso subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso with a broad range of zzso of fluorescent probe administered via the tail zzso The intermediate dose zzso zzso produces better tumor contrast than high dose (3 zzso and low dose zzso zzso during 30 minutes to 24 hours zzso because of partial zzso of zzso tumor zzso at high dose and the presence of significant amount of background zzso at low dose, zzso The tumor contrast was also dependent on the mouse viewing zzso zzso zzso of zzso was blocked by zzso zzso This study suggests that the combination of the specificity of zzso zzso interaction with zzso zzso detection may be applied to zzso imaging of zzso expression and monitoring zzso treatment efficacy providing near real-time zzso
