Our previous studies suggest that the zzso zzso zzso and associated zzso structures are likely to be elevated during zzso An easy and reliable strategy to label zzso zzso that contain such carbohydrates can enable the identification of novel zzso that are cancer zzso To this end, the present study demonstrates that the exchange zzso property of zzso zzso can facilitate the labeling of zzso zzso in cancer cells, tumor zzso and zzso in cancer zzso zzso show that zzso the zzso zzso zzso of each of the cancer cell lines studied zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is distinct either in terms of the specific zzso presented or their relative zzso While some cell lines like zzso had only one single zzso zzso others like zzso and zzso contained a complex mixture of zzso zzso zzso zzso labeling of primary tumor cells identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso unique to pancreatic zzso zzso zzso for other zzso had higher molecular zzso zzso Studies of zzso zzso human zzso showed larger zzso zzso and zzso larger zzso chains in human serum compared to zzso labeled zzso of zzso Overall, the exchange zzso property of zzso provides an efficient avenue to identify zzso proteins for applications in zzso and cancer zzso
