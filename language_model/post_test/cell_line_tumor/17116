We investigated zzso zzso zzso activity and its expression in breast cancer cases, and evaluated the zzso significance of zzso expression in invasive breast zzso A total of 49 paired of breast cancer zzso and the adjacent normal breast zzso were evaluated in this zzso zzso expression of 191 patients with invasive breast cancer was also evaluated zzso zzso activity in breast cancer ranged from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in breast cancer zzso was significantly ( zzso higher than in adjacent normal breast zzso zzso activity was significantly higher in zzso zzso tumors than zzso zzso zzso The level of zzso activity was correlated with zzso zzso Patients with zzso zzso tumors had a significantly ( zzso poorer prognosis in zzso survival compared to those with zzso zzso When evaluated in patients treated with zzso or zzso zzso zzso expression was a significantly ( zzso poorer zzso factor in zzso and overall zzso Using a Cox zzso hazards model, zzso status, zzso status, and zzso expression were independent zzso factors for both zzso and overall zzso In conclusion, zzso expression may function as a marker of zzso activity and may be a zzso indicator for patients with breast zzso
