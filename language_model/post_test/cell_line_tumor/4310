Since avian influenza virus zzso zzso plays a key role in acute lung injury, understanding its molecular mechanism is highly desirable for discovering therapeutic targets against H5N1 zzso In the present study, we investigated the role of zzso in zzso lung inflammation by using H5N1 zzso viral particles zzso The results showed that zzso significantly induced zzso both in zzso human lung zzso cells and in mouse lung zzso which was primarily due to zzso zzso of H5N1 zzso zzso zzso with zzso (an zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso genes zzso and zzso dramatically attenuated zzso zzso zzso and zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso inflammatory responses involved the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso which required the presence of zzso but did not rely on zzso or zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso of zzso also promoted zzso zzso zzso These data indicated a positive feedback loop between zzso and zzso signaling zzso which could exacerbate zzso lung zzso Our data demonstrated an essential role of zzso in zzso inflammatory responses, and targeting the zzso zzso could be a promising strategy to treat H5N1 zzso lung zzso
