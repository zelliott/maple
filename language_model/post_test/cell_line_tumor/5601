Among the different mechanisms proposed to explain the zzso effect of dietary zzso zzso interactions with zzso zzso zzso zzso have recently been zzso In the present study, the metabolism of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as their zzso activity in zzso human breast zzso and zzso normal breast cell lines, were zzso zzso and zzso were the only conversion products of zzso and zzso metabolism by zzso family zzso respectively, while zzso itself was not zzso zzso zzso and zzso produced a greater number of zzso and were shown to inhibit strongly in zzso proliferation of zzso cells at zzso and zzso zzso respectively, without essentially affecting the viability of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso family inhibitor zzso reversed the zzso activity noticed for the two zzso in zzso cells to 13 and 14 zzso zzso In contrast zzso zzso and zzso inhibited proliferation of zzso cells to a lesser extent than zzso and zzso The metabolism of zzso to zzso and of zzso to zzso was favored by zzso and zzso zzso Taken together the data suggests that zzso family zzso enhance the zzso activity of dietary zzso in breast cancer cells, through zzso to more active zzso
