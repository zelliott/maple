The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene can undergo zzso during the development and treatment of prostate zzso Even in zzso zzso zzso in the zzso paradoxically seem to result in an increased zzso zzso Two such point zzso have been described in the part of the zzso involved in DNA binding and nuclear zzso namely the hinge zzso Despite a decreased nuclear zzso these zzso zzso display increased zzso zzso Through detailed analysis of the hinge region, we found that deletion of zzso 629 to 636 resulted in a stronger zzso response on different reporters, although this zzso displays an extremely low in zzso affinity for zzso response zzso This zzso is independent of nuclear zzso and can be inhibited by zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso functions, zzso and zzso are not dramatically affected when the zzso region zzso is deleted, although zzso zzso zzso zzso had a stronger zzso effect in the absence of this zzso The zzso interaction between the zzso domain and the zzso domain zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso by the zzso We found that this interaction is strongly enhanced by deletion of the zzso zzso In conclusion, the description of prostate cancer zzso has led to the discovery of a complex role of the hinge region in nuclear zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso and zzso interaction of the zzso
