zzso interactions dictate prostate zzso and response to zzso zzso zzso clone 5 zzso is a transforming growth zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso expressed in the prostate zzso Interestingly, following zzso we identified zzso expression of zzso in mouse and human prostate zzso To determine the role of zzso zzso in prostate cancer progression and zzso zzso we compared zzso cells having zzso zzso expressed with the parental zzso cells following tissue zzso zzso with mouse prostate zzso zzso We previously identified knocking out prostate zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso prostate tumors, in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso tumors containing prostate zzso zzso knocked out for the zzso type II zzso zzso resulted in larger, more zzso and zzso tumors compared those with zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso associated with zzso zzso generated zzso tumors with reduced tumor volume, lack of invasion and restored zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso signaling is shown to reduce prostate tumor size and restore zzso following zzso Thus, we hypothesized that zzso zzso expression zzso regulated zzso zzso The mechanism of the zzso effects on zzso was determined by analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter activity suggested zzso expression inhibited zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated zzso and zzso 4 zzso bound the zzso zzso promoter in the absence of zzso zzso However, the formation of a zzso zzso complex inhibited zzso promoter activity, by excluding zzso binding with zzso on the zzso The data indicate zzso expression in response to zzso zzso zzso through the repression of zzso gene at the zzso zzso
