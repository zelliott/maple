The zzso dependent zzso zzso of zzso virus consists of a complex of the large zzso and zzso zzso zzso where L is thought to be responsible for all the zzso activities necessary for viral zzso zzso We previously showed that the L protein forms an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the L zzso of the zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mapped the L zzso domain between zzso acids 1 and 174 of the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain resides at the very zzso of the zzso virus L zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An internal deletion encompassing zzso acids 20 to 178 of the L protein lost zzso activity but still formed an zzso zzso The first 25 zzso acids of zzso L proteins are highly zzso and zzso zzso within this region eliminated the biological activity of the L protein but did not have any effect on zzso or zzso zzso zzso deletion of zzso acids zzso in L abolished biological activity, but again the zzso binding was normal demonstrating that the zzso domain of L protein resides in two zzso regions of the zzso zzso sequences between both zzso zzso and zzso zzso can independently mediate zzso L zzso however, both are required for the activity of the zzso
