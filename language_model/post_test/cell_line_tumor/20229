Bone zzso are a common occurrence in several zzso including breast, zzso and zzso Once established in bone, tumors are responsible for significant morbidity and zzso Thus, there is a significant need to understand the molecular mechanisms controlling the establishment, growth and activity of tumors in zzso Several in zzso models have been established to study these events and each has specific benefits and zzso The most commonly used model zzso zzso zzso of tumor cells directly into the zzso blood supply of zzso zzso zzso zzso This procedure can be applied to many different tumor types (including zzso prostate cancer, lung zzso and mouse zzso fat pad zzso however, in this manuscript we will focus on the breast cancer model, zzso In this model we zzso a highly zzso zzso originally derived in zzso zzso group in San Antonio, that has since been zzso for zzso expression and zzso by our zzso This clone is a bone zzso zzso with a high rate of zzso and very little zzso to zzso liver, or adrenal zzso While zzso injections are most commonly used for studies of bone zzso in certain instances zzso or zzso fat pad injections are more zzso zzso injections are typically performed when using human tumor cells with the goal of monitoring later stages of zzso specifically the ability of cancer cells to arrest in bone, survive, zzso and establish tumors that develop into zzso bone zzso zzso injections are performed if focusing on the relationship of cancer cells and bone after a tumor has zzso to bone, which zzso roughly to established zzso bone zzso Neither of these models zzso early steps in the zzso process prior to embolism and entry of tumor cells into the zzso If monitoring primary tumor growth or zzso from the primary site to bone, then zzso fat pad zzso are usually zzso however, very few tumor cell lines will consistently zzso to bone from the primary site, with zzso zzso zzso a mouse zzso zzso being the zzso This manuscript details zzso procedures and highlights key steps in post zzso zzso Specifically, it includes cell culture, tumor cell zzso procedures for zzso and zzso zzso as well as brief information regarding weekly monitoring by zzso zzso and zzso zzso
