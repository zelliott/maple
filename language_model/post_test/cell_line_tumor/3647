To study whether zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell viability and zzso zzso in human colon cancer zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso proliferation was measured by zzso zzso zzso assessment of zzso was performed with zzso microscope and electron zzso DNA fragmentation was zzso by zzso gel zzso The amount of zzso cells was measured by flow zzso 

zzso inhibited zzso cell proliferation in a zzso manner after 3 d of treatment, and the zzso for zzso zzso of cell number was zzso zzso After incubation of zzso cells with zzso 20 zzso for 24 zzso zzso changes of typical zzso were observed by zzso zzso or transmission electron zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso induced zzso in zzso cells in a zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gel zzso of DNA revealed a zzso pattern 48 h zzso 

zzso inhibited proliferation and induced zzso in the human colon cancer zzso cell zzso
