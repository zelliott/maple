zzso light chains consisting of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are expressed in precursor B cells lacking a complete form of zzso and are thought to act as zzso for conventional light zzso Upon differentiation to immature and mature B cells, zzso disappear and are replaced with conventional light zzso Thus, these molecules may be useful as essential markers of precursor B zzso To examine the expression of the surrogate zzso components zzso and zzso in precursor zzso zzso lymphoma, we analyzed tissue sections using zzso zzso Among a number of zzso zzso for the surrogate light zzso zzso and zzso were found to detect zzso and zzso respectively, in zzso fresh frozen zzso Moreover, we also observed zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Using these zzso we found that zzso were specifically expressed in precursor zzso zzso zzso but not in mature zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, other pediatric tumors that must be included in a differential diagnosis of precursor zzso zzso lymphoma, including precursor zzso zzso lymphoma, zzso zzso tumors, and Ewing zzso were also negative for both zzso and zzso Our data indicate that zzso and zzso may be important markers for the zzso diagnosis of precursor zzso zzso zzso
