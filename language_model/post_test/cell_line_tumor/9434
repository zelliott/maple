To study the zzso status of the zzso and zzso zzso candidate zzso genes closely related to the central nervous system, in the promoter regions, the zzso expression of these 2 zzso and their correlation with the clinical characteristics in human zzso 

The zzso status of zzso and zzso genes in the promoter regions was studied by zzso specific zzso zzso in the specimens of primary zzso from 88 patients, 55 males and 33 zzso aged 12 - 81, and 10 specimens of normal brain zzso all obtained during operation, and in the human zzso cells of the lines zzso and zzso The zzso expression levels of zzso and zzso genes in 30 specimens of primary zzso and 10 specimens of normal brain tissue were determined by conventional zzso and real-time zzso zzso zzso a zzso agent, was added into the culture fluid of the zzso and zzso cells, and then real-time zzso was used to the zzso status and zzso expression levels of the zzso and zzso zzso 

MSP showed that the zzso promoter region was zzso in 62 of the 88 specimens of zzso zzso and the zzso promoter region was zzso in 51 of zzso specimens of zzso zzso But no zzso of zzso and zzso promoter was detected in the 10 specimens of normal brain zzso The zzso expression of zzso gene and the zzso expression of zzso gene in the specimens of zzso of different pathological grades were all significantly decreased compared to the specimens of normal brain tissue (all P zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso gene was not significantly related to the age and sex, however, the zzso expression of zzso was significantly higher in the age group zzso 60 than in other age groups (all P zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso cells showed zzso of zzso and zzso genes and after the treatment of zzso both genes showed zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso genes in the promoter regions may play an important role in the zzso of their zzso levels in zzso The zzso frequency and zzso levels of zzso or zzso genes are closely related to the zzso development of zzso
