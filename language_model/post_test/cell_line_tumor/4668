The possible involvement of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso transport was investigated using in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso studies were performed on a zzso cell zzso the effects of 1 zzso zzso zzso on apparent zzso were determined for zzso and zzso directions, in the presence or absence of various zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and of an associated zzso protein inhibitor zzso zzso on a conscious rat model, zzso zzso zzso notably zzso zzso were determined using zzso and zzso zzso Three groups of seven rats received respectively an IV zzso dose, an oral zzso dose zzso zzso and the same oral zzso dose after zzso administration zzso zzso No formation of zzso was observed on zzso cells after zzso zzso there was no evidence that zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was higher than zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso and decreased its zzso zzso zzso did not modify these zzso zzso In rats, zzso led to an increase in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso The fraction absorbed in the zzso group was zzso times higher than in the oral group zzso and zzso for zzso group and PO zzso The zzso rate constant was lower in the zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso decreases the zzso zzso of zzso and that zzso zzso is not involved in zzso zzso
