zzso growth factor zzso zzso lung zzso cells in suspension undergo zzso to a greater extent than adherent cells in a zzso when zzso zzso is inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This suggests that cell zzso to a culture dish may activate an zzso signaling zzso other than the zzso zzso Since the zzso of cells cultured in a zzso are substantially different to that of cells existing in zzso zzso in zzso we assessed whether two zzso lung zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso were more resistant to zzso zzso zzso when cultured in a zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared with in zzso The zzso zzso cells in zzso were significantly less sensitive to treatment with zzso an zzso zzso than the suspended zzso Further, a marked degradation of zzso the inhibitor of nuclear factor zzso was observed only in the zzso cells, leading to an increase in the zzso of zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso with pharmacological zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso signaling would render zzso zzso lung zzso cells in zzso more susceptible to zzso zzso cell zzso
