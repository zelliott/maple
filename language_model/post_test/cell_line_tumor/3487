There are a large number of stable pancreatic zzso zzso cell lines zzso that are used by researchers zzso zzso data about their differentiation status and genetic zzso are present in the literature, but a systematic correlation with cell biological behavior is often zzso zzso ( zzso were clustered by source of tumor cell zzso primary zzso zzso and the data of functional cell biology were correlated with the reported structural and genetic zzso Major zzso complex zzso zzso and zzso appeared to be related to the source of zzso and zzso capacity appeared to be related to the grade of zzso No correlation between zzso features of zzso and biological behavior was zzso All the cell lines appeared generally insensitive to in zzso treatment with zzso and showed variable degrees of zzso to zzso zzso and zzso All the zzso showed resistance to zzso zzso but were significantly sensitive to the zzso effect of inflammatory zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso were characterized for the zzso of several factors relevant to the zzso cross zzso zzso zzso growth factor, zzso zzso and transforming growth factor beta were the factors most frequently zzso less frequent was the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and sporadically zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso The zzso zzso and zzso were always zzso In conclusion, a clear correlation between zzso features and function could not be zzso suggesting the weakness of a zzso zzso for the in zzso studies of pancreatic zzso
