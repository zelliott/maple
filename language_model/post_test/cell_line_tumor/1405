The human zzso zzso has been found to play an important role in zzso disease, viral infection and human zzso Although it is zzso zzso in cervical cancer, its zzso function and regulation is still zzso In the present study, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso (short hairpin zzso were constructed and zzso into zzso cells using zzso The stable cell line zzso was obtained after zzso zzso zzso cells were observed at 48 h after zzso zzso The zzso efficiency of zzso were detected by zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso The proliferation activity of cells were measured using an zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso was measured using an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the cell cycle was zzso by flow zzso and cell zzso was detected using zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso zzso protein was studied by zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein were zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso The protein expression and activity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were also zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso activity was measured by zzso Following the zzso of zzso and zzso cell proliferation was zzso zzso was increased, the cell cycle was blocked in the zzso with a corresponding decrease in the zzso and cell zzso was zzso All of these effects may be related to the zzso of zzso zzso expression and its nuclear zzso
