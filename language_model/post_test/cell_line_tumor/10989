zzso a pungent ingredient found in red pepper, has long been used in spices, food zzso and zzso Cell death induced by the binding of zzso was examined in a human gastric zzso cell line zzso zzso 

By using zzso zzso zzso flow zzso using the zzso method, and zzso of DNA zzso both cell death and DNA fragmentation were detected in zzso cells treated with zzso By using Western zzso methods, zzso reduced the expression of zzso the zzso zzso in zzso cells in a zzso zzso 

After incubation of zzso cells with zzso for 24 zzso cell viability decreased significantly in a zzso zzso After incubation of zzso cells with zzso for 24 zzso zzso bodies also significantly increased, and were again correlated with the dose of zzso When the concentration of zzso was 1 zzso the amount of DNA fragments also zzso Similar results were also in the lower zzso 

These results suggest that zzso cell death might be via a zzso sensitive zzso zzso zzso zzso might induce protection from gastric zzso
