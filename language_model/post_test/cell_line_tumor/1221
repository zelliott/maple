In the present study, we investigated zzso characterization for newly established human zzso cell zzso A zzso cell line, zzso was established by the zzso of zzso human zzso into zzso zzso Cloning of zzso cells from passage 17 was zzso After cell zzso two zzso lines zzso zzso and zzso with good zzso activities were zzso These cell lines in zzso culture retained a zzso zzso Their doubling times were 68 h and 45 zzso zzso zzso expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso core protein were detected on zzso zzso chain zzso zzso expression of zzso collagen was confirmed in each cell line using Western zzso However, there was no expression of zzso zzso Moreover, gelatin zzso revealed that both cell lines produced zzso zzso with zzso zzso 2 and zzso The parental zzso cells had zzso in zzso zzso however, zzso and zzso were not zzso New zzso lines zzso zzso and zzso derived from human zzso are zzso zzso in serial zzso cultures and express zzso zzso
