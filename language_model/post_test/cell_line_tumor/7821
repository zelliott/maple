Three new zzso complexes with the Schiff base zzso derived from the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso have been zzso zzso zzso The molecular structures of complexes were determined by zzso X-ray zzso The metal center shows a very distorted zzso zzso zzso geometry as consequence of the reduced bite angles of the zzso and the existence of zzso interactions with donor atoms in the zzso The zzso properties of complexes in zzso solution were investigated showing the zzso energies depend on the zzso part of the zzso The evaluation of their biological properties against zzso zzso cell line indicates that zzso complexes could be an interesting tools to treat drug-resistant brain zzso
