The present study was performed to zzso the effect of zzso zzso on the human zzso zzso expression in zzso rat zzso tumor cells using stable zzso of the zzso promoter fused to a zzso reporter zzso Our results showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and promoted the zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso cells with the zzso action of zzso times above the control by zzso zzso zzso Among the zzso of signaling zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso (40 zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso (5 zzso completely blocked the zzso effect of zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso indeed increased the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Neither zzso of zzso nor zzso zzso expression affected zzso induction of zzso zzso To identify the DNA sequence that zzso the effect of zzso six deletion zzso of zzso promoter were zzso The zzso effect of zzso was abolished following deletion of the zzso to zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, our data show that zzso promotes zzso zzso and synthesis by rat zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on zzso promoter appears to require the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and a zzso of promoter sequence that spans the zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso but may be unrelated to zzso zzso
