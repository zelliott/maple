This study aims at applying zzso zzso analysis in zzso for establishing and comparing the zzso properties of dental implants with different surface zzso 

zzso zzso were cultured in zzso tubes in presence of 5 different dental implants with various surface zzso zzso adherent to dental implants were detached and zzso zzso The expression of zzso genes was tested by zzso zzso 

The number and viability of cells adherent to different dental implants varied but without any significant statistical zzso zzso gene expression was revealed to be a more sensitive zzso being remarkably different in cells adherent to different zzso The 5 dental implants significantly modulated the expression of 14 zzso activities mainly including bone zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

Despite no significant differences having been found in in zzso cell number and zzso cells adherent to 5 differently surfaced implants showed different gene expression zzso Thus, to evaluate osteogenesis as related to dental zzso it is important to analyze not only the number of adherent cells but also the zzso of genes zzso for zzso zzso
