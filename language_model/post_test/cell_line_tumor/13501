Although the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have shown dramatic effects against zzso zzso lung cancer, patients become resistant by various mechanisms, including gatekeeper zzso zzso Met amplification, and zzso zzso thereafter zzso Thus, it is urgent to develop novel agents to overcome zzso zzso We have tested the effects of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso on 3 zzso zzso lung cancer cell lines resistant to zzso by different zzso zzso cells with an zzso 19 zzso zzso with an zzso zzso and zzso with an zzso 19 zzso with acquired resistance to zzso because of zzso gene zzso gatekeeper zzso zzso and Met amplification, zzso zzso inhibited the growth of zzso cells with a gatekeeper zzso zzso but did not inhibit the growth of zzso and zzso zzso zzso triggered the resistance of zzso cells to zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso and Met zzso and their downstream zzso Combined treatment zzso inhibited the growth of tumors induced in zzso zzso mice by zzso zzso and zzso cells, without any marked adverse zzso These therapeutic effects were associated with the zzso of zzso and Met zzso in zzso The combination of a zzso zzso and a zzso was effective in suppressing the growth of zzso tumors caused by gatekeeper zzso zzso Met amplification, and zzso zzso Further evaluations in clinical trials are zzso
