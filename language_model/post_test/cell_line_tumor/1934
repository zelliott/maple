The goal of this study was to assess the incorporation of zzso of human zzso zzso zzso that is abundant in zzso zzso and growth factors into zzso zzso zzso scaffolds as a zzso zzso for promoting zzso proliferation and zzso zzso was obtained from human blood by zzso without an zzso and the zzso of zzso was collected and mixed with bovine zzso and then zzso was added to form the FB zzso zzso and differentiation of human primary zzso and a human zzso cell line, the zzso embedded in the three-dimensional zzso scaffolds and on the two-dimensional zzso surface of the FB scaffolds so produced were evaluated in comparison with an zzso zzso scaffold serving as the zzso zzso demonstrated that the amounts of these zzso and growth factors in zzso zzso were higher than those in the zzso products except for zzso zzso and zzso cells on the zzso and zzso FB scaffolds with the addition of the zzso of zzso exhibited zzso proliferation and differentiation than cells on zzso and zzso FB and AG zzso It was concluded that FB scaffolds can provide an appropriate environment for zzso proliferation and zzso and it could be improved by adding zzso of zzso These zzso scaffolds have great promise for cartilage tissue zzso
