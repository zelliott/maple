zzso zzso regulates protein stability and zzso zzso is a component of the zzso zzso complex and positively regulates the zzso of zzso Here, we show a novel molecular mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increases zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso The regulation can be opposed by zzso but not by zzso and is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso zzso at zzso which increases the protein stability and decreases zzso in both zzso and zzso Compared with the zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso protein is more stable, less zzso and less dependent on zzso zzso of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso in cancer cells lacking the zzso zzso shows that the zzso zzso is zzso more active toward the zzso reporter and some zzso target zzso Cancer cells containing the zzso zzso are less sensitive to zzso growth arrest than the cells containing the zzso zzso Taken together, these data demonstrate a novel biological consequence upon zzso interaction, in which zzso can be stabilized by zzso via zzso zzso
