The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso on the cell surface of several types of tumor cells, contributing to cancer cell zzso and zzso to sites containing zzso zzso A highly specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso developed to zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to vascular zzso blocking a primary zzso step and providing a survival zzso In addition, in patients, even low levels of zzso to zzso seem to improve zzso thus, it is expected that vaccines generating zzso toward zzso would be clinically zzso Unfortunately, zzso with protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso have induced clinically inadequate immune zzso However, zzso using peptides that mimic zzso zzso such as Lewis has resulted in both zzso and zzso zzso Here, we tested the hypothesis that zzso with unique zzso zzso mimics may generate immune responses to zzso zzso on tumor cells, useful for active zzso against relevant zzso zzso mimics of zzso were selected by zzso display zzso using zzso and rabbit zzso zzso and were analyzed in zzso to confirm zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso mimics bound to zzso peanut zzso and blocked zzso rolling and stable zzso of cancer cells to vascular zzso In zzso the zzso with zzso multiple zzso peptides induced zzso zzso zzso We propose that this novel active zzso approach could decrease tumor burden in cancer patients by specifically targeting zzso cancer cells and blocking zzso
