zzso are naturally occurring chemical zzso They are secondary zzso produced via zzso of steroids and structurally consist of a zzso bound to a zzso or its zzso They are known to protect plants against zzso and have medicinal value including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso and zzso zzso are two structurally similar zzso isolated from zzso zzso also known as zzso in Indian Ayurvedic zzso zzso alcoholic leaf extract zzso rich in zzso was shown to kill cancer cells zzso Furthermore, the two closely related zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed differential activity in normal and cancer human cells in zzso and in zzso We had earlier identified several genes involved in zzso of zzso in human cancer cells by zzso zzso using either zzso or zzso zzso zzso 

In the present study, we have employed zzso tools on four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso identified by zzso zzso We examined the zzso efficacy of zzso and zzso to each of the four targets and found that the two closely related zzso have differential binding properties to the selected cellular targets that can potentially zzso differential molecular zzso We validated these findings by zzso parallel experiments on specific gene responses to either zzso or zzso in human normal and cancer zzso We demonstrate that zzso that binds strongly to the selected targets acts as a strong zzso agent both for normal and cancer zzso zzso on the other hand, has a weak binding to the zzso it showed milder zzso towards cancer cells and was safe for normal zzso The present molecular zzso analyses and experimental evidence revealed important insights to the use of zzso and zzso for cancer treatment and development of new zzso zzso zzso
