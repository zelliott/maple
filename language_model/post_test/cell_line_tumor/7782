To better use zzso to find promising zzso compounds, a series of new and known zzso base zzso of zzso zzso were zzso and their zzso activity on zzso zzso and zzso cells was zzso The results showed that through a simple chemical zzso less active zzso could be converted into more active zzso When compared with zzso many more potent compounds that could be the promising zzso agents were found, and some of them were more potent than the zzso drug zzso against all three cancer cell zzso By eliminating target functional groups, we observed that the major contributor to the zzso activity of zzso zzso seemed to be the zzso groups, and not the zzso zzso Through comprehensive analysis of zzso zzso zzso the zzso relationships were zzso
