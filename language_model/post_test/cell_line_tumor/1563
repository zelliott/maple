The human zzso gene codes for zzso zzso zzso and for multiple zzso zzso which are suggested to exert distinct functions in the cellular zzso zzso Given that the function of zzso in zzso cancer remains zzso we examined the expression of zzso zzso and various further zzso transcript zzso and their association with selected zzso genes in 74 human zzso samples and zzso cancer specimens by means of zzso Additionally, we knocked down zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso cells by means of zzso zzso zzso of four zzso transcript zzso was significantly elevated in cancer tissue or in zzso tumors compared to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and five further zzso was associated with the zzso zzso or zzso in zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso of zzso expression led to a significant decline of zzso zzso and protein levels in zzso cancer zzso Our observation of increased zzso transcript levels in cancer tissue and particularly their correlation with the expression of zzso as well as the results of our zzso studies, suggest a role of zzso in zzso zzso
