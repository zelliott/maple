zzso growth zzso zzso is one of the most important components of bovine zzso It exhibits zzso and zzso zzso zzso diseases are neurodegenerative disorders caused by cell death through zzso dysfunction and increasing generation of zzso oxygen species zzso This study examined the protective effect of IGF-1 on zzso zzso of the cellular prion protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso human zzso cells, treatment with zzso zzso decreased the cell viability and IGF-1 zzso markedly blocked the zzso zzso cell zzso IGF-1 inhibited zzso zzso zzso generation and zzso zzso zzso In addition, IGF-1 blocked the zzso of the zzso protein to the zzso induced by zzso zzso These results demonstrate that IGF-1 protects zzso cells against zzso zzso zzso through an zzso effect and zzso of zzso zzso zzso The results also suggest that regulation of IGF-1 zzso may have a therapeutic potential in the management of zzso dysfunction and zzso zzso zzso
