zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in multiple cellular processes including zzso regulation, DNA damage repair and cell zzso In prostate cancer, aggressive cases zzso zzso which functions as an zzso zzso zzso via direct zzso of zzso zzso within the zzso motif of the zzso hinge zzso The purpose of this study was to identify and zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso screening revealed an zzso that inhibited both zzso and zzso zzso zzso This substance zzso identified as zzso and other zzso were zzso and zzso against zzso Although an authentic sample of zzso was inactive against zzso in an in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as a relatively potent inhibitor zzso 2 zzso Cellular activity was confirmed by analysis of zzso of zzso and zzso proteins in a prostate cancer cell line zzso zzso treatment inhibited cellular proliferation in a panel of prostate cancer cell lines zzso growth zzso zzso zzso and induced zzso via zzso of zzso 3 and zzso 9 in a zzso and zzso zzso Also, decreased zzso zzso prostate specific zzso zzso and zzso protein levels were demonstrated in response to treatment with zzso Furthermore, zzso with zzso inhibited both zzso zzso and zzso stabilization in response to zzso zzso Based on the activity of zzso and the specificity of the compound towards zzso relative to other zzso zzso these chemical biology studies have identified zzso as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of prostate zzso
