zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been implicated to play a role in prostate cancer development and zzso To understand their functions in zzso we established a transgenic mouse model zzso with targeted expression of the zzso active and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in prostate zzso We found that zzso of zzso zzso expression of a number of zzso zzso growth factors (including zzso and zzso and expands zzso zzso cell population, leading to development of zzso zzso zzso In addition, we showed that some zzso zzso genes are zzso in zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may antagonize zzso activity and halt the differentiation process driven by zzso and zzso This notion is supported by our observations that the number of zzso intermediate cells is increased in zzso zzso after zzso and expression of zzso zzso in these intermediate cells compromises prostate zzso zzso upon zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso is a driver of prostate cancer, at least in part, through modulating multiple zzso zzso zzso
