zzso vaccination using in zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso fusion proteins has been shown in zzso zzso and tumor model zzso We demonstrate protective DNA vaccination using zzso fusion proteins against the zzso bacterial pathogen zzso zzso in a mouse zzso In contrast to previous studies using zzso zzso as vaccine vehicles, we used zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a carrier for zzso zzso zzso zzso of the cellular immune response revealed profound zzso zzso and zzso T cell zzso Our findings suggest a predominantly zzso zzso T cell response to DNA vaccination with zzso fusion proteins in the model zzso Most importantly, DNA vaccination induced protection against an otherwise lethal dose of zzso zzso
