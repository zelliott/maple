Cell zzso is partially dependent on interactions between the zzso and the zzso zzso Our previous studies have identified synthetic zzso acid cell zzso peptides using a zzso screening zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso zzso completely blocks random zzso migration and zzso invasion of prostate zzso cells on zzso This effect is zzso independent and zzso The zzso of migration by zzso involves a dramatic zzso of the zzso zzso resulting in increased stress fiber formation and zzso zzso with zzso at the cell zzso zzso interacts with zzso (not zzso and zzso zzso and surprisingly zzso zzso zzso signals including focal zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso does not contain a previously characterized binding sequence for zzso A scrambled zzso of zzso called zzso zzso does not interact with the zzso or zzso zzso zzso and is not biologically zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso is a biologically active zzso zzso that zzso zzso tumor cell migration on zzso and zzso zzso signaling from zzso zzso
