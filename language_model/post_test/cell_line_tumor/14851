zzso the biology of zzso and its characteristic combined deletion of zzso arms zzso and zzso zzso by an unbalanced zzso zzso has been hampered by the lack of cell lines that harbor these zzso We grew cells from 2 zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso propagation and expansion led to the establishment of permanent cell lines that maintained the genetic signature of the parent zzso and displayed features of brain tumor stem cells in zzso One line was established from a zzso tumor and the other from a zzso resistant zzso zzso These lines may be important tools for understanding the biology of zzso and the function of their defining genetic zzso
