Although the general relevance of zzso modifications for zzso stress zzso zzso checkpoint zzso and DNA repair is well established, how these modifications reach initial thresholds in order to trigger robust responses remains largely zzso Here, we identify the zzso scaffold attachment factor zzso as a component of the DNA damage response and show that zzso zzso with zzso zzso to allow for efficient zzso spreading and zzso stress zzso zzso zzso a highly dynamic exchange at damaged zzso in a zzso zzso and zzso manner and is required for zzso zzso checkpoint zzso and guarding cells against zzso zzso Altogether, our data reveal that transient recruitment of an architectural zzso component is required in order to overcome zzso barriers by making zzso zzso for DNA damage zzso whereas the ensuing exclusion of zzso may help prevent excessive zzso
