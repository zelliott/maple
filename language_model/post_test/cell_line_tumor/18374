Several mechanisms are known to cause resistance to chemotherapy in cancer cells, but the mechanisms of drug resistance due to a lack of zzso are not well zzso 

To understand the mechanisms of resistance to zzso induced by zzso zzso we developed a zzso zzso of zzso referred to as zzso measured growth zzso by zzso blue cell survival zzso zzso zzso by zzso V binding zzso and detected zzso of zzso zzso zzso -9 and zzso in these zzso 

The resistant cells expressed zzso resistance to zzso induced by zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso cells did not express zzso zzso or its product zzso and they did not zzso zzso Treating zzso cells with zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso for 72 h induced 8, 14 and zzso zzso zzso However, only 1 zzso zzso was able to trigger about zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso triggered by zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was mainly zzso but at 1 zzso about zzso of zzso was zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that zzso was activated at zzso and 1 zzso zzso treatment and zzso zzso -9 and 10 were only activated at 1 zzso zzso treatment in zzso cells, but none of the zzso checked were activated in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso at zzso and zzso zzso induced zzso and zzso to the same extent in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso while zzso triggers growth arrest and zzso zzso and zzso in these cells, defects in zzso of the zzso and executioner zzso play a major role in resistance to zzso triggered by zzso
