zzso in zzso signaling and its loss cause zzso instability and head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso suggesting that agents that target both zzso and zzso pathways could control zzso 

zzso efficacy was evaluated against the zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso DNA damage, zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso and focus formation zzso and zzso zzso efficacy was also examined in nude mice for zzso zzso zzso zzso were analyzed for zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso suppressed viability and induced DNA damage in zzso and zzso cells but not in normal human zzso zzso and human zzso zzso showing its selectivity toward zzso zzso however, zzso cells were resistant to zzso even at 100 zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso showed similar zzso effects as parental zzso indicating that a lack of zzso effect in zzso cells was independent of zzso status in these zzso Furthermore, zzso caused zzso arrest and zzso death of zzso and zzso cells together with induction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso body zzso treatment also inhibited zzso tumor growth in nude mice, and zzso and zzso zzso were strongly increased in zzso from zzso mice compared with zzso 

Our findings for the first time showed zzso DNA damaging, and zzso effects of zzso in zzso cells independent of zzso status, both in zzso and in zzso suggesting that more studies are needed to establish its potential usefulness against zzso
