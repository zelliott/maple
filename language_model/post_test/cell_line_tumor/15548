zzso Box zzso zzso protein is a zzso factor and regulates cell zzso It is commonly zzso in human cancer tissue and correlated with poor zzso suggesting that the zzso of zzso plays a critical role in zzso In this study, we report the identification and characterization of a new zzso of zzso which was first isolated from our laboratory in zzso cell zzso Compared with zzso zzso the new zzso lacks of zzso of zzso zzso which is a zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and western zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso was highly expressed in a variety of cancer cell lines such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not expressed in normal human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso with zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso bound to zzso targeted gene promoter region and correlated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso delayed zzso to zzso progression of cell cycle, decreased Aurora zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso induced instability of zzso and formation of zzso cells within 1 month when expressed in zzso In conclusion, zzso is expressed in cancer cells and zzso normal cell cycle and zzso zzso zzso
