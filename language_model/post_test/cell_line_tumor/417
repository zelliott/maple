zzso instability zzso is a hallmark of many zzso and zzso with the presence of extra zzso However, a direct zzso link between extra zzso and zzso has not been zzso It has been proposed that extra zzso generate zzso by promoting zzso zzso a highly abnormal division that produces three or more zzso daughter zzso Here we use long-term zzso imaging to demonstrate that cells with multiple zzso rarely undergo zzso cell zzso and the progeny of these divisions are typically zzso Thus, zzso divisions cannot explain observed rates of zzso In contrast, we observe that zzso cells with extra zzso routinely undergo bipolar cell zzso but display a significantly increased frequency of lagging zzso during zzso To define the mechanism underlying this zzso zzso we generated cells that differ only in their zzso zzso We demonstrate that extra zzso alone are sufficient to promote zzso zzso during bipolar cell zzso These segregation errors are a consequence of cells passing through a transient zzso zzso zzso in which zzso zzso attachment errors accumulate before zzso zzso and zzso These findings provide a direct zzso link between extra zzso and zzso two common characteristics of solid zzso We propose that this mechanism may be a common underlying cause of zzso in human zzso
