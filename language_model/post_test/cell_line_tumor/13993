The purpose of this study was to determine the zzso effect of a novel zzso zzso zzso on normal and zzso human zzso In a panel of several human zzso cancer cell lines, almost half of them spontaneously zzso significant amounts of zzso When incubated with zzso a zzso enhancement of zzso production by cells was zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso release of zzso in cultures of zzso cells was increased in the presence of zzso zzso zzso isolated from peripheral blood did not respond to zzso Although zzso release was not triggered in human peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso these cells to produce zzso and zzso during incubation with zzso zzso No effect of zzso was found on zzso and zzso production by zzso In cultures of peripheral blood T zzso zzso significantly decreased the zzso of these cells to zzso proteins in an in zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso as a zzso of zzso zzso may have potential application in tumor zzso
