Although zzso PET is widely used for zzso melanoma diagnosis, it is less accurate than desirable, particularly for small zzso Since both zzso and zzso zzso zzso receptors for zzso hormone zzso zzso name, zzso type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are potential candidates for melanoma zzso The aim of this study was to develop a zzso zzso zzso analog suitable for PET imaging of melanoma zzso 

A short linear zzso zzso zzso zzso was newly designed and zzso to the metal zzso zzso zzso zzso to enable zzso zzso Compared with our previously reported zzso zzso zzso zzso the major modification lies in the zzso of zzso to the zzso end of the zzso via the zzso group of zzso as opposed to the zzso zzso zzso After labeling with zzso zzso and the short-lived zzso zzso zzso zzso was characterized in zzso and in zzso using the mouse melanoma zzso zzso 

zzso exhibited an almost zzso higher zzso binding potency as compared with zzso In zzso zzso mice, both zzso and zzso behaved more favorably than zzso Both zzso exhibited higher tumor and lower kidney zzso leading to zzso ratios of the zzso to zzso area under the curve that were zzso times zzso and zzso times zzso greater than that obtained with zzso In addition, the zzso kidney zzso of zzso could be reduced by zzso by zzso of 15 zzso zzso without affecting tumor zzso zzso primary melanoma as well as lung and liver melanoma zzso could be easily zzso on tissue section zzso after systemic injection of zzso The melanoma selectivity of zzso was confirmed by PET imaging studies using zzso zzso zzso was found to be highest when the smallest amount of zzso was zzso 

zzso labeled with either zzso or zzso is in every way superior to zzso in zzso models of primary and zzso melanoma, which makes it a promising agent for melanoma zzso zzso images obtained in PET studies with an experimental tumor model 1 h after injection zzso well for its clinical potential as an imaging zzso
