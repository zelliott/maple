zzso of the potency and toxicity of high-dose zzso zzso such as zzso body zzso zzso by the linear zzso zzso model led to many zzso hesitating to adopt this zzso and zzso therapeutic zzso The aim of this study was to offer an alternative method of analyzing the effect of zzso by constructing a universal survival curve zzso that provides superior approximation of the zzso measured survival zzso in the zzso high-dose range without losing the strengths of the zzso model around the zzso 

The zzso was constructed by zzso two classic zzso models: the zzso model and the zzso zzso We have assumed that the zzso model gives a good description for conventionally zzso zzso zzso for the dose to the zzso For zzso doses beyond the shoulder, the survival curve is better described as a straight line as predicted by the zzso zzso The zzso smoothly zzso from a zzso predicted by the zzso model to the terminal zzso of the zzso model in the high-dose zzso From the zzso we derived two zzso functions, the biologically effective dose and the single fraction equivalent dose for both zzso and zzso 

The zzso of the zzso was tested by using previously published parameters of the zzso and zzso models for zzso lung cancer cell zzso A comparison of the zzso of the zzso and zzso models was made to a high-dose survival curve of the zzso zzso lung cancer cell zzso 

The zzso can be used to compare the dose zzso schemes of both zzso and zzso The zzso provides an zzso and a clinically zzso rationale for zzso while preserving the strengths of the zzso model for zzso
