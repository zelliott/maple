zzso zzso zzso was previously shown to exhibit zzso activity on zzso zzso and melanoma zzso cell zzso zzso studies about its mechanism of action using zzso zzso zzso suggested that 1 may be altering the metabolism of zzso We have now studied the effect of 1 on the fatty acid, zzso and zzso content in a line of zzso human zzso zzso cells zzso using zzso zzso acid and zzso were used as positive controls for zzso of fatty acid and zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 (10 zzso was more efficient than zzso acid in reducing fatty acid levels of zzso cells, producing a decrease in the range of zzso depending on the zzso chain length and the number of zzso In addition, zzso 1 caused a reduction on zzso content of zzso tumor cell line and zzso of zzso the common zzso precursor for zzso zzso zzso of zzso metabolism was also observed with two zzso derivatives of 1, which caused a more pronounced increase in zzso zzso zzso 1 at higher zzso (above 30 zzso produced drastic zzso in zzso zzso leading to cell zzso profiles very different from those obtained at 10 zzso These zzso changes were ascribed to zzso of zzso zzso stress zzso
