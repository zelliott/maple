The zzso zzso zzso technique is potentially a useful tool to differentiate zzso based on the variation of electrical properties presented by different zzso and zzso The different zzso and cells present zzso electrical resistance and zzso when excited at different zzso The main purpose of this area of research is to use zzso zzso over a zzso bandwidth ranging from 1 zzso to 3 zzso to 1) differentiate the pathological stages of cancer cells under laboratory conditions and 2) permit the extraction of electrical parameters related to cellular information for further zzso This provides evidence to form the basis of zzso measurement at the cellular level and aids the potential future development of rapid zzso from biopsy zzso Three cell lines, representing normal breast zzso and different pathological stages of breast cancer, have been measured using a standard zzso zzso driving a zzso chamber filled with different cell zzso We identify the specific zzso profile for each cell type and determine whether these can be zzso In addition, the electrical zzso zzso the zzso zzso membrane zzso characteristic frequency, are extracted by the use of equivalent circuit models and physical models to provide details of the cell electric signatures for further analysis of cancer cell zzso
