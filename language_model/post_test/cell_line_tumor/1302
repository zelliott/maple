zzso progression has been recognized as the product of evolving zzso between cancer cells and the surrounding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may be linked to the progression of gastric zzso To understand the significance of zzso zzso we examined the effects of zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso of gastric cancer zzso Three human gastric cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso and four human gastric zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso normal zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The zzso zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso were established from a zzso gastric wall, and normal zzso zzso zzso and zzso were established from a zzso gastric zzso zzso that were zzso muscle zzso were defined as zzso We examined the effects of zzso zzso zzso on the aggressiveness of gastric cancer cells by zzso zzso invasion zzso and zzso The ratios of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly zzso zzso zzso greater than those in zzso zzso or zzso zzso Although all four zzso zzso lines increased the zzso of gastric cancer cells, including migration and invasion ability, the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was significantly higher than that of normal zzso zzso and zzso These zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso treatment and zzso growth zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso may play an important role in the progression of gastric zzso and that transforming growth zzso produced by zzso may be one of the factors associated with the aggressiveness of gastric zzso zzso
