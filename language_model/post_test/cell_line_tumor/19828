Because of its expression pattern restricted to cells of the zzso lineage and to melanoma cells, zzso is an important target of zzso approaches for the treatment of zzso Identification of zzso derived sequences recognized by specific T cells is therefore of great interest for the development of these therapeutic zzso Using circulating zzso T cells from healthy donors, we identified two zzso zzso T cell zzso mapping to the zzso and zzso regions of the protein and restricted by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells specific for the identified zzso were able to recognize the native zzso when zzso expressed by zzso presenting cells and tumor zzso In addition, zzso T cells specific for zzso zzso recognized the zzso after zzso processing and presentation of zzso zzso zzso Identification of these zzso will be instrumental for the evaluation of the immune response to zzso in cancer zzso
