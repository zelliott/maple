To investigate the effects of reversal of zzso toxicity on the synthesis and zzso of zzso by the alpha cells and the possible mechanisms zzso 

Mouse zzso cells of the line zzso were cultured in medium containing zzso zzso zzso for 10 days zzso zzso group, zzso in medium containing 25 zzso zzso for 10 days zzso zzso group, zzso in medium with 25 zzso zzso for 5 days and then in medium with zzso zzso zzso for 5 days zzso zzso group, zzso group), or in medium with zzso zzso zzso for 5 days and then in medium with 25 zzso zzso for 5 days zzso group), zzso was used to detect the zzso concentration in the zzso zzso was used to detect the zzso expression of zzso in the zzso zzso Western zzso was used to detect the protein expression of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso 

zzso The zzso level of the zzso group was lower than that of the zzso group by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso expression level in the zzso cells of the zzso group was significantly lower than that of the zzso group by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso expression levels in the zzso cells of the zzso group were significantly higher than those of the LG group by zzso and zzso respectively (both P zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso expression levels in the zzso cells of the zzso group were significantly lower than those of the zzso group by zzso and zzso respectively (both P zzso zzso 

After removing the high zzso toxicity the abnormal zzso zzso by the zzso can be ameliorated obviously, and the expression levels of zzso and zzso proteins that promote the zzso of zzso are reduced zzso
