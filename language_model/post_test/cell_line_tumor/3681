zzso of zzso regions leads to an increase of DNA copy number and expression of zzso in human breast cancer zzso zzso of the zzso region occurs in zzso of primary, zzso zzso In our panel of 11 breast cancer cells, three cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso have overlapping zzso in the zzso zzso To characterize zzso structure of the amplified regions, we performed zzso in zzso zzso using zzso zzso clones in the 3 cell zzso The results revealed that the zzso zzso has a highly complex structure and that zzso is not in the common zzso domain in 3 breast cancer cell lines with the zzso These 3 cell lines provide good models for genetic and functional studies of candidate zzso of the zzso zzso
