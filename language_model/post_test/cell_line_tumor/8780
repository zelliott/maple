Attempts to eradicate zzso have been thwarted by the persistence of a small pool of zzso memory zzso T cells that harbor a zzso silent, integrated form of the virus that can produce infectious zzso following an zzso immune zzso zzso factors downstream of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso zzso members, are considered important regulators of zzso zzso during acute zzso zzso We now report studies exploring their precise role as zzso of zzso zzso using cell and primary zzso T cell models of zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso interference studies performed in zzso zzso T cells suggested that none of the zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso played a key role in the zzso of zzso zzso However, zzso A markedly inhibited the zzso zzso These results were zzso when calcium signaling through zzso was shown to zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso that in turn zzso the zzso zzso long terminal repeat zzso Similar effects of zzso were confirmed in a primary zzso T cell model of zzso zzso These findings highlight an important role for zzso in zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso Innovative approaches exploiting the synergistic actions of zzso and zzso in the absence of generalized zzso zzso merit exploration as a means to attack the zzso viral zzso
