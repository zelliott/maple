Sites of chronic inflammation are often associated with the establishment and growth of various zzso including breast zzso A common inflammatory condition in humans is zzso arthritis zzso that causes inflammation and zzso of the zzso Other systemic effects associated with arthritis include increased cellular zzso and inflammation of the zzso Several studies have reported statistically significant risk ratios between AA and breast zzso Despite this knowledge, available for a decade, it has never been questioned if the site of chronic inflammation linked to AA creates a milieu that attracts tumor cells to home and grow in the inflamed bones and lungs which are frequent sites of breast cancer zzso 

To determine if chronic inflammation induced by zzso arthritis contributes to increased breast zzso zzso we generated zzso zzso tumors in zzso mice that were genetically prone to develop zzso Two breast cancer cell lines, one highly zzso zzso and the other zzso zzso were used to generate the tumors in the zzso fat zzso Lung and bone zzso and the associated inflammatory milieu were evaluated in the zzso versus the zzso zzso 

We report a zzso increase in lung zzso and a significant increase in the zzso of bone zzso in the zzso and zzso mice compared to zzso control zzso We also report that the zzso breast cancer cells augment the severity of arthritis resulting in a vicious cycle that increases both bone destruction and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in lungs and bone of the zzso and zzso mice and subsequent increase in circulating levels of zzso zzso such as zzso colony stimulating factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso may contribute to the increased zzso Treatment with zzso + zzso an zzso drug completely zzso the development of zzso and significantly reduced the primary tumor zzso 

The data clearly has important clinical implications for patients diagnosed with zzso breast cancer, especially with regards to the prognosis and treatment zzso
