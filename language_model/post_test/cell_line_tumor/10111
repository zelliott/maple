zzso zzso zzso suicide gene therapy has been considered for the treatment of pancreatic zzso However, despite a bystander effect, the proportion of zzso tumor cells has proven too low to result in zzso We propose the use of a zzso marker zzso to enrich zzso cells using zzso This enrichment or positive selection phase may increase the efficacy of suicide gene zzso To test this strategy, we generated stable zzso zzso and showed zzso resistance in zzso Mixed tumors of zzso cells and parental zzso cells were established and zzso was used to increase the proportion of zzso zzso After this positive selection phase, suicide gene therapy with zzso was zzso Upon positive selection, the proportion of zzso cells increased from zzso to zzso zzso suicide gene therapy was more effective compared with a control group without positive zzso Starting with zzso of zzso cells the zzso selection strategy completely inhibited tumor zzso Taken together, these results suggest that a zzso selection strategy based on zzso and zzso genes represents an efficient way to increase the proportion of zzso cells in the tumor and the efficacy of zzso suicide gene zzso
