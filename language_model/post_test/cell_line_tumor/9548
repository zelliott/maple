The standard treatment of zzso zzso cancer is tumor zzso by surgery, followed by six cycles of chemotherapy consisting of zzso and zzso However, this therapy protocol is not zzso since about 50% of the treated patients eventually experience recurrence within a few years of zzso Thus, a more innovative treatment zzso is urgently needed for patients with this zzso We hypothesized that zzso of zzso cancer zzso cells at a zzso to zzso dose range of zzso would result in increased sensitivity to zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso blue dye exclusion were used to determine the zzso to zzso range of zzso against zzso zzso A zzso zzso release zzso zzso was used to evaluate the sensitivity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was used for zzso changes of cells with or without zzso zzso 

Our results with zzso blue dye exclusion and zzso zzso showed that the zzso to zzso range was between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso at these doses for 72 h revealed significantly enhanced zzso killing against zzso cells with the highest sensitivity achieved with cells treated with zzso zzso zzso as compared with the baseline killing of zzso cells using zzso cell alone zzso zzso zzso The enhanced sensitivity of zzso killing appeared to be in part due to zzso expression of zzso on zzso zzso 

This treatment approach may be useful for further development of an effective therapeutic mode for patients with zzso zzso
