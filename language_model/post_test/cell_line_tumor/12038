zzso zzso domain zzso proteins are zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso leading to their subsequent zzso and zzso Paradoxically, the expression of two family members zzso and zzso is induced in hypoxic cell culture despite the reduced availability of the oxygen zzso and it has been suggested that they become functionally relevant following zzso to rapidly terminate the zzso zzso Here we show that zzso are also induced in hypoxic mice in zzso albeit in a zzso zzso As demonstrated under chronically hypoxic conditions in zzso zzso and zzso show a transient maximum but remain zzso over more than 10 days, suggesting a feedback zzso of zzso which then levels off at a novel set zzso Indeed, hypoxic induction of zzso and zzso is paralleled by the zzso of zzso zzso Using an engineered zzso reporter gene in a cellular background lacking zzso zzso and hence zzso zzso zzso we could show that increased zzso zzso levels can compensate for a wide range of hypoxic zzso Similar data were obtained in a zzso zzso system in zzso In zzso these results suggest that due to their high zzso zzso values, zzso have optimal zzso properties under all zzso relevant oxygen zzso increased zzso play a functional role even under zzso conditions, allowing the zzso system to adapt to a novel oxygen threshold and to respond to another hypoxic zzso Furthermore, such an zzso zzso system would explain how a single mechanism works in a wide variety of differently zzso zzso
