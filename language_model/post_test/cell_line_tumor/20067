Multiple clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the potential zzso activity of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inducing zzso zzso and its zzso zzso These drug products act through the death receptors zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso characterization of the level and zzso of DR expression in cancer cells is important for zzso zzso In this study, we examined the zzso distribution of the four zzso in a panel of 10 human breast cancer cell lines by western blots and flow zzso and 50 human breast tumors by zzso Despite their total protein expressions, the zzso were found to be absent on the surface of some cell zzso zzso with this result, all four zzso were found to be mostly expressed in the zzso and/or the nucleus of primary breast tumors zzso We further determined the growth zzso activity zzso of the death zzso zzso human zzso zzso and zzso and found a correlation with the zzso zzso of the corresponding zzso These results demonstrate an zzso expression of the death receptors in breast cancer cells, and suggest that the lack of surface zzso appears to be zzso of tumor resistance to zzso zzso
