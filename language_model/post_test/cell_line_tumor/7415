zzso zzso vaccines have significant therapeutic and manufacturing advantages zzso zzso the presence of multiple zzso zzso zzso the potential benefit of viable but zzso cells which can provide persistent zzso presentation to the patient, and zzso the ability to be consistently manufactured in large lots that can be used to treat multiple patients and be fully tested before zzso zzso is an example of a zzso zzso zzso active zzso and has been extensively tested in phase I and II clinical zzso zzso of these clinical studies show a statistically significant increase in median and five-year survival of stage III and stage IV surgically zzso patients with melanoma as compared to matched historical zzso Phase III zzso zzso trials in both stage III and stage IV patients with melanoma are in zzso zzso of zzso whole cell vaccines requires identity testing and assurance that the vaccine is zzso Since zzso zzso vaccines contain multiple zzso and patient immune responses may occur to several different zzso it may be essential to zzso multiple zzso on the cells in the zzso This can be accomplished using quantitative flow zzso to assess zzso zzso on viable cells and zzso zzso on fixed and zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso vaccines may also be assessed for content using zzso zzso to identify unique cell zzso DNA zzso to verify that each of the cell lines is present in the final zzso Finally, a critical issue with zzso zzso cell vaccines is the assurance that zzso of the final product is effective and that cells have been rendered zzso This can be achieved using both high sensitivity visual assessment of the vaccine following extended culture and comparing cell cultures from zzso vaccine and zzso vaccine spiked with replication competent vaccine zzso This approach has been shown to have a limit of detection of one zzso cell in one million zzso zzso vaccine zzso zzso zzso such as zzso incorporation can also be used to assess cell zzso but in our hands these zzso are generally less zzso Phase zzso data with zzso are encouraging and support the further testing and extension of this approach to other zzso zzso In addition, the zzso testing, and release of whole cell active zzso can be achieved using quantitative zzso testing and proliferation zzso to ensure the consistent manufacturing necessary to produce a commercial zzso
