We examined the functional role of zzso in zzso zzso and tested whether zzso zzso targeted against zzso enhances the zzso in human zzso cancer cells in zzso zzso zzso and protein expression of zzso cells, a human zzso zzso cell line, after treatment with zzso were measured by zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso expression and cell growth were compared between zzso cells zzso with constructed a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell viability was measured with zzso zzso after zzso zzso DNA fragmentation and zzso zzso were zzso zzso expression was increased after treatment with zzso and highest at 8 h in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were highly sensitive to zzso cell death induced by zzso compared with parental zzso cells or control zzso zzso our results showed that expression of zzso was increased in the acute phase of cell death caused by zzso and that suppressing the expression of zzso enhanced the zzso of zzso caused by zzso in human zzso cancer zzso These results suggest that lowering the expression of zzso might increase the sensitivity of zzso cancer cells to zzso zzso
