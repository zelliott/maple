The delivery of zzso agents to solid tumors is zzso zzso drug carriers represent an attractive alternative strategy for efficient zzso drug delivery to tumor zzso because they appear to target tumors and have limited toxicity in normal zzso However, inadequate and zzso distribution of zzso in tumor tissue is a major impediment for their efficient use in clinical cancer zzso In the present study, we examined the effect of tumor type on the zzso zzso and distribution of zzso zzso zzso zzso using in zzso mouse models of three cancer cell zzso colon zzso zzso Lewis lung zzso zzso and zzso melanoma zzso The tumor growth zzso and the zzso response of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso were tumor type dependent and correlated with a tendency toward tumor zzso and zzso distribution of zzso zzso in contrast to in zzso zzso of zzso A potent zzso effect observed in both zzso and LLC zzso mice was attributed to the enhanced zzso with subsequent preferential zzso of zzso zzso through tumor zzso with high zzso Our results suggest that the zzso of tumor zzso constitutes a potential impediment to tumor zzso and thereby to the zzso efficacy of zzso zzso zzso zzso
