This study was aimed to investigate the effects of zzso A isolated from the zzso zzso part of the leaves of zzso zzso zzso on zzso in human zzso zzso zzso cells and its possible mechanisms, and to measure the immune toxicity of zzso A in zzso 

zzso A was isolated from the zzso zzso part of the leaves of zzso zzso zzso with column zzso The proliferation of zzso zzso and the viability of zzso cells were assessed with zzso zzso zzso zzso light microscope and zzso microscope were zzso to observe the zzso changes of zzso cells zzso zzso double labeling and zzso zzso were used to detect early zzso and DNA zzso of zzso cells zzso In addition, cell cycle distribution was analyzed by using flow zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein levels were determined by zzso zzso and western zzso zzso 

The results showed that zzso A had low immune toxicity and the proliferation of zzso cells was strongly inhibited by zzso A in a zzso and zzso manner and that the characteristics of zzso of zzso cells were zzso The results also showed that zzso rates and the number of zzso cells significantly increased with zzso of the action zzso The results of flow zzso zzso indicated that zzso A induced significant zzso and zzso arrest of zzso zzso zzso zzso and western zzso showed that the expression of zzso was found to be noticeably zzso and the expression of zzso was zzso zzso 

These results indicate that zzso A has low immune toxicity in zzso and zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso cells which is related to the zzso and zzso arrest, and it exerts its zzso effect by zzso of zzso expression and zzso of zzso zzso
