Although the zzso value of the zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso in childhood zzso is usually attributed to their role in zzso drug zzso certain observations have suggested that these zzso zzso might contribute to the zzso zzso independent of zzso drug zzso 

A zzso zzso viral related zzso zzso derived zzso transgenic mouse zzso model was crossed with an zzso mouse strain zzso zzso 205 zzso zzso or, zzso treated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes were suppressed using short interfering zzso or zzso by stable zzso in zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso which were then assessed for wound closure ability, zzso capacity, zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso quantitative zzso chain reaction was used to examine the clinical significance of zzso family gene expression in a large zzso accrued cohort of patients zzso zzso zzso with primary zzso zzso survival analysis and Cox zzso were used to test for associations with zzso and overall zzso Except where noted, all statistical tests were zzso 

zzso of zzso statistically significantly inhibited zzso development in zzso transgenic mice zzso age for palpable zzso treated mice, zzso zzso control mice, zzso zzso hazard ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso inhibited wound closure zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso suppression of zzso enhanced zzso differentiation zzso zzso zzso and inhibited cell growth zzso zzso zzso Analysis of 209 zzso patient tumors revealed that, in contrast with zzso and zzso low rather than high zzso expression was associated with reduced zzso survival zzso of recurrence or death zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso with 23 of 53 patients with low zzso expression experiencing recurrence or death compared with 31 of 155 patients with high zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso in zzso inhibited zzso cell migration zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The combined expression of zzso zzso and zzso was associated with patients having an adverse event, such that of the 12 patients with the zzso zzso expression pattern, 10 experienced recurrence or death zzso of recurrence or death zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 to zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso zzso can affect zzso biology independently of their role in zzso drug zzso enhancing their potential as targets for therapeutic zzso
