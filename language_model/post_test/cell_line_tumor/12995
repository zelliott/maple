zzso of zzso protein zzso due to its genetic amplification is found in certain zzso such as zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso cervical cancer and lung cancer, and plays a significant role in resistance to cancer zzso We previously reported that a class of small molecules represented by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activates zzso of zzso for zzso degradation, and enhances zzso of various cancer zzso However, the molecular mechanism of how zzso zzso cancer cells to zzso via zzso of zzso is not well zzso Here, we show that zzso and distribution of zzso a protein zzso by zzso is modulated by zzso Upon tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso associates with the zzso zzso complex, whereas zzso zzso associates with zzso zzso reduces the zzso zzso in the zzso complex and increases zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso of zzso by zzso reduces zzso induced by zzso plus zzso zzso These results indicate an important role of zzso in zzso induced by combined treatment with zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso zzso cancer cells to zzso by modulating zzso zzso and zzso
