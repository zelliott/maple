Previous reports have demonstrated the suitability of adding different zzso drugs to acrylic cement for the treatment of bone zzso The best results so far have been obtained with zzso zzso for which diffusion from the implanted cement has been demonstrated both in zzso and in zzso In this study the suitability of adding zzso to acrylic cement as local zzso chemotherapy was zzso 

Using an in zzso model of human breast cancer cells we demonstrated that the drug is zzso in an active form able to exert a zzso effect over a long period of zzso The use of different zzso of drug on the kinetic of zzso and on the mechanical properties of cement was also zzso 

The results obtained suggest that the release of zzso is higher at the beginning and progressively decreases over time being affected by the concentration of drug zzso Our results also demonstrated that the addition and the subsequent zzso of zzso does not alter the zzso properties of the zzso 

These findings confirm the suitability of zzso cement and support its use as an effective aid for the management of bone zzso requiring surgical zzso and acrylic cement zzso for structural zzso
