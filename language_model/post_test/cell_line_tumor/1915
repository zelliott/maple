To investigate the effects of zzso gene zzso on zzso sensitivity of zzso cancer cell line zzso to zzso 

zzso with zzso and zzso with zzso were zzso into zzso cancer cell line zzso by zzso and incubated with zzso for zzso zzso efficiency of zzso was observed under zzso zzso cellular zzso gene expression were determined by Western zzso zzso treated group zzso 5, 10 zzso and zzso zzso group were selected to treat zzso and zzso zzso cancer cell line zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso cancer cell line zzso stable expressing zzso and zzso respectively, were successfully selected, named as zzso zzso Compared with the zzso and zzso the zzso expression level of zzso was significantly zzso zzso In zzso zzso group, the zzso rate was not associated with zzso zzso In zzso treated group zzso 5, 10 zzso compared with zzso and zzso the zzso rate of the zzso was significantly increased after the treatments of zzso the difference were zzso zzso In addition, the zzso rate of zzso was significantly increased with the concentration of zzso zzso zzso The difference between zzso and zzso were not zzso 

zzso gene didn't induce zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso could increase zzso sensitivity of zzso cancer cell line zzso to zzso
