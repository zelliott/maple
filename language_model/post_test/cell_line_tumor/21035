zzso of zzso compounds in the early and later stages of drug discovery can help reduce the costs of research and zzso Through the application of principal components analysis zzso we were able to data mine and prove that approximately zzso of the total log zzso 50 zzso is due to the zzso zzso nature of zzso Furthermore, zzso led to the identification of groups of structurally unrelated substances showing very specific toxicity profiles, such as a set of 45 substances toxic only to the zzso cancer cell zzso In an effort to predict zzso zzso on the basis of the mean log zzso 50, we created a decision tree using zzso keys that can correctly zzso over zzso of the substances as zzso in zzso on the basis of the zzso of mean log zzso 50 zzso zzso Finally, we have established a linear model using zzso in which nine of the 59 available zzso cancer cell lines can be used to predict the mean log zzso zzso The model has R zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso between the observed and calculated mean log zzso 50 zzso zzso zzso Our zzso models can be applied to flag generally zzso molecules in virtual and real chemical libraries, thus saving time and zzso
