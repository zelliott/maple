Previous study demonstrated that zzso a zzso I zzso exhibited potent zzso and zzso activity in zzso and in zzso In this study, we report the efficacy of zzso against the development of melanoma zzso by an intravenous injection of green fluorescent zzso mice melanoma zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso markedly decreased zzso pulmonary zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas higher doses of zzso zzso significantly inhibited the tumor growth of zzso zzso zzso In the in zzso experiment, zzso suppressed the zzso cell invasion and migration without affecting cell zzso Further studies demonstrated that zzso decreased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and reduced the protein expression of zzso as well as the zzso level of zzso in zzso zzso These in zzso and in zzso results indicate that zzso possesses both the potent zzso ability and the tumor zzso activity, and the dual function promises zzso as a potential therapeutic agent for tumor zzso and tumor growth of melanoma zzso
