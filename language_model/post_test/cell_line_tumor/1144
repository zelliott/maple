zzso zzso of the head and neck zzso represent the sixth most common cancer among men worldwide and a major cause of morbidity and mortality due to its relatively poor zzso As part of ongoing studies addressing the molecular events underlying tumor progression in zzso we have explored the nature of the zzso pathways in which zzso may promote zzso cell growth in this tumor zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso is a downstream target of zzso zzso and a key regulator of normal and zzso growth and cell fate zzso zzso in this study, we have examined the status of zzso of zzso in different stages of zzso cell zzso development in mice and in clinical samples from zzso zzso By zzso analysis, using a recently developed zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso closely with the progression of mouse skin zzso cell zzso We also observed that zzso of zzso is a frequent event in human zzso because active zzso can be detected in these tumors with a pattern of expression and zzso zzso with the progression of the zzso In line with these zzso zzso was zzso activated in a large fraction of zzso cell zzso We also provide evidence that the zzso signaling zzso may represent a biologically relevant target for a novel zzso agent, zzso which recently has been shown to be active in cellular and zzso models for zzso at zzso safely achievable in clinically relevant zzso
