zzso diseases are a family member of neurodegenerative disorders caused by the zzso of zzso proteins zzso form of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in the brain leads to zzso by the induction of zzso zzso Recent studies implicated zzso in protection against zzso However, the basis of the zzso in prion disease remains zzso Thus, we investigated the influence of zzso on prion zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso by protecting zzso zzso Moreover, the protective effect of zzso against zzso zzso damage was associated with zzso factor 1 alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso expression inhibited the zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression attenuated the zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate for the first time that treatment with zzso prevents prion zzso zzso cell death and that the zzso is induced by zzso zzso This study suggests that treatment with zzso may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for zzso zzso
