Previous studies have suggested that zzso zzso an inflammatory zzso expressed predominantly by zzso cells, is highly expressed in tumor tissue and may help tumors to evade immune zzso In this study, the significance of zzso expression in the tumors of zzso models of breast cancer was zzso zzso mice were injected with zzso or zzso breast cancer cell lines to establish breast zzso The expression of zzso in tumor tissue was detected by western zzso 1 and 4 weeks later, which revealed that it increased with tumor progression ( zzso Additionally, tumor cells and zzso zzso were isolated from tumor zzso and cultured for 5 days with stimulation by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Culture media from zzso tumor cells or zzso zzso were harvested and their zzso of zzso were tested by zzso zzso cells zzso low levels of zzso into the zzso however, zzso from tumor zzso zzso high levels of zzso with zzso tumors zzso higher levels of zzso than zzso tumors ( zzso To evaluate the effect of zzso on the proliferation of tumor cells, zzso cells were cultured in the presence or absence of zzso zzso and cell numbers were counted on day 5 of zzso zzso zzso did not promote the proliferation of tumor cells zzso To further understand the effect of zzso expression within tumors, zzso zzso mice were injected with zzso zzso or saline via the tail zzso zzso size was measured up to 21 days following the initial infusion of zzso zzso infusion resulted in an increased tumor volume and zzso density (as measured by the zzso detection of zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression within tumor zzso appears to originate from zzso zzso and is likely to promote tumor growth by enhancing zzso
