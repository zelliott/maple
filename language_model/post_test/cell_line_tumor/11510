Human and mouse zzso zzso both induce target cell zzso in concert with zzso zzso zzso however the mechanisms by which other zzso induce zzso death remain controversial and poorly zzso We used zzso zzso to document, zzso and in real time, the death of target cells exposed to primary natural killer zzso cells from mice deficient in key zzso We found that in the vast majority of cases, zzso cells from zzso mice induced classic zzso However, zzso cells from zzso zzso zzso mice induced a novel form of cell death zzso by slower zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells initially contracted but did not undergo membrane zzso and zzso zzso was delayed until the onset of secondary zzso As it is different from any cell death process previously reported, we tentatively termed this cell death zzso Two independent lines of evidence showed this alternate form of death was due to zzso zzso first, cell death was revealed in the absence of zzso B, but was completely lost when the zzso cells were deficient in both zzso A and zzso second, the zzso zzso was precisely reproduced when zzso mouse zzso A was delivered by an otherwise innocuous dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not require zzso zzso early zzso disruption or generation of zzso oxygen species, but did require an intact zzso zzso and was abolished by zzso B and zzso zzso This work defines an authentic role for mouse zzso A in zzso cell death by zzso zzso
