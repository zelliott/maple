Heat shock proteins zzso are protective in models of zzso yet practical strategies to zzso them remain zzso The heat shock protein zzso agent zzso zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso are known to zzso zzso and zzso cellular protection but have not been investigated in a model relevant to zzso We examined the ability of zzso to zzso zzso expression and zzso protection in zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso and in a mouse model of kidney zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression was increased zzso times in zzso cells treated with zzso and zzso and DNA binding of heat shock zzso zzso zzso were zzso A three- and twofold increase in zzso and zzso protein zzso respectively, was found in zzso cells treated with zzso zzso protected zzso cells from an zzso zzso stress, and zzso short interfering zzso was found to abrogate zzso zzso induction and zzso In zzso zzso was zzso in the zzso liver, zzso and heart of zzso zzso This was associated with a functional and zzso zzso protection from zzso zzso zzso zzso mediate zzso of protective zzso in mouse zzso which are associated with reduced zzso injury and may be useful in reducing zzso kidney zzso
