zzso is a novel, highly prostate zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso expression is significantly higher in prostate cancer zzso cells of African-American men than in zzso men zzso Further, increased zzso expression associates with normal prostate zzso cells of zzso patients with a family history of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso cells promotes cell proliferation and a dramatic increase in colony formation, suggesting a biological role of zzso in cell growth zzso Taken together, the cell zzso zzso functions of zzso and the association of its increased expression with high-risk zzso patients suggest the potential roles of zzso in zzso zzso especially in these high-risk zzso
