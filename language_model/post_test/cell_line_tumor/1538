The previous study indicated that zzso was an important zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms that zzso zzso the expression of zzso remain incompletely zzso In this paper, we showed that the expression of zzso was significantly increased by testosterone at all zzso tested at the protein and zzso levels in zzso cells, the selective zzso zzso zzso obviously inhibited the effect in a zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that testosterone significantly increased the zzso level of zzso zzso zzso viral zzso zzso a key zzso of the zzso zzso zzso signaling pathway, while a specific zzso inhibitor zzso obviously prevented the zzso of zzso zzso In addition, the zzso inhibitor zzso also markedly blocked the zzso expression of zzso gene induced by testosterone at the protein and zzso zzso zzso the above results suggested that testosterone regulated the expression of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso and the zzso zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso zzso
