zzso of the zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso gene occurs in zzso of human clear cell zzso cell zzso zzso and leads to the stable expression of the zzso factors zzso and zzso The zzso expression of zzso in a majority of zzso tumors is zzso given that zzso functions as a tumor zzso in zzso whereas zzso clearly enhances tumor zzso We demonstrate here that zzso and zzso specifically bind and inhibit expression of zzso zzso and that the locus zzso zzso and zzso is selectively zzso in zzso zzso tumors expressing both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression increases zzso levels in zzso zzso cells and promotes cellular zzso zzso and zzso tumor zzso Our results indicate that zzso and zzso repression enhances zzso expression and suggests a mechanism zzso the zzso effects of zzso zzso expression are attenuated in zzso zzso zzso
