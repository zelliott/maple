Recent advances in zzso zzso and zzso complexity reduction data analysis now permit the evaluation of tens of thousands of zzso zzso simultaneously for a zzso analysis of zzso zzso Using these zzso we created high-resolution zzso maps of 26 pancreatic cancer cell zzso The areas of zzso implicitly served to reveal regions of zzso zzso The zzso maps were verified by a panel of 317 zzso markers used in a subset of seven samples, showing a zzso zzso between zzso zzso Three matched zzso pairs were used to estimate the zzso and potential zzso rates for identifying loss of zzso zzso regions zzso minimal region of loss, zzso zzso and zzso regions zzso zzso gap distance, zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso fractional zzso loss calculations showed that cumulative levels of zzso loss ranged widely from zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Regional increases in zzso zzso combined with copy number loss estimates were used to identify 41 zzso deletions (19 first zzso implicating an additional 13 regions disrupted in pancreatic zzso zzso 23 of these occurred in just two lines zzso and zzso suggesting the existence of at least two zzso of zzso instability zzso patterns, distinguished here by zzso loss and copy number changes zzso zzso and those also highly enriched in the zzso zzso of zzso deletions zzso zzso This study provides previously unavailable high-resolution zzso and deletion zzso maps in widely shared pancreatic cancer cell lines and effectively eliminates the need for matched normal tissue to define zzso zzso
