The polarization of a zzso generally results in the formation of one zzso and multiple zzso allowing for the establishment of zzso zzso The molecular mechanisms involved in zzso one zzso to become the zzso particularly those regulating the zzso network, remain zzso Here we report the identification of zzso a member of the zzso protein zzso as a zzso zzso zzso that is zzso distributed in zzso zzso zzso and selectively expressed in the zzso zzso of zzso expression prevents zzso formation, whereas zzso zzso formation of multiple zzso We further demonstrate that zzso and zzso zzso lead to zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso in the nascent zzso and that this event is important for zzso zzso Our findings unveil a zzso linking the zzso zzso zzso to a zzso regulatory protein and highlight the contribution of zzso network regulation to zzso zzso
