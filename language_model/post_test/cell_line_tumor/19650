zzso zzso complexes produce emissions with the zzso zzso at half maximum; however, their significant use in zzso required an increase in zzso zzso The companion review, zzso et zzso zzso zzso described a new technique for the enhancement of zzso zzso the zzso Energy Transfer zzso zzso zzso effect, which increases zzso and is compatible with standard slide zzso 

The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso complex, zzso was increased by employing the zzso zzso After adding the zzso zzso zzso complex of the zzso zzso zzso or the sodium salt of zzso in ethanol solution, the zzso sample was allowed to zzso Both a conventional arc lamp and a zzso zzso LED served as light sources for microscopic zzso The zzso intensity was measured with a zzso zzso Multiple zzso images were summed with special software to permit analysis and effective presentation of the final zzso 

With the zzso effect, the zzso of the zzso zzso increased at least zzso upon zzso zzso of zzso cells were stained with zzso and zzso with zzso to which a zzso zzso was subsequently zzso zzso images showed the zzso zzso zzso but did not show the short-lived zzso zzso Imaging of zzso cells with an arc lamp showed that both S phase and zzso cells were labeled, and that their labeling patterns were zzso The images of the zzso zzso and fluorescent zzso were combined to produce a color image on a white zzso This combination of simple chemistry, zzso and presentation should make possible the inexpensive use of the zzso zzso zzso zzso as molecular zzso for zzso and zzso microscopic zzso
