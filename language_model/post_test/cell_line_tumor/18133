zzso is a zzso hormone that regulates systemic iron zzso zzso expression is zzso upon iron overload or inflammation while iron zzso anemia and tissue zzso are negative zzso We investigated the involvement of zzso zzso zzso and other zzso factors in the hypoxic suppression of zzso 

Northern zzso analysis and real time zzso were used to determine zzso zzso levels in zzso cells and zzso promoter activity was measured using zzso cells zzso with suitable reporter zzso under various zzso 

Treatment of human cultured zzso cells with zzso or known zzso of zzso zzso such as the iron zzso zzso zzso or the zzso analogue zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso levels and zzso its gene promoter zzso This effect was not dependent on the zzso or other known putative response elements in the zzso promoter and was observed even under zzso zzso 

zzso zzso are important to maintain high zzso zzso expression in a zzso zzso We suggest that zzso of zzso activity may be of therapeutic value in zzso zzso
