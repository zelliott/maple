The effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso alone or in zzso were investigated by focusing on zzso growth zzso and zzso zzso in the acute zzso leukemia zzso cell line zzso zzso induced differentiation at low zzso zzso zzso and zzso at high zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso induced greater differentiation than zzso No synergistic effect of zzso and zzso was found on zzso zzso promoted zzso activities of both zzso and zzso The combination of zzso and zzso showed maximum differentiation and zzso addition was not zzso zzso of 1 zzso zzso and/or 50 zzso zzso to zzso did not affect zzso compared to zzso treatment zzso zzso induced expression of zzso zzso a zzso zzso recognized as a major zzso of zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso However, treatment with 1 zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso by zzso compared to control zzso Although zzso addition did not enhance zzso expression in the cells, the reduced zzso zzso was recovered to the same level as that in zzso zzso decreased cell viability and addition of 50 zzso zzso to zzso significantly increased the number of viable cells compared with that in zzso alone treated zzso zzso not only promotes zzso activities of both zzso and zzso but also makes zzso cells vulnerable to increased zzso zzso These observations provide new insights into combination therapy using these three agents for the treatment of zzso
