zzso cancer is one of the most intractable of zzso However, the comprehensive view of zzso zzso in this tumor is far from zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene family, which encodes important regulators of various signal zzso zzso is one of the most frequently altered gene families in human zzso 

To clarify the zzso zzso profile of zzso in pancreatic cancer, we performed a systematic screening of zzso in the zzso zzso of all human zzso genes zzso zzso of 90 genes in total) in 11 pancreatic cancer cell lines and 29 zzso primary zzso 

We identified 15 zzso zzso that included 9 DNA zzso in cell lines and 6 zzso zzso in primary zzso In particular, we identified the previously reported zzso zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso tumor and 2 zzso zzso in the zzso family of zzso zzso and zzso that would be expected to cause structural zzso 

Our zzso zzso approach revealed novel zzso pathways in pancreatic zzso
