The long-term effects of zzso oxide zzso on cell zzso to zzso killing have been zzso using a human breast tumor line zzso zzso cells were exposed to a zzso dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 20 h later were metabolically zzso with zzso IX zzso by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso was allowed to diffuse to peripheral sites, including plasma zzso after which a zzso challenge was zzso Active (but not zzso zzso made cells substantially more resistant to zzso zzso than zzso zzso A similar response to a zzso zzso challenge was zzso zzso was detected approximately 8 h zzso zzso after approximately 20 zzso and reflected diminished zzso zzso as determined with zzso zzso free iron determined with the fluorescent probe zzso rose to approximately zzso of the control level 6 h after zzso but declined to approximately zzso after 24 zzso zzso analyses revealed a rapid early zzso 2 h zzso increase in zzso zzso level, followed by a gradual zzso h zzso increase in zzso zzso of these proteins is consistent with a zzso mechanism involving zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso also induced a long-term zzso in underlying zzso zzso zzso This response was abolished by zzso indicating that NO from induced zzso oxide zzso was zzso The NO effects described are entirely novel in the context of zzso stress and provide new insights into how NO might affect zzso zzso therapy zzso
