In Ewing's zzso family of zzso zzso the clinically most adverse zzso parameters are the presence of zzso zzso at time of diagnosis and poor response to zzso zzso To identify genes zzso regulated between zzso and zzso zzso we zzso 27 zzso specimens using zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso regulated genes revealed 29 zzso pathways including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of primary zzso zzso induced by zzso was found to be correlated with the expression of genes involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, and zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings could be confirmed by in zzso zzso zzso A set of 46 marker genes correctly zzso these 20 zzso as responding versus zzso We conclude that expression signatures of initial zzso zzso can help to identify zzso patients at high risk to develop zzso zzso or to suffer from a therapy zzso zzso
