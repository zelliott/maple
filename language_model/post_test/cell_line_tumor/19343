zzso zzso zzso enhance zzso analgesia and reduce zzso tolerance and dependence by preventing a G protein zzso switch zzso to zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso although the binding site of such zzso zzso zzso was previously zzso Here we show that with approximately zzso higher affinity than for the zzso zzso zzso zzso binds a zzso segment of the scaffolding protein zzso A, known to interact with the zzso zzso zzso to disrupt its chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso A is demonstrated by the absence of zzso zzso binding in the melanoma zzso cell line that does not contain zzso or zzso contrasting with strong zzso binding to its zzso zzso zzso A7 or to zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to A7 cells was displaced by zzso but not by zzso indicating a target distinct from zzso receptors and perhaps unique to zzso and its zzso The zzso location of this binding site was confirmed by zzso binding in intact A7 zzso Overlapping zzso fragments from zzso zzso A revealed zzso zzso as the binding site, and an zzso scan of this zzso revealed an essential zzso zzso Finally, in zzso zzso slice cultures, zzso fragments containing zzso zzso abolished the prevention by 10 zzso zzso of both the chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the downstream zzso zzso zzso These results establish zzso A as the target for zzso zzso zzso previously shown to enhance zzso analgesia and to prevent zzso tolerance and zzso
