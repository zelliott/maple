zzso zzso of tumor zzso genes plays an important role in zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we explore a novel target gene of zzso zzso in zzso zzso which is zzso by promoter zzso 

zzso expression levels of zzso were evaluated by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso status was addressed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso expression was zzso in 4 of 5 zzso cell zzso zzso was zzso zzso in 4 of 5 zzso cell lines zzso and in 48 of 65 zzso primary tumors zzso but not in any of the 12 normal zzso zzso zzso zzso expression could be zzso in zzso cells after treatment with the zzso agent zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso is a frequent and zzso event in zzso Our findings suggest that zzso is a candidate tumor zzso gene in zzso
