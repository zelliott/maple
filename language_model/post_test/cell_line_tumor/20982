zzso hormone zzso plays a central role in controlling stress zzso In this study, we aimed to identify the regulatory effect of zzso zzso zzso on zzso and the underlying zzso We investigated the regulation of zzso zzso in the zzso cell line, a human zzso cell line which express zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso chain reactions showed that in the presence of zzso zzso zzso alpha or zzso beta in zzso cells increased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in this cell line also showed that both zzso alpha and zzso beta can be recruited to the zzso promoter with the treatment of zzso However, zzso mobility shift zzso did not show direct binding between zzso receptors and two zzso response elements zzso half sites in the zzso zzso To clarify the regulatory zzso zzso zzso and reporter gene zzso in the zzso cell line were zzso When the zzso half sites and the zzso regulatory element zzso in the zzso promoter were zzso zzso zzso of zzso promoter activity zzso Between the two zzso half sites zzso the zzso zzso half site contributed more to the zzso zzso expression induced by zzso In zzso our results confirm the stimulation of zzso alpha and zzso beta on zzso expression and demonstrate the important roles of the zzso half sites and zzso for the action of zzso alpha and zzso zzso
