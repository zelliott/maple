The zzso gene encodes a zzso which is induced by zzso and many other zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso repression of zzso by zzso has been a subject of intensive study for several years, as it may explain how zzso promotes cell cycle zzso Recently, we reported a novel mechanism which allows zzso to repress zzso zzso triggers a zzso cascade by directly inducing the gene zzso the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso which binds to recognition motifs located in the vicinity of the zzso promoter and mediates zzso repression of zzso zzso zzso interferes with induction of zzso via the DNA damage zzso or zzso pathways and during zzso zzso the expression patterns of zzso and zzso strictly overlap in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we survey the recent findings and discuss the role of zzso for zzso function and its potential application for cancer diagnosis and zzso
