Since zzso high-risk human zzso zzso E6 can target and degrade the tumor zzso zzso it is recognized as a major zzso agent of cervical zzso However, to date the distribution of high-risk zzso protein remains zzso Thus, in the present study we used a zzso green fluorescent protein zzso expression system to express a zzso fusion protein zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells, such as zzso and zzso cells to investigate the trafficking and zzso of E6 and zzso Following zzso we observed that the zzso zzso was a nuclear zzso and that zzso zzso zzso localized to the nucleus together with zzso zzso zzso levels were not decreased but increased in zzso zzso with zzso Furthermore, we observed significant zzso induced by zzso which proved to be dependent on zzso zzso
