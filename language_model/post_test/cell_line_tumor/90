Clinical management of pancreatic cancer is a major problem, which is in part due to both de zzso and acquired resistance to conventional zzso Here, we present in zzso and in zzso zzso evidence in support of zzso of pancreatic cancer cells by zzso zzso a natural compound that can be easily obtained by consuming zzso zzso zzso zzso of pancreatic cancer cells led to a significantly increased zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso agents zzso zzso and zzso compared with zzso It is known that resistance to chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer is associated with zzso activated nuclear zzso zzso which becomes further activated by zzso zzso Our data provide zzso evidence for the first time showing that zzso zzso the killing of pancreatic cancer cells by zzso of zzso as well as drug-induced zzso of zzso and its downstream genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso Most importantly, using an zzso animal model, we found reduction in tumor size zzso zzso zzso when zzso was given in combination with zzso compared with zzso This was accompanied by loss of zzso and zzso of zzso activity and its downstream genes zzso zzso and zzso which correlated with reduced cell proliferation (as assessed by zzso zzso of tumor zzso and evidence of zzso zzso assessed by zzso zzso zzso and terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso These results provide strong in zzso evidence in support of our hypothesis that zzso could abrogate zzso drug zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso of zzso resulting in the zzso of pancreatic tumors to conventional zzso
