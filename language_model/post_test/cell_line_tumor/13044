The development of in zzso zzso zzso as an alternative method to animal zzso is of growing interest in the context of the zzso of new regulations on zzso However, zzso of toxicity data from in zzso systems to in zzso models is hampered by the fact that in zzso systems vary in their capability to metabolize zzso and that zzso can greatly influence the experimental zzso zzso much attention has to be paid to the cellular models used and experimental zzso zzso aromatic zzso zzso are zzso ubiquitous zzso Human exposure to zzso is mainly from food zzso In this study, a detailed analysis of the zzso capabilities of three human cell lines commonly used for in zzso testing zzso zzso and zzso was undertaken using 3 model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso of these zzso was investigated in different cell lines, using a new zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso rates of zzso zzso and zzso were similar in zzso and zzso cell lines, respectively, though with the production of different zzso The zzso cell line was shown to express very limited zzso zzso We demonstrated that the zzso having a high zzso rate zzso and zzso were zzso from zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso The present study shows that zzso measurement in human cell lines competent for the zzso is an efficient and sensitive zzso zzso requiring less cells and time than other currently available zzso
