With a view toward developing a rugged zzso zzso a sheath flow system was zzso in hard plastic zzso for analysis of particles and cells using optical zzso Six optical fibers were incorporated into the interrogation region of the zzso in which zzso focusing narrowed the core stream to zzso zzso zzso 40 zzso The use of a relatively large channel at the inlet as well as in the interrogation region zzso zzso zzso 125 zzso successfully minimized the risk of zzso The device could withstand pressures greater than 100 zzso without zzso zzso using both coded zzso and cells were demonstrated using the zzso zzso zzso zzso detected nine different bacteria and toxins using a single mixture of coded zzso zzso cancer cells processed with locked zzso acid zzso were evaluated using zzso in zzso zzso
