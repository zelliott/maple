zzso melanoma is the most aggressive skin zzso it is highly zzso and responds poorly to current zzso The expression of zzso growth factor receptors zzso is reported to be reduced in zzso melanoma compared with benign zzso or normal zzso we then hypothesized that zzso may control growth of melanoma zzso We show here that melanoma cells zzso zzso respond to serum with a significantly lower proliferation compared with that of zzso zzso cell cycle arrest, zzso zzso and DNA synthesis zzso were also observed in cells zzso zzso zzso was rescued by zzso zzso allowing to exclude zzso toxic effects and indicating that zzso mediates zzso zzso signals in melanoma zzso zzso zzso was found to mediate zzso zzso A protein zzso analysis of the zzso protein zzso zzso revealed that melanoma cells zzso zzso show a strong reduction of zzso zzso in zzso 63 and of protein zzso zzso and a marked increase of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso 3, and signal regulatory protein zzso protein zzso In a mouse model of primary melanoma growth, infection with the zzso zzso zzso reached a significant zzso zzso of primary melanoma growth zzso zzso zzso and a similar zzso of tumor zzso All together, these data demonstrate that zzso strongly zzso melanoma growth likely through zzso mechanisms and indicate a novel zzso mechanism involved in melanoma zzso
