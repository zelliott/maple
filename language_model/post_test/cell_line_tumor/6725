The zzso zzso and zzso checkpoint zzso has a crucial role in regulating the cellular responses to DNA damage and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the regulatory partner of zzso binds directly to replication protein A zzso zzso and enables the zzso complex to recognize this DNA zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso associates with zzso through multiple zzso Two major zzso zzso of zzso were mapped to the regions zzso the zzso zzso zzso In contrast to a recent article, we found that zzso zzso lacking the N zzso retained the ability to bind to zzso suggesting that the multiple interactions between zzso and zzso may function zzso in the recruitment of zzso zzso one internal region of zzso exhibited affinity to zzso suggesting that zzso may interact with zzso in the zzso zzso Also, the N zzso of zzso associated with zzso in two distinct ways, indicating a dynamic and regulated association between zzso and zzso
