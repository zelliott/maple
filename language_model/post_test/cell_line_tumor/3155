Recent published reports on clinical trials of zzso indicate the effectiveness of this compound, a zzso of zzso against zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso growth factor zzso Here, we determined if zzso and zzso incorporating zzso can be an appropriate zzso for zzso treatment compared with zzso In zzso zzso was evaluated against several zzso lines with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso For the in zzso test, a human zzso line zzso zzso with the zzso gene was zzso into nude mice brain for zzso analysis by zzso zzso and zzso liquid zzso after intravenous injection of zzso and zzso In zzso zzso activity of zzso and zzso was evaluated by zzso image and zzso zzso The zzso effects of zzso were zzso to zzso more potent than those of zzso zzso enhanced and prolonged distribution of free zzso in the zzso was observed after zzso injection compared with zzso zzso showed significantly potent zzso activity against an zzso zzso zzso zzso and significantly longer survival rate than zzso zzso zzso zzso This implies that zzso can pass through the blood brain tumor barrier zzso zzso which combines enhanced distribution with prolonged sustained release, may be ideal for zzso zzso Currently, a phase I study of zzso is almost complete in Japan and the zzso The present zzso study warrants the clinical phase II study of zzso in patients with zzso zzso
