Loss of zzso in zzso stem cells is associated with enhanced zzso capacity and might facilitate progression of damaged stem cells into zzso cells that give rise to zzso This is also reflected by the frequent loss of the zzso locus in acute zzso zzso zzso zzso acute zzso leukemia cells designed to zzso express zzso arrest in the zzso phase of the cell cycle and show increased sensitivity to zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso To investigate the underlying molecular mechanism for increased death sensitivity, we zzso with specific steps of zzso signaling by expression of zzso zzso We found that zzso in cell death zzso resulted from changes in the composition of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso repression of zzso zzso and zzso and the induction of zzso zzso zzso with zzso induction by short hairpin zzso technology or zzso expression of zzso or zzso significantly reduced both zzso and zzso cell death in zzso leukemia zzso These results suggest that zzso in concert with zzso and zzso repression, critically mediates zzso death zzso and that in human zzso leukemia the deletion of zzso zzso zzso resistance by shifting the balance of zzso and zzso zzso proteins toward zzso zzso
