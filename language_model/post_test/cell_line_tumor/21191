The molecular causes for resistance of melanoma to zzso are currently only partly zzso In the present study, we examined gene transfer and expression of the zzso zzso protein zzso as an alternative approach to chemotherapy and investigated the molecular mechanisms regulating zzso zzso zzso gene transfer caused zzso of both zzso and, as shown for the first time, also the zzso zzso resulting in the zzso of zzso oxygen zzso Interestingly, expression of zzso not only triggered the classical zzso zzso zzso but also resulted in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and its downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of these zzso was abolished by zzso Moreover, zzso of the zzso by zzso interference or pharmacological zzso significantly attenuated zzso zzso Thus, our data provide evidence for the involvement of multiple pathways in zzso zzso that are triggered at zzso and the zzso zzso and suggest zzso gene transfer as a complementary approach to zzso
