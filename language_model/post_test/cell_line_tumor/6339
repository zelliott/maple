zzso zzso membrane cassette zzso A1 zzso and zzso play a crucial role in zzso cholesterol zzso which is a novel therapeutic target for zzso Advanced zzso end products zzso and their zzso zzso axis is involved in accelerated zzso in diabetes as zzso However, the role of zzso axis in zzso cholesterol zzso is not fully zzso We examined here whether zzso axis could impair cholesterol zzso from human zzso cells, zzso cells by suppressing zzso and zzso zzso We further investigated the effects of zzso on cholesterol zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso oxygen species generation in zzso cells, which was completely inhibited by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso cells was significantly prevented by zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso and zzso zzso levels, and subsequently reduced cholesterol zzso from zzso cells, which was prevented by zzso zzso zzso the effects of zzso The results demonstrated that zzso could inhibit the zzso reduction of zzso zzso cholesterol zzso by suppressing zzso zzso activity via zzso of zzso of zzso Our present study provides a novel beneficial aspect of zzso in zzso zzso may prevent the development and progression of zzso in diabetes by not only reducing serum cholesterol level, but also by improving cholesterol zzso from foam cells of the zzso wall via blocking the harmful effects of zzso on zzso
