To construct zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso against zzso containing zzso promoter, then zzso them into human liver cancer cell line zzso to observe the action of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on proliferation and zzso of human liver cancer cell zzso 

zzso expressing zzso zzso and zzso zzso were constructed and zzso into zzso using zzso zzso with zzso as the control zzso After strict screening by zzso positive clones were zzso the amount of expression of zzso and zzso was detected by zzso cell proliferation by zzso zzso activity by zzso and silver zzso zzso cell zzso by zzso 

We found that the two zzso were expressed persistently in zzso different expression levels zzso zzso zzso of zzso among zzso zzso and zzso was exhibited by the analysis of zzso with zzso zzso The difference between zzso and the others is significant in zzso zzso zzso zzso while there was no difference between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso With the advance of cell division, zzso activities of the cells treated by zzso and zzso decreased zzso and the percentage of zzso of the cells zzso with zzso and zzso increased zzso The zzso percentage of zzso zzso was zzso while those of zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso level of zzso induced by zzso zzso increases as cells zzso and this zzso maybe a potential approach for liver cancer gene zzso
