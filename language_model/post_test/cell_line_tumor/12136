We investigated the survival signals of zzso growth factor zzso in human gastric zzso cell line zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso caused zzso and zzso reactions such as the release of zzso c from zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso However, zzso treatment greatly reduced the zzso zzso as well as these zzso We previously reported that zzso growth factor transmitted protective signals against zzso zzso by causing zzso of the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso in human zzso cell line zzso zzso K & Ito F zzso J zzso zzso zzso However, zzso signaling did not mediate the zzso action of zzso in zzso zzso zzso increased the expression of the zzso zzso an zzso member of the zzso family, but not that of other anti zzso or zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso components of zzso protein 1 zzso which are known to regulate zzso gene transcription, were increased in response to zzso zzso of the cells with zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso and the resistance against zzso zzso suggesting that zzso transmitted the zzso signal in such a way that it activated zzso via a zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso did not display zzso zzso expression or resistance against zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso of zzso expression is critical for protection of zzso cells against zzso zzso
