zzso prostate cancer cells turn zzso resistant through complex mechanisms that involve zzso of zzso We investigated the role of zzso zzso in the progression of prostate cancer as well as the interactions of zzso with zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso analysis was used to study the expression of zzso in a series of 139 prostate zzso and its association with zzso grade and time to hormone zzso zzso of zzso was more abundant in prostate zzso of higher zzso grades and significantly associated with the onset of zzso zzso In zzso interactions of zzso with zzso or zzso in zzso and zzso zzso and zzso cells were investigated by means of zzso In the absence of any zzso zzso interacts with zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cells but only with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso and zzso were also evidenced in zzso from high-grade prostate cancer zzso In zzso cells treated with zzso an inhibitor of zzso I, the interaction between zzso and zzso was absent after 36 zzso zzso decreased gradually and zzso increased coincidentally with the progress of zzso These results support a model in which zzso would exert an zzso effect over zzso via zzso We propose that these interactions may provide mechanisms for suppressing the activity of zzso zzso and zzso in prostate cancer cells and that zzso expression contributes to zzso resistance and progression of prostate zzso
