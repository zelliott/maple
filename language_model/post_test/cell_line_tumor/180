The purpose of this study was to develop and characterize a human zzso in a zzso zzso zzso format zzso that is directed specifically against zzso zzso 

The synthetic zzso Gold human zzso zzso display library was used to select zzso specific against zzso zzso binding properties were analyzed by surface zzso zzso specificity was confirmed with zzso zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso on a panel of zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso 

Surface zzso resonance studies indicated zzso zzso to be the clone with the highest affinity against zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso efficiently stained zzso cells and recognized its zzso in zzso zzso zzso that was performed with zzso zzso zzso zzso native protein zzso which suggested that a zzso zzso is recognized by this zzso Cell surface zzso with laser scanning zzso zzso confirmed the specific binding to the native membrane zzso 

zzso zzso may represent a novel zzso agent against zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and other human zzso that zzso zzso
