zzso acid zzso zzso a key player in the de zzso synthetic zzso of zzso fatty zzso has been shown to contribute to the zzso in various types of solid zzso We here report that zzso is highly and consistently expressed in mantle cell zzso zzso an aggressive form of zzso zzso zzso Specifically, the expression of zzso was zzso in all four zzso cell lines and 15 tumors zzso In contrast, benign zzso zzso and peripheral blood zzso cells from normal donors were zzso Treatment of zzso cell lines with zzso a zzso zzso resulted in significant zzso zzso of zzso expression using zzso which also significantly decreased the growth of zzso cells, led to a dramatic decrease in the zzso D1 zzso zzso which has been previously reported to be zzso in a subset of zzso tumors, contributed to the high level of zzso in zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso of zzso in turn zzso zzso In conclusion, our data supports the concept that zzso contributes to the zzso of zzso by collaborating with zzso In view of its high and consistent expression in zzso zzso zzso may hold promises for treating zzso
