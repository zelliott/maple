zzso to zzso drugs is a major issue in the successful treatment of acute zzso leukemia zzso In this study, we developed an zzso cell line zzso that is resistant to treatment with a combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso by chronic exposure for more than 3 zzso We then investigated the ability of zzso to alleviate the zzso of zzso zzso Treatment with zzso alone induced growth arrest, but not the death of zzso zzso However, when zzso cells were treated with combinations of zzso and zzso the cell death and zzso rate of zzso cells were significantly increased in a zzso and zzso zzso The combined treatment with zzso and zzso caused the collapse of the zzso membrane potential and was also demonstrated to enhance the activities of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso expression of the zzso and zzso zzso which were zzso in zzso zzso Taken together, the results of this study suggest that zzso can be used to increase the therapeutic potential against drug-resistant zzso when combined with zzso zzso
