zzso zzso and zzso oxide zzso production are important for cancer zzso zzso of zzso may be used to inhibit liver tumors with low zzso zzso zzso zzso In this report, we investigated an alternative therapeutic approach by targeting zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso induced by zzso zzso stress and is zzso in some human liver zzso zzso of zzso expression by short hairpin zzso zzso in three liver cancer cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso decreased colony formation in zzso and tumor growth in zzso Furthermore, zzso infection of zzso zzso inhibited tumor growth in a therapeutic animal tumor zzso Analysis of zzso zzso on the zzso progression revealed a zzso zzso Among zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso restored the cell growth in zzso zzso zzso was observed in the cells treated with zzso zzso as shown by an increase in zzso levels and zzso zzso The total cellular zzso level was not altered zzso zzso of zzso further attenuated cell growth, suggesting that zzso induced by zzso zzso plays a feedback zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduced NO content, and addition of NO donor partially recovered the growth zzso by zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso attenuated tumor growth and the zzso was mainly zzso by a decrease of zzso zzso and zzso
