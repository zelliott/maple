zzso zzso zzso has high mortality partly due to acquiring drug resistance during chemotherapy zzso zzso it is necessary to explore the underlying mechanism of drug zzso 

We used zzso and zzso analysis to explore the possible molecular insight into zzso resistance in zzso The zzso expressed proteins were validated by Western zzso zzso 

We identified 102 unique proteins including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso and zzso enhanced zzso cells to zzso zzso 

Our study suggests that targeting drug resistant genes such as zzso and zzso could be a novel approach to overcome zzso resistance in zzso zzso
