The fragile zzso zzso zzso gene located on zzso zzso is frequently deleted in human zzso We have previously reported deletions at the zzso locus in 50% of zzso zzso derived cell lines and reduced expression in zzso of primary transitional zzso of the urinary zzso To additionally investigate the role of zzso zzso in the development of zzso cancer, we used zzso and zzso zzso mice in a chemically induced zzso zzso zzso showed that 8 of 28 zzso and 6 of 13 zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso respectively, versus 2 of 25 zzso zzso zzso mice developed invasive zzso after treatment with zzso zzso To explore the possibility of a zzso gene therapy for zzso cancer, we studied the effects of restored zzso protein expression on cell zzso cell zzso and zzso in zzso nude mice, with human zzso zzso transitional zzso derived zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells with zzso inhibited cell growth, increased zzso cell population, and suppressed zzso tumor growth in nude zzso These findings suggest the important role of zzso in zzso cancer development and support the effort to additionally investigate a zzso gene zzso
