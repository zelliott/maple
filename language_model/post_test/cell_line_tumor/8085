zzso zzso is a zzso zzso member that mediates the zzso signal resulting in T cells and zzso cells proliferation and zzso production, but the effects of zzso signaling on zzso cell zzso have not been zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of zzso signaling on regulation of zzso cell zzso zzso zzso or mouse zzso zzso control was added to zzso cell culture to determine the effects of proliferation and zzso effects on zzso zzso We observed that zzso zzso could dramatically promote proliferation of zzso zzso And zzso cells and zzso cell zzso within them possessed higher ability to kill tumor cell line zzso The zzso mice zzso with zzso cells and treated with zzso cells have prolonged zzso Further studies revealed that the percentages of zzso cells were elevated significantly in zzso zzso The expression of zzso was zzso on zzso cells from zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso increased significantly whereas the production of zzso zzso and zzso decreased in zzso cells from zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso can elevate the capacity of zzso cells to induce zzso zzso zzso We further showed that the zzso zzso also had the same effects on zzso cells expanded from the zzso of patients with zzso We concluded that zzso signaling could enhance the abilities of zzso cells to kill tumor cells in zzso and in zzso via increasing the proportion of zzso cells and their zzso Furthermore, zzso signaling can elevate the capacity of zzso cells to induce zzso zzso responses which may enhance their zzso activity zzso Taken together, our studies could be considered as valuable in zzso zzso cancer zzso
