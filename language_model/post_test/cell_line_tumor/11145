To study effects of zzso associated with zzso on human zzso zzso cell zzso strain zzso 

Using techniques of tumor cells culture in zzso zzso cells were exposed to different concentration zzso as 0, zzso zzso zzso zzso then 5 zzso radiation were given after an zzso Other groups zzso culture cells were also exposed to different concentration zzso as 5, 10, 20, 25 zzso and no radiation were zzso In all groups, contrast group was set zzso And 48 hours later, growth characteristics of zzso were studied by zzso zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso 

In normal contrast group, zzso cells grew zzso and contacted with each zzso And cellular swelling was found when zzso cells were only treated with zzso When zzso cells were treated with both zzso and zzso more cells swelled and cell number declined zzso In higher dose zzso group, necrosis could be zzso zzso zzso showed the zzso cells growth was significantly inhibited when treated with both zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed zzso could block cell growth at zzso phase and induced zzso cells into zzso whether with zzso or zzso But zzso cells only treated with zzso could not get same powerful effect as combination with zzso 

Human zzso zzso cell zzso strain zzso can be inhibited and induced into zzso by treated with zzso combination with zzso
