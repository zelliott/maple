The efficiency and specificity of gene transfer with human zzso zzso gene transfer zzso would be improved if the native viral zzso could be zzso Here, we demonstrate that the minor zzso protein IX zzso which is present in 240 copies in the Ad zzso can be exploited as an anchor for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso in zzso helper cells expressing zzso zzso with zzso zzso extensions of up to 113 zzso acids in zzso The extensions evaluated consist of zzso zzso up to 75 A in length and to which zzso zzso were zzso The zzso zzso were efficiently incorporated into the zzso of Ad zzso On intact zzso the zzso molecules were readily accessible to zzso zzso as demonstrated by electron microscopic analyses of zzso virus zzso The labeling efficiency improved with increasing zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso lift and expose the zzso at the zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that the addition of an zzso zzso motif to the zzso markedly zzso the zzso of zzso group B and zzso zzso zzso cells, demonstrating the utility of zzso modification in gene zzso Our data demonstrate that the minor zzso protein IX can be used as an anchor for the addition of zzso zzso to Ad zzso
