The quest for novel materials as scaffolds with suitable zzso for supporting tissue zzso in tissue engineering and zzso medicine zzso is zzso In this paper we report an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scaffold for applications in zzso The novel three-dimensional scaffold is highly interconnected and zzso with a pore size of 150 zzso zzso of zzso and water zzso capacity of zzso zzso revealed a typical zzso structure of zzso The scaffold has zzso and mechanical properties superior to those of zzso zzso as revealed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The scaffold exhibited satisfactory blood zzso as determined by zzso zzso zzso count, zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso The scaffold was found to be zzso with human cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso for a period of up to 4 zzso zzso analysis revealed excellent attachment, spreading and migration of cells in the zzso zzso zzso was performed to estimate the viability and growth of cells in the zzso zzso of collagen in zzso zzso was done by zzso red zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso and zzso oxide zzso in spent culture medium showed the zzso ability to promote zzso Finally, the zzso of the scaffold was determined by the weight loss observed upon treatment with zzso over a period of 4 zzso The results reveal that the zzso from zzso zzso is a promising candidate as a zzso zzso and zzso zzso of natural origin for applications in zzso
