The zzso zzso a zzso zzso is expressed on all tumors of zzso origin, including melanoma, zzso zzso and small cell lung zzso Due to its specific expression on tumor surfaces, zzso is an attractive target for zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is already applied in melanoma and zzso trials as a passive zzso To establish an active zzso alternative, we aimed to replace the poorly zzso zzso with zzso zzso Previously, we used the zzso zzso to select zzso zzso mimics from a zzso display zzso In the present study, two mimics of the zzso zzso were coupled to zzso zzso zzso and used for zzso zzso zzso zzso of a specific zzso immune response towards the original zzso zzso both zzso and expressed on zzso and melanoma cells, could be demonstrated in zzso Western zzso and zzso As the zzso zzso were of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso were capable of recruiting T cell help and inducing memory zzso In conclusion, we show that an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso can successfully be translated into zzso zzso zzso Our zzso experiments indicate that zzso zzso are suitable for active zzso of zzso zzso
