The zzso pump zzso zzso cassette zzso zzso resistance zzso 1, zzso has long been known to contribute to zzso against cancer zzso We describe the development of a zzso cell line system to allow zzso of zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso The parental zzso human zzso zzso cell line and the zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso expresses high levels of zzso zzso were zzso to express the fluorescent proteins zzso zzso red fluorescent protein zzso and enhanced green fluorescent zzso zzso zzso conditions were zzso and fluorescent zzso of each cell line allowed for the zzso simultaneous comparison of resistance to zzso compounds in sensitive and zzso cell zzso We show that this zzso system retains the zzso of the original lines and is suitable for zzso using zzso zzso flow zzso or laser scanning zzso zzso in zzso plates, enabling the zzso screening of large chemical zzso
