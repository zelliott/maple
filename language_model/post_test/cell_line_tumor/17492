Bone zzso zzso zzso is an important regulator of zzso zzso However, the regulation of zzso zzso by zzso signaling remains poorly zzso Here we examined the role of type I zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso promoted by zzso Despite zzso zzso expression in zzso cells, zzso or zzso zzso increased zzso differentiation similarly as in zzso cells which express zzso as shown by alkaline zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to zzso cells, however, zzso or zzso zzso did not increase zzso and zzso zzso and zzso activity and DNA fragmentation in zzso zzso zzso zzso increased protein zzso C zzso activity, and zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso activity in zzso but not in zzso cells that lack zzso A dominant negative zzso inhibited zzso zzso activity, whereas zzso zzso promoted zzso activity induced by zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso rescued the zzso response to zzso and a zzso active zzso restored the zzso signal in zzso cells, supporting an essential role for zzso in zzso zzso We also assessed whether zzso zzso occurred independently of zzso zzso General zzso of zzso did not abolish zzso alkaline zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso Furthermore, broad zzso zzso increased zzso zzso but did not reverse the zzso effect on zzso in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso was zzso by zzso in zzso and occurred independently of zzso zzso zzso which provides additional insights into the dual mechanism of zzso action on zzso zzso
