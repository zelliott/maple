The studies of interaction with DNA and the zzso activity of a new zzso zzso compound are zzso The ability of this new platinum complex to modify secondary DNA structure was explored by circular zzso zzso zzso mobility showed changes in zzso DNA structure, and atomic force zzso zzso revealed zzso changes of zzso DNA zzso This compound breaks the traditional zzso rules for zzso compounds, but it could be of interest because of its different zzso An zzso bond normally shows a zzso higher than that of an zzso zzso and that fact, a zzso could contribute to a higher DNA binding zzso Several zzso cancer cell lines, resistant and zzso to zzso were exposed to increasing zzso of zzso and complex 5 for 24 zzso after which time the cell zzso was determined by the zzso zzso zzso A lower zzso but also a lower resistant factor was observed for zzso compound 5 than for zzso against zzso and zzso cell zzso This result is consistent with the DNA interaction degree observed by the aforementioned zzso
