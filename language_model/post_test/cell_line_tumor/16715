zzso zzso zzso is an increasingly common cause of chronic liver zzso however, no specific zzso therapy has been shown to be effective in its zzso The present study was designed to develop an experimental cell culture model of NASH using four kinds of fatty acids - zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso - and zzso according to the zzso zzso The saturated fatty acids PA and zzso are more zzso than the zzso fatty acids zzso and zzso Cellular zzso zzso without zzso was more easily induced with the zzso fatty acids than with the saturated fatty zzso PA zzso zzso zzso while the zzso fatty acids attenuated zzso zzso In a zzso study, PA enhanced zzso zzso in the absence of zzso stress, as determined by measuring the cellular zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, PA inhibited the zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso of survival signaling pathways activated by zzso may explain the effects of PA on zzso zzso The in zzso NASH model established in this study may be used to screen drug candidates for suitability for the treatment of zzso
