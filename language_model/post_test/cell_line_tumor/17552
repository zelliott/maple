We have evaluated cell survival, zzso and cell cycle responses in a panel of DNA mismatch repair zzso colon and prostate cancer cell lines after zzso and zzso zzso We show that although these zzso cells tolerate zzso damage, they are as sensitive to zzso damage as are the zzso zzso zzso cells arrest in the zzso phase of the cell cycle and initiate zzso following zzso damage, whereas zzso cells continue zzso However, two prostate cancer cell lines that are zzso surprisingly arrest zzso in zzso after zzso zzso zzso through zzso phase initially depends on the expression of one or more of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso Analysis of zzso D1 expression shows an initial zzso decrease in the protein level after zzso as well as zzso zzso At later time points, however, only DNA zzso cells showed decreased zzso D1 levels irrespective of zzso status, indicating that reduced zzso D1 could be a result of a smaller fraction of cells being in zzso phase rather than a result of an intact zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso D1 is zzso by the zzso in response to zzso zzso
