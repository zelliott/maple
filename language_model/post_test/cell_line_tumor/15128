The introduction of zzso an zzso zzso zzso has dramatically improved the treatment outcomes of patients with B cell zzso Nevertheless, the clinical response to zzso varies, and a zzso of patients does not respond well to this zzso Although several molecular events have been shown to be involved in the mechanism of action of zzso recent studies have demonstrated that zzso signaling pathways and the direct effects of zzso on cell membrane components are responsible for the zzso action of this zzso In the present study, we demonstrated that zzso activated zzso and zzso molecules with zzso functions, in several zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso activated zzso and zzso in all the tested primary zzso samples from six zzso Our results show that the cholesterol levels in zzso cell zzso have a crucial role in the regulation of zzso and zzso The depletion of cholesterol from the cell membrane completely blocked zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of cholesterol zzso also zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Finally, we report that zzso inhibited the zzso induced by zzso drugs, which was observed solely in zzso zzso This work demonstrates for the first time that zzso paradoxically works to suppress zzso under certain conditions in a manner that is dependent on the cell membrane cholesterol zzso Our observations provide novel insights and suggest that the cell membrane cholesterol level represents a new zzso for predicting patient response to zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso zzso could provide a new strategy for enhancing the zzso action of zzso
