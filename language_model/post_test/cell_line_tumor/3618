Drugs used in treatment of adult acute zzso zzso zzso are zzso for breast cancer resistance protein zzso zzso zzso which may thus play a role in resistance in this zzso zzso blasts from 30 adult ALL patients were studied for zzso zzso by quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain reaction analysis, zzso protein by zzso with three zzso and zzso function by zzso C zzso of zzso zzso zzso measured by flow zzso zzso zzso in all cases zzso wild type protein zzso which mediates zzso and zzso resistance, but only low-level zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso stained blasts in 13, 11 and 14 cases zzso 37% and zzso zzso correlated well with zzso and zzso but zzso and zzso did not zzso and zzso zzso did not correlate with zzso zzso zzso function was seen in 21 cases zzso but correlated poorly with zzso zzso An exploratory statistical analysis indicated that zzso zzso was zzso of shorter zzso survival zzso zzso zzso zzso in this small patient zzso Poor correlations between zzso protein and function indicate the complex biology of zzso in adult zzso and the possible correlation of zzso expression with zzso should be studied in larger zzso
