The human zzso system has a wide range of functions in cells including regulation of cell proliferation and zzso immune system zzso zzso defense, zzso control of zzso factor activity, and promotion of cancer zzso A key component of this zzso system is the zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso of zzso involves alternative zzso leading to a number of transcripts also zzso zzso of zzso that differ from each other at their zzso zzso Here we have studied the zzso zzso containing an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the transcript of this zzso was found predominantly in zzso but was also detected in zzso zzso heart, liver, zzso and zzso By zzso analysis in human zzso with zzso specific for the zzso domain of zzso the protein was found to be predominantly expressed in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso transcript was also found in several cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and in zzso cells, it was induced by zzso or testosterone zzso Surprisingly, green fluorescent protein zzso with the complete zzso protein or with only its zzso domain localized to distinct cellular sites in proximity to zzso and zzso had a potent capacity to rapidly induce cell membrane zzso zzso of these structures suggested that the zzso domain of zzso zzso first in the emerging zzso and is then followed into the zzso by zzso and subsequently by zzso The results presented thus reveal that zzso has a unique and distinct expression pattern in human cells and suggest that the protein can guide zzso zzso in relation to cell membrane zzso
