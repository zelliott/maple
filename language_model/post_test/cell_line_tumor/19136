In zzso one-dimensional zzso sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso is widely used for protein zzso prior to mass zzso analysis to enhance the dynamic range of analysis and to improve the identification of zzso zzso Such protein zzso works well for zzso strategies if the proteins are labeled prior to zzso However, because of the poor zzso of cutting gel zzso especially when small amounts of samples are zzso its application in zzso and zzso quantitative zzso methods has been greatly zzso To overcome this zzso we developed a new strategy in which a DNA zzso is mixed with the protein sample before PAGE zzso After PAGE zzso the DNA zzso is stained to allow for easy, precise, and zzso gel zzso To this end, a novel visible zzso method was zzso This zzso method is fast, sensitive, and compatible with mass zzso To evaluate the zzso of zzso gel cutting for quantitative protein zzso we used stable isotope labeling with zzso acids in cell culture zzso Our results show that the quantitative error associated with zzso can be minimized using the zzso zzso and multiple replicates of gel zzso In conclusion, zzso PAGE zzso in combination with DNA ladders can be used for zzso comparative zzso without compromising zzso
