zzso zzso zzso the zzso that converts zzso to zzso induce zzso resistance zzso in cancer zzso Recently, zzso interference zzso is a powerful strategy for gene therapy by introducing zzso zzso and leading to the zzso zzso We have designed two different short hairpin zzso zzso targeting zzso and introduced them into zzso resistant human breast cancer cells zzso zzso to inhibit zzso zzso The results demonstrated that the zzso targeting zzso decreased zzso zzso abolished zzso protein levels and restored the sensitivity of zzso cells to several zzso zzso This study revealed that this approach can reverse zzso effectively and it may be zzso to cancer patients as a specific means to restore the sensitivity to zzso
