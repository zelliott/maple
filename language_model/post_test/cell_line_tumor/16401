To explore the role of zzso in the zzso migration and invasion of zzso cells with a specific zzso zzso 

Human zzso cell lines zzso treated with zzso zzso specific zzso inhibitor were zzso The migration and invasion capacities of cells in zzso cell zzso invasion zzso were zzso Western zzso was employed to detect the levels of zzso and zzso in cell zzso and the zzso activity measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to identify the expression and zzso location of zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso significantly increased the migration and invasion capacities of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso The stimulation of zzso zzso the activity of zzso versus the zzso cells zzso zzso zzso And zzso was recruited to protruding edge in zzso zzso zzso of zzso with specific zzso inhibitor decreased the migration and invasion capacities of zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso In comparison with the zzso treated group, the activity of zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso and the recruitment of zzso to protruding edge significantly decreased in the zzso zzso zzso 

This study provides novel evidence that zzso zzso the zzso migration and invasion of zzso zzso It suggests that the zzso of zzso zzso may be a new therapeutic target for zzso
