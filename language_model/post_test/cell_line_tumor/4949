zzso zzso is an important cellular zzso for zzso zzso zzso proteins and also serves as the zzso for Old World zzso zzso fever virus zzso and zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso C New World zzso In the host cell, zzso is subject to a remarkably complex pattern of O zzso that is crucial for its interactions with zzso zzso Two of these unusual sugar zzso protein O zzso and zzso modifications involving the putative zzso zzso have recently been implicated in zzso zzso Considering the complexity of zzso O zzso our present study was aimed at the identification of the specific zzso zzso on zzso that are recognized by zzso As previously shown for zzso we found that protein O zzso of zzso is crucial for the binding of zzso of distinct zzso origins, including zzso zzso virus, and zzso C New World zzso In contrast to the highly zzso requirement for O zzso more generic O zzso present on zzso are zzso for zzso zzso Despite the critical role of zzso zzso for zzso binding under normal conditions, the zzso of zzso in cells deficient in O zzso resulted in highly zzso zzso that was functional as a zzso for zzso Thus, modifications by zzso but not zzso zzso themselves are most likely the crucial structures recognized by zzso Together, the data demonstrate that zzso recognize the same highly zzso zzso structures on zzso involved in zzso protein zzso indicating a zzso similar mechanism of zzso recognition by zzso and zzso zzso
