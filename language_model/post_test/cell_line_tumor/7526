zzso zzso zzso tumors zzso are pediatric tumors of the central nervous system with limited treatment options and poor survival zzso We investigated whether enhancing chemotherapy toxicity by depleting zzso zzso zzso a key zzso in zzso zzso with high dose zzso zzso may improve therapeutic efficacy in zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell lines were treated with combinations of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso damage, and zzso were evaluated in zzso 

zzso enhanced zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were elevated in zzso cells compared to zzso cells, and zzso decreased zzso to a greater magnitude in zzso cells than zzso zzso Unlike zzso cells, zzso cells did not have elevated zzso levels upon treatment with zzso alone, but did have elevated levels when treated with zzso + zzso Both cell lines had markedly increased zzso injury when treated with zzso + zzso relative to either drug treatment zzso The enhanced toxic effects were partially reversed with concurrent administration of zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso could be used as a zzso agent to zzso zzso zzso efficacy particularly in zzso zzso tumors with high zzso levels in clinical zzso
