In the present study, we have developed an in zzso three-dimensional model to differentiate normal lung cells from lung cancer cells in order to study the mechanisms resulting in lung zzso Using a zzso zzso basement membrane zzso we were able to culture normal human zzso zzso cells and a subset of zzso zzso The two cell types can be readily distinguished by the ability of normal cells to express a structurally and functionally differentiated zzso within zzso Human zzso zzso cells embedded in zzso as single cells were able to form zzso zzso colonies with a final size close to that of true zzso in zzso Sections of mature spheres revealed a central zzso surrounded by zzso zzso zzso In contrast, none of zzso cells tested, cell lines and lung zzso responded to basement membrane by zzso zzso These results demonstrated that this in zzso zzso zzso model can be useful for studies of zzso zzso Indeed, these findings may provide the basis for a rapid zzso to discriminate normal human zzso zzso cells from their zzso zzso In conclusion, the three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso sphere represents a novel in zzso model to further investigate zzso functions resulting in lung zzso
