Loss of zzso zzso causes cell cycle arrest in zzso zzso cells, suggesting that zzso zzso may be a useful approach to halt the growth of cancer zzso We recently reported that zzso is zzso in several zzso cancer cell lines as well as in zzso of the zzso zzso Here we report the development of zzso zzso zzso of zzso that inhibit its zzso activity at zzso zzso and exhibit zzso effects on zzso cancer zzso Chemical library screening was used to identify hit compounds, which were further zzso in profiling and kinetic zzso zzso analysis was applied in the search for zzso with improved potency and zzso resulting in the discovery of novel zzso that are able to interact with both the zzso pocket and several distinct zzso regions within zzso active zzso This zzso binding mode was confirmed by X-ray zzso The zzso decreased the proliferation of zzso cancer cells, while growth of primary normal zzso was not zzso These compounds may be a starting point to develop drugs for the treatment of cervical zzso
