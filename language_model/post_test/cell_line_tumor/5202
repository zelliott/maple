In the absence of a better zzso zzso release zzso with its several disadvantages is still the most common method for detection of zzso class I restricted zzso zzso zzso We describe a system in which the zzso zzso zzso can be assessed using zzso cells zzso with a zzso zzso expressing the specific zzso and a quantifiable reporter as target zzso This overcomes the problems associated with use of zzso zzso of target cells with zzso and the zzso zzso We used zzso core zzso to prove the concept, as it is an established zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso core and reporter zzso gene were generated and further checked for zzso expression in human zzso mouse zzso zzso and mouse zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso cells to study the zzso activity were generated in zzso using zzso mice zzso with zzso expressing DNA clone or zzso The target cells zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso were incubated with zzso cells zzso from zzso mice at a different zzso to target zzso Following incubation the zzso activity was calculated by measuring the reporter zzso in the remaining viable target cells that zzso zzso with the zzso of susceptible zzso The percent specific zzso measured in our zzso was compared with conventional zzso release zzso to validate this zzso This novel zzso zzso based zzso zzso demonstrated an easy to perform, zzso and zzso method of determining zzso zzso zzso
