zzso of target zzso for zzso therapies can be shed from the target cell surface and found in zzso of zzso zzso zzso of therapeutic targets not only pose the risk of zzso therapeutic zzso but, in a zzso form, of triggering T cell zzso by zzso zzso binding to zzso on T zzso Recently, zzso cell zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be activated by release of its zzso called zzso Here, we show that only very low amounts of zzso are zzso in zzso of cancer zzso Among 100 cancer patient samples tested, only 17 zzso showed serum levels of zzso in excess of zzso zzso with highest zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso form of human zzso zzso was produced to assess its possible effect on redirected zzso and T cell zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso currently being tested in patients with solid tumor zzso zzso had a very minor effect on redirected zzso by zzso with an approximate zzso 50 value of 3,000 zzso which is a concentration close to three orders of magnitude higher than the highest zzso concentration found in cancer zzso zzso of 30 zzso zzso in combination with 250 zzso zzso were minimally required to induce a zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso T zzso We conclude that soluble zzso in zzso of cancer patients is unlikely to pose an issue for the efficacy or safety of zzso and perhaps other zzso binding to zzso zzso of zzso
