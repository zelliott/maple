The zzso processing of zzso at the short arm of the zzso chain zzso is known to convert this zzso from a cell zzso type to a zzso zzso Here, we studied this mechanism by analyzing the functions of zzso In some immortalized or zzso human cell lines, a zzso zzso in either soluble or zzso zzso form, promoted the zzso of these cells to the processed zzso zzso and it suppressed their migration zzso by serum or zzso growth factor zzso zzso also suppressed zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso disruption of zzso structures in zzso zzso bound to zzso and this zzso as well as its cell zzso activity, was blocked by zzso By analyzing the activities of three different zzso fragments, the active site of zzso was localized to the zzso zzso sequence zzso V or zzso zzso of zzso expression by the zzso interference effectively blocked the activities of domain V capable of promoting cell zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that domain V of the zzso chain zzso regulates the zzso zzso zzso probably through a zzso zzso leading to enhanced cell zzso and suppressed cell zzso
