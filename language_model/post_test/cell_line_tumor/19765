zzso are ubiquitous proteins responsible for the zzso of zzso However, these zzso also activate zzso such as the zzso agents zzso and zzso As a consequence, zzso of zzso within tumor cells zzso these cells to zzso We have recently identified two classes of zzso zzso based on either a zzso zzso or a zzso zzso scaffold and showed that these compounds inhibit zzso with zzso in the low zzso zzso Because both classes of zzso show zzso zzso zzso conventional in zzso zzso zzso would not accurately reflect the in zzso levels of zzso activity or zzso zzso we have developed a novel zzso for the determination of zzso zzso activity using zzso as a zzso These studies show that zzso and a zzso analogue efficiently enter cells and inhibit human zzso zzso and rabbit liver zzso zzso This zzso results in reduced zzso to zzso due to the lack of zzso conversion of the zzso to zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso activity with zzso or its zzso may be applied to minimize the toxicity of normal cells to zzso
