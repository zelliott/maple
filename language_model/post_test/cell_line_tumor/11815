Development of zzso is a necessary requirement for zzso growth and it provides additional opportunities for therapeutic zzso However, current zzso therapies have limited zzso mostly because of the development of zzso zzso characterization of new zzso molecular targets is of considerable clinical zzso We report that a zzso domain zzso deletion zzso of the growth factor zzso bound protein 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth and associated zzso in zzso We implanted zzso zzso cells in rat brains zzso with an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein zzso zzso of zzso its zzso wild type counterpart, and zzso zzso We systematically followed zzso growth of the zzso their zzso and the functional performance of zzso zzso using magnetic resonance imaging, including anatomical zzso and zzso images and functional diffusion and zzso zzso zzso grown from implanted zzso cells expressing zzso developed zzso became smaller and presented lower apparent zzso than those derived from cells expressing zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso within zzso derived from zzso cells showed significantly lower cerebral blood flow zzso cerebral blood volume zzso and mean transit time zzso zzso These findings were independently validated by zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, these findings confirm that the zzso of zzso plays an important role in zzso growth and associated zzso in zzso thus identifying this region of the protein as a novel target for zzso zzso
