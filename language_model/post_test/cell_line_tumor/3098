In addition to its essential role in zzso reduction, zzso zzso zzso small zzso zzso has been known to play a critical role in determining tumor zzso zzso of zzso significantly enhances the invasive and zzso potential of zzso zzso is critical to tumor zzso it plays an essential role in tumor growth and zzso It is important to investigate whether the zzso potential of tumor is affected by zzso 

We examined the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso in two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We found that zzso was significantly decreased in both zzso and zzso cells compared to the parental zzso and mock zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells showed increased production of zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, attenuating zzso expression via zzso resulted in a significant increased zzso expression in both zzso and zzso zzso while the expression of zzso by the two cells was significantly decreased under both zzso and zzso In comparison with zzso zzso of zzso had no significant effect on proliferation in zzso but it dramatically accelerated in zzso subcutaneous growth of zzso zzso possessed more zzso potential than zzso as shown in zzso by its increased zzso for zzso cells and in zzso by the generation of more zzso tumor zzso 

These findings suggest a positive role of zzso in tumor zzso and growth through regulation of the expression of zzso and zzso
