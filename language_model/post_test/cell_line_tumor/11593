zzso of zzso zzso zzso in cancer cells elicits potential zzso effects via recruitment of zzso zzso zzso tumors may zzso zzso zzso by delivering zzso death signals via zzso zzso which may lead to tumor zzso In order to distinguish the role of zzso in zzso activity and tumor zzso Lewis lung zzso cells zzso were used to establish the cell line zzso in which zzso expression was zzso by zzso zzso treatment and induced in the absence of zzso zzso cells promote tumor zzso when expressing zzso whereas tumor outgrowth is observed by depletion of zzso zzso To investigate whether initial expression of zzso during tumor formation is critical for zzso tumor regression, zzso zzso cells were zzso into zzso mice, but zzso treatment was stopped 5 days after zzso When low cell numbers were zzso we observed zzso survival and no tumor formation, whereas no mice survived zzso with high cell numbers, despite the delayed induction of zzso by zzso zzso The zzso of a high density of cells may establish a favorable tumor zzso before the expression of zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso may elicit zzso activity when it is initially present on injected cancer cells and thus can act prior to tumor zzso zzso Furthermore, a well-established tumor zzso abrogates zzso zzso zzso
