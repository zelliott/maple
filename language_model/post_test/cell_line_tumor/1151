zzso has demonstrated clinical activity in various zzso including zzso prostate zzso The development of novel zzso zzso with better zzso profiles is an ongoing research zzso Our laboratory previously reported the in zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso analog zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The current study evaluated the therapeutic potential of these zzso in the treatment of prostate cancer in zzso 

zzso combined zzso mice bearing zzso human prostate cancer zzso or zzso zzso were treated with the zzso at their maximum tolerated zzso zzso were then excised and processed for zzso and zzso zzso to determine the levels of various zzso factors and zzso density zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso induced prominent and modest growth zzso in zzso and zzso tumors, zzso zzso had no effect on tumor growth in either zzso zzso zzso growth factor and basic zzso growth factor levels were not significantly altered by any of the zzso zzso or zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly reduced zzso tumor zzso growth factor zzso levels by zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, treatment with the zzso and zzso resulted in differential zzso zzso of genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as determined by DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was significantly decreased by zzso and zzso zzso also reduced zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and 49 are promising zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso may be a potential target for these zzso zzso zzso zzso and functional analyses are under way with the aim of zzso the molecular zzso of action of these zzso zzso
