The continuous assembly and zzso of focal zzso is required for efficient cell spreading and zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso is a zzso protein whose dynamic zzso to sites of zzso zzso is critically involved in the regulation of these zzso Here we provide evidence that the zzso zzso of zzso is regulated by protein zzso D3 zzso through direct zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso 46 was zzso by zzso zzso thereby identifying zzso as the first specific zzso for this zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso localized to zzso zzso zzso complexes, whereas the zzso zzso zzso was enriched in focal zzso We propose that zzso of zzso on zzso 46 by zzso represents a molecular switch by which zzso zzso zzso trafficking, and cellular zzso activity are zzso
