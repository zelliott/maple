zzso of viral zzso acids by pattern recognition receptors zzso type I zzso induction and innate zzso immune zzso Here we show that zzso a member of the zzso family involved in zzso processing in the processing bodies, binds to synthetic or viral zzso and DNA and mediates zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso type I zzso production and cellular zzso zzso Moreover, zzso is essential for zzso induction of zzso after either zzso or DNA virus zzso We further found that zzso zzso induction requires zzso or zzso after zzso or DNA virus infection, respectively, and viral infection causes zzso of zzso to zzso where zzso zzso and zzso are zzso These findings suggest that zzso is a sensor for both viral zzso and DNA and plays an important role in initiating zzso induction in the early phase of viral zzso
