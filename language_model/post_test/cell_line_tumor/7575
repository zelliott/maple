The zzso of zzso signaling has been reported in many types of zzso cell zzso In this study, using human oral zzso cell zzso zzso cells with different zzso potential, we investigated the involvement of zzso signaling in zzso Further, we aimed to zzso the characteristic biological features related to high zzso potential and to identify new target molecules for the suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso We compared zzso zzso zzso cells expressing green fluorescent zzso and zzso which is a highly zzso cell line derived from zzso by in zzso zzso The zzso cell line had greater ability of migration and invasion compared to zzso Furthermore, a higher number of zzso zzso structures were produced in zzso cells compared to zzso cells, and the levels of active zzso and active zzso protein were higher in zzso cells compared to zzso zzso We did not observe any differences in the expression of zzso target genes between the two cell zzso however, the zzso levels of zzso were higher in zzso cells compared to zzso zzso To confirm the involvement of zzso in migration in zzso cells, we examined the effects of the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells and zzso zzso The zzso treatment significantly inhibited migration and the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso when zzso with zzso the migration and formation of zzso zzso were significantly enhanced and the levels of active zzso and active zzso proteins were also zzso These results indicate that zzso is involved in the migration ability of zzso cells through active zzso and zzso
