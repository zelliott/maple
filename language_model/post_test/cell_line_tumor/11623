Emerging studies have indicated that zzso are involved in the development and progression of zzso Here we found that zzso was frequently zzso in gastric cancer zzso zzso of zzso in gastric cancer cells zzso and zzso markedly suppressed cell proliferation and induced cell zzso both in zzso and in zzso Furthermore, zzso expression was frequently positive in gastric cancer zzso and zzso correlated with zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso factor zzso was a target of zzso and plays an essential role as a zzso of the biological effects of zzso in gastric zzso zzso also inhibited the expression of zzso and zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso may function as a novel tumor zzso in gastric cancer and its zzso activity may attribute the direct targeting and zzso of zzso
