zzso mechanisms are essential for the regulation of all genes in zzso cells but zzso repression including DNA zzso are also major zzso mechanisms of defense zzso potentially harmful zzso zzso zzso zzso however, has evolved to take advantage of zzso zzso DNA to regulate its own zzso life zzso We show here that zzso zzso DNA has an extreme composition of zzso zzso zzso with a zzso distribution of zzso or fully zzso DNA at active zzso genes or completely zzso zzso zzso zzso We find this scenario confirmed in primary zzso memory B cells in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA argues for a very restricted gene expression during zzso zzso zzso occupancy, repressive zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso further shield early zzso promoters from zzso during zzso The very tight repression of viral zzso genes must be overcome when zzso zzso enters its zzso phase and supports de zzso virus synthesis in infected zzso The zzso and zzso related zzso factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso virus synthesis in zzso infected zzso Paradoxically, zzso zzso binds to zzso motifs in key viral promoters for their zzso Upon zzso zzso we find zzso removed, zzso repression lost, and zzso zzso II recruited to the activated early promoters promoting efficient zzso viral gene zzso Surprisingly, DNA zzso is maintained throughout this phase of viral zzso and is no hindrance to active zzso of extensively zzso zzso viral genes as thought zzso Thus, we identify zzso as a pioneer factor that reverses zzso zzso of viral DNA to allow escape from zzso and report on a new paradigm of gene zzso
