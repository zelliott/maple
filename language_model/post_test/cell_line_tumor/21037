zzso is a zzso zzso that functions as a tumor zzso and zzso gene therapy has been examined for various zzso Gene transfer by zzso zzso is more efficient than zzso DNA zzso and, in the present study, we examined the zzso effects in human zzso melanoma cells zzso using zzso zzso zzso 

zzso protein zzso cell growth zzso zzso activity and zzso were examined in zzso zzso zzso was applied locally once every 5 days for a total of five times to peripheral zzso tumors transplanted in nude zzso zzso growth zzso was evaluated by measuring the tumor volume and zzso was detected using a terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso end zzso zzso zzso 

zzso expression of zzso protein was observed following zzso zzso transfer and cell survival was zzso zzso activity and zzso cells increased significantly following zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso In mice, tumor growth increased only slightly during zzso zzso administration and the tumor volume on day 30 (10 days after completion of zzso was zzso of that in the saline control zzso By contrast, zzso zzso zzso resulted in little change in tumor growth compared to zzso 

zzso zzso therapy using zzso has stronger zzso effects than zzso gene therapy using a zzso and the results suggest that zzso zzso zzso may be a viable treatment for zzso zzso
