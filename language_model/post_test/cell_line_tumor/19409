The in zzso efficacy of both zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso either zzso alone or in different combination schedules, was zzso in four zzso cancer cell zzso Both drugs were found to induce cell growth zzso zzso as well as a slight but stable zzso of cells in the zzso zzso In all cell lines, neither zzso nor zzso affected zzso and the expression of its downstream zzso By contrast, zzso inhibited in a fast and completely way zzso and partially zzso while a 3 zzso exposure resulted in the zzso of the expression of both zzso and zzso Moreover, after early zzso the zzso inhibitor produced a progressive, and almost complete zzso of zzso The analysis of combined zzso and zzso administration showed a clear zzso activity which turned out to be zzso only when zzso was given before zzso This zzso seemed to depend on increase of both zzso and zzso zzso the greater the induction of zzso the higher the decrease in cell cycle zzso Moreover, the zzso activity of the two drugs given in combination was demonstrated by a strong reduction of zzso release which turned out to be more pronounced in the zzso schedule, and zzso zzso Our results suggest that the schedule of zzso followed by zzso acting at different levels of the zzso cellular pathway, could induce zzso and zzso effects of clinical interest in the zzso cancer zzso
