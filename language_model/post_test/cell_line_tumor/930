The zzso zzso and zzso zzso family contributes to regulation of the zzso and zzso interactions that are critical zzso of zzso To determine the relationship between zzso and zzso zzso we compared the zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso of an zzso lung cancer cell line that were highly zzso to either brain or zzso zzso zzso levels were significantly higher in highly zzso zzso than in the parent or highly zzso zzso To zzso the role of zzso in brain zzso we zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells with a full-length zzso expression zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso resulted in increased invasive capacity in response to nerve growth factor, increased zzso to brain zzso and increased expression of zzso alpha 3 and beta 1 zzso Administration of the zzso 1 zzso zzso attenuated this increase in invasive and adhesive zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso cells to mice resulted in zzso zzso in the brain and multiple zzso colonies in the zzso In contrast, administration of parent and zzso zzso cells to mice resulted in lung tumors without brain zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso enhances cell zzso and invasion of zzso cell lung cancer cells via zzso of other zzso molecules and changes in sensitivity to growth factors, thereby promoting zzso capacity to the zzso
