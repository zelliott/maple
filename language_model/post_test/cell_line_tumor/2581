zzso zzso are a series of structurally related zzso recently isolated from the red maple zzso zzso zzso They differ in number and location of zzso derivatives attached to zzso Here, zzso zzso were evaluated for zzso effects against human zzso zzso zzso breast, zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso which contained two zzso zzso or three zzso zzso zzso derivatives each, inhibited cancer cell growth while those with only one zzso group zzso zzso did zzso Moreover, zzso zzso showed greater zzso effects than zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso against zzso and zzso cells, zzso zzso the cancer cells were up to zzso more sensitive to the zzso than the normal zzso In further zzso studies, zzso zzso (at 75 zzso zzso induced zzso and arrested cell cycle (in the zzso of the cancer zzso These results suggest that the number of zzso groups attached to the zzso zzso in these zzso are important for zzso zzso Also, this is the first in zzso zzso study of zzso
