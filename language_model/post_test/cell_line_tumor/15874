zzso zzso which is regulated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso is an zzso mechanism that influences zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso zzso are associated with zzso therefore, manipulating the zzso status of key gene targets is likely crucial for effective cancer zzso zzso seed extract zzso has a known protective effect against prostate zzso Here, we showed that zzso significantly inhibited zzso activity by zzso in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated significant repression of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso in prostate cancer cells by measuring zzso activity using a zzso construct bearing the zzso element in the human prostate cancer cell line zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment also decreased the zzso level of the zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso Finally, zzso inhibited growth of zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to decreased zzso zzso and cancer cell growth, and zzso zzso as a novel candidate for therapeutic activity against prostate zzso
