zzso failure was reported in treatment of zzso suggesting a role for zzso cassette (ABC) zzso Little is known about the expression pattern of ABC proteins in this cancer zzso We investigated the gene expression profile of 47 ABC proteins in the human zzso cell line zzso by zzso zzso zzso Analysis revealed 31 ABC zzso genes expressed in this tumor cell zzso zzso cells demonstrate high gene expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (more than twofold compared to pooled zzso from different zzso Moreover, we show that zzso cells exhibit an active zzso zzso pointing to zzso resistance protein zzso zzso zzso In zzso we present for the first time an ABC zzso gene expression profile in cells derived from zzso Most of the highly expressed ABC zzso genes are typical markers of cancer cells and might exhibit potential targets for medical treatment of zzso
