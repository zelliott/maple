As a new approach for gene therapy, we recently developed a new type of zzso called zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso We decided to explore the in zzso and in zzso effect of zzso in cancer choosing zzso as a target since it is involved in zzso zzso and zzso and zzso in different zzso We designed four zzso against the zzso zzso one of them directed against the template strand and three against different regions of the coding zzso These zzso were tested in zzso prostate cancer cells in an in zzso screening of cell viability and zzso zzso against the promoter sequence were the most effective and caused a decrease in zzso zzso and protein zzso We confirmed the binding between the selected zzso and their target sequences in the zzso zzso In addition we determined that both the zzso and the zzso targeting the zzso promoter were interfering with the binding of zzso factors zzso and zzso zzso Finally, we conducted two in zzso efficacy zzso using the zzso against the zzso promoter and performing two routes of administration, namely zzso and zzso in a subcutaneous zzso tumor model of zzso prostate cancer zzso The results showed that the chosen zzso proved to be effective in decreasing tumor volume, and reduced the levels of zzso protein and the formation of blood zzso These findings represent the zzso proof of principle of zzso as a new zzso tool for cancer gene zzso
