zzso expression is finely tuned by a variety of environmental and zzso stimuli and regulated at both zzso and zzso zzso Our previous investigations demonstrated that the zzso major zzso region zzso in the zzso zzso reporter gene zzso which implies that this region possessed intrinsic regulatory zzso However, the effect of the zzso on zzso zzso and the underlying regulatory mechanisms, remain to be zzso To assess the direct effect of the zzso on the zzso activity of the zzso zzso we employed targeted zzso zzso to establish a zzso zzso zzso cell line and then compared the zzso activity and zzso effect on zzso between the wild type and targeted zzso We found that deletion of the zzso significantly decreased the zzso activity of the corresponding zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso deleted of the zzso had a slower response to zzso stimuli than did the wild type zzso The regulatory function of the zzso was zzso through zzso zzso of zzso increased zzso zzso while zzso of zzso with zzso decreased zzso zzso Our results clearly indicated that the zzso could positively regulate zzso gene expression and this regulatory function was closely related to zzso
