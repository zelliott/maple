The study was undertaken to explore whether zzso could inhibit the production of zzso zzso in human zzso cells zzso and to examine the underlying mechanism of this zzso zzso components zzso were extracted from zzso zzso and then used to treat zzso cells at three different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the production of zzso and zzso were measured by Western zzso analysis and zzso linked zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, the expressions of zzso precursor protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso precursor protein zzso zzso zzso were also examined by Western zzso zzso The activities of zzso and zzso were detected at the same zzso Furthermore, zzso level was detected by zzso zzso We demonstrated that the treatment of zzso could significantly decrease the levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells, despite the fact that the activities of zzso and zzso were not affected zzso These data suggest that zzso components could significantly inhibit the level of zzso zzso and zzso zzso without affecting the activity of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso
