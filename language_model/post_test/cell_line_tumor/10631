Our previous report suggested the potential role of the exchange protein directly activated by zzso zzso zzso in melanoma zzso via zzso zzso zzso cell zzso In order to obtain conclusive evidence that zzso plays a critical role in modification of HS and melanoma zzso we extensively investigated expression and function of zzso in human melanoma samples and cell zzso We have found that, in human melanoma tissue zzso protein expression of zzso was higher in zzso melanoma than in primary zzso In addition, expression of zzso positively correlated with that of zzso zzso and zzso zzso an zzso that increases zzso of zzso Further, an zzso zzso increased, but zzso of zzso zzso expressions of zzso zzso zzso and cell migration in various melanoma cell zzso Finally, zzso cells with stable zzso of zzso showed a decrease in cell migration, and zzso in zzso These data suggest that zzso plays a critical role in melanoma zzso presumably because of modification of zzso
