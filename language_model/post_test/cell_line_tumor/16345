Ethanol has been used to achieve zzso depletion in zzso zzso zzso Ethanol zzso has also been used widely in the therapy of many tumors including zzso zzso In light of these findings, we delineated the differential zzso behavior and mechanism of lower concentration of ethanol towards zzso zzso zzso and its normal counterpart zzso zzso zzso and normal zzso were cultured with ethanol zzso for zzso and zzso was measured by various zzso zzso cells treated with ethanol showed zzso loss of viability at zzso ethanol concentration and exhibit zzso arrest at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicated that ethanol induced death in zzso cells, by induction of both zzso and necrosis which was further supported by findings of zzso and zzso blue dye exclusion zzso However, treatment of zzso with similar concentration of ethanol did not show any zzso zzso Furthermore, ethanol induced significantly higher zzso generation in zzso cells as compared to zzso and caused zzso zzso and zzso of zzso proteins like zzso and zzso in zzso cells and not in normal zzso In addition, ethanol exposure to zzso cells led to zzso of zzso and zzso of death zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that ethanol zzso a concentration of zzso caused no significant zzso towards normal zzso and induced cell death in zzso cells via zzso of zzso and regulation of zzso leading to further zzso of both zzso zzso and intrinsic zzso zzso zzso
