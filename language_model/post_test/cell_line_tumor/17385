In zzso a number of zzso zzso zzso have been detected and found to exert various biological zzso In zzso zzso zzso have been zzso however, a lack of experimental zzso that permit the identification of overlapping transcripts in cells presents a barrier to a more systematic identification of zzso zzso Here we have developed an experimental strategy that allows systematic identification of zzso zzso with long complementary regions to other zzso The method was applied to human normal zzso zzso and breast cancer zzso Experimental validation of the presence of the sense and zzso transcripts by various techniques zzso northern zzso zzso supports the specificity of the zzso When the zzso zzso were specifically targeted, their corresponding zzso levels significantly altered, a result consistent with a regulatory role for the identified zzso zzso
