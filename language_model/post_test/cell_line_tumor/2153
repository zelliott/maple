zzso B virus zzso X zzso zzso is a zzso protein that alters the activity of selected zzso factors and zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of a unique zzso zzso which in turn zzso zzso zzso thereby contributing zzso to zzso zzso and zzso also alter the expression of multiple zzso and by zzso array analysis, both were shown to promote the expression of zzso zzso zzso was also seen in zzso positive liver samples from infected zzso To study the function of zzso zzso was introduced into zzso and zzso cells zzso expressing zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed cell zzso cell cycle zzso cell migration, zzso independent growth in soft zzso and subcutaneous tumor formation in zzso zzso Introduction of zzso increased zzso protein and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso was targeted by zzso zzso failed to suppress zzso expression when zzso with reporter gene zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso Introduction of zzso also resulted in depressed zzso signaling by zzso and zzso resulting in decreased expression of zzso Thus, zzso may play a central role in zzso zzso zzso and may be an early diagnostic marker and/or therapeutic target associated with this tumor zzso
