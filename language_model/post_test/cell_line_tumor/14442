zzso zzso zzso expression has been found to promote zzso but little is known about the role of zzso in zzso zzso In this study, we selected 10 zzso and analyzed their expression in 10 zzso cancer cell lines and 158 tissue specimens using Northern zzso and in zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in all 10 cell lines, zzso and zzso were not expressed in any of the cell lines, and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in some of the cell lines but not zzso In addition, transient zzso of zzso inhibited zzso and zzso D1 expression and zzso cancer cell zzso whereas zzso suppressed zzso expression and increased tumor cell zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso expression was associated with tumor cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso was associated with higher zzso disease stages in patients with zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso expression and zzso expression were associated with shorter overall and zzso survival in all zzso cancer zzso In addition, zzso zzso and zzso expression were associated with shorter overall and zzso survival in patients with zzso zzso however, zzso zzso and zzso expression were not associated with overall or zzso survival in zzso cell zzso zzso Our data indicate that further evaluation of zzso and zzso as zzso zzso is warranted in patients with zzso zzso In addition, the role of zzso in zzso cancer also warrants further zzso
