The goal of this study was to identify zzso that are specifically expressed in pancreatic zzso To investigate the gene expression of zzso between pancreatic cancer and normal pancreatic zzso we performed zzso zzso about 1000 zzso zzso using zzso zzso of pancreatic cancer cells and normal pancreatic zzso Eighty-six genes were zzso and zzso were zzso in pancreatic cancer, compared to normal pancreatic zzso Among these changes, it is noteworthy that the expression of zzso was decreased and the expression of zzso was increased in pancreatic cancer, compared to normal pancreatic zzso Although zzso and zzso are involved in the same reaction as a zzso their zzso zzso is zzso When 5 cases of pancreatic cancer zzso were examined using the real-time zzso method, the expression of zzso was dominant in tumor zzso and the expression of zzso was dominant in the surrounding normal zzso The expression of zzso was increased in all 3 cell lines that had been treated with zzso and zzso These results suggest that the zzso of zzso in pancreatic cancer cells is due to an zzso zzso in the zzso
