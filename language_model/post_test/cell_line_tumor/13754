zzso salicylic acid zzso is one of the most frequently prescribed medications for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular zzso It has recently been reported to cause small zzso zzso injury at a considerably higher rate than previously zzso The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanism by which this occurs using an in zzso small zzso model focusing on the role of zzso stress and cell zzso zzso zzso exhibits a zzso similar to human small zzso zzso We measured whether zzso induced the increase of differentiated zzso zzso the decrease of tight junction protein zzso the production of zzso oxygen species zzso and the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In some experiments, zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was zzso The nontoxic concentration of zzso decreased zzso electrical resistance and increased the flux of zzso zzso zzso across zzso in a zzso zzso The same concentration of zzso significantly decreased zzso expression among zzso proteins as assessed by Western zzso and zzso and increased zzso production and the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso suppressed the zzso increased zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso Our findings indicate that zzso zzso production can specifically modify the expression of zzso protein and induce increased cell zzso which may ultimately cause small zzso zzso zzso
