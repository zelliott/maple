Although zzso zzso has proven therapeutic benefit in the clinical setting, the molecular zzso predicting responsiveness to this agent are still not very well zzso Here, we assessed the relationship between zzso total and activated zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso levels in a tumor and the responsiveness to zzso zzso or zzso treatment using human zzso zzso zzso treatment alone zzso zzso zzso zzso effectively delayed the growth of zzso and zzso tumors by a minimum of 10 days corresponding to log cell kill values of zzso zzso activity was seen in the zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso failed to show any significant zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All of the studied tumors had zzso yet variable levels of zzso For combination regimens, zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proved to be significantly more zzso than individual zzso in the zzso yet zzso zzso tumor model zzso zzso zzso However, no therapeutic enhancement was observed in the zzso and zzso zzso responsive zzso zzso Similarly, combinations of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso failed to show any improvements over individual zzso in the zzso zzso responsive zzso zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso activity associated with zzso zzso does not correlate directly with relative zzso levels of total or activated zzso zzso in a zzso Moreover, robust zzso activity by zzso may be the best predictor for this agent to zzso zzso zzso zzso
