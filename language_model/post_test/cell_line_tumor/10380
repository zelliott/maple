zzso zzso regulates zzso function, and zzso is exported to the zzso following DNA damage in a zzso zzso Because more than 50% of solid tumors harbor zzso zzso it is possible that genetically zzso zzso zzso is functionally abnormal through compromised zzso shuttling in sporadic breast cancer patients with dysfunctional zzso In this study, we have investigated the mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso distribution and DNA zzso nuclear export, as well as the impact on the resulting zzso response to therapy in human breast zzso We first show that zzso mediates zzso nuclear export via zzso zzso rather than by zzso of its zzso Furthermore, it is the zzso zzso region of zzso that is critical for its interaction with zzso and zzso may promote zzso nuclear export by interrupting the association of zzso with zzso In sporadic breast cancer zzso dysfunctional zzso strongly zzso with nuclear retention of zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso shuttling determines cellular zzso to DNA damage as zzso of zzso zzso significantly enhances cancer cell zzso to zzso zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso dysfunction compromises nuclear export of zzso zzso as a mechanism to increase cellular resistance to DNA damage in sporadic breast zzso We propose that targeting nuclear zzso to the zzso may offer a unique strategy to sensitize zzso sporadic breast zzso to DNA zzso zzso
