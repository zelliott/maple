zzso zzso zzso zzso exerts many different functions in addition to its role in zzso In pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso and plays an important role in zzso invasion, and zzso zzso interaction with cell membrane receptors has been related to increased zzso activity and to signal zzso through zzso zzso The aim was to analyze the role of zzso zzso an zzso zzso that also is zzso in zzso as a new functional zzso for zzso 

zzso interaction was analyzed using surface zzso resonance and pull-down zzso zzso cells and tumors were used to study zzso expression and zzso by Western zzso and zzso zzso of zzso by small interference zzso was used to analyze the involvement of zzso interaction in zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso cell zzso and invasion in pancreatic and zzso zzso 

zzso interaction is zzso specific, and of high zzso zzso moderately increases the zzso activity of zzso High zzso levels were detected in zzso cells in culture, where it concentrates at the migration front, and in zzso where it is expressed in zzso cells and in the zzso zzso of zzso abolished the effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso cell zzso and invasion, both in pancreatic and in zzso zzso 

These findings support a new molecular mechanism by which zzso interaction with zzso contributes to zzso progression involving both transformed zzso cells and tumor zzso
