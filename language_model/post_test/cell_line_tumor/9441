zzso are basic constituents of zzso cell membrane zzso zzso which are involved in many cell functions, including zzso trafficking, and cellular growth zzso The distribution of zzso within the normal brain and in brain tumors is zzso In the present study, we describe the expression of zzso zzso in 64 brain tumors of different grade, of either zzso or zzso zzso All studied zzso of any grade (from II to zzso were zzso positive, displaying zzso patterns and intensity specifically associated to the different tumor zzso In all zzso and zzso zzso zzso was extremely intense, typically localized at the cell membrane and recognized a variable percentage of cells, including the majority of zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso a less intense membrane zzso or a zzso zzso zzso were present, the latter being almost the exclusive pattern observed in diffuse zzso grade zzso In contrast to zzso tumors, the striking totality of grade II zzso and the large majority of grade III were lacking zzso zzso Interestingly, a zzso distribution overlapping the pattern described in zzso was observed also in primary cell cultures of human zzso and zzso and also in one established zzso cell line zzso zzso analyzed by means of zzso zzso and flow zzso In conclusion, among zzso tumors zzso expression varies in distribution, pattern, and intensity specifically according to tumor types and zzso The association between tumor progression and a more structured zzso pattern of zzso expression could suggest the hypothesis of a zzso shift towards a zzso zzso whose behavioral and zzso significance worth further zzso Finally, the lack of zzso zzso in zzso suggests its concrete application as a useful diagnostic zzso
