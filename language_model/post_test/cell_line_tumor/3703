zzso is a T cell surface zzso that plays an important role in interactions of zzso with zzso zzso cells and in mature T cell interactions with selected zzso tissue zzso We describe a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that is distinct from the known zzso zzso The zzso protein is expressed on cells derived from human zzso skin, zzso and cartilage, and its expression is enhanced by zzso zzso directed against the zzso zzso and zzso exhibit distinct patterns of binding to a panel of cell zzso zzso zzso shows that both zzso and the zzso zzso are expressed at the cell surface, and that these proteins zzso The zzso zzso has a molecular mass of 130 zzso and is zzso using either zzso zzso or soluble zzso fusion zzso zzso directed against individual zzso were less potent than was soluble zzso fusion protein in reducing zzso of T cells to adherent zzso zzso cells in zzso suggesting that these zzso recognize zzso on the zzso zzso and zzso that are distinct from zzso binding zzso Finally, zzso of zzso cells with zzso small interfering zzso significantly decreased zzso expression without zzso in zzso zzso levels, and thus confirmed that these two zzso are zzso Taken together, our data identifies a novel zzso zzso that may mediate interactions of zzso and zzso cells with T zzso
