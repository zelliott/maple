A new signal amplification strategy based on DNA zzso reaction on the surface of magnetic zzso zzso for zzso detection of zzso DNA was zzso In this strategy, zzso modified with probe DNA zzso were bound to target DNA zzso (with a ratio of 1 : 1) captured to a zzso The zzso were released from the zzso via DNA zzso and then zzso with zzso detection DNA zzso After the zzso and zzso were separated by zzso the zzso was zzso The zzso were then zzso with other zzso to initiate the next zzso zzso This recycling of the zzso process on the surface of the zzso was repeated multiple times to accumulate zzso Finally, zzso intensity of the collected zzso was zzso Using this strategy, the limit of detection for determination of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 11 zzso The zzso zzso was used to zzso zzso zzso large, zzso zzso zzso in human breast cancer zzso
