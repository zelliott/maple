zzso cancer is a highly aggressive disease that remains zzso to various zzso zzso Because the zzso zzso can zzso zzso in response to zzso insults and is commonly zzso in pancreatic cancer, we investigated the value of zzso as a potential zzso of cellular response to various zzso zzso 

zzso zzso or small interfering zzso zzso zzso of zzso and restoration of zzso D1 were done in the zzso pancreatic tumor cell zzso Cell viability after zzso treatment of zzso control, and zzso cells was determined by zzso zzso zzso and drug-induced zzso was measured by DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression profile after zzso treatment was determined by Western zzso and DNA binding activity of nuclear zzso was examined by zzso mobility shift zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso in zzso and human pancreatic cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso respectively, resulted in increased sensitivity to zzso and other zzso zzso Increased sensitivity to zzso in zzso cells was due, in part, to the marked increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression in stable zzso cells by zzso zzso resulted in decreased sensitivity to zzso cell zzso These results indicate an important role of zzso in zzso of pancreatic cancer zzso The zzso zzso sensitivity correlated with zzso of nuclear factor zzso activity, which was partially restored by zzso zzso D1 zzso 

Our results suggest that the zzso zzso to zzso zzso involves suppression of zzso D1 expression and nuclear factor zzso zzso
