zzso in lung cancer cells is general in clinic, hence it is significant to investigate the mechanisms of zzso and develop new methods of reversing zzso Recent researches showed that zzso could regulate cell growth, zzso migration and invasion even in drug therapy in cancer by its target zzso The aim of this study is to investigate the effects and molecular mechanisms of zzso on reversing the zzso in lung cancer zzso cell line zzso 

zzso zzso was employed to determine the effect of zzso on zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso rate and zzso concentration of zzso zzso were determined by flow zzso the expression of zzso resistant proteins zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined by Western zzso and real time zzso The zzso of zzso was analyzed by Western zzso the zzso activities of zzso and zzso were detected by zzso reporter gene zzso 

zzso was able to increase the zzso sensitivity of zzso After treatment with zzso the reverse folds zzso to zzso was zzso fold, the zzso level of zzso was zzso fold, the zzso rate was zzso fold, the expressions of several drug-resistant related zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso significantly, as shown by zzso in contrast, the level of zzso was zzso the zzso zzso of zzso was zzso the zzso zzso of zzso was zzso the zzso zzso of zzso was zzso the zzso zzso of zzso was zzso the zzso expression of zzso was zzso the zzso zzso of zzso was zzso in addition, the zzso of zzso decreased and zzso activities of zzso was zzso zzso was zzso compared with control zzso 

zzso was able to reverse the zzso resistance of zzso zzso processed this kind of effect by zzso the drug zzso zzso the expression of drug-resistant related proteins and promoting cell zzso
