zzso analysis of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso offers a limited potential for precise zzso of zzso due to strong overlap between the zzso zzso zzso is a powerful tool to zzso and simultaneously measure a larger number of zzso zzso However, it is still rarely used for zzso first because quantitative analysis by zzso zzso requires a zzso procedure due to the zzso nature of zzso zzso experiments, and above all because of the prohibitive experiment duration that is necessary to obtain such a zzso zzso In this work, we develop and evaluate a zzso zzso zzso protocol for a fast determination of zzso zzso in complex zzso The zzso pulse sequence is carefully zzso and evaluated in terms of precision and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso are obtained in 7 zzso with a zzso better than zzso for zzso zzso as small as 100 zzso and an excellent zzso The method described in this work allows a fast and precise zzso of zzso zzso and it forms a promising tool for zzso zzso
