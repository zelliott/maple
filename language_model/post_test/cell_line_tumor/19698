zzso is a nuclear protein that zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso and functions as a zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso the expression of several zzso genes regulated by nuclear zzso including zzso in human tumor cell zzso zzso interacts with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso gene zzso zzso also forms complexes with zzso while bound to its target sites in the zzso promoter, as shown by zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso zzso zzso Using cells from zzso mouse zzso we observed that levels of the corresponding zzso zzso zzso and protein are increased in cells lacking zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein levels were reduced in zzso zzso Taken together, these observations provide a mechanism that links two previously ascribed functions of zzso zzso repression and zzso to zzso
