We reported previously that zzso zzso of zzso in mice induced an increased expression of zzso family proteins zzso and zzso in the zzso and protected them from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore, assessed the effect of zzso introduced zzso on zzso zzso in zzso mouse zzso cells and report here that zzso protects zzso cells from zzso zzso by attenuating its ability to disrupt zzso membrane integrity, activate zzso and promote zzso zzso zzso zzso and induce zzso These changes correlated with suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso events as well as the zzso of zzso zzso of chemical inhibitor of zzso to zzso expressing cells rendered them sensitive to zzso These data demonstrate that zzso protects zzso cells against zzso zzso by interfering with its zzso signaling upstream of the intrinsic zzso events by preventing its ability to zzso zzso
