zzso is a zzso widely distributed in fruit and zzso zzso studies suggest that lycopene consumption is associated with decreased cancer zzso Animal studies have revealed that lycopene may protect against zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso aromatic zzso zzso are environmental zzso that can be zzso by two phase I zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Products formed by these reactions are zzso zzso zzso generated by these zzso zzso is believed to be an important step in cancer zzso Some phase II detoxifying zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso facilitate the elimination of these zzso zzso In the present study, the mechanism by which lycopene prevented zzso zzso in the breast was investigated in a cell culture model zzso 

The zzso action of lycopene on zzso zzso was assessed in zzso protein and cell culture using zzso zzso zzso zzso expressions of zzso and zzso and zzso were estimated by zzso reverse zzso chain zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso and lycopene for zzso the protection of the zzso against DNA zzso generated from the zzso zzso 

zzso inhibited zzso zzso and zzso with estimated zzso in the zzso zzso In zzso cells, lycopene administration slightly reduced the zzso zzso activity by zzso Meanwhile, a zzso increase in zzso zzso activity was zzso 

The present study illustrated that phase I zzso zzso and phase II zzso induction were the underlying zzso mechanisms of lycopene against zzso zzso
