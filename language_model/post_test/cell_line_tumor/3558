zzso zzso zzso especially zzso 2 zzso exert their zzso zzso and/or zzso and zzso zzso Here we aimed to investigate the zzso effect of zzso gene transfer into pancreatic cancer cell line zzso and the mechanisms involved in this zzso The full-length human zzso complementary DNA was introduced into pancreatic cancer cell line zzso by zzso zzso and stable expression of zzso was detected by zzso and zzso zzso mice were separately zzso with zzso cells zzso group), zzso control and mock control zzso zzso zzso density zzso was assessed by zzso zzso and zzso were used to determine the expression of zzso factors vascular zzso growth factor zzso basic zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was significantly lower in the experimental group zzso zzso zzso than that in the zzso control zzso zzso zzso and mock control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed a significant decrease in the expression of zzso zzso and zzso protein in the experimental group compared with the zzso control and mock control, considering both the integral optical density and area of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a significant reduction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression in the experimental group compared with the zzso control and mock control zzso zzso zzso Thus, introduction of the zzso zzso the expression of which is frequently lost in human pancreatic zzso exerts its zzso effects by zzso the expression of the factors, which are involved in tumor zzso and zzso suggesting zzso gene transfer as a promising strategy of gene therapy for pancreatic zzso
