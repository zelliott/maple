In the present study, we investigated the potential zzso mechanism and zzso activity of zzso using in zzso and in zzso experimental zzso zzso of human zzso vein zzso cells zzso zzso with vascular zzso growth factor zzso 30 zzso and basic zzso growth factor zzso 30 zzso was significantly inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also blocked the zzso of zzso response element binding protein zzso induced by zzso (30 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited proliferation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells in a zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso treatment zzso zzso significantly inhibited growth of zzso and zzso mouse zzso in zzso These results indicated that zzso inhibited zzso by suppressing zzso zzso in growth factor zzso zzso This is the first study to demonstrate that zzso is an inhibitor of zzso zzso
