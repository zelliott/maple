We studied effects of zzso zzso zzso on survival of zzso a zzso brain tumor cell line, following single doses of 250 zzso zzso and on repair of damage zzso and potentially lethal damage zzso zzso zzso in both exponential and plateau phase zzso zzso were exposed to 2 zzso zzso (1 h at 37 degrees zzso prior to zzso At varying times after zzso cells were zzso in medium without zzso Two weeks later, colonies were counted and results analyzed using either the zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both exponential and plateau phase cells to zzso as shown by a decrease in the zzso dose zzso leading to an average zzso enhancement factor zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso reduced zzso in exponential cells by a factor of zzso In plateau phase cells there was little expression of zzso but zzso produced additional cell killing at zzso h after the first zzso For zzso expression in exponential cells, zzso inhibited zzso by a factor of zzso and in plateau phase cells, zzso decreased zzso expression by a factor of zzso These data show that the decreased zzso value seen after single doses of zzso with zzso treatment is also accompanied by a significant decrease in recovery from zzso and potentially lethal zzso
