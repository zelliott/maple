zzso is a member of a small family of architectural zzso factors involved in the coordinate assembly of zzso complexes referred to as zzso In addition to their role in cell zzso zzso and development, zzso group proteins of the A type zzso family members behave as transforming zzso either in zzso or in animal zzso Recent reports indicated that zzso might counteract zzso zzso and provided an interesting hint on the mechanisms determining zzso transforming zzso zzso expression is zzso in a very large array of human tumors, including cervical cancer, but very limited information is available on the molecular mechanisms leading to zzso deregulation in cancer zzso Here, we report that zzso expression is sustained by human zzso virus zzso zzso proteins in cervical cancer, as demonstrated by either zzso zzso or by repression through zzso zzso zzso down zzso expression by means of zzso zzso we also showed that it is involved in cell proliferation and contributes to zzso zzso in this type of zzso Finally, we show that zzso is necessary for the full expression of zzso E6 and zzso zzso thus establishing a positive zzso loop between zzso zzso and zzso zzso
