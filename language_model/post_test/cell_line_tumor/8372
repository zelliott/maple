zzso are zzso zzso small zzso that regulate target genes by zzso of the targeted zzso or zzso zzso We investigated the zzso using zzso zzso in a highly invasive human breast cancer cell line, zzso zzso zzso and a zzso breast zzso cell line, zzso We found 13 zzso that were zzso and nine were zzso significantly in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso change zzso compared with zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso and its putative target zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso had inverse expression pattern in breast cancer zzso The zzso region of zzso contains a regulatory element for zzso and our zzso experiments indicate that zzso zzso enhances zzso expression in cancer zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso suppressed cell invasion in zzso cells, whereas zzso zzso invasion in moderately invasive zzso breast cancer zzso In addition, zzso reduces cell proliferation as well as cell migration and zzso Analysis of human breast tumors revealed that zzso expression increases during cancer zzso zzso a decrease in zzso zzso Furthermore, our data indicate that zzso zzso cells from entering into S phase by zzso zzso which results in zzso of zzso zzso complexes, suggesting zzso reduces cell growth through its effects on cell zzso zzso Introduction of zzso into zzso cells did not suppress the effect on cell zzso These findings suggest that zzso plays an important role in several biological zzso and some effects are not completely dependent on zzso zzso
