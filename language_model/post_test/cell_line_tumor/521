In the present study we have explored the sensitivity of zzso cancer cells to the synthetic zzso zzso zzso For these studies we have used the zzso zzso cancer cell line and its zzso derivatives zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso cancer cell lines and primary zzso cancer cells, providing evidence that: zzso the majority of these cell lines are highly sensitive to the zzso effects induced by zzso zzso zzso added alone exerted only a weak zzso but clearly zzso the zzso effect zzso by zzso zzso the zzso effect induced by zzso involves zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sensitivity is zzso related to the level of zzso zzso zzso zzso studies on primary zzso cancer cells have shown that these cells are sensitive to the zzso effects of zzso These observations support the experimental use of synthetic zzso in the treatment of zzso zzso
