The zzso gene is frequently silenced in different types of tumors, and, in breast tumors, zzso is correlated with tumor zzso suggesting that it might be associated with the acquisition of a zzso zzso zzso exerts its function mainly through the zzso domain, because its zzso domain is zzso Analysis of zzso binding to zzso has revealed a specific interaction with zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso has been observed in different types of tumors, and expression of this zzso in the activated form has been shown to promote zzso zzso Here, we investigated the possibility that interaction between zzso and zzso zzso might zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso expression was knocked down using short hairpin zzso in the zzso cell line, which has been extensively used as a model for zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso by at least zzso to zzso and zzso zzso cells showed enhanced migration and zzso to classic zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression also enhanced pulmonary tumor cell arrest in zzso zzso To complement our findings with clinical evidence, we showed that zzso of zzso gene by DNA promoter zzso in a collection of 94 primary breast tumors was significantly associated with lower distant zzso and zzso zzso and was an independent zzso factor for poor disease zzso Our results strongly support a functional role of zzso during zzso progression by zzso modulating zzso zzso zzso
