zzso zzso are released from cells in association with proteins or zzso We previously reported that zzso transformation changes the assortment of released zzso by affecting whether a particular zzso species is released or retained by the zzso How this selectivity occurs is zzso Here we report that selectively exported zzso whose release is increased in zzso cells, are packaged in structures that are different from those that carry zzso released zzso zzso whose release is not affected by zzso By separating breast cancer cell zzso we find that selectively released zzso associate with zzso and zzso However, zzso of breast cancer cells associate with unconventional zzso which are larger than conventional zzso and enriched in zzso a protein relevant to breast cancer zzso Based on their large size, we call these zzso zzso zzso to the distribution of zzso among different zzso of breast cancer cells, normal cells release all measured zzso in a single type of zzso Our results suggest that zzso transformation alters the pathways through which specific zzso are exported from zzso These changes in the particles and their zzso cargo could be used to detect the presence of zzso cells in the zzso
