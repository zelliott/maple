To investigate the role of nicotine on the proliferation and cell zzso in zzso oral zzso cell zzso zzso 

The growth, zzso zzso oxygen species zzso level and nuclear factor zzso of activated B cell zzso DNA binding activity were detected in zzso oral cancer cell using zzso zzso zzso zzso flow zzso zzso linked zzso zzso 

In zzso cells treated with nicotine for 48 h at different zzso zzso 1, 10 zzso zzso level was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, which were significantly higher than in control groups zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the A value for cell growth was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, which were significantly higher than in control groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Only 1 zzso nicotine induced significantly higher cell zzso than in other groups zzso zzso zzso Cell growth was inhibited in zzso cells treated with 1 zzso nicotine for 72 zzso which had statistically significant difference compared with control zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso rate in 1 zzso nicotine treated groups for 24 h was significantly higher than 48 h and 72 h zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in the nucleus were increased in zzso cells treated with 1 zzso nicotine for 24, 48 and 72 h and the A value for zzso DNA binding activity was zzso zzso and zzso respectively, which were higher than in control group zzso 

zzso induced zzso cell growth and zzso which maybe by zzso signal zzso activated in oral cancer zzso
