The zzso zzso zzso is a potent and specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso whose zzso zzso profile supports progression towards clinical zzso zzso evaluation revealed a short zzso zzso effective zzso of cellular zzso response to zzso challenge in zzso cells indicating a need to maintain sustained levels of zzso zzso zzso evaluation in mice of novel zzso zzso in a zzso zzso showed zzso elimination from plasma zzso 30 zzso following subcutaneous zzso A zzso dose escalation gave a zzso increase in the total zzso zzso zzso and 6 h continuous infusion were investigated in rats to mimic a more clinically relevant administration zzso Drug elimination following zzso zzso administration was zzso zzso elimination zzso zzso zzso The linear relationship between dose and zzso zzso enabled the prediction of infusion rates and doses for sustained delivery using continuous 6 h zzso where steady state was reached in 120 zzso Plasma levels of zzso zzso were achieved over the duration of the zzso At the lowest dose, plasma drug levels after the zzso of infusion declined with a zzso of approximately 43 zzso zzso activity, measured both by zzso and downstream zzso was inhibited in a zzso manner by injection of zzso in mice bearing zzso of the human zzso cell line zzso which expresses a zzso active zzso of the zzso zzso Taken together, these experiments provide essential data to assess the zzso efficacy of zzso and will assist in the rational design of dose regimens for clinical zzso
