The involvement of unfolded protein response zzso zzso in tumor survival and resistance to zzso suggests a new zzso strategy targeting zzso zzso zzso a natural product, has been recently identified for its zzso activity with selective toxicity against cancer cells under zzso zzso with unknown zzso Here we found that zzso specifically blocks the zzso induction of two potential zzso targets, namely zzso zzso zzso and its analog zzso under zzso zzso but not by zzso The zzso of other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso deprivation was also suppressed by zzso A further zzso experiment showed that zzso expression of zzso at least partially rescued zzso zzso cell growth zzso suggesting the zzso role of zzso suppression in zzso zzso under zzso zzso These observations bring a new insight into the mechanism of action of zzso and may lead to the design of new zzso zzso
