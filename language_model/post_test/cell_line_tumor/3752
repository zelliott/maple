Despite progress in identifying molecular drivers of cancer, it has been difficult to translate this knowledge into new therapies, because many of the zzso proteins cannot be inhibited by conventional small zzso zzso zzso interference zzso which uses small zzso to inhibit gene zzso provides a promising alternative to reach traditionally zzso protein targets by shutting off their expression at the zzso zzso zzso zzso Challenges for realizing the potential of zzso have included identifying the appropriate genes to target and achieving sufficient zzso in zzso We have developed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso and delivered these in zzso using zzso zzso resulting in significant reduction of zzso expression in liver cancer zzso Reduction of zzso strongly reduced tumor burden, alone or in combination with zzso and as effectively as zzso that target zzso genes such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso also strongly reduced the expression of zzso zzso including zzso providing a potential mechanism for tumor zzso These results validate zzso as a target for liver cancer therapy and demonstrate the promise of zzso in general and zzso in particular for reaching traditionally zzso cancer zzso
