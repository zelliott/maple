zzso zzso referred to as zzso a major zzso zzso zzso zzso is the product of a zzso gene that has been found zzso in different cancer zzso In the present study, we sought to investigate the role of zzso in zzso induced by ultraviolet light (the most important zzso cause of skin zzso and zzso (an zzso DNA damaging zzso It is clearly shown that zzso zzso zzso cell line and zzso mouse zzso zzso are sensitive to zzso zzso as compared to their respective zzso zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicating that zzso protects cells from undergoing zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso this reduction in zzso zzso was associated with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with no effect on zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso role of zzso is zzso via the zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso through zzso zzso Interestingly, only zzso but not zzso zzso cells underwent zzso in response to the zzso zzso These novel findings provide further insight into the role of zzso in zzso and has potential implications for future therapy zzso
