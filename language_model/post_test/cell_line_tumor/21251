zzso based zzso zzso can detect zzso effects of human zzso Y zzso on living cells in a zzso zzso free way in real time without the need of supporting zzso Since the discovery that zzso transformations in breast cancer are correlated with a change of the zzso zzso expression of zzso in the affected zzso the zzso zzso system has come to the fore of cancer zzso Today there are different methods detecting zzso zzso interactions like fluorescent and radioactive zzso or detecting zzso zzso like zzso zzso zzso zzso and G zzso zzso zzso For all these zzso it is necessary to either label related proteins with additional zzso which can affect the nature state of the cell, or the need of producing cell zzso which allows only a snapshot of the investigated zzso To overcome these problems we established a new method to detect zzso zzso zzso we monitor the complex electric resistance zzso of cells attached to a zzso over a wide frequency zzso Cell zzso are detected as changes in the zzso zzso After application of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is decreased at 5 zzso frequency within zzso This effect can be inhibited by zzso the cells with zzso for a time range of 20 zzso The zzso effect of zzso can be washed out and the same cells can be zzso by zzso zzso
