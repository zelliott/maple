Although the zzso effects of zzso are known, the precise mechanism of action has yet to be zzso 

zzso and zzso cells were used for these zzso The effect of zzso on gene expression was zzso using a DNA zzso zzso Northern zzso and/or quantitative zzso were carried out to confirm any changes in gene zzso The effect of zzso on cell cycle progression was analyzed using flow zzso zzso interference experiments were employed for the zzso zzso 

zzso markedly induced zzso a cell zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso arrest, but not zzso was observed in both cell types following treatment with zzso The introduction of zzso against zzso partially zzso the induction of zzso arrest by zzso in both cell zzso 

zzso induced zzso arrest in zzso and zzso zzso zzso may be involved in zzso zzso zzso
