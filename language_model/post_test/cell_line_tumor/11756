A novel and facile strategy using zzso zzso zzso as a zzso and template has been proposed and applied for the first time to zzso a novel and unique class of zzso eccentric zzso zzso zzso zzso consisting of a single zzso zzso zzso zzso and eccentric zzso zzso that are composed of a large number of small fluorescent zzso zzso Interestingly, the resulting eccentric zzso shell around zzso zzso as a high zzso zzso is like a zzso to absorb and retain water molecules inside its net structure to zzso the growth of small zzso zzso inside the zzso networks, resulting in the formation of an eccentric zzso NC with zzso zzso The thicknesses of uniform and zzso zzso zzso can also be precisely controlled by varying the amount of zzso zzso zzso zzso the synthetic method has been confirmed to be universal and extended to other functional zzso with different compositions and shapes as eccentric zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso eccentric zzso zzso zzso combined zzso imaging, zzso drug loading capacity zzso zzso zzso eccentric zzso and zzso drug release into one were taken as an example to study the applications in simultaneous zzso imaging and pH responsive drug delivery into prostate cancer zzso zzso
