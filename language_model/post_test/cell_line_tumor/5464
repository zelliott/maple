We previously demonstrated that two closely spaced zzso zzso with the consensus sequence zzso located between zzso zzso to zzso of zzso zzso interactions with cellular zzso zzso The zzso motif zzso zzso is only zzso in zzso 1 zzso whereas the zzso motif zzso is zzso throughout all zzso C virus zzso zzso although this motif was shown to be zzso for replication of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to investigate the potential role of these motifs in the viral life cycle, we have undertaken a detailed zzso analysis of these zzso zzso in the context of both zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso infectious zzso zzso We show that the zzso motif is zzso for zzso replication of all zzso zzso and, zzso is not required for virus production in zzso In contrast, the zzso motif is only required for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso within zzso to zzso dramatically attenuated zzso zzso zzso replication in three distinct genetic backgrounds, but the corresponding zzso zzso was not required for replication of the zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso resulted in both a delay to virus release and a modest (up to zzso reduction in virus zzso These data point to critical roles for these zzso zzso at multiple stages in the zzso life zzso however, they also caution against zzso of data from zzso zzso to infectious zzso
