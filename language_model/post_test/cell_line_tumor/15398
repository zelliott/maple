zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso is expressed in most zzso zzso where its zzso relevance is zzso Using zzso normal sequence zzso zzso inhibitor zzso a zzso associated with familial zzso zzso an active zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso techniques, we investigated the actions of zzso on cell migration zzso zzso collagen invasion zzso invasion zzso and proliferation zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso human zzso zzso cell zzso All three forms of zzso zzso migration zzso and normal sequence zzso showed synergistic zzso effects when added with zzso zzso of structurally unrelated soybean zzso inhibitor had no zzso zzso Similar results were seen using collagen invasion zzso although the active site zzso zzso had no zzso activity, probably due to reduced zzso zzso zzso did not stimulate proliferation despite acting, at least zzso through the zzso zzso as effects of zzso were truncated by the addition of an zzso zzso blocking zzso or the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Cell lines produced zzso zzso and zzso zzso interference zzso or the addition of zzso zzso zzso or zzso blocking agents reduced migration and invasion below zzso zzso induced zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso This profile was more limited than that induced by zzso and did not include zzso probably explaining the lack of zzso zzso Our findings of zzso stimulation and synergistic responses between zzso and zzso at zzso found in urine and tissue suggest that zzso has zzso zzso
