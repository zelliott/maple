Alzheimer's disease zzso is a complex, neurodegenerative disease characterized by the impairment of cognitive function in elderly zzso In a recent global gene expression study of zzso transgenic mice, we found elevated expression of zzso zzso which we zzso represents a zzso response because of zzso zzso damage caused by the zzso of zzso zzso and/or zzso beta zzso We investigated this hypothesis in a series of experiments examining what forms of zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso and whether the presence of these species is associated with zzso dysfunction and zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso and electron zzso techniques, we found a relationship between zzso zzso derivatives and zzso in brain slices from zzso mice and in mouse zzso cells expressing zzso human zzso Further, to determine the functional relationship between zzso zzso and zzso damage, we zzso zzso levels, hydrogen zzso production, zzso zzso activity and zzso proteins in zzso mice and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were found to be significantly increased in zzso mice when compared with zzso zzso zzso and directly correlated with levels of soluble zzso in zzso mice, suggesting that soluble zzso may be responsible for the production of hydrogen zzso in zzso progression in zzso zzso zzso c zzso activity was found to be decreased in zzso mice when compared with zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso and soluble zzso impair zzso metabolism in zzso development and zzso An increase in hydrogen zzso and a decrease in zzso zzso activity were found in young zzso mice, prior to the appearance of zzso zzso These findings suggest that early zzso targeted therapeutic interventions may be effective in delaying zzso progression in elderly individuals and in treating zzso zzso
