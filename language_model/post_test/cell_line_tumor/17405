zzso comparative zzso zzso zzso is a recently developed tool for zzso determination of DNA copy number zzso This technology has tremendous potential for zzso discovery in cancer and zzso disorders as well as numerous other zzso However, widespread zzso of a zzso has been limited by the lack of well zzso high-resolution clone sets zzso for consistent performance in zzso zzso and specifically designed zzso zzso We have assembled a set of approximately 4100 publicly available human bacterial artificial zzso zzso clones evenly spaced at approximately zzso resolution across the zzso which includes direct coverage of approximately 400 known cancer zzso This zzso clone set was compiled from five existing sets, zzso zzso and supplemented for higher resolution and enhancing mapping zzso This clone set is associated with a public online resource containing detailed clone mapping data, protocols for the construction and use of zzso and a suite of zzso software tools designed specifically for zzso zzso These resources should greatly facilitate the use of zzso in gene zzso
