To study the zzso of zzso zzso expression in human lung zzso cancer cell zzso through zzso virus zzso zzso and therefore to observe its effect on the growth of cancer cells and tumor zzso 

zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso was constructed, and then zzso into zzso zzso zzso cells and cells zzso with zzso were used as the control zzso The effects of the reduced expression of zzso by zzso from zzso on the growth, formation, zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso were zzso 

In zzso experiment showed that zzso was constructed zzso There was an significant decrease in the expression of zzso protein 72 h after zzso compared with the normal zzso cells and zzso cells zzso zzso zzso Cell cycle analysis showed that the proliferation index zzso of normal zzso cells, zzso cells and zzso cells were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no statistic difference in the zzso among the 3 groups zzso zzso zzso In zzso experiment using zzso mice showed that, there was an remarkable reduction in the mass and volume of tumors in zzso zzso group, compared to the control zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively in the 3 groups, a statistic difference among the zzso group, the normal zzso group and the zzso zzso zzso The percentages of zzso cells in each group were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, the experimental group being higher than those of the control zzso Positive rates of zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, the zzso zzso cancer cells showing a lower zzso index than the control zzso 

zzso expression of zzso could reduce the expression of zzso in cancer cells, significantly enough to inhibit cell zzso promote cell zzso and inhibit tumor zzso
