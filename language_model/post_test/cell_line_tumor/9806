To investigate the effects and possible mechanisms of zzso zzso an alcohol extract of the root of zzso zzso Bunge, on tumor invasion and zzso of human colon zzso zzso zzso 

The effects of zzso zzso on invasion and zzso of zzso cell lines zzso and zzso were evaluated by in zzso and in zzso zzso Western zzso was used to investigate possible molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso inhibited migration and invasion of zzso cells in a zzso zzso The zzso effect also depended on time, with the most significant effects observed at 72 zzso zzso zzso also significantly inhibited in zzso zzso of colon zzso zzso zzso It inhibited in zzso and in zzso invasion and zzso of zzso cells by reducing levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and by increasing levels of tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso was also shown to suppress the nuclear zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso inhibited in zzso and in zzso invasion and zzso of zzso zzso The effect resulted from changes in the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and apparent zzso of the zzso signal zzso zzso
