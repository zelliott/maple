The zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in the development of zzso resistance in lung zzso Several suspension lung zzso cell lines, which express zzso zzso undergo zzso or zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso However, lung zzso cell lines vary in their sensitivity to zzso zzso We hypothesized that the addition of zzso a potent zzso zzso should significantly enhance the degree of zzso in lung zzso cells treated with zzso zzso In this study, we treated four suspension lung zzso cell lines with zzso an zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso or a combination of zzso In zzso and zzso cells, combined treatment with zzso and an zzso inhibitor effectively induced zzso and the extent of zzso was significantly greater than that induced by each agent alone; the zzso between the two drugs was zzso Although we did not observe a marked increase in zzso in zzso and zzso cells treated with zzso alone, zzso and zzso cells treated with zzso (1 zzso upon detachment significantly underwent zzso the levels of which were much greater than those observed upon zzso However, the levels of zzso induced by combination treatment were still greater than those by the individual agents in zzso and zzso zzso These findings provide a biological rationale to test combination therapy with zzso and zzso zzso in patients with lung zzso
