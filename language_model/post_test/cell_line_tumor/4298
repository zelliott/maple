zzso zzso can zzso behave as either tumor zzso or zzso depending on its zzso state and the type of zzso In this study we show that zzso was zzso on zzso 14 zzso by zzso family members in various human cell lines and primary mouse cultures of zzso zzso the most frequent zzso zzso affecting zzso zzso zzso in the human zzso zzso or zzso zzso cells yielded increased zzso levels and reinforced the zzso state of either zzso or zzso zzso respectively, in turn enhancing in zzso cell zzso migration, zzso and zzso In contrast, reducing the zzso levels by administration of a zzso inhibitor or through targeted zzso zzso zzso the zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with these results, zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells into nude mice resulted in substantial tumor growth in comparison to control zzso Taken together, these data point to zzso as an important and zzso valuable target for overcoming the progression and zzso resistance of zzso
