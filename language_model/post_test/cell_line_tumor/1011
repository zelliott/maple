zzso D zzso has been strongly implicated in the regulation of zzso trafficking as well as zzso and zzso Our aim was to investigate the role of zzso in regulating the zzso zzso of insulin from pancreatic zzso that is essential for zzso zzso zzso We observed that zzso activity in zzso pancreatic zzso is closely coupled to zzso Cellular zzso activity was increased in response to a variety of zzso including the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pharmacological or hormonal zzso of zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso Most importantly, blockade of zzso zzso acid formation using zzso inhibited insulin zzso in both zzso cells and isolated pancreatic zzso It was further established that zzso activity was required for both the first and the second phase of zzso insulin release, suggesting a role in the very zzso steps of zzso beyond zzso recruitment into a readily zzso zzso zzso of zzso using green fluorescent zzso confirmed a requirement for zzso prior to zzso fusion with the plasma zzso zzso was shown to be the zzso zzso in zzso cells, and it was located at least partially on insulin zzso zzso of zzso or a dominant negative zzso inactive zzso of zzso zzso or inhibited zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso acid formation on the zzso membrane by zzso is essential for the regulated zzso of insulin from pancreatic zzso
