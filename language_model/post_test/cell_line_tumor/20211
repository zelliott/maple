Previous study has shown human serum zzso zzso coated zzso can deliver zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso cells, and decrease zzso zzso and protein expression zzso In the current study, cell growth zzso and zzso of zzso cells were zzso zzso composed of zzso ammonium zzso zzso zzso zzso 1000 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and coated with zzso were examined for cell growth zzso and zzso to a commonly used zzso drug, zzso zzso zzso complexes effectively inhibited cell growth in the range of zzso concentration of zzso zzso Upon zzso with zzso the zzso was further significantly increased compared to the zzso complexes zzso The zzso was dependent on zzso zzso zzso incubation time and zzso zzso and relatively independent on zzso zzso This study suggests that zzso zzso are effective delivery vehicles for zzso zzso with potential therapeutic application and can be effectively combined with zzso
