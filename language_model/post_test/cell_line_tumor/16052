Investigation of the mechanism underlying cell zzso zzso capture by zzso zzso zzso through zzso revealed an unidentified zzso protein zzso bound to zzso We identified zzso as zzso zzso zzso heavy chain zzso by mass zzso and zzso analysis using zzso zzso After stimulation with zzso growth factor I zzso zzso zzso with zzso in zzso at the leading edge of zzso zzso of zzso expression by small interfering zzso zzso and zzso of zzso II activity by zzso zzso the formation of zzso filament zzso arcs and zzso induced by zzso zzso was zzso associated with zzso which was dependent on zzso II activity, and the zzso complex zzso to zzso at the leading edge after zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is required for zzso formation since it provides zzso forces and tension for the zzso network to form convex arcs at the leading edge through zzso binding to zzso and zzso with zzso in response to zzso
