To clarify the mechanism of progression and acquired drug resistance of zzso we searched for an zzso gene in drug-resistant leukemia cells and identified an approximately zzso transcript by using the zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the gene was highly zzso to those of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso revealed that the gene was zzso in cells from 6 childhood acute zzso leukemia patients zzso but not in bone zzso cells at zzso zzso blood zzso cells from normal controls zzso and bone zzso cells from zzso patients zzso did not express the zzso These findings indicate that the gene may play a role in zzso and may be a novel leukemia zzso Further studies on the functional role of the gene are zzso
