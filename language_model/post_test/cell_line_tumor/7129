The cell biology of Alzheimer's disease zzso is characterized mainly by the zzso caused by the zzso zzso peptides and by the formation of zzso zzso The initial events of zzso in the brain tissue include synaptic dysfunction and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were studied in zzso on differentiated zzso zzso zzso zzso Different methods were used to investigate the mechanism of action of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 1 h induced irreversible changes in the zzso zzso Change of zzso zzso and cell viability zzso zzso state and active membrane zzso was irreversible during the first hour after the addition of zzso zzso to the zzso These rapid events indicate that zzso might induce zzso even at an early stage of zzso zzso A novel zzso zzso an analog of zzso zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell viability reduction induced by zzso zzso
