zzso zzso is a severe pediatric tumor originating from neural crest derivatives and accounting for zzso of childhood cancer zzso The zzso and complex genetic zzso has been confirmed with the identification of zzso in two zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso in a limited proportion of zzso zzso Interestingly, these two genes are zzso in the great majority of primary zzso samples and cell zzso These observations led us to test the hypothesis of a regulatory or functional relationship between zzso and zzso underlying zzso zzso 

Following this possibility, we first confirmed a striking correlation between the zzso levels of zzso zzso and its direct target zzso in a panel of zzso cell zzso Then, we manipulated their expression in zzso cell lines by zzso zzso and forced zzso of each gene under zzso Surprisingly, zzso and zzso zzso efficiently zzso each other as well as zzso gene and, consistently, the enhanced expression of zzso in zzso cells yielded an zzso of zzso zzso We finally demonstrated that zzso drives zzso gene zzso by directly binding its promoter, which therefore represents a novel zzso zzso 

These findings provide a compelling explanation of the concurrent involvement of these two genes in zzso zzso and are going to foster a better understanding of molecular interactions at the base of the zzso Moreover, this work opens new perspectives for zzso zzso to conventional therapies that may benefit from the design of novel therapeutic zzso approaches for multiple gene zzso
