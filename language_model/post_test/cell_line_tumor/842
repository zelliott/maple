The zzso protein zzso binds to and suppresses the zzso zzso function of zzso thus zzso zzso Despite being abundant as a component of the zzso large zzso zzso zzso does not induce zzso under normal growth zzso In search of mechanisms controlling zzso interaction, we found that the induction of zzso under growth zzso conditions, such as low dose of zzso D or serum zzso can be significantly attenuated by knocking down zzso indicating the importance of zzso in zzso these growth zzso signals to zzso We show that zzso is not regulated by zzso or protein stability and its level remains relatively constant during serum zzso However, serum zzso zzso zzso of zzso from the zzso to the zzso where it zzso in a complex with zzso We propose that the zzso acts as a barrier to prevent zzso interacting with zzso during normal zzso Growth zzso presumably through suppression of zzso production in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso thus zzso zzso through zzso zzso
