The zzso biological clock involves a negative zzso feedback loop in which clock genes regulate their own zzso and that of output genes of zzso zzso While around zzso of the liver zzso is rhythmic, only about a fifth is driven by de zzso transcription, indicating zzso processing is a major zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso of zzso reactions zzso the zzso zzso zzso sequencing then reveals zzso zzso causes widespread changes in the zzso of the zzso processing machinery, associated with zzso zzso We identify zzso sites on many clock gene transcripts and show that specific zzso of zzso zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to elicit zzso period zzso and zzso processing zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso distribution of clock genes zzso and zzso then revealed an zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso rhythms when zzso zzso is zzso
