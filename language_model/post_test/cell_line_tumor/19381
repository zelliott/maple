With the goal of assessing the environmental risk of zzso we have previously observed that a mixture of 13 different drugs at environmentally relevant zzso had adverse consequences on human and zebra fish cells in zzso Here we aimed to identify both main and interaction effects within the same environmentally relevant mixture of zzso We studied in zzso zzso in zzso coli, human embryonic zzso and zzso zzso tumor cells using zzso experimental zzso Our approach identified a subset of compounds of primary environmental concern, namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso that had statistically significant effects on zzso and zzso cells at environmentally relevant exposure levels zzso Drugs could interact and behave as zzso with joint effects representing a statistically significant element of mixture zzso zzso and interactions were concentration dependent, confirming the difficulty of dose zzso in mixture toxicity zzso This study suggests that a thorough investigation of mixture effects can direct environmental concerns toward a handful of zzso which may represent an actual risk at environmental zzso We indicate that risk identification may strongly depend on the use of environmentally relevant exposure zzso zzso interactions and dose dependency of effects may hamper the modeling and prediction of mixture toxicity with zzso zzso identification for zzso depends heavily on appropriate study designs, and we indicate the use of in zzso zzso threshold and statistical design of experiments zzso as a valid zzso
