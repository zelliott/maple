The genetic engineering, zzso and validation of a fusion protein of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso to the human insulin zzso zzso is zzso The 15 zzso zzso zzso was fused to the zzso zzso of the heavy chain of the zzso The fusion protein heavy chain reacted with zzso specific for human zzso and zzso and had the same affinity for binding to the zzso zzso domain as the original zzso zzso The fusion protein zzso bound zzso zzso but was zzso fully saturated with zzso by zzso cells, zzso to the high level of zzso in tissue culture zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells were permanently zzso with a tandem zzso expressing the fusion protein zzso and high expressing cell lines were isolated by zzso amplification and zzso zzso The product expressed by zzso cells had high binding to the zzso and migrated as a homogeneous species in size exclusion zzso and native zzso gel zzso The zzso cells were adapted to a 4 week culture in zzso depleted zzso and the zzso fusion protein expressed under these conditions had 1 unoccupied zzso binding site per zzso based on a zzso zzso zzso The zzso increased zzso zzso by human cells zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso In zzso the zzso fusion protein is a new drug targeting system for humans that can be adapted to zzso drugs or zzso zzso
