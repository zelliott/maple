zzso zzso a zzso multiple zzso zzso zzso has been shown to suppress the growth of various tumor zzso Since zzso inhibited by zzso are involved in zzso zzso we hypothesized that this novel target therapeutic might have a role in the treatment of human leukemia zzso zzso we examined the effect of zzso on human zzso cells and evaluated potential zzso zzso inhibited the growth of both zzso and zzso cells in zzso and zzso zzso zzso changes such as enlarged zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were noted in both cell lines treated by zzso A smaller population of zzso cells was also zzso DNA zzso revealed zzso and zzso populations of zzso zzso zzso treatment enhanced the surface expression of the zzso marker zzso in contrast, the zzso marker zzso A expression was zzso At optimal conditions for inducing zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression and signaling of zzso a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso can inhibit zzso induce zzso zzso and to a lesser extent, cause zzso in zzso zzso This effect might involve the expression and signaling of zzso
