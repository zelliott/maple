To explore the biological function and possible underlying mechanism of zzso zzso family 1 member B10 zzso gene during zzso 

A pair of chemically zzso small interfering zzso zzso targeting on zzso was zzso into liver cancer cell line zzso by zzso zzso After confirming the interfering effects of zzso through zzso zzso Green zzso chain reaction zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso activity zzso the capabilities of proliferation and zzso of the zzso cells were observed by zzso zzso and flow zzso analysis, and the expressions of a group of zzso gene such as zzso zzso zzso were observed through zzso zzso 

The expressions of zzso and the zzso activity were zzso significantly in zzso zzso Compared with mock and blank control groups, cell growth in zzso group was inhibited by zzso at zzso after zzso The ratio of zzso cells was zzso in zzso group, which was significantly higher than that in mock and blank control groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso gene zzso were zzso in zzso cells, while the expressions of zzso gene zzso and zzso were zzso 

zzso might promote zzso inhibit zzso and then induce zzso transformation of zzso by regulating the expression level of some zzso zzso
