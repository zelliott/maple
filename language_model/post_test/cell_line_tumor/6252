The zzso transition zzso in prostate cancer zzso cells is considered prerequisite for acquiring zzso zzso and subsequent zzso We hypothesized that promoting the zzso expression in zzso cells by using nontoxic zzso like zzso would prevent zzso and consequently zzso Our results showed that zzso treatment zzso zzso significantly zzso migratory and invasive potential of advance human zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells in in zzso zzso zzso the zzso efficacy of zzso was not due to its zzso toward zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso increases zzso level that was localized mainly at cellular membrane as evidenced by zzso fractional and zzso analyses in zzso cells, which might be responsible for zzso observed shift toward zzso zzso zzso also decreased the levels of zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso and zzso together they play an important role in regulating zzso zzso and zzso Similar zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels were also observed in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Selective zzso zzso by zzso also showed increased zzso expression in zzso cells suggesting a possible involvement of zzso zzso in zzso increase in zzso zzso Additional studies in zzso cells with stable zzso of zzso expression revealed that zzso efficacy of zzso is zzso dependent on zzso zzso Together, our results showing zzso effects of zzso and associated mechanisms suggest that zzso should be tested further in clinically relevant animal models toward exploiting its potential benefits against zzso zzso
