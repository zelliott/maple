zzso a permanent natural killer zzso cell line, shows zzso against a variety of tumors and has been tested in a phase I zzso We tested the toxicity of zzso and chemotherapy drugs against the stem cell capacity of the acute leukemia cell line, zzso While the zzso zzso is the most common method for assessing zzso of immune zzso and flow zzso is increasingly used, the relationship of either zzso to zzso zzso remains zzso 

zzso was assessed for stem cell frequency by serial zzso zzso sorting and colony growth in zzso zzso was sorted into zzso zzso and zzso zzso populations and zzso in liquid medium or zzso to determine the zzso capacity of each zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso against zzso was measured using the zzso zzso flow zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso cell frequency of whole zzso was between 1 in 100 to 1000 by serial dilution and zzso zzso Although a rare zzso zzso zzso population could be demonstrated in zzso both zzso had equivalent zzso zzso The cumulative flow zzso zzso was more sensitive than the zzso zzso in detecting target cell zzso At a zzso ratio zzso eliminated the zzso capacity of zzso which was not predicted by the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso provide a more sensitive means of assessing the effect of a zzso agent against putative cancer stem cells within cell lines, provided that they grow well in liquid culture medium or zzso
