Although zzso cell lung cancer zzso cells with zzso zzso in their zzso growth factor receptors zzso initially show a dramatic response to zzso zzso inhibitor zzso these cells eventually develop resistance to zzso This resistance may be caused by a secondary zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso which leads to the substitution of zzso for zzso in zzso In this study, we show that a combination of zzso and zzso overcomes zzso resistance in zzso with the zzso zzso We observed that zzso lung cancer cells were resistant to zzso and zzso was persistently activated in the resistant zzso A zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso by blocking zzso of zzso and zzso which led to a modest increase in the zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso In addition to zzso the zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso and zzso cell death in zzso zzso Finally, combined zzso and zzso treatment resulted in significantly enhanced zzso against zzso zzso cells in zzso and in zzso Taken together, these data suggest that treatment with a combination of zzso and zzso which zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso appears to be an effective strategy for treatment of patients with zzso zzso zzso
