The zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes growth and zzso of solid zzso We recently identified that zzso zzso of the zzso promoter is associated with better survival of zzso lung zzso patients, and now also demonstrates a marginal improvement in survival of advanced zzso cell lung cancer zzso patients receiving standard chemotherapy zzso zzso zzso zzso studies focused on investigating the effect of zzso on zzso expression and its zzso zzso The genes and pathways modulated by zzso zzso of zzso and the effects on sensitivity to chemotherapy were characterized in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso through small interfering zzso or zzso primarily increased expression of zzso genes including zzso a marker for increased sensitivity to zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso cell lines with zzso zzso zzso express zzso higher zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines and normal human zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso and high zzso zzso zzso cell lines were zzso more sensitive to zzso than zzso and low zzso zzso cell zzso zzso a soluble analog of zzso and zzso zzso drug, dramatically arrested the growth of zzso but not zzso lung tumors in nude mice ( zzso Similarly, high zzso expression that is comparable to the zzso zzso zzso cell lines was found in tumors from zzso of zzso patients compared with normal zzso indicating a potential to identify and target the most sensitive zzso zzso for personalized zzso zzso
