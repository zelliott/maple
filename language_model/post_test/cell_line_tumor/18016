To investigate the expression and significance of zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso in human zzso 

zzso zzso for zzso gamma was performed using biopsy specimens of human zzso of various zzso zzso zzso of zzso gamma and zzso in zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso were analyzed using Western zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction zzso 

zzso study showed that zzso gamma was expressed in zzso zzso with positive rate of zzso Western zzso and zzso showed that zzso gamma was expressed in both zzso cell lines zzso and zzso but not in zzso zzso However, high expression of zzso was detected in zzso zzso 

zzso gamma is associated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso gamma by zzso may be a novel approach to the treatment of zzso
