Single zzso zzso zzso mapping zzso were used to perform DNA copy number analysis of five human cancer cell lines (four zzso zzso one zzso cell lung zzso to identify and map the zzso of deletions of zzso All five cell lines exhibited zzso deletions encompassing the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The DNA analysis profiles demarcated precisely two different, but zzso deletions in each zzso cell line, but the lung cancer cells showed two copies of a single zzso In the latter cell line, zzso analysis revealed that virtually all zzso for zzso 9 were zzso suggestive of zzso zzso These findings demonstrate the utility of zzso mapping zzso for high-resolution analysis of zzso imbalances in cancer zzso
