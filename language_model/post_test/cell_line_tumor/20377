A library of zzso derivatives of zzso zzso acid were prepared zzso and the activity as zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso determined in zzso against zzso and the zzso activity determined in zzso zzso zzso The zzso values of the best-performing compounds zzso against zzso ranged between 38 and zzso The least potent compound zzso inhibited a maximum of only zzso zzso activity at zzso The zzso activity of zzso at zzso against zzso zzso cells ranged between zzso and zzso The structural similarity between the potent zzso inhibitor zzso A zzso 1; zzso zzso zzso and the present compounds zzso was high at the zzso zzso zzso acid head zzso and in selected compounds zzso zzso at the zzso zzso The significantly reduced potency of zzso relative to 1 underscores the rank importance of the zzso region as part of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso modeling of zzso using zzso as the template suggested that the zzso constrained zzso group of 1 may contribute to zzso inhibitor potency through a zzso interaction with a zzso region containing zzso and zzso and that the absence of this group in zzso may reduce zzso The close proximity of the zzso oxygen atom in zzso to the sulfur atom of zzso in zzso or the corresponding zzso group of zzso in zzso may zzso potency through repulsive zzso and zzso zzso In a unique resonance stabilized form of 2, this interaction could manifest as stronger zzso repulsive forces, resulting in a further decrease in zzso This work suggests that resonance structures of zzso zzso could zzso zzso interactions with zzso targets, and zzso
