To explore the inducing effect of human zzso zzso gene on the zzso of the human gastric cancer cell line zzso and its associated zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso was constructed to zzso the human gastric cancer cell line zzso Using flow zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso analysis, we measured the zzso effect of zzso on the human gastric cancer zzso 

zzso was successfully constructed and the infection efficiency reached zzso After 18 h of infection, we observed an zzso zzso peak on the flow zzso before zzso and zzso characteristic bands in the DNA zzso The zzso rate detected by zzso method was significantly higher in the zzso group zzso compared to the control group zzso P zzso zzso 

Human zzso zzso can induce zzso of the human gastric cancer cells in zzso
