zzso both arrests replication zzso and enhances repair of DNA damage by zzso downstream zzso Although there has been a concerted effort to identify zzso of zzso activity, underlying mechanisms of zzso action are still being zzso zzso (also called zzso is a zzso and zzso domain protein that promotes both DNA zzso break zzso repair and zzso of stalled replication zzso In this study, we show that zzso is zzso only on zzso zzso in zzso in response to DNA damage by zzso zzso zzso is the major zzso of this zzso zzso We had previously shown that zzso zzso zzso associates with zzso near zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we show that a zzso zzso zzso zzso which is not zzso by zzso is defective in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso also fails to enhance repair of an induced zzso when compared with zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso demonstrated increased zzso of stalled replication zzso compared with zzso zzso Thus, zzso of zzso zzso zzso between these two functions, enhancing zzso repair and zzso replication fork zzso In zzso these data lend insight into the mechanism by which zzso enhances repair of DNA damage while at the same time zzso stalled replication fork zzso
