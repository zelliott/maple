The expression of zzso zzso zzso by the zzso resistance 1 zzso zzso is associated with the emergence of the zzso zzso in cancer zzso We investigated whether zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso cells were incubated with zzso and changes in zzso expression were determined at the zzso protein and functional zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed to assess its gene promoter activities, and zzso analysis to study its molecular mechanisms of zzso 

zzso significantly inhibited zzso expression by blocking zzso gene zzso zzso also significantly increased the zzso zzso of the fluorescent zzso zzso zzso Nuclear zzso zzso activity and the level of zzso degradation were reduced by zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso cells with the zzso zzso of zzso induced zzso promoter activity and zzso and this effect was attenuated by zzso The suppression of zzso promoter activity and protein expression was zzso through zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso Small interfering zzso methods confirmed that reduction of zzso levels zzso the zzso of zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso effects of zzso on zzso expression and zzso element binding protein zzso zzso were reversed by zzso of a zzso zzso of zzso 

These results suggest that zzso activates zzso and suppresses zzso expression in zzso cells by zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso This study reveals a novel function of zzso as an zzso zzso
