Survival rates for zzso cell zzso of the head and neck zzso have remained unchanged for several decades due to local tumor zzso as well as regional and distant zzso Recent evidence has shown that zzso zzso is zzso in stages III and IV regionally zzso zzso compared with stages I and II localized zzso This study evaluated the expression of zzso in head and neck zzso and investigated the zzso use of this marker on a large cohort of previously zzso patients with zzso 

Standard Western zzso techniques were used to evaluate zzso protein expression in nine established head and neck cancer cell lines and in normal oral zzso In zzso expression of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso was investigated using zzso analysis on a tissue zzso composed of 113 independent tumor zzso zzso expression was analyzed as it related to clinical and zzso variables of zzso 

zzso of zzso protein were increased in the zzso cell lines compared with normal oral zzso The in zzso expression of zzso correlated with advanced clinical stage and zzso zzso zzso for the entire patient cohort as well as in small primary tumors zzso and zzso 

This study is the first to examine the expression of zzso zzso protein in zzso and normal zzso zzso It is clear from the results that zzso is a specific marker of zzso zzso zzso in patients with this challenging form of zzso zzso levels seem to identify a subset of patients with early tumor stage primary tumors and high zzso potential that might benefit from more aggressive zzso Through continued investigation, blockade of zzso activity may be a potential target in the development of novel strategies for treating zzso of head and neck zzso
