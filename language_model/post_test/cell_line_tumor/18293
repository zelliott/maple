zzso also named as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been proved to be involved in several aspects of tumor zzso In addition to its ability to induce vascular zzso growth factor zzso production, it zzso resistance to some zzso zzso To investigate the possible role of zzso in the mouse zzso cell line zzso with no zzso potential in the zzso zzso we used zzso interference zzso approach to silence zzso zzso The results showed that zzso of zzso in zzso cells significantly zzso the expression of zzso at both zzso and protein zzso The zzso cells exhibited significantly decreased growth ability when compared with control zzso Colony formation of zzso deficient cells was dramatically inhibited in soft zzso and zzso was reduced in nude zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso expression also zzso cells to be more sensitive to zzso These results suggested that zzso might be a potential target for therapeutic zzso zzso
