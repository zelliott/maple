zzso zzso is an integral part of tissue development, zzso and zzso but excessive zzso is associated with various zzso zzso The ability to target zzso undergoing zzso could lead to new zzso and zzso as well as applications in zzso zzso however, such zzso are often zzso and zzso making them difficult to target with conventional zzso Here, we present zzso collagen zzso peptides zzso that can be zzso to fold into triple zzso and bind to zzso zzso by heat or by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate that the binding is primarily driven by zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso of high zzso propensity and zzso collagen zzso zzso zzso allows specific zzso of collagen chains in protein gels as well as zzso of collagen and gelatin zzso In zzso experiments demonstrate that zzso delivered zzso can bind to zzso in bones, as well as prominently in zzso zzso and tumors characterized by high zzso zzso We further show that zzso zzso can detect abnormal bone growth activity in a mouse model of zzso zzso This is an entirely new way to target the zzso of abnormal zzso and could lead to new opportunities for management of numerous zzso conditions associated with collagen zzso and high zzso zzso
