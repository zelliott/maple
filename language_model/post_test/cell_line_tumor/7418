To investigate the possibility of using zzso labeled framework region zzso zzso zzso zzso as an imaging agent or zzso therapeutic zzso in zzso 

A zzso partial zzso zzso sequence was zzso and grafted in zzso with a zzso group which was further zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was performed using the zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso mice were injected via a tail vein with 148 zzso zzso zzso zzso Animals were sacrificed at the end of 1, 2, 4 and 24 zzso and tissue samples were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were injected zzso into zzso zzso mice (6 weeks after zzso of 107 zzso zzso meanwhile zzso zzso labeled sense zzso served as zzso zzso was monitored by sequential zzso and organ zzso measurement 24 h after zzso Percentage of the injected dose per gram of tumor and zzso tissue ratios zzso were calculated for each group of mice and the difference between two groups was zzso 

The zzso zzso group allowed specific and stable zzso of the zzso with zzso The zzso reached its peak 1 h after injection, and then decreased rapidly in normal mice after intravenous administration of zzso The liver, stomach and zzso played an important role in zzso and zzso counts were low in bone, brain and zzso When zzso was injected zzso into mice grafted with zzso cell line, images showed the zzso accumulated in the zzso Immediately after zzso administration, only the tumor was zzso zzso performed at the end of 1 and 2 h showed elimination of the zzso from the tumor to the abdomen and at the end of 24 h the tumor was clearly zzso Percentage of the injected dose per gram of tumor and zzso ratios for the sense group zzso were significantly lower than those of the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso showed high specificity in zzso family zzso lymphoma, which should be further investigated for nuclear medicine imaging application and zzso zzso zzso
