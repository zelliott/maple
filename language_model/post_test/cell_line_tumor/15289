zzso has been shown to exert zzso influence on zzso factors and regulate genes expression by zzso their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a family of zzso factor and play a critical role in embryonic zzso The zzso activity of zzso is highly zzso by zzso in an zzso zzso However, the zzso that poses zzso activity towards zzso is still not zzso Here we reported that zzso was identified as the major zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso by combining both unbiased zzso screen and in zzso zzso zzso The zzso form of zzso was readily zzso in either zzso zzso cells or knockout zzso zzso markedly enhanced the zzso of zzso through directly zzso Moreover, zzso protein was accumulated in response to zzso stimuli which in turn zzso activity zzso of zzso zzso Our data clearly show that zzso plays an important role in determining the dynamics and functional outcome of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
