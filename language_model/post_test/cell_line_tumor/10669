A compound that can target cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso and produce predominantly zzso zzso in those cells has been designed and zzso This compound produces mainly the zzso zzso upon reaction with calf zzso DNA, and binds to the zzso with a relative binding affinity of 51% zzso zzso zzso The compound is toxic to zzso zzso breast cancer cells, and zzso with the zzso zzso zzso abrogates the zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso which zzso zzso zzso by the compound, resulted in a zzso decrease in the zzso These results demonstrate the feasibility of this strategy for producing zzso zzso in targeted zzso
