zzso therapy after liver transplantation for zzso zzso zzso is one of the major zzso factors for zzso recurrence and zzso zzso a potent zzso has been reported to be an effective inhibitor in a variety of zzso The present study is designed to explore whether zzso could block the growth and zzso progression of zzso 

zzso cells were used as targets to explore the effect of zzso on cell cycle zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso a highly zzso model of human zzso in nude mice, was also used as the model tumor to explore the effect of zzso on tumor growth and zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso induced cell cycle arrest at the zzso checkpoint and blocked proliferation of zzso cells but did not induce zzso In zzso zzso prevented tumor growth and zzso progression in zzso zzso zzso density and circulating levels of zzso in zzso mice were also significantly reduced in zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso the zzso expression of zzso and zzso but not of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, western zzso analysis confirmed that zzso also decreased expression of zzso at protein level, in parallel with the zzso of the levels of zzso protein zzso in a zzso manner as compared to zzso control cells following zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso prevents the growth and zzso progression of zzso and suppresses zzso synthesis and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso may be useful for clinical application in patients who received a liver transplant for zzso
