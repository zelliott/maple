zzso zzso changes to cancer cells that make them more resistant to zzso We have looked at signaling pathways that facilitate these changes by screening the human zzso for effects on hypoxic responses in zzso colon cancer zzso zzso identified in the screen were examined for effects on multiple molecular responses to zzso including the zzso zzso stress and DNA damage responses in zzso melanoma, and zzso cancer zzso To validate the hits from the small interfering zzso studies, we developed cell lines expressing stable short hairpin zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Several lines, including those expressing zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed an inability to form zzso zzso In addition, zzso targeting zzso and zzso were incapable of zzso growth under zzso In the zzso zzso line, nuclear zzso zzso was localized to the nucleus, but in the zzso zzso line, zzso levels were increased but the extent of nuclear zzso was zzso zzso negative zzso of zzso and zzso also showed strong zzso effects in zzso cells under zzso supporting a direct link between these zzso and survival of the zzso zzso line, which is typically highly resistant to hypoxic stress as a result of high and zzso levels of zzso
