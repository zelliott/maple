zzso zzso predictions of the clinical efficacy of experimental cancer drugs are highly desired but often zzso Such predictions might be improved by incorporating elements of the tumor zzso in zzso models by providing a more zzso zzso In generating improved zzso models, it is generally accepted that the use of primary tumors from patients are preferable to zzso tumor cell zzso Here we describe an interdisciplinary platform to study drug response in multiple zzso an incurable cancer of the bone zzso This platform uses zzso technology to minimize the number of cells per experiment, while incorporating three-dimensional zzso zzso and zzso cells derived from the tumor zzso We used sequential imaging and a novel digital imaging analysis zzso to zzso changes in cell zzso zzso models were used to convert experimental data into zzso zzso which offered zzso zzso Using this platform, we predicted zzso to zzso and zzso two clinical multiple myeloma treatments, in three multiple myeloma cell lines and seven zzso primary multiple myeloma cell zzso We also demonstrated how this system could be used to investigate zzso drug resistance and drug combinations that target zzso This interdisciplinary zzso zzso is capable of generating quantitative data that can be used in zzso models of clinical response, demonstrating its utility as a tool to contribute to personalized zzso
