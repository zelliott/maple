In previous study, we found that the zzso zzso 9 zzso was highly expressed on zzso T cells from patients with zzso lineage acute zzso leukemia zzso and zzso leukemia cell zzso and zzso Combined use of zzso 2 zzso and zzso promoted the zzso of zzso and therefore attenuated leukemia cell zzso and zzso In this study, we preliminarily investigated the mechanism of zzso of zzso on zzso cell model (a human leukemia zzso line, naturally expresses zzso and found that zzso zzso the cell surface expression of zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso had no significant influence on alpha zzso and beta zzso zzso of zzso Moreover, specific zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso of zzso which indicated a role of protein zzso C zzso and G zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was zzso and zzso to cell membrane in zzso and zzso treated cells which indicated that zzso could be a prerequisite for zzso zzso
