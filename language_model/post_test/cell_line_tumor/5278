To evaluate the mechanisms and consequences of zzso aberrations in zzso cancer zzso we used a combination of spectral zzso array comparative zzso zzso zzso and zzso global gene expression profiling on 31 primary zzso and 15 established cell zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso profiles of primary tumors are zzso in the cell zzso We revealed a preponderance of zzso zzso at sites of copy number zzso zzso in the zzso cell lines, a novel mechanism of DNA breakage in zzso The integration of gene expression and zzso led to the identification of 157 genes localized within high-level copy number changes whose zzso deregulation was significantly affected across all of the samples, thereby suggesting that these genes play a functional role in zzso zzso amplification at zzso was the most zzso event and led to the zzso of zzso and zzso Copy number dependent gene expression resulted in deregulation of known cancer genes such as zzso zzso and zzso The identification of only 36 genes whose zzso near a zzso could account for their observed zzso expression demonstrates that the major mechanism for zzso deregulation in zzso is zzso copy number changes resulting from zzso zzso
