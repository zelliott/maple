We have developed an online zzso method that combines zzso cell membrane zzso zzso with high performance liquid zzso and mass zzso zzso for identifying active components from zzso zzso acting on human zzso zzso zzso on zzso model were captured onto an enrichment column and the components were directly analyzed by combining a zzso column zzso with an zzso system for separation and preliminary zzso Using zzso zzso as a positive control, zzso and zzso from zzso zzso were identified as the active molecules which could act on the zzso This zzso method can be applied for screening active components acting on zzso from traditional Chinese medicines exemplified by zzso zzso and will be of great utility in drug discovery using natural medicinal herbs as a source of novel zzso
