To construct the zzso models of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso root zzso zzso of chickens and investigate the zzso effects of zzso on neural zzso 

zzso culture dish was adopted to construct zzso model of zzso cells and zzso zzso cells were seeded in the medium pore with zzso around zzso zzso of zzso processes was zzso Then zzso was cultured in the zzso medium of zzso with the groups of zzso medium of zzso and zzso the group of cell zzso zzso the groups of zzso medium and zzso medium as the zzso zzso of zzso processes was also recorded and compared with control zzso 

In the zzso model of tumor and zzso zzso zzso cells produced a suitable zzso in which zzso processes remarkably zzso zzso processes of most zzso displayed growth tendency toward zzso The group of zzso medium from zzso zzso obvious zzso effects on zzso 

zzso model of tumor and zzso tissue was successfully constructed, with which the zzso effects of tumor on outgrowth of zzso processes could be zzso So hypothesized that zzso could zzso some zzso factors to guide peripheral nerves zzso and to trigger the cascade of the neural invasion in zzso
