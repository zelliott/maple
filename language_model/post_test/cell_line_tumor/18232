zzso zzso regulates zzso dynamics and is altered during aging and the progression of numerous diseases or pathological zzso Although several zzso proteins have been identified as zzso how localized zzso activity is regulated and the mechanisms controlling zzso recognition are not zzso In this study, we report that zzso binding regulates the zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso to zzso by zzso 1 and zzso At first, zzso did not appear to be a zzso for zzso 2; however, zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso resulted in nearly complete zzso of the full-length zzso producing stable breakdown zzso zzso 1 was able to cleave zzso in the absence of zzso zzso however, zzso binding increased the rate of zzso and zzso zzso zzso binding significantly inhibited zzso zzso binding appeared to regulate zzso zzso of zzso by modulating the exposure of a highly sensitive zzso site within the zzso zzso 2 zzso In zzso zzso cells, which contain elevated levels of zzso zzso zzso with zzso within dynamic zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso producing stable breakdown products was observed in zzso cells treated with calcium zzso to activate the zzso zzso Additional evidence of zzso zzso zzso of zzso was observed in rat embryonic zzso These results suggest that zzso binding is a critical zzso for zzso zzso by zzso In conclusion, zzso binding to the zzso is a potential mechanism for regulating zzso to zzso by zzso
