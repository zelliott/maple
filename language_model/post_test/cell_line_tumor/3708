zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso family proteins are involved in sensing zzso pathogens or zzso zzso triggering host defense responses resulting in zzso processing of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso recruitment domain, zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso also known as ICE zzso factor, belongs to a branch of the zzso family that contains proteins carrying zzso recruitment zzso zzso and zzso repeats zzso By using gene transfer and zzso approaches, we demonstrate in this study that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso from human zzso after exposure to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was also found to mediate a direct zzso effect within zzso after zzso infection and to sensitize host cells to zzso cell death through a zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso contributes to several biological processes central to host defense, suggesting a prominent role for this zzso family member in innate zzso
