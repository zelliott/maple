zzso which belongs to the zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that has been shown to increase tumor invasion, zzso and zzso zzso To define the role of zzso in invasion and zzso more precisely, we zzso gene zzso to inhibit the expression of zzso in pancreatic cancer zzso We observed that zzso expression was significantly zzso at both the zzso and protein levels and resulted in a decrease of zzso and zzso zzso There was also a decrease of zzso expression in the invasion and zzso potential of pancreatic cancer cells, as well as increased zzso to zzso in zzso zzso Overall, these results suggest that zzso plays an important role in the invasion, zzso and zzso of the human pancreatic cancer cell line zzso indicating that zzso may be a promising therapeutic target for pancreatic zzso
