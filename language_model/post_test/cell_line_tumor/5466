We wanted to develop a therapeutic approach against rabies disease by targeting the zzso zzso zzso Because this complex zzso zzso template processed by the L zzso and its zzso the zzso P) is similar to that of other zzso zzso zzso we aimed to design zzso zzso drugs that could be used as a complement to zzso vaccination and zzso Recent progress in understanding the zzso of the rabies virus zzso zzso and L proteins predicts that the zzso end of P is an excellent target for zzso the replication complex because it interacts with both L (for positioning onto the zzso zzso and N (for keeping N zzso as needed for viral zzso zzso Thus, peptides mimicking various lengths of the zzso end of P have been zzso as zzso zzso for binding properties to the zzso partners by the zzso zzso zzso for their capacity to inhibit the zzso of a rabies virus zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso for their capacity to inhibit rabies virus infection of zzso cells and of two derivatives of the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso (the first 60 and first 57 zzso zzso of zzso zzso exhibited a zzso strong, and long-lasting zzso potential on zzso expression zzso from 24 h to 55 zzso zzso was less efficient in its zzso level zzso for 18 to 30 zzso and duration zzso after 48 zzso The most promising peptides were zzso in tandem with the zzso zzso allowing cell zzso Their zzso effects were observed on zzso cells infected with rabies virus and zzso bat virus but not with zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, a significant zzso of both zzso inclusions and rabies virus release was zzso
