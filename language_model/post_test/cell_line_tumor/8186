zzso zzso regulates gene expression at the zzso level by functioning as a zzso for zzso zzso alpha zzso and zzso zzso beta zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso are required for optimal zzso activity and secondary zzso responses, zzso We show that zzso zzso 21 zzso and zzso seven zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso these zzso have the potential to control zzso zzso and 757 zzso zzso at the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso alters zzso expression of zzso zzso induced the expression of eight zzso family members, zzso and zzso zzso these zzso reduced the levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso III zzso required for zzso processing, is also an zzso zzso Several zzso zzso genes are associated with zzso sites or located in the zzso region of zzso zzso We propose that the clinical course of zzso breast zzso is dependent on the balance between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, our studies reveal a zzso loop controlling zzso response through zzso as well as differences in zzso zzso and zzso
