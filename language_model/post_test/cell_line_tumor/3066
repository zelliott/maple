Previously, we showed that zzso proliferation of human colon cancer cells is zzso by zzso of zzso growth factor zzso receptors zzso In the present study, we zzso the molecular mechanism underlying this zzso zzso proliferation of zzso colon cancer cells, which express exclusively zzso zzso receptors zzso was attenuated by zzso zzso binding domain zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a diphtheria toxin analog that blocks release of an zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso media from zzso zzso cells induced proliferation of zzso colon cancer cells that express zzso but not zzso These actions were attenuated by an zzso inhibitor and by zzso and zzso zzso In zzso but not zzso colon cancer cells, zzso caused a striking zzso and zzso increase in levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Similarly, zzso induced robust zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso was attenuated by zzso zzso zzso and chemical zzso of zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not alter zzso gene zzso zzso these findings indicate that zzso release of zzso mediates zzso zzso of zzso and zzso proliferation of colon cancer zzso zzso zzso of zzso and downstream zzso signaling also regulates zzso zzso of zzso thereby identifying a novel zzso mechanism for zzso cell zzso
