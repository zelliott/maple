Fusion between zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor gene zzso is the most frequent genetic zzso that occurs in zzso of prostate zzso Not only zzso but also other zzso zzso factor genes are involved in gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso have all several fusion zzso One common feature shared by the majority of these partners is zzso zzso Despite its high frequency, the biological and molecular effects of zzso gene fusion in prostate cancer development and progression are zzso In this chapter quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso is used for detection and further studying the zzso and properties of these fusion zzso The focus is on the expression of zzso transcripts in clinical prostate zzso zzso regulation of zzso is measured in commonly used zzso prostate cancer cells grown with and without the synthetic zzso zzso Furthermore, combining zzso with zzso zzso and sequencing are described for the identification of novel zzso fusion zzso
