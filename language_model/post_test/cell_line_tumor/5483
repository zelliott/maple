The persistence of circulating tumor cells zzso in breast cancer patients might be associated with stem cell like tumor cells which have been suggested to be the active source of zzso spread in primary zzso Furthermore, these cells also may undergo zzso changes, known as zzso transition zzso which allows them to travel to the site of zzso formation without getting affected by conventional zzso Here we evaluated 226 blood samples of 39 zzso breast cancer patients during a follow-up of zzso zzso zzso - or hormonal therapy for the expression of the stem cell marker zzso and markers for zzso and correlated these findings with the presence of zzso and response to zzso 

2 zzso 5 zzso blood was analyzed for zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso for the detection of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The recovered zzso was additionally multiplex tested for three zzso markers zzso zzso zzso and separately for the tumor stem-cell markers zzso The identification of zzso markers was considered positive if at least one marker was detected in the zzso 

zzso of 30 healthy donor samples investigated were negative for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso were detected in zzso zzso cancer zzso In the zzso zzso group, zzso were positive for at least one of the zzso markers and zzso for zzso zzso In the zzso zzso group the percentages were zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso expression was found in zzso and zzso of patients, in zzso the rates were zzso and zzso zzso 

Our data indicate that a major proportion of zzso of zzso breast cancer patients shows zzso and tumor stem cell zzso Further studies are needed to prove whether these markers might serve as an indicator for therapy resistant tumor cell populations and, therefore, an inferior zzso
