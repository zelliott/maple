zzso is a small, zzso zzso membrane protein that is zzso in a percentage of zzso In the present work, we have analyzed the role of zzso expression during zzso cancer zzso We have found that zzso is expressed in zzso human zzso tumors while it is not expressed in normal or benign zzso zzso levels increased with breast tumor stage and were strongly correlated with zzso zzso zzso A significant increase in the levels of zzso oxygen species zzso was observed in zzso cells, as compared with parental zzso This increase was further paralleled by an increase in the zzso capacity of zzso cells but not in zzso zzso breast zzso cells, which provides a selective advantage once zzso has zzso zzso of specific zzso zzso in zzso tumor cells reduced their zzso capabilities, which suggests that this effect is dependent upon zzso protein zzso Our data show that zzso functions as a second zzso that enhances zzso properties, which are inhibited in zzso zzso We have found that zzso zzso mediates this zzso zzso triggers a zzso zzso response that is abolished in the absence of zzso zzso Furthermore, in human breast tumors, zzso zzso is correlated with a lack of zzso of zzso zzso zzso is zzso in late-stage breast tumors, in which zzso activity relies on zzso zzso to induce zzso zzso
