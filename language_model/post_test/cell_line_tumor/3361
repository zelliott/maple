zzso of the zzso gene family is a negative feedback mechanism known to occur at high levels of zzso zzso Loss of this mechanism and associated zzso zzso has been observed in human tumors, thereby contributing to zzso The childhood tumor zzso is characterized by zzso amplification in aggressive and highly zzso tumors that occur in a subset of zzso The precise molecular mechanism of zzso is unknown, and previous observations indicated that zzso zzso was intact only in zzso zzso cell zzso 

zzso reporter zzso and zzso A zzso experiments were performed to evaluate several candidate zzso including zzso zzso promoter binding protein 1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso for their involvement in zzso zzso zzso and zzso were examined further for their expression levels and effects on zzso zzso zzso Finally, their zzso to the zzso promoter were investigated by zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso circuit was zzso even in amplified cell zzso zzso consistently showed a modest effect in zzso zzso in transient reporter zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso genes resulted in a zzso to fourfold decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso in an zzso cell line and in zzso cell zzso In addition, zzso of the zzso promoter was relieved in the presence of zzso Increased association of zzso with the zzso region within the zzso promoter by zzso was observed upon zzso of zzso zzso 

The zzso circuit was intact in both amplified and zzso zzso cell zzso Furthermore, zzso gene zzso occurred through zzso zzso
