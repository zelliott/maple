High grade zzso are one of the most difficult zzso to treat and despite surgery, zzso and zzso chemotherapy, the prognosis of zzso patients is zzso Resistance to zzso is the major barrier to effective zzso Alternative therapeutic approaches have been shown to be ineffective for the treatment of genetically zzso zzso zzso Thus, novel therapies are zzso zzso chemotherapy is an emerging tool to combat cancer, and inner zzso zzso transition zzso represents a target for the development of zzso zzso A number of agents are able to induce zzso and some of them target zzso zzso components that are selectively zzso in cancer, making these agents putative cancer zzso zzso 

The aim of this paper is to report a comprehensive analysis of the effects produced by selected zzso drugs zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso 

zzso expression has been zzso by zzso zzso amplification and zzso deletion have been zzso by zzso Drugs effect on cell viability has been tested by crystal violet zzso zzso has been tested by zzso zzso Drug zzso effect has been tested by zzso index zzso Drug zzso effect has been tested by zzso AM zzso zzso has been zzso by zzso incorporation and zzso V binding zzso zzso has been tested by zzso orange zzso 

We performed a molecular and genetic characterization of zzso cells and demonstrated that this line does not express the zzso and does not show zzso zzso zzso cells do not show zzso zzso but differential zzso data indicate a zzso deletion of zzso zzso We analyzed the response of zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso agents produce zzso zzso and zzso effects in parallel with zzso induction triggered through zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid trigger zzso as principal death zzso 

The obtained data suggest that these pharmacological agents could be selected as zzso drugs for the treatment of high grade zzso that resist conventional therapies or that do not show any peculiar genetic zzso that can be targeted by specific zzso
