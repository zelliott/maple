zzso I zzso are effective zzso therapies and have shown activity in zzso zzso Here we show for the first time that zzso the potent active zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in multiple myeloma zzso zzso zzso degradation of nuclear zzso I has been proposed as a resistance mechanism in solid zzso zzso zzso degradation of zzso I was observed during zzso zzso against zzso myeloma cell line but occurred after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and failed to protect cells from zzso zzso toxicity was observed against zzso cells versus bone zzso zzso cells, and zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso cell proliferation when zzso cells adhere to bone zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso directly inhibited zzso and zzso zzso 6 and vascular zzso growth factor zzso by bone zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed when zzso was used in combination with zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso These findings have clinical significance, because identification of downstream zzso signaling after zzso I zzso will both zzso mechanisms of resistance and zzso future combination chemotherapy against zzso
