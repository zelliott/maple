zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso resulting in extremely poor survival of zzso therefore, novel molecular targets, even in small zzso of genetically characterized zzso are urgently zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are already in clinical zzso The aims of this study were to examine the gene copy number and expression of zzso growth factor zzso 1 zzso in 155 patients with zzso and investigate the effects of the zzso inhibitor zzso on zzso pancreatic zzso cells in zzso 

Fluorescence zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis of 155 zzso were performed using tissue zzso zzso of zzso was found in zzso zzso of zzso Four per cent of zzso zzso were shown to express zzso by zzso zzso analysis demonstrated an zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) in all zzso zzso The zzso pancreatic zzso cell line zzso showed high levels of zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso of this cell line can be inhibited using the zzso inhibitor zzso 

zzso represents a potential new therapeutic target in a subset of patients zzso zzso zzso Identification of pancreatic zzso zzso zzso amplification may be important in zzso patients and/or interpreting clinical studies using zzso
