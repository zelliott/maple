zzso zzso has been clinically detected in zzso and promoter zzso has been implicated as the mechanism of zzso in some of those zzso Our previous researches indicated that zzso is a target gene of zzso the interaction of zzso and zzso is involved in zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso is a target gene of the other zzso zzso We found that the high expression of zzso and zzso in zzso are involved in pathological zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso inhibited the proliferation in zzso and growth of zzso cell with in zzso magnetic resonance imaging by zzso transplanted tumor model in zzso We also demonstrated that zzso a zzso zzso for zzso is highly expressed and zzso correlated with zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso and zzso affected zzso regulation of the zzso zzso This finding was verified by zzso zzso of zzso or restoration of zzso zzso expression by treatment with the DNA zzso agent zzso Taken together, zzso and zzso may be a useful therapeutic target for treatment of zzso
