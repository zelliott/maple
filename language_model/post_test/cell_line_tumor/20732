An zzso zzso zzso analogue 1, which zzso human zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso has been reported to suppress the proliferation of an zzso zzso zzso zzso leukemia cell line zzso when zzso is depleted in the zzso We now report the synthesis and biological activity of two new zzso zzso of 1 that have been studied as part of systematic efforts to identify compounds with improved cell zzso and/or zzso zzso One of these new zzso an zzso zzso 5 having no net charge at cellular zzso is a better zzso inhibitor zzso zzso than 1 and suppresses proliferation of zzso cells at zzso lower concentration zzso More importantly, and in contrast to the lead compound 1, the presence of zzso 5 at zzso above zzso zzso causes the death of zzso cells even when zzso is absent in the culture zzso The zzso zzso 5 exhibits different zzso behavior when incubated with an zzso zzso cell line zzso supporting the hypothesis that zzso 5 exerts its effect by zzso zzso in the zzso Our work provides further evidence for the idea that zzso represents a zzso target for the treatment of zzso and perhaps other zzso including those of the zzso
