zzso regulation of progression from zzso to S phase of the cell cycle by altered activity of zzso zzso zzso is a hallmark of zzso However, zzso of zzso particularly zzso has not shown selective activity against most cancer cells because the zzso seems to be redundant in control of cell cycle zzso Here, we show a novel role in the DNA damage response and application of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso and small interfering zzso or zzso zzso zzso in zzso or zzso cells lead to delayed damage signaling through zzso zzso and zzso This coincided with reduced DNA repair using the zzso comet zzso and defects observed in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, tumor cells lacking cancer predisposition genes zzso or zzso are zzso to zzso more sensitive to zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso of zzso can be applied to selectively enhance responses of cancer cells to zzso agents, such as zzso chemotherapy and zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso may be useful zzso in zzso with defects in DNA repair, such as zzso in the familial breast cancer gene zzso
