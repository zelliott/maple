The zzso zzso with zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso targeting breast cancer cells was zzso zzso complexes were formed via charge interactions among zzso zzso zzso 1800, and DNA, and we investigated their cellular zzso nuclear zzso as well as zzso zzso All the experiments were assessed by employing zzso cells that express zzso zzso and zzso cells that lack the expression of the zzso In zzso cells, cell zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso was markedly increased compared to that in zzso In addition, compared to that of the zzso complex, zzso complexes exhibited much enhanced zzso reporter gene expression by up to zzso By contrast, in zzso cells, the evident improvements of cellular zzso nuclear zzso and zzso efficiency by zzso were not zzso This study demonstrates an alternative method to construct a zzso delivery system for targeted gene transfer into breast cancer zzso
