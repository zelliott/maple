zzso and progression of cervical cancer closely relate with human zzso virus zzso E6 and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso had been used to inhibit the expression of zzso E6 or zzso zzso to treat cervical cancer, but problems, including low efficiency, zzso zzso hard work, and high costs, still zzso This study was to evaluate the specific zzso effect and zzso of zzso interference zzso on zzso E6 gene in cervical cancer cell line zzso 

The specific small interfering zzso zzso of zzso E6 modified by zzso was zzso and zzso into zzso zzso The zzso efficiency of zzso was evaluated by calculating the ratio of fluorescent cells to total zzso Cell zzso was evaluated by flow zzso zzso The zzso level of zzso E6 before and after zzso zzso was measured by zzso and protein level of zzso E6 was measured by Western zzso and zzso 

The zzso efficiency of zzso was zzso zzso rates of zzso cells at 1, 2, 5, and 9 d after zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso level of zzso E6 at 1, 2, 5, and 9 d after zzso reduced by zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, but the zzso level of zzso as internal control, had no zzso The zzso rates of zzso E6 protein at 1, 2, 5, and 9 d after zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, but the protein level of zzso zzso as internal control, had no change at each time zzso 

zzso exists in zzso cells, and has specific high efficiency on zzso E6 zzso
