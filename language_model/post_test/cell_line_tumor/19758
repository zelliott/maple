zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in tumor growth by increasing resistance to zzso and the production of zzso factors, such as vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso is an attractive target for development of novel cancer zzso We have generated Chinese zzso zzso cells, which zzso express zzso reporter construct under the control of a zzso response element to screen 15,000 zzso We identified 40 compounds that inhibited hypoxic zzso of zzso and the top 30 compounds were further screened in a secondary zzso using zzso breast cancer cell zzso Eight compounds were shown to inhibit zzso expression in hypoxic cells at zzso zzso Three top putative zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were chosen for further zzso zzso zzso of cells with zzso zzso reporter plasmids further validated that these compounds inhibit zzso zzso zzso All three compounds failed to inhibit zzso protein levels but they did inhibit induction of downstream targets of zzso under zzso Two of the three compounds were cell type specific, whereas compound zzso inhibited zzso at zzso levels in breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso melanoma cell line zzso and zzso zzso zzso cancer cell lines zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of downstream targets of zzso and significantly inhibited zzso zzso activity by blocking zzso zzso response zzso zzso Our zzso approach and zzso of the zzso effect of zzso has identified a novel compound that targets the zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso
