Novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso were developed from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a lead compound by zzso with zzso This study evaluated the binding affinity and specificity of the zzso for the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso specificity in the brain were investigated in zzso zzso affinity and specificity were determined by zzso zzso binding zzso Three zzso were used for competitive binding zzso In addition, zzso of the complexes into zzso nerve cells was zzso 

The zzso purity of zzso zzso was more than zzso Analysis of brain regional zzso showed higher concentration in the frontal lobe and specific zzso in the zzso zzso reached a higher target to zzso ratio than zzso The results indicated that zzso bound to a single site on the zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not the zzso zzso and zzso zzso partial zzso zzso inhibited specific binding of zzso to the zzso zzso Cell physiology experiments showed that zzso can increase the viability of zzso cells after zzso zzso 

The new zzso zzso has good affinity for and specific binding to the zzso zzso and easily crosses the zzso zzso suggesting that it might be a potentially useful zzso for zzso zzso zzso
