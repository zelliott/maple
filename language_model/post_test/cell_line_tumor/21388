The zzso zzso zzso element zzso factor complex zzso in the regulation of viral gene expression and zzso processes caused by various zzso The zzso B virus zzso zzso I directs zzso zzso of viral genes and contains a zzso sequence zzso however, whether the zzso and zzso protein zzso are required for the zzso life cycle remains to be zzso This study was designed to investigate the role of zzso in zzso replication and gene zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso reported worldwide showed that the zzso sequence is highly zzso indicating the possibility that it plays an important role in the zzso life zzso The binding of zzso to the zzso site was markedly inhibited by zzso containing zzso and consensus zzso sequences in zzso and in zzso The zzso promoter activity was demonstrated to be dependent upon the zzso activity of zzso Treatment with zzso decoy zzso reduced zzso promoter activity, and this was reversed by zzso zzso The levels of viral zzso DNA, and zzso were remarkably decreased in response to the zzso of zzso zzso or treatment with the zzso decoy zzso whereas enhancing zzso activity increased the levels of viral zzso In addition, introduction of a zzso zzso into the zzso led to a marked reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Taken together, our results demonstrate that both replication and gene expression of zzso require a functional zzso and zzso We have also demonstrated that zzso decoy zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso can effectively block the zzso life cycle, suggesting that interventions against zzso activity could provide a new avenue to treat zzso zzso
