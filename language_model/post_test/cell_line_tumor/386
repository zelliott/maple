We have developed and tested a robust delivery method for the transport of proteins to the zzso of zzso cells without compromising the integrity of the cell zzso This zzso delivery zzso technology zzso a zzso of substance P zzso a zzso that is rapidly zzso upon interaction with the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the form of synthetic zzso fragments zzso were zzso to the engineered SP zzso zzso and efficiently zzso by zzso zzso The zzso used here were generated to bind specific zzso forms of zzso The zzso proteins appear to escape the zzso and retain their binding activity within the cells as demonstrated by zzso with the zzso zzso Further, since the zzso is zzso in many zzso zzso delivery provides a highly specific method for therapeutic zzso of affinity zzso targeting zzso processes in diseased zzso
