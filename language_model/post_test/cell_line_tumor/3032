zzso zzso zzso has been reported to possess zzso activity against zzso The present study was designed to investigate whether hot water extracts obtained from green tea leaves might inhibit pathogen zzso to human or mouse cell zzso Green tea zzso zzso with the maximum yield of zzso zzso is composed of a major proportion of carbohydrates containing zzso zzso zzso but lack of zzso It showed strong zzso activities against zzso zzso by pathogens zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the minimum zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso further demonstrated an zzso effect on the zzso of these pathogens to host cell lines with the zzso values zzso zzso of zzso of zzso zzso It exhibited the highest activity against zzso zzso but no zzso effects were observed against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coli, or zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso may exert a selective zzso effect against certain zzso bacteria with no adverse effects against beneficial or zzso zzso
