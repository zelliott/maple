The zzso zzso zzso has emerged as an important zzso in multiple tumor types and is thought to be dependent on a zzso signaling zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the role of pancreatic zzso zzso zzso pancreatic zzso cells, zzso in zzso zzso In addition, we evaluated the efficacy of a novel zzso zzso zzso on tumor progression with an emphasis on the role of the zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso members and zzso of the zzso zzso were analyzed in both zzso and pancreatic cancer zzso We tested the effects of zzso zzso zzso with zzso on tumor growth in zzso using an zzso model of pancreatic cancer containing varying amounts of zzso 

zzso expressed high levels of zzso zzso and low levels of zzso zzso whereas cancer cells showed the converse expression zzso zzso proliferation was zzso by Sonic zzso with zzso of downstream zzso zzso These effects were zzso by zzso zzso In an zzso model of pancreatic cancer, zzso inhibited tumor growth only when zzso were present, implicating a zzso signaling mechanism dependent on zzso Further evidence of zzso signaling of the zzso zzso in prostate and colon cancer models is zzso demonstrating the broader zzso of our zzso 

Based on the use of our novel zzso pancreatic cancer zzso cells, our results suggest that zzso therapies primarily affect the zzso zzso rather than the zzso zzso
