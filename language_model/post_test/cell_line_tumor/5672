Within the human zzso the zzso consists of a zzso pool of zzso cells which differentiate to replenish the zzso zzso zzso zzso which forms the barrier between the maternal and fetal zzso zzso to zzso differentiation and function may result in impaired fetal development and zzso zzso expression is limited to barrier forming zzso It promotes zzso differentiation by zzso zzso to zzso zzso intermediate zzso and indirectly providing zzso and zzso zzso However its role in the zzso remains zzso 

Using zzso zzso the reaction of control and zzso zzso zzso cells to suppressed zzso was examined for genes pertaining to zzso cell cycle and zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were increased following zzso suppression suggesting a role for zzso in zzso their zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and zzso protein levels were zzso 

Since expression of these molecules is normally increased with zzso zzso our results imply that zzso zzso zzso zzso This is the first functional study of this unusual member of the zzso family in the zzso where it has a different function than in the zzso This knowledge of the molecular zzso of zzso differentiation may instruct future therapies of zzso zzso
