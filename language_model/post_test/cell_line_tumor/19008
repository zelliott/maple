To investigate the relationship between heat shock protein 27 zzso expression and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was used to detect zzso expression in 68 specimens of human zzso The expression of zzso zzso and protein was also detected in two zzso zzso cell lines with different zzso zzso zzso by zzso Western zzso and zzso 

zzso expression was not related to such zzso factors as the patient's age, zzso zzso grade, zzso zzso or clinical stages zzso but zzso of zzso showed significant inverse correlation to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein were expressed at low levels in zzso cells with high zzso for zzso zzso and at high levels in zzso cells that had low zzso zzso zzso 

zzso expression can be zzso correlated to zzso behavior of zzso cells, and may play a role in suppressing the zzso of zzso
