RON is a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Like zzso RON is expressed by a variety of zzso tumors and cancer cell lines and it is thought to play a functional role in zzso To date, zzso of RON activity have not been tested in zzso to validate RON as a potential cancer zzso In this report, we used an zzso zzso display library to generate zzso a human zzso zzso zzso zzso that binds with high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso to RON and effectively blocks interaction with its zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso We found zzso to be a potent inhibitor of zzso and downstream zzso cell migration, and zzso It antagonized zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso in several cancer cell zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso pancreatic cancer zzso tumor models, zzso inhibited tumor growth by 50% to zzso as a single agent, and in zzso zzso it led to tumor zzso when combined with zzso Western zzso analyses of zzso and zzso zzso tumors treated with zzso revealed a decrease in zzso zzso compared with control zzso tumors, suggesting that zzso of zzso activity may be required for the zzso activity of zzso To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that a RON zzso and specifically an zzso zzso of RON zzso affects zzso Another major contribution of this report is an extensive analysis of RON expression in approximately 100 cancer cell lines and approximately 300 patient tumor samples representing 10 major cancer zzso Taken together, our results highlight the potential therapeutic usefulness of RON activity zzso in human zzso
