The zzso binding specificity of influenza A virus is one of the major zzso of viral zzso and host zzso In general, avian viral zzso prefers to bind to zzso zzso acid, whereas the human viral zzso prefers to bind to zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that host zzso protein plays an important role in the life cycle of some influenza A zzso Treating cells with zzso zzso or zzso small interfering zzso can inhibit the virus replication of human zzso influenza A zzso zzso these zzso effects cannot be observed in cells infected with H5N1 zzso By using reverse zzso techniques, we observed that the zzso binding zzso but not the origin of the zzso zzso is responsible for this differential zzso zzso zzso the binding preference of zzso from zzso zzso acid to zzso zzso acid can make the virus resistant to the zzso zzso treatment and vice zzso Our further zzso indicate that zzso zzso acts on the early phase of viral replication cycle, but it has no effect on the initial binding of influenza A virus to cell zzso Our subsequent investigations further show that zzso zzso can block the zzso entry of influenza zzso Overall, these results indicate that the zzso acid binding preference of influenza viral zzso can zzso the preferences of viral entry zzso suggesting that there are subtle differences between the virus entries of human and avian influenza zzso
