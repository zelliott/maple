zzso zzso zzso zzso a newly identified zzso zzso has been found to participate in the process of proliferation and zzso for several zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso value of zzso in pancreatic cancer and to probe its function in pancreatic zzso We found that zzso protein was absent or reduced in pancreatic cancer cell zzso There was also a loss or decrease in zzso expression in 118 cases of pancreatic cancer zzso as compared with that in 82 cases of normal pancreatic zzso In a Cox zzso hazards model, zzso expression independently predicted better survival ( zzso zzso restoration of zzso expression greatly zzso the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cell in zzso and suppressed the zzso of pancreatic cancer cell in zzso nude zzso Our data also revealed that zzso of pancreatic cancer cells proliferation by enforcing zzso expression at least partly through delaying cell cycle progression and inducing cell zzso In zzso our work revealed a novel function of zzso which might possibly be used as an independent zzso factor and a potential therapeutic target for pancreatic zzso
