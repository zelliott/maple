The presence of zzso zzso in the cancer zzso represents a potential opportunity for zzso intervention to therapeutic zzso Unfortunately, many classes of zzso zzso zzso zzso are not amenable to conventional zzso zzso Despite the identification of zzso zzso zzso most cancer therapy still zzso zzso zzso zzso One illustrative example is the treatment of Ewing zzso Although the zzso zzso present in the vast majority of Ewing tumors, was characterized over ten years ago, it has never been exploited as a target of zzso Previously, this target has been intractable to zzso with traditional zzso library screening zzso Here we describe a gene zzso approach to identify compounds that induce a signature of zzso zzso We zzso that screening zzso libraries highly enriched for zzso drugs will provide a more rapid path to clinical zzso 

A gene expression signature for the zzso off state was determined with zzso expression profiling of Ewing zzso cell lines with zzso zzso zzso A zzso library enriched for zzso drugs was screened with a zzso zzso amplification zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso identified zzso zzso zzso as a zzso of zzso zzso reduced zzso protein abundance and accordingly diminished cell viability and transformation and zzso tumor growth in a zzso zzso Given the poor outcomes of many patients with Ewing zzso and the well-established zzso safety profile, clinical trials testing zzso are zzso 

We demonstrate that a gene zzso approach to zzso library screening can zzso for rapid clinical testing, candidate drugs that zzso previously intractable zzso Furthermore, this is a generic approach that can, in principle, be applied to the identification of zzso of any zzso zzso in the rare pediatric zzso but also in the more common adult zzso
