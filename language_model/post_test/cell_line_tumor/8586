zzso zzso zzso is the worst and most common brain zzso characterized by high proliferation and invasion zzso zzso of zzso zzso for zzso drug delivery have attracted interest in recent years since they provide targeted delivery and may overcame the obstacle imposed by zzso zzso Here we investigated the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso treatment on in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso We observed that zzso treatment decreased selectively the cell viability of a panel of zzso cell lines, while did not exhibited toxicity to zzso We further demonstrate that the treatment with zzso dose of zzso reduced the in zzso zzso growth as well as reduced the zzso characteristics of implanted zzso zzso treatment improved the weight, the zzso behavior of zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment neither induced mortality or peripheral zzso Finally, zzso also altered the zzso zzso metabolism of peripheral zzso suggesting that zzso effects of zzso could also be associated with the zzso of the zzso zzso metabolism in zzso Data indicate at first time the potential of zzso as a promising therapeutic zzso to zzso zzso
