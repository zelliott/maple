zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso family member, is zzso in human zzso zzso and associated with high-grade tumors and poor zzso However, the precise role of zzso in tumor progression is zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso promotes tumor zzso and growth in breast zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso and zzso human breast cancer cells significantly increased zzso expression and production of vascular zzso growth factor zzso and decreased zzso levels and zzso of tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso without affecting cell proliferation and zzso cell growth in zzso zzso the zzso medium from zzso cells enhanced zzso migration and tube formation of human zzso vein zzso cells, and promoted zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso membrane of the chick zzso In addition, there were lower levels of zzso acid and zzso acid, and higher contents of zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso cells compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly increased tumor weight and zzso density by zzso and zzso in human tumor zzso models, zzso Moreover, zzso zzso increased the zzso of zzso and zzso while zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso reversed zzso changes in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of the zzso family, zzso inhibited the zzso zzso with associated changes in the zzso levels of zzso acid, zzso acid and zzso zzso these data suggest that increased zzso expression promotes tumor zzso and growth in breast cancer partly via zzso and zzso zzso
