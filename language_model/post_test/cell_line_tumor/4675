Several viruses have been demonstrated to be the zzso agent in chronic progressive diseases, associated with zzso however, major questions concerning the zzso mechanisms of viral persistence are still zzso With the aim of identifying host cellular proteins that may play a role in viral zzso we established long-term persistently infected human zzso cell lines with zzso zzso virus zzso and analyzed the host proteins by two-dimensional gel zzso zzso with mass zzso We observed significant zzso in the expression of zzso short chain zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso zzso of fatty zzso zzso of this gene by a short interference zzso zzso apparently impaired zzso zzso replication and the zzso effects zzso of zzso were significantly reduced in zzso zzso These findings will shed light upon a new important notion for the interaction between virus replication and zzso metabolism in host cells and might provide a new strategy for virus zzso
