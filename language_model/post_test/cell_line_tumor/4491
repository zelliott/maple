The present studies determined whether clinically relevant zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso with clinically relevant zzso to kill zzso cancer zzso In zzso cancer cells, regardless of zzso zzso status, at clinically achievable doses, zzso zzso zzso in a greater than additive fashion with zzso zzso to cause cell zzso In pancreatic tumor cells expressing zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso in a greater than additive fashion with zzso to cause cell zzso The most potent zzso inhibitor was zzso zzso down of zzso expression zzso the combination effects of zzso inhibitor drugs with chemotherapy zzso zzso of cellular zzso zzso zzso did not significantly inhibit chemotherapy zzso but did significantly reduce enhanced killing in combination with zzso zzso of zzso zzso large suppressed individual and combination drug zzso zzso down of zzso or zzso death domain protein suppressed drug combination zzso Combination toxicity was also abolished by zzso or zzso interacting protein 1 knock zzso Treatment with zzso zzso and chemotherapy drugs promoted zzso which was zzso at zzso hour zzso and zzso zzso or knock down of zzso suppressed drug combination zzso by zzso zzso zzso enhanced and prolonged the induction of DNA damage as judged by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and checkpoint zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso down of zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso and zzso zzso and enhanced drug combination zzso zzso our data demonstrate that the combination of zzso zzso with standard of care chemotherapy agents for zzso zzso represents a novel zzso
