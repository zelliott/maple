The ability to induce cell cycle progression while evading cell death is a defining characteristic of zzso zzso of zzso is a common event in most human zzso Paradoxically, this can lead to both cell cycle progression and zzso Although the way in which zzso causes cell cycle progression is well zzso the pathways by which zzso zzso cell death are less well zzso Many of the known mechanisms through which zzso zzso zzso occur through regulation of zzso target zzso However, zzso of zzso that lack the zzso domain are still able to induce cell zzso To further investigate this activity, we refined a zzso independent zzso to identify a minimal zzso zzso This revealed that only 75 zzso acids from within the zzso domain of zzso is sufficient for cell death and that this activity is also present in the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso However, analysis of this domain from zzso revealed it does not bind DNA and is consequently unable to zzso repress or zzso zzso target zzso This provocative observation therefore defines a potential new mechanism of death from zzso and opens up new opportunities for inducing cell death in zzso for therapeutic zzso
