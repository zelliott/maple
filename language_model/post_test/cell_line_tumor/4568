The objective of this paper is to study the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso cells of zzso zzso zzso zzso have been successfully prepared and zzso zzso suggested that the zzso with zzso cell zzso model did not cause significant changes in membrane integrity in controlled concentration range zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that large dose of zzso zzso injection zzso zzso zzso did not induce zzso cell zzso From zzso zzso experiments, although the levels of zzso decreased and those of zzso zzso increased after treatment with large dose of zzso zzso injection zzso zzso zzso they were all not significant zzso Then zzso mice were treated with large dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and after 4 days total zzso was isolated to zzso patterns of gene expression using a mouse zzso zzso Treatment with zzso resulted in zzso of a lot of zzso cassette (ABC) zzso especially two ABC zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso in comparison with the zzso zzso could zzso low molecular weight zzso after zzso zzso zzso outside the zzso We also discovered that zzso expressed zzso resistance protein 5 zzso to pump out zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso The results were confirmed by zzso zzso of in zzso zzso and zzso experiments indicated that about zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso after mouse primary zzso reached a zzso zzso of zzso during the concentration range of zzso zzso The results suggested that ABC zzso (especially zzso pump out the zzso after zzso from mouse zzso cells and large dose of zzso zzso make mouse zzso cells gain drug resistance to zzso zzso
