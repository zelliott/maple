In previous studies, we found that zzso zzso coli zzso blocks the base zzso repair zzso zzso by interacting with zzso zzso 1 zzso In this study, we identify the molecular features that contribute to the formation and/or stabilization of the zzso complex that determines the extent of zzso zzso and the subsequent zzso of DNA damage creates zzso zzso leading to transformation zzso We show here that zzso binds to the nuclear zzso sequence of zzso zzso which prevents entry of zzso into the nucleus and participation in zzso zzso zzso We also show that levels of the zzso complex are higher in breast tumors than in the surrounding normal zzso These studies demonstrate a novel role for zzso in the suppression of zzso activity in the zzso zzso and a new zzso profile to be explored to identify individuals who may be susceptible to the development of zzso and other zzso
