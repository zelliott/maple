To investigate the zzso interactions between infectious zzso disease virus zzso and target zzso cells, a zzso zzso zzso display library from the chicken zzso of zzso was constructed and screened for virus zzso Surface zzso M zzso was isolated as a putative candidate binding site and its interactions with zzso were further investigated using a chicken zzso zzso cell line zzso The results showed that the zzso light chain of zzso specifically zzso with zzso in a zzso manner in zzso and most of the binding of zzso to zzso cells was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso Further, the zzso of zzso in zzso was reduced by zzso zzso zzso Our data provided evidence that zzso may participate as one of the putative membrane binding sites responsible for zzso zzso
