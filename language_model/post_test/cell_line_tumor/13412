zzso zzso occur frequently in zzso cell lung cancer, leading to zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso that contributes to the zzso zzso However, the development of zzso zzso remains zzso Here, we show that zzso a component of the zzso zzso complex that is known to integrate signaling and gene activities, is selectively important for zzso lung zzso By screening a large panel of human lung cancer cell lines with or without a Ras zzso we found that zzso zzso specifically zzso the proliferation and zzso of lung cancer cells with zzso Ras zzso zzso zzso in zzso selectively inhibited the zzso transformation induced by Ras but not by zzso The zzso factor zzso which is zzso by zzso for relaying Ras signaling to zzso also was required for the zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso and zzso zzso a common set of target genes enriched in regulating zzso and zzso functions to support the Ras zzso Furthermore, zzso was zzso by Ras transformation in correlation with the strength of Ras signaling as indicated by the zzso zzso level and was found to be zzso in both zzso lung cancer cell lines and primary tumor zzso zzso lower zzso expression predicted better survival in zzso lung cancer patients and zzso zzso zzso our findings demonstrate a critical role for zzso in enabling the zzso of lung zzso thus providing a vulnerable target for the treatment of zzso lung zzso
