The zzso binding protein zzso and its zzso zzso are associated with advanced human zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso a tumor zzso by zzso has been thought to zzso their roles in zzso Here we report that the zzso for the human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso known to play a critical role in cell proliferation and survival and also a major therapeutic target in breast cancer, is among several targets of zzso zzso We show that zzso stimulates zzso expression at the zzso level, and that enforced zzso expression promotes cancer cell growth via multiple zzso zzso with its zzso role in regulating gene zzso zzso zzso in primary breast tumors is a powerful predictor of poor zzso representing the first report on the impact of zzso expression on clinical outcome in human zzso While revealing another layer of regulation of zzso expression in addition to gene amplification, our studies also suggest novel zzso insights linking zzso expression to disease outcome and imply that targeting multiple pathways is a common zzso theme of zzso regulation in zzso
