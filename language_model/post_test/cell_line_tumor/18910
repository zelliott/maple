zzso gene fusion leading to the zzso induction of the zzso zzso expression is a highly prevalent zzso zzso in prostate tumor zzso zzso cancer is a zzso disease, and the origins as well as biological contribution of multiple cancer zzso remain unclear with respect to prostate cancer onset or zzso To assess the role of zzso zzso in prostate cancer onset and/or zzso we have evaluated the status of fusion transcripts in benign zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and multiple cancer zzso of each zzso zzso expression of zzso fusion type A and C transcripts was analyzed in benign, tumor and zzso areas, selected from zzso radical zzso zzso zzso expression was correlated with zzso zzso Overall, 30 of 45 zzso patients exhibited zzso fusion transcripts in at least one tumor zzso Of 80 tumor zzso zzso 39 had zzso fusion zzso A zzso 30, type C zzso 2, both types A and zzso zzso with zzso detection of the zzso fusion type A zzso zzso in the index zzso Of 14 zzso zzso 2 were positive for type A zzso zzso presence of the zzso in index tumors suggests critical roles of zzso zzso in the onset and progression of a large subset of prostate zzso However, zzso of the zzso detection in the context of multiple cancer zzso and its frequency in zzso also support the role of other zzso zzso in the origins of prostate zzso
