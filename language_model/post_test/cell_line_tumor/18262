zzso of pancreatic zzso with zzso compounds constitutes an attractive alternative therapy for type 1 diabetes zzso The major limiting factor is the availability of a zzso and mechanically stable zzso We investigated the potential of zzso a novel zzso constituted of zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were obtained using an air jet zzso generator and zzso with zzso or calcium zzso zzso rat zzso zzso cells were tested for viability using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rat pancreatic zzso were zzso with zzso derived from mouse zzso liquid to assess the zzso potential of the zzso using quantitative real zzso zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated by subcutaneous injection of empty zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso human pancreatic zzso was evaluated using an zzso zzso zzso human zzso transplanted into chemically induced diabetic mice were monitored for reversal of zzso 

The zzso activity of zzso zzso cells persisted for at least 15 zzso zzso expression by zzso was observed during zzso with zzso zzso with zzso but not with zzso No statistical difference in zzso insulin zzso was observed between zzso and zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso zzso the blood zzso level of diabetic mice zzso they remained zzso for at least 60 days, displaying normal oral zzso tolerance zzso 

This study demonstrated that zzso can be used for zzso zzso and reversal of zzso however, further investigations are required to assess its potential for long-term zzso
