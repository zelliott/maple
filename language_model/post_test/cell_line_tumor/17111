B cell zzso are a diverse group of zzso diseases with an increasing zzso As with other zzso the zzso of genetic abnormalities are required for zzso transformation of human zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso zzso in zzso synthesis and has been implicated in the zzso of numerous zzso including zzso breast, and lung zzso There is little data on the potential role of zzso in zzso zzso In this study, several B zzso cell lines and primary B cells obtained from normal volunteer controls were examined for zzso protein zzso zzso analysis demonstrated between an approximately zzso increase in zzso protein expression relative to primary B cells in all zzso cell lines zzso Increased zzso zzso was found in the zzso zzso and zzso cells whereas the levels in zzso zzso and Ramos did not differ from that of primary B zzso Treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in decreased proliferation as measured by zzso in all cell lines zzso and the effect was zzso and not significantly enhanced by zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso on zzso in zzso cells was examined and revealed zzso induction of greater than zzso in all cell lines examined at 50 zzso zzso The zzso effect was zzso and was not significantly enhanced by zzso zzso of zzso proteins by zzso analysis revealed levels of zzso zzso and zzso to be unaffected by zzso In contrast, levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were all decreased after incubation with 50 zzso zzso These findings suggest that increased zzso expression and activity, contributes to the zzso of B cell zzso and point to a possible role for zzso zzso in their zzso
