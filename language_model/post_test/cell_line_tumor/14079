zzso zzso zzso are a worldwide problem, causing serious water pollution and public health hazard to humans and zzso The intact cells as well as the toxins released after cellular zzso can be responsible for toxic effects in both animals and humans and are actually associated with fish zzso Two fish cell zzso derived from a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells derived from the zzso of rainbow trout zzso zzso were exposed to several zzso of extracts from a natural zzso bloom and a zzso zzso zzso After 24 hours, zzso and zzso changes zzso protein content, zzso zzso zzso neutral red zzso zzso zzso salt zzso zzso function, and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The most sensitive end point for both zzso extracts in zzso cells was zzso activity, with similar zzso values (6 zzso for the zzso bloom and 7 zzso for the isolated zzso zzso cells were less susceptible according to zzso activity, with their most sensitive end point zzso function with an zzso of 4 zzso for the zzso zzso strain and 72 zzso for the zzso zzso The zzso function was zzso at low zzso although zzso activity increased at high doses, indicating zzso and energetic zzso Increased zzso zzso zzso effects, decreased cell numbers and size, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were observed in the zzso zzso Similar sensitivity to the zzso zzso strain was observed in both cell lines, whereas the zzso bloom was more toxic to the zzso cell zzso
