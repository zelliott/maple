Alternative zzso in the zzso D1 gene produces zzso zzso zzso which lacks a zzso region containing the zzso zzso zzso site required for nuclear zzso We have shown that the expression of the zzso zzso zzso is detected in about zzso of human zzso cancer zzso zzso and cell lines zzso To examine the role of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso we introduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso into a human zzso cancer cell line, zzso in which zzso zzso transcript was not zzso and compared their zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso promoted cell zzso and zzso growth of the cancer zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso enhanced zzso growth, but did not promote cell zzso The amount of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was higher than that of zzso zzso zzso In addition, introduction of zzso specific for zzso zzso into cells of the zzso zzso cancer cell line, in which zzso zzso transcript was zzso significantly suppressed cell zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso could bind to zzso zzso 4 zzso but zzso zzso has lost its capacity to associate with zzso Unlike zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso did not enhance zzso of zzso protein in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso promotes cell zzso independent of binding to zzso to enhance zzso zzso
