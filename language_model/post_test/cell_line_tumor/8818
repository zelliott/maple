zzso zzso is widely used in tissue engineering applications due its multiple zzso sites that allow it to retain growth factor affinity while zzso with zzso components of the tissue zzso However, the extent to which zzso zzso interferes with zzso protein binding is difficult to zzso To investigate such simultaneous zzso we examined a zzso zzso system comprised of zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso acting as a zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso was used to assess binding affinities and complex zzso as a function of zzso strength for zzso and zzso The zzso strength dependence of zzso formation is zzso consistent with binding driven by the release of condensed zzso previously suggested for native zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1995, 34, zzso On the other hand, zzso binding displays more complex zzso strength zzso with higher salt zzso zzso zzso that can bind two zzso molecules can only bind one zzso The limited binding of zzso to zzso suggests that the zzso might not block growth factor zzso and the zzso zzso complex is indeed zzso The analysis of mass distribution of the bound zzso chains in zzso zzso and zzso complexes indicated that higher degrees of zzso zzso promote the formation of zzso and zzso Thus, the selectivity of appropriately chosen short zzso chains could be used to zzso growth factor zzso and release in a way not feasible with zzso native zzso In support of this, human zzso zzso cells zzso treated with zzso were found to exhibit biological activity similar to cells treated with zzso
