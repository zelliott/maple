zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is an zzso protein implicated in zzso metabolism at several zzso Even if zzso zzso it is considered as a zzso zzso factor and a major signature for neurological zzso making the comprehension of its activity in the nervous system a very challenging zzso zzso has also been described as an accessory component of the zzso zzso syndrome critical region gene 8) zzso complex, which is zzso involved in zzso and zzso zzso processing zzso In the present study, we exploited in zzso zzso differentiation systems to investigate the zzso demand for the zzso function, focusing on both its zzso zzso zzso activity and its alternative role as a zzso regulator of gene zzso Our findings reveal a novel role for zzso as an essential factor that controls the stability of zzso protein during zzso zzso thus globally affecting the production of zzso We also demonstrate that zzso is required for the zzso regulation of zzso 2, a master gene orchestrating zzso whereas zzso control of zzso another zzso target, resulted to be zzso These results zzso a previously uncovered contribution of zzso in regulating the abundance and the zzso specificity of the zzso complex and provide new insights into zzso as a key player in zzso zzso
