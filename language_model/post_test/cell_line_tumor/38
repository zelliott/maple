A total synthesis of the complex, bent aromatic zzso marine zzso zzso A is achieved through a route in which every step (with the exception of the final zzso is performed on a zzso This is accomplished through the development of a method for the zzso of zzso that allows for zzso zzso zzso This strategy makes it possible to program the desired zzso outcome from a simple zzso zzso By zzso zzso A, this work has firmly established that natural zzso exists as a single, zzso zzso Finally, biological investigations demonstrate that the bent aromatic ring of this natural product is critical for zzso activity against zzso zzso
