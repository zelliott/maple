Two new zzso zzso zzso zzso D zzso and E zzso and one new zzso zzso zzso were isolated from the fruit of zzso zzso zzso together with another eight known zzso Their structures were determined on the basis of spectral zzso zzso activities of the isolated major compounds were evaluated against lung cancer cell line zzso zzso cell line zzso and zzso zzso cell line zzso by using a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso showed compounds 1 and 7 zzso zzso with an zzso zzso group in the side chain exhibited significant zzso activities against cancer zzso zzso the zzso values of the new compound 1 to zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, which were much lower than those of other tested zzso
