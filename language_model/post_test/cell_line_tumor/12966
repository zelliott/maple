zzso a plant zzso is known to possess multiple biological activities such as zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso At present, the zzso potential of zzso has not been fully zzso In this study, we focused on the effect of zzso on cell cycle regulation in human zzso zzso zzso zzso First, we found that zzso inhibited cell cycle progression at zzso phase and prevented entry into S phase in a zzso and zzso zzso Next, it was found that zzso treatment led to zzso of zzso D1 via enhanced protein zzso and zzso degradation, leading to reduced zzso activity and suppression of zzso protein zzso zzso and subsequently zzso of the zzso factor zzso In search of the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso D1 zzso it was found that zzso was capable of suppressing zzso zzso and zzso resulting in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso then targeted zzso zzso causing zzso of zzso D1 at zzso and subsequent zzso zzso The above findings were reinforced by the fact that zzso was able to abrogate the effect of insulin on the zzso D1 pathway, resulting in suppression of zzso cell zzso Since zzso is often zzso in many human zzso including zzso it is thus believed that data from this study support the potential application of zzso as a zzso or zzso agent in human zzso
