To investigate the role of zzso zzso and its zzso zzso in the proliferation of zzso zzso zzso 

The expression of zzso zzso in zzso cell lines as well as zzso tissue samples and zzso tissue was studied using zzso chain zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned into a zzso expression zzso allowing both transient expression and the production of stable zzso expressing cell zzso zzso expression was studied in these cells using Western zzso zzso and zzso linked zzso zzso A zzso blocking zzso and zzso targeting of zzso were used to examine the role of this zzso in the zzso zzso cell growth observed in zzso zzso cells zzso expressing either zzso zzso or -C were injected zzso into the zzso of nude mice to observe in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and protein in these zzso was examined using reverse zzso chain reaction and zzso 

zzso is expressed in zzso in 3 forms, the full length zzso and 2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression was noted in zzso tissue as well as zzso surrounding zzso liver zzso zzso of these zzso zzso in the zzso derived cell line zzso resulted in zzso of zzso into the culture zzso Transfer of zzso zzso media to zzso zzso and zzso cells resulted in significant cell growth suggesting that all zzso zzso can zzso cell proliferation in a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso increase in cellular proliferation was dependent on zzso as only zzso positive cell lines responded to zzso zzso media while zzso zzso of zzso blocked the zzso zzso zzso expression also increased the proliferation of zzso cells in a subcutaneous nude mouse zzso model, with zzso cells expressing zzso showing the greatest zzso zzso 

This study demonstrates that zzso plays a significant role in the proliferation of zzso through interaction with the cell surface zzso zzso zzso of this interaction could represent a novel strategy for the control of zzso
