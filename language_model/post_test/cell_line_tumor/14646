Previous studies have demonstrated that the persistent exposure of human zzso zzso cells to nicotine zzso through zzso zzso receptors increases zzso D1 promoter activity and protein zzso The main purpose of this study is to zzso the zzso role of zzso zzso which is involved in breast zzso when induced by zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso D3 is highly expressed at the zzso level in surgically dissected breast tumor zzso compared to the surrounding normal tissue zzso fold ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To test whether zzso zzso zzso zzso binding could affect zzso D3 expression in human breast cancer cells, the transformed cell line zzso zzso was generated from normal breast zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso gene zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso mice resulted in a significant induction of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso D3 expression was zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors in zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso human breast cancer zzso cell proliferation was inhibited by 1 zzso of zzso zzso isolated from the edible fruit zzso zzso through zzso of zzso and zzso D3 zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso D3 zzso is important for zzso transformation of normal human breast zzso zzso The zzso regulation of zzso D3 has the potential to be a molecular target for zzso zzso or zzso purposes in clinical breast cancer zzso
