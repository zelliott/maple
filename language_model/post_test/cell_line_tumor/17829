Although zzso of zzso or zzso zzso is rare in breast cancer, zzso of zzso zzso is nonetheless thought to play an important role in breast zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso including the zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso families, has been observed in various zzso In breast cancer, frequent zzso and zzso of zzso was recently zzso however, altered expression of other zzso zzso genes is largely zzso In the present study, we found frequent zzso of zzso family genes in breast cancer cell lines zzso 7 out of 11, zzso zzso 11 out of 11, zzso zzso 10 out of 11, zzso and primary breast zzso zzso 31 out of 78, zzso zzso 60 out of 78, zzso zzso 55 out of 78, zzso We also observed zzso of zzso although less zzso in cell lines (3 out of 11, zzso and primary zzso (15 out of 78, zzso Breast cancer cell lines express various zzso zzso and zzso of zzso inhibited cancer cell zzso In addition, zzso of a zzso zzso and depletion of zzso using small interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results confirm the frequent zzso and zzso of zzso zzso genes in breast cancer, and suggest that their loss of function contributes to zzso of zzso zzso in breast zzso
