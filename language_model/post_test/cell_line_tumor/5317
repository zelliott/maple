zzso regulatory T zzso cells are vital for maintaining peripheral T cell tolerance and zzso The mechanisms by which zzso target genes orchestrate zzso zzso cell function are largely zzso In this study we show that in mouse peripheral zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso a gene that is involved in enhancing zzso responses, is exclusively expressed in zzso regulatory T zzso zzso is a direct target of zzso and regulatory T cells lacking zzso are functionally impaired in zzso and in zzso However, not all aspects of zzso cell function are zzso and zzso appears to be zzso for zzso cell function in maintaining zzso T cell zzso
