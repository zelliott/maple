zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the leading causes of zzso zzso zzso of zzso control is thought to be a crucial event in zzso zzso and zzso zzso are a family of zzso zzso zzso which act at different points of the cell cycle, including zzso and zzso zzso Here, we investigated the expression and functional significance of zzso in zzso zzso zzso expression levels in human pancreatic tissue samples were zzso by zzso zzso quantitative zzso and Northern zzso zzso was carried out to zzso and zzso zzso zzso Two specific zzso zzso were zzso to determine the functional relevance of zzso By quantitative zzso zzso zzso was zzso in pancreatic cancer zzso in comparison to the normal zzso Strong nuclear zzso zzso was present in both pancreatic and zzso cancer samples, and there was a marked increase of the percentage of positive cells in primary cancer zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared to normal samples zzso Two zzso zzso reduced the growth of pancreatic cancer cell lines, resulting in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings demonstrate an important role of zzso in zzso zzso raising the possibility that zzso of zzso may have therapeutic potential in pancreatic zzso
