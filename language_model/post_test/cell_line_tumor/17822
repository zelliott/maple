To investigate the expression of zzso in prostate cancer cells with different zzso potential and the correlation with zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso and protein in human prostate cancer cell zzso zzso with zzso potential and zzso with highly zzso potential was detected by zzso and Western zzso zzso expression plasmids of zzso were constructed and zzso into zzso The biological effects were observed, including in zzso invasion by zzso chamber zzso zzso by would healing zzso zzso of zzso network by the zzso of zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso by gelatin zzso analysis and expression of zzso by Western zzso zzso 

The expression levels of zzso zzso and protein varied in the two different zzso zzso of human prostate cancer zzso zzso was significantly zzso in the highly zzso zzso in comparison to the zzso counterpart zzso zzso zzso As shown in zzso chamber zzso the invasive capacity of zzso cells zzso zzso was significantly promoted as reflected by more penetrating cells zzso zzso zzso than the zzso transcripts zzso zzso zzso the negative zzso zzso zzso and blank controls zzso zzso zzso Further study by would healing zzso indicated that cells zzso zzso were more zzso in zzso active movement zzso healing ratio after 16 h of the sense zzso zzso zzso negative controls and blank controls was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso revealed less zzso filament zzso and a fuzzy network of shorter filaments in the sense zzso In addition, zzso activity and zzso expression level were zzso in the sense zzso 

zzso zzso could promote the invasive capacity of human prostate cancer cell in zzso and it's expression level correlated positively with the zzso capacity of human prostate cancer cell, so zzso may be a potential target in the development of a novel strategy for treating zzso of prostate zzso
