zzso zzso is demonstrated in many species but key factors interacting with zzso under zzso conditions are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stress is an zzso factor involved in several zzso We hypothesized that, if zzso is a pivotal mechanism for nerve cell protection or zzso it might be selectively regulated under zzso stress zzso To check our hypothesis, we investigated zzso effects on zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso high performance liquid zzso and zzso analyses showed that, along zzso pathways converting zzso into various zzso only zzso synthesis selectively decreased in zzso cells after zzso zzso conversion into zzso was also inhibited by zzso zzso reverse zzso chain reaction revealed zzso gene repression in zzso cells 12 h after the zzso stress zzso zzso viability zzso showed that chronic zzso of zzso activity by zzso killed zzso zzso A zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso was protective against zzso zzso In addition, zzso was also capable of rescuing markedly zzso cells from zzso zzso Altogether, these results suggest that zzso zzso formation is pivotal for zzso cell zzso zzso zzso stress, which also killed zzso cells, unaffected zzso indicating that zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso is specific for zzso zzso Selective targeting of zzso pathways may therefore constitute an interesting strategy against zzso neurodegenerative zzso
