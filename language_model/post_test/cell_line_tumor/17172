zzso zzso present in many human zzso can lead to resistance to radiation and chemotherapy, is associated with a more aggressive tumor zzso and is an independent zzso factor of clinical zzso It is therefore important to identify and zzso tumor zzso in cancer zzso In the current study, serial zzso imaging was used to evaluate zzso zzso zzso zzso physical zzso as a zzso imaging agent in 17 zzso breast tumors and six zzso zzso implanted in zzso For comparison, another promising zzso PET zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso in the same zzso zzso Twelve animals were also zzso with zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso examination was performed, and direct measurement of tumor zzso status carried out with the zzso probe zzso Two size groups were used, relatively zzso tumors in the range of zzso zzso were designated as small, and those zzso zzso and highly zzso as zzso Based on the data from 11 zzso and six zzso tumors, both zzso and zzso images showed high zzso zzso in the large zzso In zzso images at 1, zzso and zzso h zzso zzso there was considerable zzso background zzso In contrast, zzso imaging was optimal when performed at zzso h zzso when the zzso background had dissipated zzso As a result, the zzso images at zzso h zzso had higher tumor to zzso activity contrast than the zzso images at 3-6 h zzso zzso analysis was performed as a function of time zzso and indicated a tumor zzso of zzso (of zzso zzso for zzso at 3-6 h zzso and of zzso for zzso at 48 h zzso This was zzso by zzso data in that the zzso tissue zzso normal zzso of blood, heart, zzso liver, zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity ratios of zzso at 24 h zzso was zzso times higher than those of zzso at 3 h zzso with the exception of zzso zzso analysis indicated that these differences in zzso ratios were zzso The small tumors were zzso in the zzso images, but not in the zzso or zzso zzso This was perhaps due to the combined effect of a smaller tumor volume and a lower hypoxic zzso zzso probe measurement indicated a lesser proportion of regions with zzso zzso in the small tumors zzso zzso was zzso zzso in zzso and zzso of the data in small and large zzso tumors, respectively), and the zzso data showed lower zzso of the zzso in the small tumors than in the large zzso In the first study of its kind, using serial zzso imaging in conjunction with zzso analysis and direct probe zzso of local zzso to evaluate tumor zzso zzso we have provided data showing the potential of zzso for zzso zzso
