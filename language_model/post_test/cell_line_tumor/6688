zzso zzso such as those derived from the zzso protein are candidate zzso for zzso delivery of therapeutic zzso such as DNA and zzso The mechanism by which they enter cells is controversial, and very little spatial information regarding the downstream fate of these peptides from the plasma membrane is zzso We studied zzso traffic of fluorescent zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in human zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso zzso and substantiated our findings in zzso zzso Both peptides were efficiently zzso to zzso pathways of both zzso cell zzso however, comparative analysis of the zzso location of the peptides with zzso zzso revealed major differences in spatial organization of their zzso zzso and their interaction with the peptides at low zzso Double labeling zzso zzso demonstrates that zzso zzso of all the tested cells are accessible to zzso peptides within 60 zzso of zzso zzso zzso of cells with zzso and zzso D inhibited zzso traffic from early to late zzso structures, demonstrating a zzso requirement for zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso dynamics was without effect on zzso zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso rather than these zzso are the major zzso compartments for these zzso
