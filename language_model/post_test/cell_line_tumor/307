zzso zzso is a potential zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso In this study we characterized the effect of zzso on cell cycle regulation in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso negative zzso zzso zzso human prostate cancer zzso zzso had an zzso effect on both zzso and zzso cells, as it significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a zzso zzso cell cycle zzso zzso strongly inhibited the expression of zzso and zzso protein and increased the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor zzso protein in zzso and zzso zzso zzso deletion studies with zzso reporter gene zzso showed that this zzso increase in zzso was dependent on the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, using a dominant negative inhibitor of zzso zzso we showed that the induction of zzso and subsequent zzso arrest by zzso involve zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso is able to stop the cell cycle progression of human prostate cancer cells regardless of their zzso and zzso status, by zzso modulating cell cycle regulatory zzso The zzso and zzso zzso pathways mediate the zzso cell cycle regulatory effect in zzso zzso
