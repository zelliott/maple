zzso acid zzso zzso were zzso using zzso acid zzso as a zzso segment and zzso zzso as zzso segment by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The structural characteristics of the zzso zzso were investigated using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared based on zzso zzso and the characteristics of zzso were investigated using dynamic light zzso transmission electron zzso zzso scanning electron zzso zzso and zzso zzso The particles were between zzso and zzso zzso in size, depending on the degree of substitution zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso images indicated that the zzso of zzso was zzso in zzso The critical zzso zzso of zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso which decreased with an increase in the zzso of the zzso Images of zzso zzso indicate that zzso were taken up by the cancer cell line zzso and significantly decreased by competition zzso of free zzso From the zzso test, it was found that zzso zzso exhibited similar dose and zzso zzso against zzso cells with free zzso
