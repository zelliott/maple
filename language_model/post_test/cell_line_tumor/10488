Our previous study has demonstrated that zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso are closely related to the proliferation and migration of colon cancer cell line zzso However, the detailed signaling zzso and underlying molecular mechanisms remain zzso This study has investigated whether zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso and nuclear factor zzso zzso signaling pathways are involved in the zzso The results revealed that zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells, and the effect of zzso was significantly attenuated by zzso zzso zzso or zzso also increased zzso zzso levels among cell nuclear proteins and simultaneously decreased zzso levels in the zzso zzso Such effects of zzso can be inhibited with zzso or zzso zzso While zzso inhibitor zzso intervened with the regulatory effects of zzso and zzso on zzso zzso expression in the cells, zzso inhibitor zzso partially blocked the enhancing effects of zzso and zzso on the zzso and migratory ability of zzso zzso Furthermore, the regulatory effects of zzso and zzso on expressions of certain proteins zzso zzso and zzso were also significantly abolished by zzso zzso the data in this study suggest that the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso thereby triggers the zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso to regulate the gene expression of zzso zzso and zzso and ultimately promotes zzso cell proliferation and zzso
