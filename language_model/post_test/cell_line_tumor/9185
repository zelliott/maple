zzso alpha zzso zzso both zzso and a zzso zzso growth factor zzso survival response in cancer zzso In this report, zzso increased zzso zzso factor zzso zzso protein expression by zzso of zzso degradation via a zzso zzso The reduction of the expression level of zzso by zzso interference enhanced the zzso induced by zzso on the same zzso Moreover, zzso induced the zzso of both zzso and zzso in zzso These effects were paralleled by an increased zzso and zzso of zzso with zzso The suppression of zzso zzso activity with the inhibitor BAY zzso completely antagonized the increase of both zzso zzso and expression and of zzso zzso induced by zzso and enhanced zzso and zzso zzso Cell zzso with the zzso zzso zzso increased zzso expression and zzso tumor cells to the modulating effects of zzso The dynamic simulation of zzso of zzso identified putative zzso and zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the interaction between zzso and zzso increases zzso stability and zzso a survival zzso
