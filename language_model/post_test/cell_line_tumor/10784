zzso of zzso zzso 2 zzso has been reported to be associated with biological zzso in several zzso High expression of zzso is associated with tumor cell zzso invasion and zzso and has important zzso zzso However, little is known about the function and mechanisms of zzso in cervical zzso 

This study was conducted to investigate the clinical value of zzso expression in cervical cancer and the association between zzso and possible downstream proteins using zzso interfering zzso 

zzso expression rate was significantly greater in cervical cancer tissue than in normal cervical tissue both in zzso and protein zzso High zzso expression was significantly associated with zzso depth and zzso zzso zzso gene zzso resulted in zzso of cell growth, cell cycle arrest and decreased ability of invasion in zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressions were zzso whereas zzso was zzso after zzso of zzso 

High zzso expression may be associated with tumor cell proliferation and invasion in cervical cancer, and that zzso may be one of the candidates for new molecular therapeutic targets for the treatment of cervical zzso
