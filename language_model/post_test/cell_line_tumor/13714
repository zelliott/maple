zzso zzso is one of the zzso strategies that improve neurological outcomes after brain damage in zzso stroke and traumatic brain zzso zzso cells become activated following brain injury and play an important role in zzso and subsequent brain zzso The aim of this study was to determine the zzso effects of zzso on zzso cell zzso and migration, which are accompanied by zzso 

zzso cells in culture were subjected to mild zzso or moderate zzso zzso conditions before, zzso or after zzso zzso or hypoxic zzso and the production of zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso oxygen species, and zzso was zzso zzso of zzso on zzso migration were also determined in in zzso as well as in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso treatments inhibited zzso production of inflammatory zzso to varying zzso early treatment was the most efficient, and delayed treatment showed zzso zzso Delayed zzso also suppressed the zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso and attenuated zzso zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, delayed zzso reduced zzso migration in the zzso chamber zzso and wound healing zzso In a stab injury model, delayed local zzso reduced migration of zzso toward the injury site in the rat zzso 

Taken together, our results indicate that delayed zzso is sufficient to zzso zzso zzso and migration, and provide the basis of determining the optimal time window for therapeutic zzso Delayed zzso may be zzso by zzso zzso zzso indicating the therapeutic potential of zzso zzso for patients with brain damages exhibiting some of the inflammatory zzso
