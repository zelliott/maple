zzso receptors and their zzso zzso are implicated in cancer zzso Their expression in gastrointestinal cancer, however, has not been zzso zzso 

The expression of four zzso receptors and a panel of zzso zzso were determined by reverse zzso in two gastric zzso zzso and two colon zzso zzso cancer cell zzso Cell proliferation was measured by zzso zzso while gene zzso was achieved by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso receptors and five known or putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso transforming growth factor alpha zzso and zzso were expressed in all four cell zzso zzso of zzso however, did not affect cell zzso 

This study profiles the expression of zzso receptors and their zzso zzso in gastric and colon cancer zzso These findings might lay the basis for the development of zzso zzso zzso for gastrointestinal zzso
