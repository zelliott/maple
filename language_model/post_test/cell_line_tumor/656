The physical properties of the zzso zzso zzso regulate the behavior of several cell zzso yet, mechanisms by which cells recognize and respond to changes in these properties are not zzso For example, breast zzso cells undergo zzso zzso only when cultured in a zzso collagen zzso but not when the tension of the zzso is increased by loading collagen gels or by increasing collagen zzso We report that the zzso protein zzso A zzso is necessary for cells to contract collagen gels, and pull on collagen zzso which leads to collagen zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso gels, cells are not able to contract and zzso the zzso and zzso does not zzso However, increased zzso zzso interactions rescue gel contraction and zzso in zzso gels, resulting in branching zzso These results suggest zzso can be zzso by the balance between zzso zzso and opposing zzso zzso Our findings support a role for zzso zzso as a zzso complex that zzso senses the tension of the zzso and, in turn, regulates cellular zzso and response to this zzso zzso
