zzso from zzso zzso zzso a Chinese medicinal herb that is widely used to prevent and treat zzso in China, zzso zzso exerted zzso effects on several cancer zzso However, its zzso mechanism is still not zzso In this study, we found that zzso could induce zzso arrest and subsequently stimulate cell zzso in zzso and zzso zzso We used zzso quantitative zzso to identify zzso proteins in cancer cells, and found that 124 proteins were significantly altered in zzso Gene zzso and zzso zzso Analysis revealed that these proteins were mainly involved in the regulation of zzso stress and inflammation zzso zzso studies demonstrated that zzso induced zzso arrest and zzso by inducing zzso generation, and that zzso zzso could block the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in DNA zzso subsequent zzso arrest and zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso inflammation factors zzso zzso and zzso through zzso and independent zzso The current work reveals that zzso exerts its zzso effects through zzso DNA damage, zzso zzso mechanism and zzso inflammation factor zzso
