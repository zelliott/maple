The zzso zzso plays a central role in zzso and vascular zzso Recent studies investigating the regulation of the human zzso zzso zzso gene identified an upstream zzso region zzso within its regulatory promoter, zzso termed the zzso This study aimed to identify the main zzso factors that bind within the zzso to zzso repress zzso gene expression in the zzso human zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Of the putative zzso elements zzso disruption of zzso and zzso elements within the zzso substantially increased zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that zzso and zzso but not zzso bind to the zzso in zzso while zzso expression of zzso substantially reduced zzso zzso levels and zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differentiation increased zzso zzso and zzso reporter gene expression and zzso zzso generation in zzso zzso Two zzso regions, termed zzso and zzso were identified within zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso within the overlapping zzso and of zzso zzso and zzso zzso within the overlapping zzso zzso revealed that both zzso and zzso contribute to the zzso induction of zzso zzso and gene expression in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis established that induction of zzso gene expression during zzso differentiation is largely regulated by zzso zzso of zzso and enhanced binding of zzso to zzso in addition to increased binding of zzso zzso and zzso to elements within the core zzso in zzso Taken together, these data provide critical insights into the zzso regulation of the zzso gene within the zzso including during zzso zzso
