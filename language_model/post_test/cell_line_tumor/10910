zzso zzso zzso is a new strategy to treat cancer through a vulnerability created by the loss of large segments of zzso material by loss of zzso zzso Using zzso approaches, it is possible to target single zzso zzso zzso in the remaining zzso of an essential gene in the zzso thus killing the tumor while the zzso patient survives at the expense of the other zzso zzso lost by the zzso In this study, the feasibility of using locked zzso acid zzso zzso zzso of the zzso motif as zzso drugs was zzso We demonstrate that incorporation of zzso into zzso motif zzso increases their efficacy in zzso degradation and that, in a zzso system, the zzso motif zzso can adequately discriminate and recognize an zzso in the large zzso of zzso zzso II zzso an essential gene frequently involved in zzso in cancer zzso However, the zzso zzso under in zzso conditions, are not always efficient in zzso their zzso target in cell culture, and the efficiency of zzso zzso in cell culture is cell type zzso The zzso rate of the zzso is also much slower than zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso Moreover, compared with DNA zzso the ability of the zzso to zzso knock down two zzso zzso in cultured cancer cells is zzso
