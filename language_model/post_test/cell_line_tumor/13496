zzso zzso 5 zzso is a surface protein expressed selectively on B cells and plasma zzso We found that zzso was expressed at elevated levels on the surface of plasma cells from the bone zzso of patients diagnosed with multiple zzso This prevalence in multiple myeloma and narrow pattern of normal expression indicate that zzso could be a target for zzso therapies for multiple zzso particularly zzso zzso zzso potent zzso drugs linked to zzso via specialized chemical zzso where limited expression on normal zzso is a key component to their zzso We found that zzso is zzso upon zzso zzso indicating that zzso to zzso could be zzso Indeed, we found that zzso zzso were zzso in zzso and in zzso but the zzso zzso was zzso The two most effective consisted of our zzso zzso zzso through zzso to zzso E zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso via zzso to the zzso zzso through a zzso zzso zzso These two zzso were highly effective in zzso in combination with zzso or zzso drugs in use for the treatment of multiple zzso These data show that the zzso zzso described zzso show promise as an effective treatment for multiple zzso
