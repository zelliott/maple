zzso signaling zzso is essential for development and zzso however, this signaling zzso in the progress of zzso zzso zzso remains zzso In this paper, we studied the function of human zzso zzso zzso zzso a key factor of zzso signaling pathway, on the proliferation of zzso cell zzso We showed that the expression of zzso zzso in zzso cell line zzso was higher than that in immortalized normal liver cell line zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso a dominant negative zzso could suppress zzso cells growth and decrease the expression of zzso D1 and zzso two of target genes of zzso zzso On the other hand, stimulating zzso zzso by introducing a zzso zzso zzso could increase zzso cells zzso But all the treatments had no effect on zzso zzso Our data indicated that zzso might be another key factor in zzso zzso involved in zzso cells proliferation and zzso could be an effective therapeutic target for suppressing the growth of zzso zzso
