zzso levels of testosterone and zzso zzso are found in prostate cancer zzso tissue after zzso deprivation zzso Treatment of surviving zzso cells and the ability to metabolize steroids from precursors may be the zzso for the appearance of zzso zzso To study this hypothesis, we assessed the expression of several zzso zzso and stem cell markers in clinical zzso samples and cell cultures during zzso zzso Gene expression profiles were determined by zzso or zzso In addition, we measured cell viability and analyzed stem cell marker expression in zzso cells by zzso zzso patient samples from different stages of zzso and the zzso cell line zzso were included in this zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso ) that are involved in the metabolism of adrenal steroids were zzso in zzso resistant prostate cancer zzso In zzso some zzso cells survived zzso zzso and eventually gave rise to a culture adapted to these zzso During and after this transition, most of the zzso zzso were zzso These cells also are enriched with zzso cell markers zzso 5 zzso and zzso cassette zzso G member 2 zzso Similarly, putative zzso cell markers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in clinical zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and stem cell markers in zzso tumors suggests that cancer initiating cells can expand by adaptation to their zzso deprived zzso zzso targeting the metabolism of adrenal steroids by the tumor may prove effective in preventing tumor zzso
