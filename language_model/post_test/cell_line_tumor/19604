zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso functions in cancer cells as an zzso and as a zzso of zzso events on the cell zzso To exert its functional activity, zzso requires zzso removal of the zzso zzso There are two potential zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso sequence of zzso Our data suggest an important role of zzso and related zzso zzso zzso in zzso both the zzso of zzso and the levels of functionally active zzso at the surface of cancer zzso We have determined that the zzso sequence that spans the first zzso site is susceptible to zzso and zzso whereas the second sequence is susceptible to zzso and also to zzso zzso and zzso In the structure of the zzso zzso the zzso site, however, is zzso to zzso Our studies also demonstrated a direct functional link between the zzso and the zzso rate of the zzso and the zzso of zzso Thus, the zzso rate of the zzso zzso zzso noticeably exceeded that of the active zzso We conclude that zzso and related PCs are the essential components of the specialized cellular machinery that controls the levels of the functionally active, mature, zzso zzso on the cell surface to continually support the potency of zzso zzso
