DNA zzso I zzso is a ubiquitous nuclear zzso that plays essential roles in various cellular zzso such as zzso or zzso Agents that target zzso involving zzso and its zzso are among the most effective zzso drugs used in the zzso Previous work has suggested that the level of zzso expression zzso with the zzso of zzso but no direct evidence has been provided thus far in the context of human cells with a strictly zzso genetic zzso In this study, we perform zzso disruption of the zzso gene zzso by gene targeting in a human zzso cell line, zzso which is zzso stable and normal for zzso zzso We show that the zzso loss of the zzso gene does zzso cellular resistance to zzso to an extent comparable to that observed in the absence of functional zzso zzso Such a tolerance was not observed with other agents that target DNA zzso zzso Our results provide direct evidence that human cells with decreased zzso levels are significantly more resistant to killing by zzso than are otherwise zzso zzso
