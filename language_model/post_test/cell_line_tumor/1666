zzso resistance zzso remains a primary hindrance to zzso cancer zzso Thus, introduction of novel strategies to overcome zzso is of paramount therapeutic zzso zzso of zzso in zzso is an established mechanism of drug zzso Here, we show that zzso cells display a marked increase in zzso zzso We further demonstrate that zzso zzso which are zzso zzso undergo a dramatic zzso in zzso because of their zzso weak base zzso We hence developed a novel zzso pharmacological Trojan horse approach to target and eradicate zzso cancer cells based on zzso of zzso zzso and tumor cell zzso via formation of zzso oxygen zzso zzso of zzso cells resulted in zzso zzso and restoration of parental cell drug zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells zzso the key zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso resulted in zzso to zzso lower zzso values of various zzso thereby restoring parental cell zzso Finally, in zzso application of this zzso therapy strategy after zzso injection of zzso in human zzso tumor zzso in the zzso membrane model revealed selective destruction of tumors and their associated zzso These findings identify zzso zzso of zzso as an Achilles heel of zzso cells that can be harnessed to eradicate zzso tumor cells via zzso zzso
