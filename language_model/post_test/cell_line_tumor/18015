To investigate the effects of zzso on the cell cycle and zzso in human colon zzso zzso cells and explore the possible zzso 

The effect of zzso on cell proliferation was assessed using zzso zzso and the cell cycle arrest induced by zzso was determined by flow zzso The changes of cell zzso were observed through optical zzso zzso microscope and electron zzso and the cell zzso was detected using zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso cells in a zzso and zzso zzso Compared with the control group, the zzso cells showed increased cell percentage arrested in G zzso phase with decreased zzso zzso zzso the zzso cells treated with zzso exhibited cell zzso cell size reduction, plasma zzso zzso zzso changes, and formation of zzso body with also the presence of the zzso cells, all typical of zzso zzso 

zzso exposure of zzso cells zzso the cell zzso causes cell cycle arrest at G zzso phase, and zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso dependent zzso
