The invasive behavior of zzso zzso zzso cells is one of the most important reasons for the poor prognosis of this zzso For invasion, tumor cells must acquire an ability to digest the zzso zzso and zzso the normal tissue bordering the zzso Preventing this by altering zzso molecules can significantly improve a patient's zzso zzso evidence suggests that zzso are involved in multiple biological functions, including cell invasion, by altering the expression of multiple target zzso The expression levels of zzso correlate with the invasive potential of zzso zzso In this study, we found that zzso expression was low in zzso zzso especially in zzso The data showed an inverse correlation in 60 zzso zzso between the levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Additionally, zzso expression of zzso suppressed the invasion of zzso cells whereas zzso of zzso expression enhanced the invasive zzso Numerous members of the zzso family are downstream zzso of the zzso zzso Target prediction databases and zzso data showed that zzso is a new direct target of zzso zzso western zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso can reduce protein levels of zzso and zzso zzso therefore, zzso that zzso directly targets zzso resulting in reduced synthesis of zzso zzso suggest that zzso is involved in the invasive behavior of zzso cells and by targeting zzso and blocking the invasive zzso zzso it may be useful for developing potential clinical zzso
