The initial stages of spreading of a suspended cell onto a zzso under the effect of zzso or zzso zzso exhibit a universal behavior, which is zzso zzso We show that this behavior is governed only by zzso zzso This can be understood if the main zzso force that opposes cell zzso is of mechanical origin, that is, dissipation occurring during the zzso By comparing several zzso models that generate different patterns of zzso we show by zzso simulation that only dissipation due to the deformation of the zzso zzso is compatible with the experimental zzso This zzso dissipation zzso to the energetic cost of rearranging the zzso and is the trace of all zzso events occurring in the cell zzso during the early zzso such as the binding and zzso of zzso and molecular zzso
