During zzso tumor zzso the loss of zzso expression and inappropriate expression of zzso zzso coincide with increased zzso zzso experiments have established zzso as an invasion zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso suppresses zzso and the role of zzso zzso are poorly zzso We show that both zzso zzso and zzso zzso are required for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso binding promotes the zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso which are essential for cell migration and zzso zzso also promotes zzso by zzso zzso activity, independently of zzso zzso Furthermore, association of zzso zzso with zzso is required for zzso suppression of zzso and is accompanied by a reduction in zzso zzso zzso The data indicate that zzso acts as a zzso promoting a zzso cellular zzso when associated with zzso or a zzso zzso when associated with zzso zzso
