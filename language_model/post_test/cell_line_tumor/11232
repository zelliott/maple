zzso is one of the most critical zzso factors in zzso and zzso of the molecular backgrounds of zzso may lead to better clinical zzso zzso cells resemble in zzso cells and are considered an in zzso model for the drug zzso We found that zzso cells displayed more zzso than conventional zzso cells across 11 zzso cell zzso To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the resistance to chemotherapy, we examined the zzso differences between the zzso and zzso cells by zzso Of the zzso protein species observed, we further investigated 435 species with zzso mass zzso in the public zzso database, Genome Medicine Database of Japan zzso Among the 435 protein species, we found that 17 species exhibited expression level differences when the cells formed zzso in more than five cell lines and four species out of these 17 were associated with zzso associated resistance to zzso We confirmed the zzso of zzso D in zzso cells by western zzso zzso D has been implicated in zzso of various zzso but has not previously been implemented in zzso Our study suggested that the zzso system may be a useful tool to reveal the molecular backgrounds of zzso in zzso
