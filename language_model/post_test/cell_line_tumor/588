zzso is a central component of two complexes formed by five zzso zzso in zzso These complexes are involved in repairing DNA zzso breaks through zzso zzso Despite accumulating evidence suggesting that the zzso may prevent zzso by controlling zzso integrity, zzso role in maintaining zzso stability remains zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso leads to both zzso aberrations in an zzso manner and increased zzso in human zzso While it was reported that zzso zzso did not cause zzso aberrations in zzso in zzso cells, such aberrations were observed in zzso in zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso treatment and zzso of zzso but not that of zzso reduced the frequency of zzso aberrations in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso interference in zzso cells resulted in similar zzso Treatment with a zzso inhibitor and zzso of zzso also reduced the frequency in zzso zzso zzso of zzso at the zzso and nuclear zzso of gamma zzso were increased in the zzso Moreover, the zzso cells had a higher frequency of zzso These findings indicate that the zzso zzso plays a role in increased zzso aberrations induced by zzso zzso
