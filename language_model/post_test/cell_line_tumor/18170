zzso binds zzso zzso receptors zzso to form a zzso complex and zzso downstream signaling zzso The mechanism by which zzso binding converts the inactive zzso zzso to its active signaling zzso is zzso zzso has no axis of zzso Its interaction with zzso is zzso by two zzso binding sites on zzso each with distinct zzso Site 1 is of high affinity and is thought to mediate the first binding zzso zzso of binding site 2 (as in the human zzso zzso zzso zzso the second binding but leaves site 1 binding zzso zzso is a zzso zzso it binds only one zzso and thus fails to zzso and it prevents productive zzso binding by normal zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso zzso signaling was achieved by a zzso version of a zzso zzso We now employ zzso of cellular signaling and zzso zzso changes to examine whether zzso molecules harboring two site 1 regions can trigger zzso zzso We used zzso produced zzso and zzso zzso in which zzso in tandem are connected by a short zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso cells zzso were treated with zzso zzso zzso or zzso As expected, zzso and zzso but not zzso induced zzso zzso linkage, as assessed by zzso zzso of cell extracts resolved by zzso under zzso zzso zzso linkage of zzso reflects zzso of the active signaling zzso Likewise, zzso and zzso but not zzso caused zzso zzso 2 zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso despite its lack of an intact site 2 in either zzso partner, also promoted zzso zzso linkage and zzso and zzso zzso albeit less zzso than either zzso or zzso zzso responses of the three zzso were similar in terms of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of cells with our zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso for all three zzso zzso was also rendered less zzso by zzso zzso after treatment with these zzso These results are important in that they indicate that a zzso with two intact binding sites 1 causes zzso to adopt similar zzso changes as does zzso and thus triggers zzso of zzso and downstream zzso Furthermore, we zzso that there is substantial flexibility in the zzso zzso domain, such that it zzso zzso zzso zzso that are much larger than zzso
