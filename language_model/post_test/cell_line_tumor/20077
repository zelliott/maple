Among zzso zzso the zzso zzso virus zzso is especially potent and a highly promising agent for the treatment of zzso But, even though effective against multiple tumor entities in zzso animal models, zzso zzso exhibits inherent zzso which has so far hindered clinical zzso To overcome this zzso zzso zzso zzso for cancer gene therapy have been tested and proven to be zzso However, gene delivery was inefficient and only minor zzso efficacy was zzso Here, we present zzso zzso systems for zzso zzso composed of two zzso zzso zzso zzso The de zzso generated deletion zzso of the two zzso zzso proteins P zzso and L zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, were used mutually or in combination with zzso zzso These zzso systems zzso in zzso and in zzso without zzso zzso to zzso zzso The zzso systems were highly zzso for human zzso cell lines, zzso and subcutaneous zzso Especially the combination of zzso zzso was as potent as zzso zzso zzso in zzso and induced long-term tumor zzso in zzso without any associated adverse zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso animals succumbed to neurological disease shortly after tumor zzso Most importantly, even when injected into the brain, zzso did not show any zzso In conclusion, zzso is a promising platform for zzso approaches and also for zzso zzso vaccines, combining improved safety with an increased coding capacity for therapeutic zzso potentially allowing for multipronged zzso
