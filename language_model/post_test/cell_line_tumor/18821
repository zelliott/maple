zzso cells were zzso zzso with human zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in expression of zzso zzso a high abundance of zzso zzso and the formation of zzso on the plasma zzso zzso zzso from zzso cells was 280 and zzso higher than that from parent zzso cells when human plasma and human zzso respectively, were used as zzso The difference in zzso was eliminated by treatment of cells with zzso There was no difference in cholesterol zzso to zzso zzso zzso from plasma membrane zzso was similar for the two cell zzso zzso led to a zzso increase in the amount of plasma membrane cholesterol in zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso and a zzso increase in the rate of cholesterol trafficking from zzso compartments to these zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was increased by zzso and cholesterol zzso was reduced by 50% compared with parent zzso zzso The proliferation rate of zzso cells was significantly lower than that of zzso zzso zzso did not affect expression of zzso or the abundance of zzso zzso but decreased zzso of zzso We conclude that zzso of zzso in zzso cells stimulates cholesterol zzso by enhancing transfer of cholesterol to zzso zzso in the plasma zzso
