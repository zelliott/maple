We previously showed that zzso or induced zzso zzso expands zzso cell numbers in T zzso and zzso zzso We zzso these increases could be zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso of zzso leads to the expansion of both zzso zzso cell zzso and regulatory T zzso cell numbers, indicating zzso control of zzso numbers by a zzso cell zzso zzso zzso specific zzso of zzso leads to expansion of zzso numbers, but not expansion of the zzso zzso indicating zzso also has a lineage intrinsic role in limiting zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso cell that promotes zzso and zzso expansion is not an zzso as they lack zzso protein zzso Thus, regulation of zzso numbers in zzso must be controlled in a zzso fashion by another zzso cell zzso We had previously shown that zzso levels are profoundly increased in zzso mice, suggesting this zzso growth factor could promote zzso expansion in a zzso zzso zzso with this hypothesis, we find that zzso is required for expansion of the zzso zzso compartment in mice rendered zzso as zzso Thus, zzso controls zzso numbers, in part, by limiting production of the zzso growth factor zzso
