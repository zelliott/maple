Type III zzso zzso exhibits potent zzso activity similar to zzso but in contrast to the ubiquitous expression of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso is restricted to cells of zzso zzso Despite the importance of zzso in zzso zzso zzso the molecular mechanisms responsible for this confined zzso expression remain zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso repression machinery mediates zzso zzso of the unique zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso elevate zzso expression and restore sensitivity to zzso in previously zzso cells, thereby enhancing protection against viral zzso In addition, blocking zzso activity renders zzso cell types susceptible to the zzso activity of zzso revealing the combination of zzso zzso and zzso to be a potential zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the type III zzso response may be zzso harnessed by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso expression zzso
