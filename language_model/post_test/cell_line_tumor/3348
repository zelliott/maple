The biological antagonism between zzso and zzso controls the zzso balance in development and zzso Although altered zzso signaling has been linked to human diseases, including cancer, evidence for a substantial involvement of zzso in human tumors has remained zzso Here, we show that zzso control on zzso signaling is lost in approximately 50% of human zzso zzso due to specific zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso operates as an zzso as its zzso expression in zzso but not in zzso tumor cells zzso zzso Increased zzso signaling is observed in zzso tumors, but reverts to zzso levels after enforced expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso increases zzso signaling in normal breast cells and in zzso breast zzso Finally, growth suppression of zzso but not zzso breast tumors can be achieved by pharmacological zzso of zzso Thus, the zzso biological antagonism is relevant to the zzso of the normal zzso zzso and its zzso contributes to human zzso zzso
