zzso a new synthetic zzso was identified as a selective proliferation inhibitor of human tumor zzso and zzso cell lines than to zzso cells zzso The zzso activity of this zzso was also extensive to peripheral human zzso zzso was found to block tumor cells in the zzso phase of the cell zzso The zzso arrest of zzso cells was zzso and zzso reaching a maximum after zzso treatment while zzso cells reached the maximum value of zzso zzso only after a zzso zzso zzso cells evidenced a high frequency of cells in zzso indicating progression beyond zzso and arrest early in zzso This zzso arrest was associated with abnormal zzso zzso characterized by the formation of a zzso structure, suggesting that the zzso interferes with zzso The results of an in zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that this zzso zzso zzso in a manner similar to zzso
