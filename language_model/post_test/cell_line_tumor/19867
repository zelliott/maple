zzso of zzso with 4 zzso and 5 zzso were tested in 2 zzso cell lines zzso and zzso Many complexes caused stimulation of zzso proliferation zzso zzso in the range of zzso to 25 zzso In the zzso zzso some zzso complexes zzso the zzso zzso zzso in the same range of zzso The zzso and zzso complexes were the most efficient zzso agents zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso cells at 100 zzso The zzso and zzso complexes exerted a similar effect in the zzso zzso On the other hand, all the complexes promoted the zzso of the zzso regulated zzso zzso All together, these results indicate that the stimulation of zzso is not the only factor that plays a role in the zzso effects of zzso derivatives since some compounds were zzso zzso zzso Cell differentiation was evaluated by alkaline zzso specific activity and collagen synthesis in zzso zzso All the complexes inhibited alkaline zzso activity, with zzso complex as the most effective compound zzso zzso 43 zzso The complex with the zzso zzso was the most effective agent to stimulate collagen synthesis zzso zzso and zzso consumption zzso zzso A zzso zzso protein zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso seem to be involved in the stimulation of zzso consumption by zzso zzso In this series, only zzso gathered the characteristics of a good insulin zzso and zzso zzso In addition, this complex was a good promoting agent of zzso zzso zzso whereas it inhibited zzso zzso zzso the complex with zzso was also more toxic for zzso than for zzso zzso These 2 zzso derivatives are good potential zzso zzso All the results suggest that the biological effects of zzso compounds are a complex phenomenon influenced by the zzso the dose, and the nature of the zzso and the zzso
