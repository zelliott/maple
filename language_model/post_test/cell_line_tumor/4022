zzso expression of the zzso family member zzso has been suggested to play a zzso role in cancer zzso Here, we show that zzso the zzso zzso zzso plays a major role in regulation of cell migration, invasion and cancer zzso We identified zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso as a downstream target of zzso that is required for zzso these zzso We show that zzso regulates zzso zzso protein zzso 1 and 2 zzso activity via zzso in both cancer and zzso zzso We further show that zzso zzso zzso cell invasion and is dependent on zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results in increased cell migration and invasion, which can be reverted by reintroducing the zzso zzso alone, but not by other zzso Interestingly, these effects require zzso but not zzso zzso and can be rescued by enforced zzso zzso Moreover, zzso expression is reduced in invasive zzso and reduced zzso expression increases zzso frequency in zzso Taken together, these results suggest an important role for zzso in preventing cancer zzso by zzso of zzso signaling via zzso
