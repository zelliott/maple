Cellular signaling zzso by zzso receptors results in coordinated regulation of cell growth, survival, and zzso zzso zzso zzso has been linked to a variety of human zzso Here, we show that zzso signaling drives the vertical growth phase zzso of primary melanoma toward a more aggressive zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso expression of the zzso zzso domain enables zzso primary melanoma cell lines to zzso in a zzso and growth zzso manner in zzso and to grow more aggressively with zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso also enhances tumor cell survival when cultured as three-dimensional zzso Such effects of zzso signaling are zzso by zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both pathways are activated in melanoma cells following zzso zzso zzso zzso of either the zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso reverses the zzso zzso tumor cell zzso Moreover, the zzso effect of zzso depends on zzso zzso We further showed that zzso zzso increases tumor cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our data show regulation of zzso zzso activities and expression of zzso by the zzso zzso and provide a zzso basis for zzso signaling in the promotion of primary melanoma zzso
