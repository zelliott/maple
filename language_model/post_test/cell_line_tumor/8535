The unfolded protein response zzso is activated in response to zzso stress in the zzso zzso zzso and consists of three distinct signaling zzso Here we explore the potential of targeting two of these arms with new potent zzso zzso designed against zzso and zzso 

We zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was measured by zzso and was used to monitor zzso zzso zzso activity was monitored by zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso tolerance was measured using proliferation and zzso cell survival zzso of cells exposed to mild or severe zzso in the presence of the zzso 

Using zzso experiments we show that zzso is essential for survival of zzso cells while zzso of zzso dramatically decreases the proliferation and survival of zzso during zzso Further, we show that in response to both zzso and other zzso zzso agents both zzso and the zzso inhibitor are selective and potent zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, despite potent zzso of zzso zzso zzso had no effect on cell proliferation or zzso survival of cells exposed to zzso This was in contrast to the zzso of zzso signaling with the zzso zzso which reduced tolerance to zzso and other zzso stress inducing zzso 

Our results demonstrate that zzso but not its zzso activity is important for hypoxic cell zzso The zzso signaling arm is uniquely important for promoting adaptation and survival during zzso zzso stress and should be the focus of future therapeutic zzso
