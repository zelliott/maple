zzso receptors zzso are the largest family of cell surface molecules that play important zzso in a number of biological and pathological processes including zzso Earlier studies have highlighted the importance of zzso signaling via its zzso zzso zzso a zzso in zzso of cell zzso zzso growth, and reversal of transformed zzso in non small cell lung cancer primarily through zzso of the tumor zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso that couple to this important tumor zzso zzso have not been identified, and are of potential therapeutic zzso In this study, by using two independent zzso zzso we identify zzso as a novel downstream zzso of zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso expression is severely zzso both at the zzso zzso levels and protein levels, in many non small cell lung cancer cell zzso Additionally, through zzso zzso and expression of zzso forms zzso of zzso we also establish zzso as a novel regulator of non small cell lung cancer cell proliferation and zzso cell zzso Taken together, our data not only establish the importance of zzso as a critical downstream zzso of the zzso zzso signaling zzso but also as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of non small cell lung zzso
