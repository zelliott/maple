The coordination chemistry of the new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso resulting in two new zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso was zzso by reacting zzso with zzso in a zzso ratio zzso and compound 2, zzso was prepared from zzso and zzso zzso zzso electron zzso resonance zzso and zzso quantum interference device zzso zzso were some of the techniques employed to portray these zzso studies on single zzso of free zzso zzso and zzso provided detailed structural information about compounds 1 and zzso being the first two zzso zzso zzso In addition the zzso activity of the new compounds was studied and compared with free zzso for a number of human tumor zzso To provide more insight on the mode of action of these compounds under biological conditions, additional experiments were accomplished, including studies on the nature of their interactions with calf zzso DNA by zzso zzso and zzso zzso These experiments together with zzso studies indicate zzso interactions between some of these species and the double zzso pointing out the weak nature of the interaction of the compounds with zzso The intrinsic zzso of the free zzso and both copper compounds provided valuable information over the cellular process and therefore, zzso zzso studies were performed using a human zzso cell zzso Studies in zzso using this technique suggest that the action of these molecules seems to occur outside the zzso
