zzso zzso zzso zzso are gaining interest as cancer therapeutic zzso We tested the hypothesis that natural zzso compounds might be zzso to zzso zzso in human prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso acid components of zzso zzso In a zzso system, zzso zzso K zzso and zzso acid zzso convert zzso to the corresponding zzso acid, zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso converts zzso to its corresponding zzso acid, zzso zzso Although zzso zzso analogue of zzso is an excellent zzso for zzso zzso is poorly zzso zzso MSP and zzso resemble the known zzso inhibitor zzso We examined zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells and found that these human prostate cancer cells exhibit zzso zzso zzso In the corresponding zzso zzso the metabolism of zzso was accompanied by the zzso formation of zzso In zzso and zzso prostate cancer cell lines, zzso zzso 3 levels increased within 5 hours, and returned to essentially baseline levels by 24 hours, suggesting a zzso transient induction of zzso zzso In an in zzso zzso activity zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso had no effect at zzso up to zzso zzso whereas MSP and zzso both inhibited zzso zzso We conclude that, in addition to targeting zzso signaling proteins and zzso factors, zzso acid zzso of zzso and zzso can alter zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso These findings provide a potential new paradigm by which naturally occurring zzso might prevent the progression of human prostate zzso
