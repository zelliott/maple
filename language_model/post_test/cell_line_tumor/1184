In this work, we investigated the zzso activity of orally administered zzso human zzso zzso alone and in combination with chemotherapy in zzso zzso zzso inhibited the growth of zzso cell zzso zzso tumors in T zzso zzso mice by zzso when administered at 1,000 zzso zzso zzso by oral zzso twice daily for 8 days zzso zzso zzso Similar activity was observed in zzso zzso zzso mice, where orally administered zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso once zzso halted the growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also used alone and in combination with zzso (5 zzso to treat zzso zzso cell zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso with oral zzso or zzso caused zzso or zzso tumor growth zzso over zzso zzso Mice receiving both therapies showed zzso growth zzso a statistically significant improvement over each drug zzso We then demonstrated that administration of oral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso or zzso mice resulted in zzso significantly increased production of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso systemic zzso cell zzso and zzso circulating zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that oral zzso is an zzso agent active against cancer as a single agent and in combination chemotherapy, exerting its systemic effect through stimulation of zzso and other zzso in the gut zzso zzso has been administered orally to 211 people without a single serious drug-related adverse zzso Thus, zzso shows promise as a safe and zzso novel zzso zzso zzso
