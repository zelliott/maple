To study the effect of tumor zzso gene zzso on proliferation and cell cycle of zzso zzso cell line zzso 

zzso zzso expression zzso of wild type and zzso type of zzso gene were constructed, named as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 2000 was used to zzso the constructed expression zzso into zzso zzso cell line zzso which was zzso protein zzso zzso was used to select the cell clones constantly expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso the cell cycle of zzso zzso by above mentioned zzso expression zzso and zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso zzso representing the level of active zzso was zzso by Western zzso The zzso zzso served as zzso 

The proliferation of zzso constantly expressing zzso protein was obviously inhibited compared with zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso gene and empty zzso and zzso zzso zzso The number of zzso cells zzso with wild type zzso gene at zzso phase, zzso phase and S phase was zzso zzso and zzso zzso Compared with control group zzso with empty zzso the number of zzso phase zzso cells constantly expressing wild zzso protein was significantly higher than that of zzso The number of cells in zzso and S phase was significantly lower than that of zzso However, the number of cells in zzso phase, zzso phase and S phase of zzso zzso with zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso There was no significant difference compared with control zzso Western zzso result showed that the intrinsic level of zzso zzso of zzso constantly expressing wild type zzso protein was zzso and that of zzso zzso with zzso zzso gene was equal to that of zzso 

Wild type zzso gene can inhibit the proliferation of zzso zzso cells at zzso zzso The mechanism is possibly related with intrinsic activity of zzso which is zzso by wild type zzso
