zzso zzso a naturally occurring zzso zzso present in the Chinese medicinal zzso zzso zzso zzso exerted zzso effects on various cultured cancer zzso However, the cellular mechanisms by which it controls the development of the cancer cells are zzso particularly the human zzso cancer zzso zzso In this study, we found that zzso inhibited the zzso cell zzso Cell cycle arrest in S and zzso zzso was also zzso Western zzso analysis showed that zzso of cell cycle regulatory proteins was responsible for the zzso cell cycle zzso Besides, zzso also triggered zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso was found to be associated with the zzso zzso as evidenced by the loss of zzso membrane potential zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and the regulation of zzso family zzso Despite the Western zzso analysis showed that both intrinsic and zzso zzso pathways zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were triggered in the zzso zzso additional analysis also showed that the induction of zzso could be achieved by the zzso zzso Besides, zzso zzso and zzso pathways were found to involve in zzso cell zzso Overall, our findings provided the first evidence that zzso induced cell cycle arrest, and zzso in zzso zzso zzso could be a potential zzso agent in the treatment of zzso cancer zzso
