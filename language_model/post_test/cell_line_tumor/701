Most cancer vaccines induce zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso zzso of tumor cells occurs through zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that one preventive followed by two therapeutic zzso with an attenuated zzso zzso zzso vaccine zzso all zzso and almost the entire primary tumor in the zzso aggressive mouse breast tumor model zzso We provide strong evidence that this is due to the combined result of direct kill by zzso infecting the tumor cells and by zzso responses against zzso zzso We showed by electron zzso that zzso expressing truncated zzso O zzso and zzso acid fragments 311 to zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the control strain zzso zzso tumor cells in zzso and in zzso In zzso data indicate that tumor cell death occurs through zzso of zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso levels, both resulting in the production of high zzso zzso Because both zzso and zzso showed equally strong zzso in zzso we concluded that zzso was crucial and zzso was of less zzso We found strong zzso responses to zzso in the zzso and depletion of zzso T cells in zzso resulted in significant tumor regrowth zzso in zzso mice, indicating that zzso zzso indeed partially contributed to tumor cell kill in zzso This dual mode of action of a zzso vaccine has not been described before and may provide new directions in the development of more effective vaccines against zzso breast zzso
