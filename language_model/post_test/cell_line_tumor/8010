zzso a zzso present in red wines and various human foods, was first reported to exhibit zzso properties based on studies using a mouse skin cancer zzso Our laboratory and others subsequently demonstrated the zzso cancer zzso activity of zzso as evident in its suppression of cell zzso arrest of cell cycle zzso and induction of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanism of action of zzso has not been tested in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, which mimic the transition stages of prostate zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso effects of zzso in the context of zzso of growth suppression and zzso expression as zzso by zzso targeting protein zzso using both control and zzso zzso silenced zzso zzso Exposure to zzso resulted in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso which was accompanied by a reduction in the expression of zzso zzso The suppression of zzso zzso expression was zzso in zzso zzso silenced zzso cells, suggesting that zzso is upstream of and integral to the regulation of zzso zzso To our knowledge, this study is the first to reveal that zzso targeting protein zzso plays a zzso role in zzso changes of zzso zzso which may contribute to the zzso activities zzso by zzso
