This study was designed to obtain the chemical fingerprint and to investigate the effect of zzso zzso on zzso activity and zzso pathways in the human zzso zzso cell line zzso 

The zzso compounds in zzso zzso were investigated by zzso Cell viability with the treatment of zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso acid, zzso and zzso was detected by zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA fragmentation analysis and zzso activity were used to confirm zzso zzso zzso activity was determined using the zzso zzso zzso isolation and zzso were used to analyze the related genes zzso All experiments on treatments with zzso zzso from 0-3 zzso were carried out for 24 zzso 

5 major compounds including zzso acid, zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso C and zzso acid were identified as a plant fingerprint by zzso With the zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso acid reduce cell zzso The zzso features showed DNA fragmentation and increased zzso activity associated with the zzso of zzso but not of zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, treatment of zzso cells led to an zzso of zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1) and zzso zzso expression and to decreased zzso zzso 

This study suggests that zzso zzso zzso the death of zzso cells in zzso through the induction of zzso and inhibited zzso zzso
