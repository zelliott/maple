We report a general zzso transformation approach to zzso zzso magnetic transition metal zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso While the straightforward reduction or zzso process was employed to produce zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso was used as precursor to prepare zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) zzso The transformed zzso zzso retain the hollow structure and zzso nature of the original zzso However, the zzso zzso of cubic zzso zzso and zzso zzso show strong correlation with their zzso The zzso zzso zzso with zzso size, shape, and composition have exhibited unique magnetic zzso Moreover, they have been demonstrated as a highly effective zzso mimic zzso for laboratory zzso or as a universal zzso zzso with zzso zzso for magnetic separation and optical probe of lung cancer cells, suggesting that these zzso magnetic zzso have great potential in zzso and zzso zzso
