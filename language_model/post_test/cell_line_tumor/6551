The zzso gene zzso is required for retinal zzso cell proliferation early in zzso and subsequently for bipolar zzso zzso To clarify the molecular mechanisms employed by zzso we sought to identify its target zzso In a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso site of the zzso gene zzso zzso shift zzso using in zzso translated protein confirmed that zzso binds to zzso but not to the similar zzso sites zzso and zzso Using retinal nuclear zzso we observed interactions between zzso and additional zzso elements including the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso locus control region zzso cone zzso However, zzso zzso zzso revealed that in zzso zzso bound sites upstream of the Rod zzso and zzso zzso protein genes but not zzso or zzso zzso Thus, in a zzso context, zzso associates with a specific subset of elements that it binds with comparable apparent affinity in zzso Our data suggest that zzso may target these motifs to inhibit rod zzso gene expression in bipolar zzso
