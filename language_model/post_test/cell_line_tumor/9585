zzso D zzso is a zzso zzso abundantly by zzso cells with a documented role in tumor zzso The levels of zzso in primary tumors are highly correlated with an increased zzso of zzso Our earlier studies have shown that zzso exerts its effect on cancer cells through its zzso zzso (AP) and involves both zzso and zzso modes of zzso In this study, we analyzed the expression and role of zzso in zzso and its derived cell lines zzso and zzso possessing discrete zzso zzso Our results demonstrated a direct relationship between expression and zzso of zzso to the differential invasive potential of these zzso Also, the cell lines responded to zzso treatment by enhancing their invasive potential, proliferation and induction of zzso of various zzso suggesting that zzso plays a role in zzso through its zzso zzso
