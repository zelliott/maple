The effect of vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso on tumor cell zzso migration, and invasion was zzso It has recently been suggested that zzso signaling through the zzso zzso zzso zzso may play a role in tumor cell survival, invasion, and zzso The purpose of the present study was to determine the expression of zzso and zzso zzso in a panel of gastrointestinal zzso zzso Additionally, we evaluated the effects of zzso zzso signaling on tumor cell zzso migration, and invasion utilizing zzso zzso a zzso zzso Five zzso three zzso and two zzso zzso cell lines were screened for zzso and zzso expression by several zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was cell zzso whereas zzso was not zzso zzso of zzso was detected in the zzso of all cell lines whereas zzso zzso was detected in the zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso cells showed increased migratory activity, but not zzso when zzso with zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso inhibited tumor cell migration and invasion, with no effects on zzso zzso decreased zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso of downstream zzso zzso and zzso expression was detected in all the gastrointestinal zzso cells zzso Although zzso of the zzso zzso did not affect cell zzso our data indicate that this zzso seems to play a role in tumor cell migration and invasion in these cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso may represent a clinically relevant treatment option for gastrointestinal zzso
