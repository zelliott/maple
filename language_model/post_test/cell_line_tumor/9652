Cell surface expression of zzso class I molecules by tumor cells is zzso in the interplay between tumor cells and the immune zzso Nevertheless, the mechanisms which regulate zzso expression on tumor cells are not zzso We previously showed that immune innate cells from the zzso can regulate zzso expression on zzso tumor zzso Here, using the zzso model of zzso melanoma, we demonstrate that the zzso status of tumor cells in zzso is regulated by the zzso In subcutaneous zzso induction of zzso molecules on tumor cells is zzso to the recruitment of zzso and relies on an zzso zzso zzso T and zzso cells are essential to this zzso A small proportion of zzso zzso cells and zzso T cells were found to produce zzso suggesting a possible direct participation to the zzso increase on the tumor cells upon tumor cell zzso zzso of zzso T cells increases the tumor growth rate, confirming their zzso role in our zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that in zzso zzso and zzso T cells play a dual role during the early growth of zzso tumor zzso In addition to controlling the growth of tumor cells, they contribute to zzso the zzso profile of residual tumor zzso
