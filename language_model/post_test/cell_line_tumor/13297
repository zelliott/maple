In the present study, in order to determine whether the zzso gene plays a role in the zzso of human zzso zzso the zzso expression levels of zzso were examined in zzso of human zzso zzso zzso and corresponding adjacent normal zzso zzso by quantitative real-time zzso zzso The zzso zzso expression zzso was zzso into the human colon zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso The zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined by zzso whereas the protein levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were examined by western zzso zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso were employed to assess cell zzso zzso and the cell zzso As shown by zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso in zzso of the tumor zzso Cell proliferation was inhibited by zzso in the zzso cells and by zzso in the zzso cells, compared to the corresponding control zzso Furthermore, the percentages of zzso cells were zzso and zzso in the zzso and zzso cells, whereas the percentages of zzso phase cells in the two cell lines were zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the zzso expression of zzso and zzso was zzso in the zzso and zzso cells, whereas that of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso the protein expression of zzso and zzso was zzso whereas that of zzso and zzso was zzso Based on these results, we can conclude that zzso plays an essential role in the zzso of human zzso zzso Moreover, our data suggest that zzso promotes zzso through the regulation of the zzso signaling zzso and zzso zzso
