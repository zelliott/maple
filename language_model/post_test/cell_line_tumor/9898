The functional diversity of the tumor zzso protein zzso is mainly regulated by protein zzso In this study, we describe a new interaction with the zzso zzso zzso zzso 18 zzso The interaction reduced the zzso DNA binding of zzso in zzso whereas the zzso of the interaction increased zzso gene activity in zzso The active site of the folding helper zzso zzso was directly involved in zzso The zzso region zzso acids zzso of zzso was most likely responsible for the observed binding because a synthetic zzso zzso zzso acids zzso of zzso inhibited this interaction, and a zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso at position 72 zzso zzso with zzso more effectively than the corresponding zzso zzso zzso of the zzso interaction induced an zzso of cells in the zzso phase of the cell cycle, which was more pronounced when zzso was expressed compared with zzso in an otherwise zzso cellular zzso Moreover, zzso zzso was elevated in zzso knockout cells, suggesting an zzso potential of zzso zzso zzso in zzso data hint to a possible clinical relevance of the zzso interaction zzso
