zzso of DNA molecules into zzso cells with electric zzso which is so-called zzso is a powerful and widely used method that can be directly applied to gene zzso However, very little is known about the basic mechanisms of DNA transfer and cell response to the electric zzso We developed a zzso chip with zzso zzso to investigate the mechanism of zzso as a first step of DNA transfer and to introduce the benefits of zzso into the genetic zzso The zzso chip has a zzso with a height of 20 zzso and a length of 2 zzso zzso to the transparency of zzso we could in zzso observe the zzso process of zzso zzso zzso into zzso cells, which shows promise in zzso of gene delivery in living zzso We also noticed the geometric effect on the degree of zzso in zzso with diverse channel zzso This experimental result shows that the geometry can be another zzso to be considered for the zzso when it is performed in zzso with an exponential zzso pulse zzso Cell zzso is possible within the zzso zzso and we also successfully zzso zzso cells with enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso which demonstrates the feasibility of the zzso chip in genetic zzso
