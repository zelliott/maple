Due to zzso in patient response to cancer therapy, there is a growing interest in monitoring patient progress during zzso zzso cell death is one early marker of tumor response to zzso Using known zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso to vary the exchange regime, zzso and zzso relaxation data for acute zzso leukemia zzso cell samples were obtained and then analyzed using a zzso model of relaxation with zzso zzso cells treated with zzso to induce zzso exhibited a statistically significant zzso zzso zzso decrease in zzso zzso relaxation time, zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso a decrease zzso zzso zzso in the zzso water zzso zzso from zzso to zzso and a statistically significant increase zzso zzso zzso in zzso water exchange rate, zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso The changes in MR parameters correlated with quantitative zzso such as cellular zzso area and average nuclear area zzso The results of this study emphasize the importance of accounting for water exchange in dynamic zzso zzso zzso studies, particularly those that examine tumor response to therapies in which zzso changes zzso
