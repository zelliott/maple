zzso zzso a member of the zzso gene family, is highly expressed in high-grade zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso with a higher risk of local zzso zzso is, therefore, a potential zzso for zzso with a poor zzso zzso zzso is characterized by a high proliferation rate and crowded cells, consequently, lose contact with the zzso zzso The aim of this study was, therefore, to zzso the involvement of zzso signals in the regulation of zzso zzso expression was evaluated by Western zzso flow zzso and zzso and using breast zzso zzso databases available from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso was zzso in zzso cells using short hairpin zzso We found a significant negative correlation between the expression of zzso and zzso and a positive correlation between zzso and zzso in normal and zzso zzso zzso In a cluster analysis of 34 zzso molecules and 20 zzso zzso we showed that zzso libraries expressing the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, the expression of all the three proteins correlated strongly to the zzso zzso We confirmed the negative correlation between zzso and zzso when normal and breast cancer cells were cultured in suspension and on zzso zzso The zzso of zzso by short hairpin zzso in zzso cells led to the induction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and we demonstrated that these zzso were not zzso zzso By blocking the zzso C zzso zzso in these cells, we showed that the induction of zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso is an zzso zzso target of the zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells may contribute both to the high expression of zzso seen in some high-grade zzso tumors and to the induction of zzso
