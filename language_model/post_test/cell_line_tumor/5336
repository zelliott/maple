zzso gene encodes a protein that belongs to the zzso zzso transfer proteins involved in zzso transport and metabolism of zzso It has been previously documented that zzso has a zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso and several zzso cell lines with highest levels in both zzso zzso and zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso To understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate the expression of the human zzso zzso we have cloned and characterized the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso of several zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso cells indicated that the zzso region contains the gene minimal zzso In addition, sequence analysis of a zzso gene zzso revealed the presence of a zzso promoter as well as multiple regulatory zzso including one regulatory element corresponding to the zzso factor 4 zzso binding zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso a component of zzso zzso increased both zzso zzso and protein expression as well as its promoter zzso zzso experiments in zzso cell line revealed that the zzso promoter is activated by zzso zzso factor and by its zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of the zzso site located zzso relative to the zzso start site markedly diminished zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso and zzso are bound in zzso to the zzso gene promoter in zzso cells treated with zzso zzso zzso these studies show that zzso and zzso activate the human zzso gene interacting with its promoter region through zzso zzso
