zzso was initially identified as a novel zzso and has recently been found to be a zzso gene for a familial form of Parkinson's disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at position 106 zzso in zzso was found to be oxidized zzso under zzso zzso In the present study, we developed specific zzso against zzso zzso using zzso particles displaying the surface zzso zzso protein as the zzso zzso Western zzso analysis combined with two-dimensional gel zzso revealed that these zzso specifically recognized oxidized zzso Furthermore, we developed a competitive zzso zzso zzso zzso for detecting oxidized zzso and measured blood levels of oxidized zzso in zzso patients zzso It was observed that the levels of oxidized zzso in zzso of zzso zzso patients were markedly higher without overlap than those of zzso zzso patients and healthy zzso No significant difference was observed in zzso levels between zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results suggest the zzso modification of zzso in zzso patients and the potential application of the zzso for diagnosis of zzso at zzso
