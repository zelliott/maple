zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso are effective in treating patients with zzso zzso However, most responses are partial and short-lived, and many patients fail to respond at zzso We found that suppression of zzso activity in response to zzso or zzso zzso as measured by decreased zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso effectively predicted induction of cell death by the inhibitor in zzso melanoma cell zzso In resistant zzso zzso activity was maintained after treatment with zzso or zzso zzso in some cases despite robust suppression of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso In in zzso mouse models, suppression of zzso after zzso zzso was necessary for induction of zzso and tumor zzso Finally, in paired zzso obtained from patients with zzso melanoma before treatment and after initiation of zzso inhibitor therapy, zzso suppression predicted significantly improved zzso zzso Such a change in zzso could be readily monitored in real time by serial zzso aspiration zzso making zzso of zzso a valuable zzso to guide treatment in zzso zzso
