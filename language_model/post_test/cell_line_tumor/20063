Recent studies have suggested that cancer cells behave as zzso zzso by inducing zzso stress in adjacent normal zzso More specifically, zzso zzso in cancer cells lead to zzso production and the zzso of hydrogen zzso zzso zzso stress in zzso zzso then zzso their zzso conversion into zzso zzso Such zzso stress drives the onset of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso resulting in the local production of zzso zzso fuels (such as zzso zzso bodies, and zzso These recycled nutrients are then transferred to cancer cells, where they are efficiently burned via zzso zzso metabolism zzso We have termed this new zzso mechanism zzso zzso zzso to reflect that the production and consumption of nutrients zzso and other zzso is highly zzso Thus, zzso zzso are produced by the tumor zzso Here, we used a genetic approach to zzso test this zzso zzso First, we generated zzso zzso which were genetically zzso towards zzso zzso zzso zzso towards zzso metabolism was achieved by the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results in extensive zzso zzso driving zzso zzso Our results directly show that zzso undergo zzso stress, with increased zzso production, and the onset of zzso and zzso both zzso zzso zzso zzso stress zzso zzso via zzso zzso also providing a link with zzso As a consequence zzso showed zzso zzso depletion and the zzso zzso of zzso a critical zzso zzso also showed signs of zzso zzso with the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso promoted early tumor growth (up to zzso despite a zzso overall reduction in zzso Thus, zzso metabolism in zzso zzso may be a critical event during tumor zzso allowing accelerated tumor growth, especially prior to the onset of zzso
