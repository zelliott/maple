zzso zzso zzso zzso is a fatal disease that shows minimal response to zzso zzso changes involved in the progression of zzso concern genes that zzso proteins related to signal zzso zzso This fact reveals the importance in identifying the role and the relations between multiple signaling zzso in zzso One of the major factors that zzso signaling events is zzso scaffold proteins that function by binding several proteins zzso inducing their proximity and influencing the outcome of zzso A particular group among them, containing multiple zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso that can bind proteins containing zzso zzso was associated to different aspects of cancer cell zzso In this work, using a zzso analysis, we have shown that 13 multiple zzso domain containing scaffold proteins are expressed in zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso approach, we have identified proteins that interact with these zzso zzso Among them we have found several molecules that zzso cell proliferation and survival zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso and membrane dynamics zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that interactions zzso by zzso zzso proteins could lead to the formation of dynamic protein complexes that function in pancreatic cancer cell zzso The identification of such protein complexes is of paramount importance in deciphering pancreatic cancer biology and designing novel therapeutic zzso
