High intensity zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso zzso laser zzso may, via zzso zzso cause zzso cell death at zzso that otherwise are zzso We study the efficacy of inducing zzso death of cancer cells by ultraviolet zzso visible zzso and near infrared zzso zzso laser zzso 

Human zzso zzso cervical cancer cells are zzso by zzso laser zzso at 800 zzso zzso 400 zzso zzso zzso and 200 zzso The zzso death is assessed by colony forming zzso The contribution from zzso processes is evaluated by comparing the cell reproduction subsequent to zzso by zzso zzso zzso and focused zzso zzso zzso laser beams with identical zzso 

zzso zzso zzso are capable of arresting cell reproduction at all the tested zzso zzso at zzso zzso is far more efficient than the other zzso both in terms of the zzso and the absorbed dose needed to induce zzso cell zzso The zzso 800 zzso beam is unable to induce zzso cell death even at a zzso of 230 zzso zzso zzso However, focused 800 zzso zzso with much higher zzso but lower zzso efficiently arrest cell zzso thus highlighting the dramatic effect of zzso zzso At the zzso used in the present work focusing the 400 zzso beam improves its efficacy by an order of zzso whereas focusing the zzso zzso beam does not improve its zzso 

zzso zzso at zzso zzso 400 and 800 zzso induce zzso cell death if the intensity is sufficiently zzso zzso processes can improve the efficacy substantially and even result in zzso cell death at zzso where zzso processes are zzso
