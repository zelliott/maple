zzso developed for fusion transcript detection in zzso zzso data, employs multiple steps of false positive filtering to nominate fusion transcripts with near zzso zzso zzso features include: zzso identification of multiple fusion zzso from two gene zzso zzso prediction of zzso zzso zzso identification of zzso fusion zzso zzso generation of a zzso fusion spanning sequence for zzso zzso and zzso prediction of the protein zzso including frame shift and zzso acid zzso We applied zzso to identify 50 fusion candidates in 22 breast cancer and 9 zzso cell zzso Five additional fusion candidates with two zzso were zzso In all, 30 of 55 fusion candidates had zzso protein zzso No fusion transcripts were detected in zzso zzso Consideration of the possible functions of a subset of predicted fusion proteins suggests several potentially important functions in zzso including a possible new mechanism for zzso of zzso in a zzso cell zzso The source code of zzso is provided in two zzso one configured to run on the Sun zzso zzso for zzso and the other zzso to run on a single zzso zzso zzso in zzso are available for download from our web zzso zzso
