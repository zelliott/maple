zzso zzso is a relatively common zzso soft tissue zzso characterized by a zzso zzso resulting in a zzso fusion gene playing a pivotal role in its zzso Treatment options in patients with zzso or zzso zzso zzso are relatively poor though being developed and new hope is zzso 

Using zzso profiling and subsequent zzso analysis in two cell lines and four primary cultures of zzso zzso all of which demonstrated a zzso fusion gene including one new fusion type, we aimed at identifying new molecular targets for systemic zzso zzso zzso by activated zzso was verified by Western zzso and cell viability was measured before and after treatment of the zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso We found zzso associated with the zzso nuclear zzso and zzso pathways to be the most active in zzso zzso zzso of zzso by the small zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso showed only a mild effect on cell viability of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of the nuclear zzso pathway, which is regulated by the zzso fusion product, in zzso zzso cells using zzso zzso 2 inhibitor zzso zzso showed a significant decrease in cell zzso decreased zzso of nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso 3 zzso zzso Combination of zzso and zzso showed an enhanced zzso 

zzso associated with zzso of the zzso nuclear zzso and the zzso pathways are the most active in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso of nuclear zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso 2 using zzso of which the effect is enhanced by zzso zzso using zzso offers new potential therapeutic strategies for zzso zzso patients with advanced zzso
