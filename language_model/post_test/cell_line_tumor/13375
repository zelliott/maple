We report a generalized methodology for the zzso production of chemically modified functional zzso zzso during in zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso The efficiency of incorporation of zzso in the transcripts by the wild type zzso zzso zzso dramatically increases in the presence of zzso zzso resulting in a high-yield production of chemically modified zzso zzso zzso with zzso that are resistant to zzso from human blood zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso mixture can be used for functional ex zzso pilot zzso
