Secondary zzso is a frequent complication of breast cancer associated with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation following breast cancer zzso The potential contribution of genetic zzso to risk of developing secondary zzso following surgical zzso radiation, and other tissue insults has not been zzso 

To determine whether women with breast cancer and secondary zzso had zzso in candidate zzso zzso we undertook a zzso study of 188 women diagnosed with breast cancer recruited from the University of Pittsburgh Breast Cancer Program zzso between 2000 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 47 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso for zzso zzso analysis and in zzso functional zzso were used to confirm significance of novel zzso 

zzso zzso were identified in individuals having secondary zzso following breast cancer treatment but not in breast cancer controls or normal women without breast zzso These novel zzso are dysfunctional as assessed through in zzso zzso and zzso analysis and provide evidence that altered gap junction function leads to zzso 

Our findings challenge the view that secondary zzso is solely due to mechanical trauma and support the hypothesis that genetic zzso is an important risk factor for secondary zzso A zzso recognition of genetic risk zzso raises the potential for early detection and intervention for a high-risk group and zzso allows the possibility of altering surgical approach and/or zzso and radiation therapy, or direct medical treatment of secondary zzso with novel zzso zzso
