Recent applications of scanning zzso zzso zzso to studies of single biological cells are zzso This scanning probe microscopic technique allows the imaging of an individual cell on the basis of not only its surface topography but also such cellular activities as photosynthesis, zzso electron transfer, single zzso zzso and membrane zzso The operational principles of zzso are also introduced in the context of these biological zzso Recent progress in techniques for high-resolution zzso imaging are also zzso Future directions, such as single-channel detection by zzso high-resolution imaging with zzso zzso and combined zzso techniques for zzso imaging are also zzso
