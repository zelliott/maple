To investigate the zzso effect on zzso gene by zzso short hairpin zzso zzso downstream regulation of expression of zzso and invasion of human breast cancer zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was constructed and zzso into human breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso Fluorescence zzso was used to evaluate the efficacy of zzso The zzso expression of zzso and zzso gene were determined by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso the protein expression of zzso and zzso were determined by zzso and western zzso The invasion ability was evaluated by zzso chamber invasive zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was constructed and zzso into zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso After the zzso zzso zzso was suppressed in both cell lines zzso and zzso The expression of zzso protein became positive in zzso zzso cell, and the expression of zzso zzso were zzso The invasion ability was decreased zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso cells failed to show significant difference in the expression of zzso and zzso without change of the invasion ability zzso zzso zzso 

zzso interference can effectively suppress the expression of zzso in human breast cancer zzso An induction of zzso protein and suppression of zzso may be related to the decrease of tumor cell invasive zzso zzso interference involving zzso gene may provide an effective zzso gene zzso
