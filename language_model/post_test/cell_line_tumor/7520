The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between proliferation zzso and the production of zzso oxygen species zzso induced by zzso A zzso Cell viability was evaluated using zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso level was assessed using the 2, zzso zzso zzso probe and zzso zzso probe zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso human zzso cancer zzso proliferation in a zzso manner, with an zzso value of approximately 55 zzso The zzso zzso production is inhibited by the zzso of zzso and free radical scavenger zzso zzso on the contrary, the proliferation rate and zzso production increase when treated by the combination of zzso and zzso zzso The ratio of reduced zzso zzso to oxidized zzso zzso decreases in a zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso proliferation by increasing zzso zzso levels resulted in an zzso stress status in zzso zzso
