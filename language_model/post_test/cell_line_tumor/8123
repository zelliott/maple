zzso molecules represent a novel class of zzso agents for zzso zzso zzso Fusion of the zzso molecules with an zzso domain zzso enables modification of the blood zzso of the zzso molecules and reduction of the zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso fusion protein has earlier demonstrated promising results in treatment of zzso zzso in zzso The use of the in zzso generator zzso as a label for zzso zzso molecules would create zzso for efficient treatment of both zzso zzso to conversion and zzso electrons of zzso and bulky zzso zzso to zzso beta particles from the daughter zzso zzso The goal of this study was to investigate if different zzso influence the zzso of zzso and to find an optimal zzso for attachment of zzso to the zzso zzso fusion zzso 

zzso derivatives of zzso and zzso were coupled to zzso The cellular processing of both zzso was studied in zzso The influence of zzso on the zzso was investigated in mice using double isotope zzso and zzso zzso 

The apparent affinity of zzso and zzso to the zzso domain of zzso was similar, zzso and zzso zzso zzso It was found that both zzso were zzso by zzso zzso The use of zzso provided better cellular retention of the zzso better zzso zzso of zzso and better zzso to organ dose ratios than zzso 

zzso is more suitable for zzso zzso of zzso zzso fusion proteins for zzso zzso
