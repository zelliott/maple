The zzso Box zzso zzso zzso factor, which regulates the expression of genes essential for cell proliferation and zzso is implicated in zzso and tumor zzso zzso has attracted much attention as a potential target for the prevention and/or therapeutic intervention in human zzso 

The levels of zzso expression in clinical tissue specimens and cell lines of human zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso of zzso expression was performed by small interfering zzso in zzso zzso An zzso zzso (named zzso was constructed to express a short hairpin zzso specific to zzso The efficacy of zzso for tumor gene therapy in zzso cells and an in zzso zzso zzso model was zzso 

A strong expression of zzso was observed in clinical tissue specimens and cell lines of human zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso specific small interfering zzso diminished the zzso cell zzso The infection of zzso in zzso cells resulted in the zzso of zzso zzso and protein levels, correlated with the reduction of proliferation and zzso growth of the cancer zzso The growth of zzso tumors was significantly suppressed when zzso mice were injected with zzso in the zzso 

Together, our results suggest that zzso is a potential therapeutic target for zzso and zzso may be an additional gene therapeutic intervention to be evaluated in future treatment strategies for patients with zzso
