zzso zzso are highly resistant to current therapeutic approaches due to genetic zzso rendering them resistant to cell zzso zzso a ubiquitous and zzso active zzso zzso frequently elevated in tumors, contributes to enhanced cell proliferation and resistance to zzso zzso of zzso expression or treatment with zzso of zzso affected survival or induced zzso in various cancer zzso Here we compared zzso effects of well-known and new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and also structurally similar to above compounds zzso zzso and its derivatives zzso on cultured zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were more effective than zzso in inducing growth arrest and cell death in zzso zzso zzso and zzso strongly induced zzso death involving zzso 3 and 7 zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso strongly zzso the expression of zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso modifications of zzso largely affected its zzso exchange of zzso to zzso or zzso on the zzso ring and inclusion of the bulky zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso diminished zzso activity, while zzso with short zzso groups or an zzso group had opposite zzso Interestingly, zzso at moderate dose did not affect viability of zzso zzso suggesting some specificity toward tumor cells in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso associated with zzso cascade zzso in human zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso and zzso zzso The reported data demonstrate that suitably modified zzso molecules exhibit a significant zzso potential towards zzso zzso zzso
