In this study, the zzso activity of the zzso zzso and derivatives extracted from zzso zzso zzso and their effect on zzso and cell cycle distribution in the human gastric cancer cell line zzso were zzso 

The zzso activity of the zzso zzso and derivatives was evaluated by using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso - 2, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used for a positive zzso 

Six new zzso zzso and derivatives were extracted from the root of zzso zzso zzso the zzso cell line to the extract indicated that zzso zzso derivatives could initiate growth zzso and induce zzso in these tumor zzso The zzso rates as measured from zzso and zzso zzso were significantly increased and are comparable to those of the common zzso agent zzso In addition, the zzso zzso extract effectively inhibited the proliferation of zzso cells by interfering with the progression of the cells through the zzso phase of the cell zzso 

The current study indicates that zzso zzso might be a promising zzso and zzso agent for treating various forms of cancer by causing zzso and proliferation zzso
