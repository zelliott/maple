The development of zzso cancer, unlike that of most human tumors, is rarely dependent upon the mutually exclusive loss of RB and zzso cell cycle zzso zzso zzso cancer cell lines are, however, insensitive to the zzso effects of zzso expressed zzso zzso which suggests that they harbor as yet unidentified defects that compromise cell cycle regulation in late zzso In the current study, we used Western zzso to analyze zzso E protein expression in a panel of normal and tumor zzso zzso and zzso cancer cell lines (including the zzso zzso zzso cancer cell line, zzso Both the zzso cell line and zzso of zzso zzso tumors showed zzso elevated levels of the full-length zzso E protein zzso in addition to several low molecular weight zzso zzso of zzso zzso Using small interference zzso zzso we have inhibited the synthesis of zzso zzso protein by approximately zzso and eliminated the zzso zzso in zzso zzso cancer zzso Associated with the zzso of zzso E zzso we observed both a marked shift in RB protein expression to the active, zzso state and barely zzso expression of zzso A (which is usually expressed upon entry into zzso zzso with the protein expression data, cell cycle distribution analysis indicated that the zzso cells had undergone a marked zzso in zzso phase of the cell zzso These data indicate the therapeutic potential of targeted zzso interference in the treatment of zzso cancer patients whose tumors zzso zzso E zzso
