zzso cell zzso protein zzso an zzso member of zzso family, has been reported to be correlated with tumor zzso The purpose of this study was to establish the zzso value of zzso expression in human gastric zzso 

Western zzso zzso was performed to detect the expression of zzso protein in human gastric cancer cell lines and zzso while zzso expression in zzso gastric cancer tissue samples was zzso by zzso 

The level of zzso protein expression in gastric cancer cell lines was significantly higher than that in gastric zzso zzso cell zzso Moreover, the expression level of zzso protein was significantly higher in gastric cancer zzso than corresponding zzso zzso zzso was correlated with T zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clinical stage zzso zzso zzso and zzso invasion zzso zzso zzso Patients with high zzso expression showed poorer zzso overall survival than patients with low zzso expression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Further zzso and zzso analysis suggested that high zzso expression was an independent zzso marker for the zzso 

zzso is highly zzso in gastric cancer and high zzso expression is correlated with a poor prognosis in gastric cancer zzso Thus, zzso can be zzso as an independent zzso zzso
