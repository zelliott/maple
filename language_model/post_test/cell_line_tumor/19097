We developed new zzso zzso zzso for an zzso zzso zzso These zzso consist of an zzso zzso main linkage and a zzso zzso which was a zzso zzso or zzso group or a hydrogen zzso The primary zzso was protected with a zzso zzso zzso The chemical properties of zzso containing these zzso were zzso The zzso group of these zzso could be quite rapidly removed from the zzso under very mild zzso conditions, which are not strong enough for the zzso of a conventional zzso zzso This significant feature enabled the zzso zzso to be zzso zzso with a reverse phase zzso Furthermore, the zzso efficiently reacted to active zzso as compared with other zzso We also found that the zzso values of the zzso were lower than that of the zzso zzso All of the experimental results showed that these chemical properties are closely related to their zzso We report here the chemical properties and the availability of the new zzso zzso zzso
