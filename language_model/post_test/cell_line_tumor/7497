zzso zzso culture systems can mimic certain aspects of the cellular zzso found in zzso but generation, analysis and imaging of current model systems for zzso cellular zzso and zzso remain zzso This work demonstrates a zzso culture zzso zzso uses stacked sheets of zzso mesh to support cells embedded in gels to form zzso zzso the stacked sheets can be zzso by peeling the sheets apart to analyze cultured zzso the zzso The mesh sheets leave openings large enough for light to pass through with minimal zzso and thus allowing multiple options for zzso using straightforward analysis by optical light zzso zzso by high-resolution analysis with zzso zzso or zzso with a zzso gel zzso The sheets can be patterned into separate zones with zzso zzso zzso in order to conduct multiple experiments in zzso the zzso decal films also block lateral diffusion of oxygen zzso zzso zzso the generation and analysis of zzso culture without compromising zzso and quality of the data zzso it is especially useful in experiments that require control of oxygen levels, and isolation of adjacent zzso in a zzso zzso
