zzso zzso related cell zzso zzso zzso 6 is zzso in different types of cancer zzso In addition, it has also been implicated in some infectious zzso zzso this zzso by an zzso might have applications in diverse tumor zzso Single domain zzso zzso is becoming very useful format in zzso engineering as potential tools for treating acute and chronic disease conditions such as cancer for both diagnostic as well as therapeutic zzso Generally, zzso with good affinity are isolated from an immune zzso Discovery of a new target zzso would require a new zzso with zzso zzso which is not always zzso In this study, we have isolated, by zzso display, an zzso against zzso with an affinity of 5 zzso from a zzso zzso with cancer zzso The zzso has good zzso properties, and it binds to the cells expressing the target zzso Furthermore, it reduces cancer cells proliferation in zzso and shows an excellent tumor targeting in zzso This zzso could be useful in diagnosis as well as therapy of zzso expressing zzso Finally, we zzso it would be feasible to isolate good zzso against other interesting tumor associated zzso from this zzso zzso this zzso method could be a general strategy for zzso zzso against any surface zzso without zzso the animal with the zzso of interest each zzso
