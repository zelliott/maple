It is now well established that tumor cell invasion through tissue is strongly regulated by the zzso and mechanical properties of the zzso zzso zzso However, it remains unclear how these physical zzso zzso are jointly processed with zzso zzso to drive zzso In this study, we address this open question by combining a zzso zzso channel zzso platform that enables independent control of zzso zzso and confinement with an zzso breast tumor progression series in which the zzso zzso and zzso are zzso independently or in zzso We find that increasing channel confinement and zzso zzso both promote cell migration to a similar degree when other parameters are kept zzso In contrast, zzso zzso slows migration speed, and does so in a fashion that dwarfs effects of zzso confinement and zzso We also find that zzso zzso dramatically enhances cell zzso when combined with zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso cues and zzso parameters promote cell invasion in an zzso zzso zzso analysis of cells inside the zzso platform reveals that the rapid cell migration induced by narrow channels and zzso zzso are both accompanied by increased cell zzso zzso of this polarization occurs by pharmacological zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by reducing cell polarization and slowing zzso By systematically measuring migration speed as a function of zzso zzso and zzso we also zzso for the first time the sensitivity of migration speed to zzso properties and transforming zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso and zzso zzso properties can zzso interact to drive invasive migration, and that both zzso may act through common molecular mechanisms to enhance migration zzso
