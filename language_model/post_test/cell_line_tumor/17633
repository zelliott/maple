zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso in cell locomotion and tissue zzso zzso to the plasma membrane and zzso into the transient storage compartment both regulate the cell surface presentation of zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso lacking the zzso tail is recruited to the zzso zzso raft membrane zzso in breast zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso is not permanently associated with zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso correlated with poor zzso and the persistent presentation of zzso at the cell zzso The tail zzso efficiently functioned in inducing the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and contraction of three-dimensional collagen zzso zzso of the tail zzso to zzso raft zzso however, the zzso of the plasma zzso zzso These events limited the contribution of the tail zzso to cell locomotion and zzso zzso It is conceivable that the tail zzso sequence plays a crucial role in the zzso of zzso across the cell and contributes to coordinated cellular zzso It is tempting to zzso that the mechanisms involved in trafficking of zzso to zzso zzso zzso may be targeted in a clinically advantageous zzso
