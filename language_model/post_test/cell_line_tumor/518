The zzso factor nuclear zzso zzso has been linked to the cell growth, zzso and cell cycle zzso zzso blockade zzso zzso of cancer zzso zzso zzso is suggested as a potential therapeutic target for zzso Here, we have evaluated the zzso potential of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In a large-scale screening test, we found that zzso was a novel zzso zzso The global zzso profiling of zzso in zzso cells was therefore zzso by zzso tools in this zzso 

zzso suppressed zzso zzso activity in zzso cells through the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso also inhibited induced zzso activities in lung and breast cancer cell zzso zzso genes zzso with zzso or its downstream genes by network zzso zzso affected the expression levels of genes involved in cell cycle or zzso suggesting that zzso exhibited zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso the expressions of zzso zzso genes involved in phase II drug zzso suggesting that zzso might interfere with drug metabolism by slowing down the zzso of zzso 

This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of zzso by zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso is a novel zzso inhibitor with zzso zzso
