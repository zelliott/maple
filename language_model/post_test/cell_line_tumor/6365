Though clinical trials demonstrated effectiveness of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso therapies for some solid zzso there are rather few experimental data about cellular effects of zzso on zzso cells and zzso associated zzso zzso Recent reports demonstrate resistance mechanisms and secondary zzso after a transient zzso of zzso zzso Therefore we investigated the influence of zzso on human zzso cells and human brain derived as well as zzso derived zzso cells zzso on the role of zzso and zzso as potential alternative zzso zzso zzso treatment showed no influence on proliferation after short term exposure zzso zzso but slowed down zzso cell proliferation by zzso after 14 days zzso There was no significant induction of zzso after short or long term zzso zzso formation capabilities were significantly impaired by zzso with a continuing effect after 14 days of treatment even after omitting the zzso zzso and zzso had no effect on zzso cells in zzso or short term treatment zzso However, cells developed responsiveness to these factors in terms of increased proliferation and tube formation after 14 days zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso induced expression of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Treatment with zzso may induce zzso in human brain and zzso zzso cells leading to escape mechanisms from zzso zzso zzso and zzso thus might act as alternative zzso factors during zzso zzso
