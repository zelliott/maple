We evaluated the effect of zzso zzso on cancer and primary cell lines in zzso and in zzso in laboratory zzso zzso is an innovative material with interesting zzso properties that has possible pharmacological and prosthetic zzso Given that precautions need to be taken where carbon zzso are injected into human body for drug delivery, as contrast zzso entities for zzso or as the material of a new zzso generation, we assessed the toxicity of zzso carbon zzso zzso has structural resemblance to zzso whose toxicity has been linked to zzso 

zzso decreased proliferation of human zzso breast and zzso cancer cell lines in zzso However, zzso had no effect on the proliferation and viability of normal human zzso smooth muscle cells and human zzso zzso in zzso in zzso zzso induced a moderate inflammatory reaction but had no zzso zzso After zzso zzso the animals showed an inflammatory reaction followed 2 weeks later by a zzso reaction with the organization and zzso of the zzso 

These results show a low toxicity of zzso both in zzso and in zzso
