Breast cancer zzso to bone where it stimulates formation of zzso zzso zzso constitute an important treatment for zzso zzso The goal of this study was to assess the effects of soluble factors produced by breast cancer cells on zzso survival and responsiveness to zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso cell line zzso or from primary mouse bone zzso were cultured for zzso h zzso with zzso zzso media zzso from human zzso or mouse zzso zzso breast zzso cells, or with a zzso factor zzso zzso factors maintained zzso survival at the levels comparable to those observed with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso induced zzso zzso in zzso and, to a smaller extent, in zzso cultures, resulting in a significant decrease in zzso number and size, induction of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso In the presence of zzso factors, zzso were ineffective in inducing zzso zzso resulting in only modest decrease in zzso numbers and not in zzso zzso CM prevented zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso attenuated the effect of zzso CM by zzso but could not fully restore zzso responsiveness to zzso zzso of zzso C zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso and prevented zzso action of zzso factors on zzso Our data suggest that factors produced by the zzso breast cancer cells promote zzso survival and block the zzso effect of zzso in zzso and zzso manner, potentially compromising zzso effectiveness in the bone zzso zzso
