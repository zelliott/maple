The advent of zzso has provided a tool for the zzso identification and determination of a large series of proteins using two-dimensional gel zzso with subsequent mass zzso zzso We tried an approach to zzso the high abundance zzso zzso of a zzso cell zzso zzso zzso were grown in zzso zzso in the presence of zzso harvested and the 100,000 zzso g zzso of the zzso was applied on two-dimensional gel zzso with subsequent zzso zzso of protein spots and zzso zzso laser zzso mass zzso analysis of resulting peptides using specific zzso A series of 57 zzso zzso were identified including zzso of zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso zzso We are presenting a tool for the analysis of zzso systems including zzso deficiencies at the protein level with the advantage of zzso identification of proteins and thus zzso zzso activity zzso
