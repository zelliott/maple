zzso activity is implicated in cell invasion, tumor zzso and zzso Recently, we have reported that zzso stimulates tissue factor zzso expression in zzso and cancer cells, resulting in zzso of zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso regulates other zzso zzso and examined the expression and zzso of tissue factor zzso inhibitor zzso following zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso human zzso vein zzso cells zzso and human zzso cell lines were incubated with zzso or were zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso expression and zzso were zzso zzso zzso or zzso addition zzso zzso expression by 2-3 zzso zzso zzso in the cell culture medium exceeded in magnitude the observed induction of zzso gene zzso reaching zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was evident already 60 zzso following zzso addition, prior to zzso protein zzso and correlated with increased zzso zzso This effect was found to be independent of zzso zzso activity and interaction with zzso and correlated with reduced zzso levels on the cell zzso Data were verified in zzso transgenic mice zzso and zzso zzso between zzso and zzso was evident by zzso zzso of zzso with zzso resulted in its displacement from the surface of the vascular zzso and in increased zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso blood zzso on the cell surface by two independent zzso zzso of zzso from the vascular surface shortly after local zzso of zzso levels, and subsequent induction of zzso zzso
