zzso zzso supports zzso zzso growth, embryonic zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso is regulated by diverse zzso and hormonal signals, including zzso zzso of zzso The action of natural and synthetic zzso zzso on zzso expression in primary and transformed human zzso cell cultures was established by zzso zzso gene expression and zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso were truncated and zzso to map functional zzso zzso zzso and cells express zzso zzso Treatment of transformed and primary zzso cells with zzso a synthetic zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso a naturally occurring zzso zzso decreased zzso protein zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso with an zzso approximately approximately 50 zzso zzso and zzso zzso promoter zzso revealed that the zzso domain is a direct repeat zzso motif zzso zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso 

zzso zzso repress zzso gene expression via a zzso element zzso in the zzso gene zzso zzso of this nuclear zzso might be exploited zzso to inhibit pathological zzso in complications of pregnancy, zzso and zzso zzso
