The human zzso gene zzso is controlled by multiple promoters that give rise to different zzso zzso Its regulation has been studied in cells from multiple origins, including zzso bone, zzso zzso and breast zzso However, little is known about its regulation in cells from neural zzso We assessed whether vitamin D, zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulate the zzso gene in human zzso zzso and breast cancer zzso The results show that these compounds enhance the activity of different zzso promoters in zzso cells, but not in zzso and breast cancer zzso Vitamin D increased the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso transcripts and induced de zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso increased the expression of zzso zzso and zzso transcripts and zzso increased the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The cell specific regulation of zzso by vitamin D, zzso and zzso opens the possibility for cellular selective zzso of zzso zzso within the zzso
