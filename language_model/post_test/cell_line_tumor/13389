The zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in controlling cell zzso zzso binds zzso and zzso zzso zzso and signals in complex with zzso receptors such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso Previous work from this laboratory has shown that synthetic zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso when carrying the zzso or zzso zzso zzso or zzso cell migration, zzso To gain zzso insights into these opposite cell responses, the functional consequences of zzso and zzso zzso in full-length zzso were zzso First, zzso embryonic kidney cells expressing zzso exhibit enhanced zzso zzso increased random and directional cell migration, long-lasting zzso zzso and increased zzso to zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso substitution prevents zzso zzso zzso and zzso decreases binding and zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Also, zzso cells appear quite zzso and their zzso well zzso whereas zzso cells assume a large flattened zzso with random orientation of zzso zzso Interestingly, when zzso cells zzso wild type zzso with zzso zzso the latter behaves as a zzso zzso zzso signaling and reducing cell wound repair as well as lung zzso in nude zzso In contrast, zzso wound repair and in zzso lung zzso of zzso cells bearing wild type zzso are enhanced when they zzso zzso In conclusion, our findings indicate that zzso is a critical zzso for zzso signaling and that the zzso and zzso exert opposite effects on zzso zzso These findings may be zzso in a molecular model, in which zzso and zzso are forced into inactive and active forms, respectively, suggesting important implications for the development of novel drugs targeting zzso zzso
