zzso of the zzso gene define a genetically distinct subset of acute zzso with poor zzso Current treatment options are of limited zzso thus, there is a pressing need for new therapies for this zzso zzso and small zzso inhibitor studies have demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso is required for the development and maintenance of zzso leukemia in model zzso Here we describe the characterization of zzso a potent and selective zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso The compound has an zzso constant value of 80 zzso and demonstrates zzso selectivity over all other zzso zzso In cellular studies, zzso inhibited zzso zzso and zzso target gene expression and demonstrated potent cell killing that was selective for acute leukemia lines bearing zzso zzso Continuous IV infusion of zzso in a rat zzso model of zzso leukemia caused complete tumor zzso that were sustained well beyond the compound infusion period with no significant weight loss or signs of zzso zzso is therefore a potential treatment of zzso leukemia and is under clinical zzso
