zzso zzso zzso zzso has recently been found to be functionally expressed in zzso and are probably involved in their zzso biological zzso In an attempt to explore the therapeutic significance of zzso we used zzso human zzso cells zzso the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso cells zzso zzso to establish zzso in mice zzso Compared to zzso and mock zzso cells, zzso zzso cells formed smaller and more zzso zzso with fewer zzso figures and more zzso filaments within their zzso The density of zzso which presented as a nearly normal zzso was also decreased significantly in zzso zzso zzso Moreover, fewer invasive zzso could be observed in the zzso derived from zzso zzso cells, which also showed a poor migratory capacity in zzso We suggest that decreased zzso and zzso expression might be a possible mechanism for the decreasing zzso potential and invasive capability of zzso cells after zzso zzso zzso zzso might be essential for sustaining the growth and aggressive zzso of zzso and could therefore be a potential therapeutic zzso
