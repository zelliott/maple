Human zzso inhibitor zzso could effectively block zzso zzso and inhibit growth of transplant solid tumors in zzso However, its exact molecular mechanism of zzso has not been totally zzso Many tumor zzso genes occur loss of expression by zzso zzso in promoter zzso zzso treated with zzso inhibitor zzso zzso restore the gene zzso To further explore functions of zzso and investigate relationship between zzso and zzso the study was designed to explore effects of zzso on expression of zzso in cancer cell zzso 

Human breast cancer cell line zzso human gastric cancer cell line zzso human prostate cancer cell line zzso and human colon cancer cell line zzso were treated with zzso zzso of zzso was analyzed by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso Western zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso of zzso significantly elevated by zzso at both zzso and protein level in zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso Compared with control cells, zzso levels of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells treated with zzso were increased by percentages of zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein levels of zzso were increased by percentages of zzso zzso and zzso zzso but no obvious change observed in zzso zzso 

zzso gene may be involved in zzso of zzso zzso and breast zzso
