zzso Club zzso zzso is one of the most important spiritual and medicinal plants to many indigenous peoples of Alaska and the Pacific zzso It is widely used for external and internal infections as well as arthritis, respiratory zzso zzso tract zzso broken bones, fever, zzso and zzso 

To investigate zzso constituents and their potential zzso activity from zzso Club, zzso zzso 

The root bark extract of zzso zzso was isolated by zzso zzso zzso of isolated compounds were identified by zzso methods and comparison with published zzso The zzso of isolated zzso constituents in human breast cancer zzso cells, human colon cancer zzso and zzso cells were zzso The potential mechanism of zzso was also investigated using cell cycle and zzso zzso 

Six compounds were isolated and structurally identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These compounds showed potential zzso activities on human breast cancer and colon cancer cells, of which compound 3 possesses the strongest zzso Further cell cycle and zzso tests by flow zzso showed the zzso zzso induced zzso cell arresting in zzso phase and inhibited proliferation by the induction of zzso at both earlier and later zzso 

These results provide promising baseline information for the potential use of zzso zzso as well as some of the isolated compounds in the treatment of zzso
