zzso of the zzso tumor zzso can be caused not only by inherited zzso in familial zzso but also by zzso gene zzso in sporadic zzso zzso a key feature of the tumor zzso has been shown to zzso zzso at the zzso level via repressive zzso zzso Here we showed that zzso also drives zzso modification of the zzso promoter, with decreased zzso zzso as a key repressive modification produced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso We also observed increased zzso zzso coupled with decreased zzso zzso Similar modifications were seen in the zzso promoter, which is also zzso by zzso whereas exactly opposite changes were seen in the promoter of the zzso gene zzso In cells containing the zzso promoter driving a zzso zzso zzso long-term zzso of the promoter was observed following exposure to hypoxic zzso zzso with silenced zzso promoters were detected at zzso of zzso or more following zzso but at less than 6 zzso zzso without zzso The silenced clones showed decreased zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso in the zzso zzso consistent with the acute effects of hypoxic zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso persisted in subsequent zzso conditions but could be reversed by treatment with a zzso zzso zzso inhibitor but not with a DNA zzso zzso Interestingly, treatment of cells with zzso of zzso zzso zzso can cause short-term repression of zzso zzso but such treatment does not produce zzso or zzso zzso modification or zzso promoter zzso These results suggest that zzso is a driving force for long-term zzso of zzso thereby promoting zzso instability and tumor zzso
