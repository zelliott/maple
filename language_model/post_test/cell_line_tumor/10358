zzso zzso zzso of tumors is becoming a more widely accepted minimally invasive alternative to surgery for patients who are not good surgical candidates, such as patients with advanced head and neck zzso In this study, zzso zzso iron oxide coated with gold zzso zzso zzso that have both optical and magnetic properties was zzso with the targeting agent, zzso zzso zzso against zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso have an average a diameter of 82 zzso zzso zzso contain 142 zzso 15 zzso per zzso have an zzso peak in the near infrared zzso zzso and have zzso zzso zzso of 193 and 353 zzso zzso versus zzso of zzso and 300 zzso zzso using zzso T and 7 T MR zzso zzso zzso targeting of the zzso zzso zzso was tested in zzso using zzso cells and oral cancer cells, zzso zzso and zzso all of which zzso zzso Selective binding was achieved using zzso zzso but not with the zzso zzso zzso and blocking group zzso of zzso + zzso zzso In zzso zzso on mice bearing zzso tumors also showed selective targeting of zzso zzso compared with the zzso and blocking zzso The selective zzso zzso of the zzso shows that without laser treatment there were no cell death and among the groups that were treated with laser at a power of 36 zzso for 3 zzso only the cells treated with zzso zzso had cell killing zzso zzso zzso In zzso successful synthesis and characterization of targeted zzso zzso demonstrating both zzso and optical properties has been zzso We have shown both in zzso and in zzso that these zzso are zzso and can be selectively heated up for simultaneous imaging and zzso zzso zzso
