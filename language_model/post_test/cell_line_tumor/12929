zzso fatty acids are known to display several biological activities, but their zzso activity has remained zzso In this study, we zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso acids zzso and evaluated their in zzso activity against zzso (blood) stages of zzso zzso and liver stages of zzso zzso zzso Since the type II fatty acid zzso zzso zzso has recently been shown to be indispensable for liver stage malaria zzso the zzso potential of the zzso against multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso The highest zzso activity against blood stages of zzso zzso was displayed by zzso zzso value zzso zzso whereas the zzso was the only acid arresting the growth of liver stage zzso zzso infection, in both flow zzso zzso zzso value zzso zzso zzso control drug zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso zzso control drug zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the best zzso activity against the zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso control drugs 14 and 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso and molecular modeling studies revealed valuable insights into the binding mechanism of zzso on the target zzso All zzso showed in zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso zzso values zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso values zzso zzso with generally low or no significant toxicity on zzso zzso This is the first study to indicate therapeutic potential of zzso against various zzso zzso It also points out that the zzso liver stage growth zzso effect of the zzso may be promoted via zzso zzso The lack of zzso zzso nature, and calculated zzso properties suggests that zzso could be a useful compound to study the interaction of fatty acids with these key zzso zzso zzso
