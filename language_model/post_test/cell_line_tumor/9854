During microbial or zzso cell zzso TNT zzso is reduced to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso depending on the specific zzso The zzso zzso is the most common of the zzso zzso pathways in bacterial and zzso species studied to zzso in the zzso liver cells, TNT is zzso to zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso is rapidly emerging as a relevant zzso for detecting zzso toxin zzso We report in this study that zzso treatment of zzso cells causes cell death by zzso Cell death was zzso by the zzso Blue zzso zzso changes, such as DNA break down, were detected in treated cells by the production of a zzso zzso zzso signal using the zzso zzso DNA zzso detection system, by zzso techniques with zzso zzso and by using a zzso reader for a zzso DNA binding zzso All of these results showed that zzso is toxic to zzso cells and zzso zzso
