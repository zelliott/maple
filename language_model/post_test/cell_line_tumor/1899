As a novel mode of tumor zzso zzso mimicry zzso has been reported to increase zzso mortality in many different solid zzso In the present study, two established human gallbladder zzso zzso cell lines zzso aggressive zzso and poorly aggressive zzso cultured on a three-dimensional zzso were assessed for the ability of zzso channel formation under zzso or hypoxic zzso In addition, the relationship between zzso gene expression and zzso channel formation of zzso cells in zzso was measured using the small interfering zzso zzso technique, western zzso and real-time reverse zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to observe zzso in zzso tissue zzso Additionally, all zzso specimens with zzso and zzso were stained for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its correlation with zzso features and prognosis was analyzed zzso We found that zzso could induce more zzso channel formation and elevated zzso expression in highly aggressive zzso zzso zzso zzso efficiently knocked down zzso expression and zzso zzso networks under either zzso or hypoxic zzso zzso was present in human primary zzso and zzso of zzso was significantly correlated with depth of invasion and zzso involvement in the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso were independent factors for the overall survival of zzso patients and correlated with decreased zzso In conclusion, zzso was present in human zzso As a critical zzso in zzso formation, high expression of zzso was associated with zzso and tumor progression in zzso zzso
