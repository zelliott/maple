zzso oxide zzso is a zzso free radical zzso that has been implicated in zzso zzso and progression of head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso However, the mechanism underlying the effect of NO on zzso spread remains largely zzso zzso zzso has recently received considerable attention and there is increasing evidence that it is relevant for zzso to zzso zzso in zzso Here, we study the correlation between zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso in a series of 60 zzso and the possible involvement of the zzso factor vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso presenting with zzso zzso zzso had a significantly higher zzso vessel density in both the zzso mass and the zzso area zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso with zzso zzso zzso showed greater zzso vessel area than zzso with no zzso zzso involvement zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and p zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso activity measured in specimens from the zzso periphery correlated strongly with both zzso vessel density and zzso vessel area zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these correlations were not observed in specimens from the zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso expression was significantly elevated in zzso with high zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression correlated positively with the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso in the zzso human zzso zzso cell line, zzso and zzso stimulation of the zzso zzso led to zzso of zzso which was blocked by the zzso inhibitor zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso activity may promote zzso and spread to zzso zzso in zzso with the possible involvement of zzso
