Previous studies have shown that blocking zzso signaling reduced tumor growth by zzso productive zzso We developed selective zzso and zzso zzso zzso to dissect the mechanisms involved by analyzing the contributions of selectively targeting zzso in the tumor or in the host zzso and zzso in zzso models derived from primary human zzso We found that each zzso inhibited tumor growth and that the combination of the two zzso was more effective than either zzso Treatment with zzso zzso inhibited the expression of zzso target genes and reduced proliferation of tumor zzso Furthermore, we found that specifically zzso human zzso in the zzso either alone or in combination with the zzso agent zzso reduced cancer stem cell frequency, as shown by flow zzso and in zzso zzso zzso
