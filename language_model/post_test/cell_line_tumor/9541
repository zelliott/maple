Because the response of cancer cells to zzso agents depends upon the supporting zzso zzso zzso the response in zzso may not be reproduced in zzso cell zzso The zzso to zzso and two derivatives by zzso cancer cells grown on both normal zzso and zzso zzso zzso and on plastic were zzso zzso grown on zzso were resistant to zzso but cells growing on zzso which mimic cancer cells suppressed by normal zzso were nearly as sensitive as cells grown on zzso zzso zzso cells, which are models for zzso cells, were the most sensitive, but even aggressive cell lines were nearly as sensitive when grown on zzso as on zzso zzso response depends highly on the supporting zzso and cells grown on plastic poorly models cells growing on natural zzso zzso could prove an effective zzso for zzso cancer recurrence when administered zzso zzso
