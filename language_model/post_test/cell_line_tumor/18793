We report in a zzso model of acute zzso leukemia zzso the potent zzso efficiency of a zzso delivery of zzso gene modified zzso zzso and zzso converting zzso zzso gene modified zzso zzso Live leukemia cells zzso or zzso plus zzso showed apparently reduced zzso with a survival rate of 40 or 50% at 50 days after zzso zzso zzso of a lethal dose of cells, zzso Combination of zzso and zzso was capable of zzso zzso of bloody zzso zzso superior to zzso or zzso zzso All surviving mice were zzso with parental zzso cells at day 50, and all survived up to day 80, suggesting that zzso cells induced immune zzso Moreover, zzso zzso and zzso activity were both enhanced in mice injected with zzso especially zzso plus zzso zzso of zzso were not altered significantly by zzso of zzso or zzso plus zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso is a useful candidate gene in gene therapy of zzso or zzso zzso and ex zzso zzso delivery of zzso plus zzso either as a single approach or as an adjunct to zzso zzso or chemotherapy, may be more efficient in a situation of minimal residual zzso
