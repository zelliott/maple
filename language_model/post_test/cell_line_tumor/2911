The development of molecular zzso capable of recognizing zzso cells is essential to meet the serious clinical, zzso and zzso challenges confronting zzso zzso We report the development of DNA zzso as zzso for the selective targeting of zzso living zzso 

To create zzso zzso capable of recognizing zzso cells, we used zzso zzso evolution of zzso via exponential zzso which uses intact infected live cells as targets for zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso and zzso lung cancer zzso cells were chosen to develop our model zzso 

A panel of zzso has been evolved by means of the infected zzso zzso The results demonstrate that the zzso bind selectively to zzso zzso zzso cells with apparent equilibrium zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In addition, these zzso can specifically recognize a variety of target infected cell zzso The zzso target is most likely a viral protein located on the cell zzso 

The success of developing a panel of zzso zzso capable of recognizing zzso cells via a whole living zzso selection strategy may increase our understanding of the molecular signatures of infected zzso Our findings suggest that zzso can be developed as molecular zzso for use as diagnostic and therapeutic zzso and for zzso drug delivery against infected zzso
