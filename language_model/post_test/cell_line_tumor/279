In this study, zzso effects of structurally related zzso and zzso on a human zzso zzso cell zzso cell line zzso were determined, and the molecular mechanisms responsible for their zzso effects were zzso The results of zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were able to induce zzso in zzso cells in a zzso and zzso manner, and the zzso potency of these compounds was in the order of: zzso zzso zzso and DNA fragmentation analysis indicated that the zzso induced by zzso and zzso was zzso by zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso Furthermore, the expression of genes related to cell cycle arrest and zzso was assessed by zzso zzso real-time zzso and Western zzso It was shown that the treatment of zzso cells with these compounds caused zzso arrest through zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso B1 at the zzso and protein levels, and induced zzso zzso zzso through zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso The results of western zzso analysis further showed that increases of zzso and zzso protein translation or stability might be contributed to the regulation of zzso zzso B1 and zzso
