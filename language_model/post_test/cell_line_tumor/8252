Despite good safety data in clinical trials, zzso zzso have not been efficient enough to make them a viable treatment alternative for zzso As more potent viruses are being made, zzso and zzso targeting to tumor zzso becomes increasingly zzso To improve zzso zzso zzso zzso can be armed with therapeutic zzso such as the zzso soluble vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso fusion zzso We hypothesized that an zzso zzso targeted, vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso armed zzso zzso would exhibit improved specificity and zzso effect in zzso kidney cancer zzso Two zzso zzso zzso promoters were evaluated for zzso cancer specificity using a novel in zzso dual zzso zzso Earlier data had shown usefulness of the zzso zzso zzso modification for kidney zzso zzso we constructed zzso which showed good specificity and zzso effect on zzso cancer cells in zzso and resulted in zzso efficacy in a subcutaneous in zzso model, in which vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso expression and a concurrent zzso effect were zzso In an zzso zzso kidney cancer model, significantly enhanced survival was observed when compared with control zzso These results suggest that a targeted, zzso zzso zzso might be a valuable agent for testing in kidney cancer zzso
