As an zzso zzso zzso is a potential zzso target for cancer zzso Most zzso forms of the protein are largely accumulated in cancer cells due to their increased zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that zzso zzso protein stability is regulated by zzso acid zzso Following zzso exposure, protein levels of zzso zzso decreased while the zzso levels were not affected in zzso cells, which indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso a protein synthesis zzso induced a decrease of zzso of zzso zzso zzso These findings indicated that the reduction of zzso zzso by zzso was due to the zzso and degradation of the zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso activity by zzso blocked zzso zzso of zzso zzso causing zzso zzso zzso in zzso cellular zzso Further studies revealed that zzso zzso was zzso and it was zzso related zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso rather than zzso involved in the degradation of zzso zzso In addition, zzso prevented zzso zzso complex formation and enhanced interaction of zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso stabilized zzso zzso in zzso treated zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso may be zzso by zzso through zzso zzso degradation zzso in cancer zzso
