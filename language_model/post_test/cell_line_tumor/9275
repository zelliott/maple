The ability of sex steroid hormones to zzso the zzso signaling proteins is well zzso however, the zzso potential of sex hormones is not remarkable and fully compensated by their growth zzso action to target zzso In the present study using the long-term zzso of zzso zzso breast cancer cells in zzso zzso we have established a cell zzso designed as zzso which was characterized by the resistance to growth zzso zzso action and hypersensitivity to zzso zzso We have demonstrated that zzso treatment of the cells does not influence on the level of zzso or zzso but dramatically decreases the zzso activity of zzso zzso the zzso cells, which are insensitive to growth zzso zzso action, retain the ability to decrease in the zzso activity in response to zzso zzso Furthermore, the significant increase in the zzso (in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in the zzso cells was revealed and zzso zzso antagonism between zzso and zzso was zzso Finally, we proved the possible involvement of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In general, the results presented suggest that long-term growth of zzso breast cancer cells in zzso medium is accompanied with the increase in the zzso zzso zzso activity as well as the maintenance of the negative regulatory loop zzso The latter may be considered as one of the factors resulting in a zzso between zzso and zzso pathways and enhancement in zzso zzso action in the zzso
