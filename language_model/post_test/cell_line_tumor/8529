zzso zzso are zzso by zzso families found in several large clusters in the human zzso and are thought to be functionally zzso However, the abundance of specific zzso zzso of zzso zzso is altered in patients with chronic zzso zzso Similar changes in the abundance of zzso zzso are also associated with the proliferation and zzso of zzso cancer zzso To determine whether these zzso zzso can perform distinct functions, expression of several zzso zzso was reduced by zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso locus leads to increased rates of cell proliferation and zzso We also observe that regulation of zzso zzso zzso expression can occur on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes are either zzso or zzso in chronic zzso leukemia tumor tissue zzso In addition, discreet elements are identified in the zzso untranslated region of the zzso locus that zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso zzso zzso can possess distinct cellular functions and that regulation of these zzso may play a role in zzso
