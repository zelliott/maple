zzso A zzso is an industrial zzso that zzso from food containers during normal zzso leading to human zzso Early and chronic exposure to zzso environmental zzso such as zzso zzso the potential for long-term health zzso We examined the impact of zzso exposure on fetal programming of zzso tumor zzso as well as its growth promoting effects on transformed breast cancer cells in zzso Fetal mice were exposed to 0, 25, or 250 zzso zzso by oral zzso of pregnant zzso zzso were subsequently treated with the known zzso zzso zzso zzso While no significant differences in zzso zzso development were observed, both low- and high-dose zzso zzso had a statistically significant increase in zzso to zzso tumors compared to zzso zzso To determine if zzso also promotes established tumor growth, zzso human breast cancer cells were zzso injected into zzso of zzso zzso zzso female mice treated with zzso zzso or zzso alone or combined with zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso formed tumors by 7 zzso zzso while no tumors were detected in the zzso zzso zzso reversed the effects of zzso and zzso We conclude that zzso may increase zzso zzso through at least two zzso molecular zzso of fetal zzso without associated zzso changes and direct promotion of zzso tumor cell zzso Both results indicate that exposure to zzso during various biological states increases the risk of developing zzso cancer in zzso
