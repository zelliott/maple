zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso is a promising candidate for cancer therapy, however, emergence of drug resistance limits its potential zzso Here, we report for the first time that zzso zzso the major zzso constituent of green tea, zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso through zzso of intrinsic and zzso zzso zzso When combined with zzso zzso exhibited enhanced zzso activity in zzso cells characterized by three major molecular zzso First, zzso induction was accompanied by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso family of zzso A synergistic zzso of zzso of zzso with zzso increase in zzso zzso was zzso Second, zzso of cells with zzso resulted in zzso of zzso signaling cascade complex involving zzso zzso zzso death domain and zzso protein zzso zzso we observed a synergistic zzso in the invasion and migration of zzso zzso This effect was observed to be zzso through zzso in the protein expression of vascular zzso growth factor, zzso and zzso 1 and zzso Further, the activity and protein expression of zzso zzso and -9 and zzso of zzso in cells treated with a combination of zzso and TRAIL was zzso These data might have implications for developing new strategies aimed at eliminating prostate cancer cells resistant to zzso
