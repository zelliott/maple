To study zzso capacity and zzso expression of human gastric zzso zzso cells at different stages of a first cell zzso 

zzso cells were synchronized by zzso and zzso for zzso to an zzso cell zzso zzso Surface expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso on zzso cells was evaluated by flow zzso zzso relevance of zzso zzso receptors was investigated by blocking studies using anti zzso zzso zzso or by zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso to zzso was increased during zzso transit, after which zzso returned to baseline levels with cell cycle zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were all zzso on zzso during cell cycle progression with a maximum effect in zzso The function of zzso surface receptors was assessed with specific zzso blocking zzso zzso or removal of zzso by zzso with zzso Both strategies inhibited tumor cell zzso to zzso by nearly zzso which indicates that zzso is zzso zzso 

zzso expression level is linked to the cell cycle in gastrointestinal tumor cells, which in turn leads to cell cycle dependent zzso of their zzso zzso to zzso
