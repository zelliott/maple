zzso zzso the main component isolated from zzso zzso some kinds of zzso growth and zzso The combination of low dose chemotherapy and zzso zzso suppresses growth of experimental zzso more effectively than conventional zzso The effect of this combination on zzso cancer remains to be zzso zzso we investigated the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso on growth and zzso of human zzso zzso 

zzso female zzso mice were divided randomly into 4 groups of 7: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso combination and control, after being transplanted with zzso cancer cells zzso The mice were given zzso injection of zzso zzso and zzso for the 10 days following zzso of zzso zzso The life quality and number of living days of mice were zzso The size of zzso zzso zzso rate, life zzso rate, zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso index zzso expression of vascular zzso cell growth factor zzso and zzso density zzso of the zzso zzso were zzso 

Life quality of mice in zzso zzso and combined treatment groups were better and number of living days longer than zzso Average zzso weights of each treated group were less than control and there was no significant difference among the treated zzso zzso of treated groups was lower than zzso The zzso value and zzso expression in treated groups were significantly lower than control and the zzso values of zzso zzso and combined treatment groups were lower than that of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso significantly inhibited growth and zzso of zzso cancer when used alone or combined with zzso zzso zzso and zzso combination reinforced the zzso effect each other and improved the living quality and survival time of mice with zzso
