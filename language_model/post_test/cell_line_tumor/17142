We have demonstrated that the basement membrane regulates the zzso We are now studying the effect of zzso a basement membrane zzso in the zzso of a cell line zzso derived from human zzso zzso zzso zzso These cells were grown inside a three-dimensional preparation of zzso zzso differences were assessed by light and transmission electron zzso In addition, we zzso the effect of a molecular domain of zzso the zzso zzso on zzso zzso This zzso was chosen because it is effective in cell proliferation and zzso zzso cells grown inside zzso were mostly zzso while cells treated by zzso showed light and electron microscopic features of typical zzso zzso This zzso also modulated zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso and its derived zzso zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso
