The resistance to zzso zzso limits their zzso therapeutic zzso Here we studied the zzso effect of zzso gamma in relation to zzso expression in a panel of breast cancer cell lines and normal zzso zzso zzso Compared to normal cells most breast cancer lines zzso were highly resistant to zzso Using Northern zzso and real time zzso we investigated zzso of zzso zzso All normal zzso cells zzso showed zzso induction zzso zzso while most breast cancer lines did not or zzso activated zzso after the zzso gamma zzso Among the cancer lines, the zzso cells showed increased sensitivity to zzso and relatively high level of zzso induction zzso zzso Together, there was a good correlation
