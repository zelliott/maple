The contribution of bone zzso circulating zzso zzso cells zzso to tumor zzso has been controversial, primarily because of their low numbers in blood vessels of zzso zzso We show that treatment of zzso mice with vascular zzso agents zzso leads to an acute zzso of zzso which home to the viable tumor rim that characteristically remains after such zzso zzso of this zzso spike by zzso drugs or by genetic manipulation resulted in marked reductions in tumor rim size and blood flow as well as enhanced zzso zzso zzso These findings also provide a zzso rationale for the enhanced efficacy of zzso when combined with zzso zzso
