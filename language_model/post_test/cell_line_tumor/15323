This systematic study clarified a few zzso aspects of cancer cell zzso on zzso zzso zzso and indicated that the cell zzso equilibrium greatly responds to zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso of zzso bovine serum zzso zzso or collagen with or without zzso treatments of the zzso surfaces dramatically impacted the zzso equilibrium of breast cancer stem cells, while the variations of the zzso elastic zzso had much less such zzso Our results showed that the surface zzso of collagen and zzso on zzso maintained breast cancer cell zzso to be nearly identical to the cultures on commercial polystyrene zzso zzso The surface coating of zzso provided a weak zzso zzso that zzso the increase in zzso zzso Our observations may potentially guide surface modification approaches to obtain specific cell zzso
