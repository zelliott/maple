zzso is a standard treatment for zzso patient with or without zzso zzso can increase tumor sensitivity for zzso zzso a synthetic zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso was investigated in zzso and in zzso and the possible mechanisms were studied in zzso In the present experiments, the human zzso zzso cell line used zzso was resistant to 5 zzso of zzso zzso The results showed that 10 zzso of zzso zzso in combination with zzso significantly inhibited cell proliferation both in zzso zzso and colony formation zzso zzso growth was inhibited by zzso zzso in combination with local zzso but not by local zzso or zzso zzso alone in human zzso zzso model in nude zzso The zzso ratio of tumor growth produced by zzso zzso zzso 5, and 15 zzso in combination with zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Further molecular mechanisms were studied in zzso The results showed that the expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased in the cells treated with zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso did not induce zzso but induced cell cycle arrest at zzso zzso The said results demonstrated that zzso zzso possessed a zzso effect via zzso zzso zzso and NO production in the tumor cells, leading to cell cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potential candidate as zzso for human zzso
