In the present study, an zzso system was applied as a simple and convenient technique to characterize the extent of metal zzso zzso in solution and to zzso zzso zzso zzso and surface interaction in three cell zzso under normal culture zzso The experimental results demonstrated that silver zzso 80, 130 zzso aluminum zzso zzso and zzso (40 zzso particles and zzso were effectively zzso by rat liver cells zzso zzso rat zzso zzso zzso and rat neuroendocrine cells zzso Individual and zzso zzso were observed within the cells and zzso were observed on the cell surface zzso The particles were initially dispersed in zzso or zzso balanced salt solutions and zzso was observed using the zzso Resolution Imaging zzso zzso Different methods, such as zzso and addition of zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso Due to effects of zzso itself on cell zzso the zzso could not be directly applied during cell zzso zzso following addition of zzso zzso the particles were washed twice with zzso water, which reduced zzso even zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso is important for studying their zzso and in applications that benefit from individual zzso such as zzso In zzso this study demonstrates a simple technique to characterize the extent of zzso zzso in solution and zzso zzso (40 zzso and zzso zzso and interaction with zzso Additionally, an example application of zzso labeling onto the surface and zzso extensions of zzso zzso cells zzso is presented as a potential imaging zzso
