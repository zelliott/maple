zzso acid regulates the expression of genes involved in cell zzso differentiation and survival by direct control of gene zzso via zzso of nuclear zzso receptors bound to response elements in the promoters of target genes or by indirect zzso zzso we investigated the mechanism by which zzso acid zzso the expression of the human tumor zzso zzso The zzso zzso upstream region of the zzso gene was found to contain two potential zzso binding sites zzso and one zzso binding site with direct repeat 5 zzso motifs designated zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso were zzso among zzso However, only zzso zzso CCC zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be the functional zzso for zzso induction of zzso as indicated by zzso mobility shift zzso using wild type and zzso synthetic zzso representing different fragments of the promoter for competition with zzso acid zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed the binding of zzso acid receptors alpha and gamma and zzso X receptors alpha and beta to zzso in intact zzso These results demonstrate the importance of functional analysis for zzso the activity of predicted response zzso
