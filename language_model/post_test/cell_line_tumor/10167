zzso is often associated with lower abdominal pain, zzso zzso and chronic pelvic zzso There is no correlation between the extent of zzso and the intensity of zzso The mechanism of pain in zzso is zzso The aim of our study was to investigate the influence of zzso fluid zzso from zzso patients on cultured neural cells that are the zzso basis of zzso and to determine whether there was a relationship between the zzso staging and an zzso of zzso production by these zzso 

Different human zzso cell lines were grown to 3/4 zzso and then cultured in presence of zzso pooled according to the presence of no, mild, or severe zzso After 6 and 24 h of zzso the zzso changes were assessed and the zzso activity was zzso 

The different cell lines showed strongly varying proliferation and zzso zzso The zzso activity was also varying between cell lines, but no consistently increased cell turnover in the zzso when compared with the control medium nor associated to a particular, zzso zzso pool could be zzso In this experimental setting, we have observed that the cell proliferation in the presence of zzso was zzso and not enhanced as it might have been zzso zzso of zzso showed higher production rates for this zzso under exposure to zzso than in controls for some but not all tested cell lines, but there was no association with the stage zzso of the zzso 

The zzso cell culture model may become a useful tool to investigate the zzso pain, but different zzso and cell lines may have to be zzso
