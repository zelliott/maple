zzso resistance occurs in various zzso The zzso zzso protein is responsible for zzso zzso by reducing zzso zzso Our aim is to evaluate whether zzso zzso against zzso increases the sensitivity of canine zzso for zzso such as TRAIL and zzso We used small interfering zzso zzso directed against zzso in three zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso represent frequently occurring canine zzso and are highly comparable to their human zzso zzso zzso was measured by means of quantitative zzso zzso and Western zzso The zzso depleted cells were treated with a serial dilution of TRAIL or zzso and compared to zzso and zzso zzso zzso was measured with a zzso zzso 

All zzso zzso treated zzso showed a zzso zzso over 80 zzso Western zzso analysis confirmed zzso zzso No zzso effect of zzso family members was seen in zzso depleted zzso The sensitivity of zzso depleted cells for TRAIL was highest in zzso cells with an increase in the zzso of zzso compared to zzso and zzso zzso The sensitivity of zzso and zzso zzso increased zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatment in zzso depleted cells increased sensitivity in zzso cells more than zzso whereas zzso and zzso zzso showed an increase in sensitivity of three- and zzso zzso 

zzso directed zzso have a strong zzso effect on zzso zzso and a smaller but significant effect with the DNA damaging drug zzso The increase in efficacy of zzso with zzso depletion provides the rationale for the use of zzso zzso in insensitive canine zzso
