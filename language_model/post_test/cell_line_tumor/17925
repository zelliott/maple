In an effort to develop agents to test the zzso zzso hypothesis of zzso benchmark compounds from a program to discover zzso selective, competitive zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso were zzso in order to further study the detailed pharmacology of these zzso and the distribution of zzso in zzso We here report the in zzso characterization of zzso zzso a zzso developed from a potent and selective zzso zzso zzso its use in zzso studies to zzso zzso zzso binding sites in rat and zzso brain and for in zzso occupancy zzso of competitive zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso compounds were characterized by zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso binding studies were performed with tissue zzso zzso studies were performed on tissue zzso 

zzso is a potent zzso zzso selective, zzso inhibitor that, when zzso with zzso is a zzso zzso with low zzso zzso zzso studies of rat and zzso brain slices with this zzso showed that specific binding sites were plentiful and zzso distributed, with high levels of binding in the zzso zzso white matter, thalamus, cortical white matter and spinal zzso gray zzso In zzso studies demonstrate zzso binding of zzso in rat brain zzso following zzso administration of this zzso 

This is the first report of detailed anatomical zzso of zzso using direct zzso zzso and the first demonstration that an in zzso occupancy zzso is zzso suggesting that it may also be feasible to develop zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso
