In glioblastoma, zzso zzso a member of the largest family of zzso zzso zzso are zzso in both tumor cells and zzso blood zzso The purpose of this study was to examine whether the zzso zzso zzso labeled with both zzso and zzso zzso dye zzso could be used as a molecular imaging agent for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and optical imaging of human zzso in zzso brain tumor zzso 

zzso was zzso to zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was then labeled with zzso for in zzso binding and in zzso dual zzso and optical imaging studies in nude mice implanted with zzso zzso and zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso and brains were removed at the end of the imaging sessions for zzso zzso and zzso microscopic zzso 

zzso and zzso optical imaging clearly showed specific zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso tumors in the brains of the nude mice after intravenous injection of the zzso In zzso tumors, the zzso zzso zzso with both tumor blood vessels and tumor zzso in zzso tumors, the zzso zzso only with tumor blood vessels, not with tumor zzso 

zzso zzso zzso could be used as a zzso molecular imaging agent for zzso and optical imaging of zzso zzso to its ability to bind to both zzso zzso blood vessels and zzso tumor zzso
