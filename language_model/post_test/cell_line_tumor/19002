zzso are widely used for the treatment of zzso However, their zzso action on zzso zzso also results in the depletion of intermediate zzso products, which zzso contribute to cell zzso The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of the individual commercially available statins on experimental pancreatic zzso The in zzso effects of individual statins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the viability of human pancreatic cancer were evaluated in zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso The in zzso experiments were performed on nude mice zzso with zzso zzso The mice received oral treatments either with a zzso or with the statins mentioned earlier in a daily dose corresponding to a zzso dose in zzso The effect of these statins on the zzso Ras zzso trafficking in zzso zzso cells, was also zzso zzso differences in the zzso effects of all statins were detected in both in zzso and in zzso zzso While zzso exerted the highest zzso effects in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were the most potent compounds in an animal zzso All statins (except zzso inhibited zzso Ras protein zzso In zzso substantial zzso effects of various statins on the progression of experimental pancreatic zzso were demonstrated, with marked differences among individual zzso These results support greatly the potential of statins for the zzso treatment of pancreatic zzso
