B zzso are divided into two zzso B1 and B2 cells based on expression of the T zzso protein zzso Natural B1 cells are further divided into zzso cells that express zzso on their membrane and zzso cells that do not but share most other biological characteristics of zzso zzso Recent studies from our laboratory have revealed, in humans, the existence of two alternative zzso of the zzso zzso A cell surface zzso zzso which uses zzso zzso zzso of the gene in zzso cells, and an zzso zzso which uses zzso zzso zzso mainly in human zzso zzso Indeed, the protein zzso zzso by transcripts containing zzso lack the leader zzso and is, thus, retained in the zzso of B zzso The restriction of zzso zzso to B1 zzso in the mouse raises the possibility that the human zzso B cells produce zzso This prediction was confirmed in the zzso negative zzso B cells zzso with zzso for either zzso resulted in high level zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso B cells have the capacity to interfere with the immune response through their ability to produce high levels of zzso
