zzso is essential for solid zzso growth, whilst the molecular profiles of zzso blood vessels have been reported to be different between cancer zzso Although presently available zzso strategies are providing some promise for the treatment of some zzso it is perhaps not surprisingly that, none of the zzso agents available work on all zzso Thus, the discovery of novel zzso targets, relevant to individual cancer types, is zzso Using zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso blood vessels we have identified 63 genes that are zzso significantly zzso zzso in zzso blood vessels associated with human invasive zzso zzso zzso of the breast as compared with blood vessels in normal human zzso We tested the zzso capacity of a subset of these zzso Genes were selected based on either their known cellular functions, their enriched expression in zzso cells and/or their sensitivity to zzso zzso all features implicating their involvement in zzso For example, zzso a zzso zzso involved in DNA zzso was zzso zzso in zzso blood zzso zzso a nuclear zzso zzso factor involved in cellular growth and survival was zzso zzso in zzso blood vessels and zzso a zzso involved in the breakdown of zzso zzso was zzso zzso in zzso blood zzso Furthermore, in zzso analysis confirmed that zzso and zzso also were enriched in zzso cells when compared with zzso zzso None of these genes have been reported previously to be involved in zzso However, our data establish that zzso depletion of zzso zzso or zzso had significant zzso effects in zzso ex zzso mouse zzso ring zzso Overall, our results provide zzso that our approach can identify a cohort of potentially novel zzso targets that are zzso to be, but not zzso relevant to breast zzso
