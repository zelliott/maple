zzso zzso therapy, which seeks to exploit the use of live viruses to treat cancer, has shown promise in the treatment of zzso resistant to conventional zzso zzso Among the most difficult to treat zzso is advanced pancreatic zzso Our study investigates the ability of a novel zzso agent, zzso virus, to zzso zzso replicate in, and kill human pancreatic cancer cells in zzso 

The zzso virus zzso was tested against a panel of human pancreatic zzso cell zzso zzso viral zzso and tumor cell kill were zzso 

zzso of tumor cells was assessed by expression of the marker gene enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso zzso had the ability to zzso all pancreatic cancer cell lines zzso zzso of tumor cells varied among the 6 cell lines tested, ranging from zzso cell kill at 7 days for the most sensitive zzso cells, to zzso in the most resistant cell line zzso zzso correlated to replication of virus, and was found to zzso exhibit a zzso increase in zzso units for the most sensitive zzso cells within 72 zzso 

Our study demonstrates for the first time the ability of the zzso virus to zzso zzso replicate in, and lyse human pancreatic zzso cells in zzso These data encourage further investigation of this virus, which is zzso only in zzso for treatment of this nearly zzso fatal zzso
