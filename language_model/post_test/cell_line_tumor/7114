zzso derivatives are widely investigated due to their potent zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso with zzso A zzso zzso were zzso and examined for their zzso zzso zzso zzso activity as well as their zzso properties on zzso human cancer cell zzso Both compounds maintained their zzso zzso zzso zzso activity at the zzso M level and led to significant growth zzso in certain zzso zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso cancer, zzso cancer and breast cancer cell lines with zzso values at the 10-6 M zzso There could not be observed any notable difference between zzso and zzso regarding to their zzso zzso Interestingly, we observed the high tendency of zzso and zzso to include certain zzso zzso water, zzso zzso which may be due to the remarkable number of hydrogen zzso groups in zzso and zzso An X-ray analysis of zzso including water and zzso illustrates a possible hydrogen bond pattern and could serve as information for preferred zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso Finally, we aimed for irreversible zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso derivatives zzso and zzso which contain a Michael zzso position according to the irreversible inhibitor zzso could be derived from the zzso derivatives zzso or zzso respectively, by zzso However, due to their instability zzso and 11b could not be obtained in a pure zzso
