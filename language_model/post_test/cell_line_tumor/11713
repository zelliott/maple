zzso poor outcomes in patients with pancreatic cancer requires a greater understanding of the biological mechanisms contributing to zzso zzso therefore, sought to identify genes involved in the zzso of pancreatic cancer zzso Two pancreatic cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso were repeatedly exposed to radiation, establishing two zzso cell zzso Gene expression profiling using zzso zzso was performed to identify genes responsible for zzso The levels of expression of zzso zzso by selected genes and their correlation with radiation dose resulting in 50% survival rate were analyzed in pancreatic cancer cell zzso The radiation dose resulting in a 50% survival rate was significantly higher in zzso zzso compared to parental zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but was lower in zzso compared with parental zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis identified 4 zzso including zzso calcium binding protein A4 zzso zzso and 23 genes zzso in the zzso compared with the parental cell zzso The levels of zzso zzso expression were correlated with radiation dose resulting in a 50% survival rate zzso test, zzso zzso zzso zzso expression may predict zzso of pancreatic cancer cells and may play an important role in the poor response of pancreatic cancer cells to radiation zzso
