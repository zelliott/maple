zzso proteins zzso also termed as zzso acid early transcripts zzso zzso are frequently expressed by zzso transformed cells and stimulate zzso immune responses zzso by zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso T cells and zzso T cells in zzso and in zzso In this study, we identified four novel functional zzso zzso of zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso liver zzso cells, zzso human zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso leukemia cells, respectively, by reverse zzso and T zzso cloning zzso Analysis of alignments of zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso illustrated that there were important modifications between zzso zzso and their individual parental zzso All zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were type 1 zzso molecules and had the ability to bind with human zzso zzso in zzso zzso expressions of zzso and zzso zzso zzso resulted in the enhanced zzso sensitivity of target cells against zzso cells, which could be blocked by zzso zzso Moreover, zzso soluble forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso cells zzso the cell surface expression of zzso Finally, immobilized in a zzso form of zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso Taken together, all the identified functional zzso zzso will help to advance our knowledge regarding the overall functions of zzso gene zzso
