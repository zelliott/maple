The zzso group protein zzso of zzso zzso 2 zzso a zzso of gene transcription, has been linked to the progression of various zzso This study was done to examine a potential correlation of zzso zzso expression with zzso parameters and outcome in patients with zzso zzso zzso of the zzso 

We determined the relative zzso gene expression by quantitative zzso in tumor specimens from a cohort of 100 patients with UC zzso follow-up zzso zzso zzso expression levels were correlated to pathological tumor features and zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso 2 was expressed in zzso of the tumor zzso zzso levels increased in parallel with tumor stage zzso zzso zzso High grade UC displayed significantly elevated zzso levels compared to low grade disease zzso zzso zzso High zzso expression was related to an zzso time to recurrence in muscle invasive zzso zzso zzso 2) zzso zzso zzso No such correlation was detected in the group of superficial tumors zzso zzso 1) zzso zzso zzso High zzso expression levels were associated with an increased risk of tumor related death in the zzso analysis zzso risk, zzso P zzso zzso This association became zzso when the zzso effect of tumor stage was considered in a zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso 2 expression is related to an aggressive tumor behavior but due to its strong association with pathological features, zzso levels do not provide independent zzso zzso
