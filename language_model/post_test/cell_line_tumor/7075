To explore the possible effect of zzso gene expression on the proliferation and zzso of zzso and zzso cell zzso 

The infections of zzso and zzso cells were performed by the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso The efficiency of zzso infection and the expression of zzso zzso and protein were evaluated by zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso The proliferation and zzso of zzso and zzso cells were estimated by using zzso blue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso zzso 

The infection efficiency of zzso and zzso cells were zzso and zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso showed that there were significant expressions of zzso zzso and protein of zzso and zzso cells infected by zzso while zzso cells themselves showed only faint zzso zzso and zzso and zzso cells hardly presented zzso zzso and zzso The strong proliferation zzso which were in a zzso manner for zzso and zzso cells infected by zzso were indicated by cell growth curve and zzso zzso After 72 h infection of zzso and zzso cells by zzso the zzso zzso zzso cell rates were zzso and zzso respectively, which were significantly increased compared with control group zzso and zzso zzso The typical DNA zzso bands were zzso in zzso and zzso cells after 48 h of zzso zzso 

The infection of zzso and zzso cells by means of zzso zzso zzso gene could evidently inhibit cellular proliferation and promote cell zzso which would provide experimental evidence for gene therapy of zzso using zzso zzso gene zzso
