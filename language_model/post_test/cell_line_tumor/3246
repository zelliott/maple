zzso zzso zzso a potent zzso zzso zzso is successfully used in the treatment of chronic zzso leukemia and gastrointestinal zzso zzso However, the intended chronic oral administration of zzso may lead to development of cellular resistance and subsequent treatment zzso Indeed, several molecular mechanisms leading to zzso resistance have already been reported, including zzso of the zzso drug zzso We examined whether zzso is a zzso for the breast cancer resistance protein zzso drug pump that is frequently zzso in human zzso Using a panel of zzso zzso cell lines, we provide the first evidence that zzso is a zzso for zzso that it competes with zzso for drug export, and that zzso zzso can be reversed by the zzso C analog zzso Since zzso is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal zzso zzso might not only play a role in cellular resistance of tumor cells but also influence the gastrointestinal zzso of zzso
