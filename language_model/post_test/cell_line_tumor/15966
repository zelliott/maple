zzso zzso division cycle 25) zzso function as zzso of zzso zzso zzso complexes to regulate progression through the zzso We have recently identified a pool of zzso at the zzso of zzso cells that plays a role in regulating zzso zzso 

In the present study, we demonstrate that zzso forms a close association with zzso zzso proteins at the zzso This interaction involves both zzso and zzso regions of zzso and requires zzso binding to its zzso zzso However, the interaction is not dependent on the zzso activity of zzso Although zzso appears to bind indirectly to zzso this association is pertinent to zzso zzso at the zzso We further demonstrate that zzso plays a role in maintaining the overall integrity of the zzso by regulating the zzso levels of multiple zzso zzso including that of zzso 

Our results therefore suggest that zzso associates with a zzso zzso complex in the zzso which targets it to the zzso where it plays a role in maintaining the zzso levels of zzso and a number of other zzso zzso
