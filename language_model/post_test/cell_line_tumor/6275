A better understanding of the mechanisms through which zzso drugs exert their effects is essential to improve combination zzso While studying how zzso stress kills cancer cells, we discovered a large zzso cell zzso platform, referred to as zzso It contains the core components zzso zzso and zzso and assembles in response to zzso zzso depletion of zzso zzso and zzso zzso it forms independently of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso It also forms upon zzso zzso treatment without involvement of zzso zzso zzso assembly requires zzso zzso activity and can stimulate zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso It is zzso regulated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso target components of this complex for zzso and zzso Moreover, we find that zzso zzso formation converts zzso zzso into zzso zzso Together, our observations shed new light on fundamental mechanisms by which zzso may kill cancer zzso
