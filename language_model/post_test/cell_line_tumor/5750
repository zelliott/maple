A comprehensive understanding of the molecular vulnerabilities of every type of cancer will provide a powerful zzso to guide therapeutic zzso Efforts such as The Cancer Genome zzso Project will identify genes with zzso copy number, zzso or expression in various cancer types, providing a survey of the genes that may have a zzso role in zzso A complementary approach is to perform systematic zzso studies to identify essential genes in particular cancer cell zzso We have begun a systematic effort, termed Project zzso aimed at identifying genetic vulnerabilities across large numbers of cancer cell zzso Here, we report the assessment of the zzso of zzso genes in 102 human cancer cell zzso We show that the integration of these functional data with information derived from surveying cancer zzso zzso known and previously zzso zzso zzso across a wide spectrum of zzso In particular, we found 54 genes that are specifically essential for the proliferation and viability of zzso cancer cells and also amplified in primary tumors or zzso zzso in zzso cancer cell zzso One such zzso zzso is zzso amplified in zzso of high-grade zzso zzso zzso and expressed at higher levels in zzso zzso zzso of zzso selectively zzso zzso cell death of zzso cancer zzso These results identify zzso as an zzso zzso zzso More generally, these observations demonstrate that the integration of zzso functional and structural studies provides an efficient path to identify zzso of specific cancer types on particular genes and zzso
