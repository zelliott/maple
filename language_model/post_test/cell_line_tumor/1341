zzso at the level of zzso zzso represent a common source of disease zzso in almost all known diseases with a genetic zzso In general, it is commonly accepted that zzso of all zzso zzso are caused by zzso zzso However, this is probably a conservative estimate since clinical practice has only recently begun to routinely assess for this types of zzso zzso it is expected that many currently zzso or apparently harmless genetic zzso will really turn out to be zzso zzso It is also well known that some genes are more susceptible than others to zzso in their zzso zzso Among these zzso one of the most representative is the zzso zzso In this zzso almost 50% of all reported zzso zzso can be directly attributed to zzso of the zzso zzso In this chapter, we review the zzso process of the zzso gene and the most commonly used methods to identify zzso zzso In particular, we provide practical notes on how to perform this analysis to maximize the chance of correctly identifying zzso zzso zzso events in this zzso
