Many studies have suggested the involvement of zzso zzso zzso in the repair of DNA zzso breaks zzso via DNA zzso zzso zzso To investigate this possibility, we compared the capacity and zzso of DNA zzso in zzso cells containing zzso zzso and zzso cells containing no zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso The zzso zzso cells showed lower zzso of DNA zzso compared to the control zzso zzso The DNA zzso zzso revealed the association of a protein complex including zzso nuclear zzso G zzso zzso with the DNA ends in zzso cells containing zzso zzso but not with the DNA ends in zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso G notably diminished the zzso of zzso in zzso cells expressing zzso zzso Moreover, an zzso expression of zzso G significantly enhanced the zzso of DNA zzso and the protection of DNA ends in human cancer cells lacking zzso G protein or containing zzso zzso zzso Finally, using zzso zzso G zzso we demonstrated the zzso G protein is able to bind to and protect DNA ends from degradation of zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso repair by, in part, inducing zzso G, and the ability of zzso G to bind and protect DNA ends may contribute its ability to promote the zzso of DNA zzso
