Growth arrest DNA zzso gene 45 beta zzso has been known to regulate cell growth, zzso cell death, and cellular response to DNA zzso zzso of zzso has been verified to be specific in zzso cancer zzso and consistent with the zzso zzso and degree of zzso of zzso This observation was further confirmed by eight zzso cell lines and paired human normal and zzso tumor zzso by Northern zzso and zzso To better understand the zzso regulation, we cloned and characterized the active promoter region of zzso in zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso three nuclear zzso binding sites, one zzso binding site, and one putative zzso region were identified in the zzso promoter of zzso from zzso Of interest, no marked putative binding sites could be identified in the zzso region between zzso which zzso to zzso zzso The zzso agent zzso was used and demonstrated restoration of the zzso expression in zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso status in the promoter was further examined in one normal liver cell, eight zzso cell lines, eight zzso zzso and five corresponding zzso liver zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and sequencing of the sodium zzso DNA from zzso cell lines and zzso samples revealed a high percentage of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the five zzso correspondent liver zzso demonstrated very low levels of zzso To further understand the functional role of zzso zzso in zzso the zzso zzso constructed zzso was zzso into zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The transforming growth zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso which revealed a decrease to zzso in zzso of zzso but no significant change in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso demonstrated significantly reduced transforming growth zzso The colony formation was further examined and revealed a decrease in zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings suggested that zzso might play a crucial role in the zzso regulation of zzso in zzso transformation that may be directed by zzso zzso Thus, our results provided a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso in zzso
