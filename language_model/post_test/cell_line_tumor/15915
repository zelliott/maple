We have previously reported that although zzso is a zzso factor, it is often localized in the zzso of some invasive and zzso breast zzso To determine whether zzso zzso is a common mechanism zzso by cancer cells to zzso indefinitely, zzso zzso was examined at different stages of development in normal mouse zzso zzso and in cancer zzso We show here that zzso expression is nuclear in zzso zzso cells throughout zzso zzso development and differentiation but is localized in the zzso of some breast cancer cell lines zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso is associated with zzso of the growth arrest response of breast cancer cells and results from zzso zzso activity rather than defects in its nuclear zzso zzso and zzso studies revealed that zzso zzso activity with zzso A can rescue this zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression that results in increased cell zzso Our data suggests nuclear zzso expression parallels development and differentiation but zzso zzso expression is associated with zzso of growth arrest response of breast cancer zzso Such expressions may be a common mechanism zzso by some transformed breast cancer cells to zzso zzso
