zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso are potent zzso factors produced by tumor and zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether expression of zzso and/or zzso zzso with zzso features of human zzso zzso zzso of zzso for zzso zzso and their zzso zzso was examined by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso in six colon zzso cell lines and in fresh zzso biopsy specimens from 20 patients with zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso protein was also examined zzso in 139 archival surgical specimens of human zzso zzso Of the six cell lines, one zzso zzso expressed zzso and four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was increased under low oxygen conditions, and all six cell lines zzso expressed zzso zzso under hypoxic zzso Of the 139 specimens of human zzso zzso 65 zzso showed intense zzso zzso and 41 zzso showed intense zzso zzso In 49 zzso of the 65 and 20 zzso of the 41 cases, zzso zzso zzso was observed for zzso and zzso respectively, with the highest levels of expression at the invasive zzso zzso expression correlated with the depth of tumor invasion, zzso involvement, zzso involvement, zzso zzso zzso and liver zzso and zzso expression correlated with the depth of tumor invasion, zzso zzso zzso and liver zzso No correlation was observed between zzso and zzso expression in zzso The survival time of patients with zzso tumors was significantly shorter than that of patients with zzso tumors, and the survival time of patients with zzso tumors was significantly shorter than that of patients with zzso zzso The survival time of patients with both zzso and zzso tumors was significantly shorter than that of patients with both zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso may be independent and important zzso factors in patients with human zzso zzso
