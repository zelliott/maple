We have previously shown that zzso zzso receptors zzso enhance zzso colon cancer cell proliferation via the zzso zzso Here, we examined the signaling pathways linking zzso stimulation to zzso zzso and the subsequent proliferation of zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso by zzso or protein zzso C zzso by zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso of the cells with zzso and zzso produced an additive effect on zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso and zzso pathways act in zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are downstream zzso of zzso and are known to have important roles in cell zzso In zzso cells, zzso treatment induced zzso zzso in an zzso manner, and this zzso zzso was decreased by the zzso of either zzso or zzso Moreover, the zzso inhibitor zzso almost completely blocked zzso cell zzso Together, these data indicate that zzso and zzso are involved in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and the subsequent proliferation of zzso colon cancer zzso
