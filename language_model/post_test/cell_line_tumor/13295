Given the important role of zzso in cancer zzso zzso factors that zzso zzso may have an impact on the process of tumor zzso zzso is a common feature of solid tumors and a significant zzso factor that drives aggressive zzso zzso is zzso in several cancer cells under hypoxic conditions, suggesting a relationship between tumor zzso and zzso However, the role of zzso in regulating zzso in gastric cancer remains poorly zzso zzso III gastric cancer cells were exposed to zzso or zzso zzso expression in cells zzso with zzso specific for zzso was investigated by western zzso and flow zzso zzso healing, migration and invasion zzso were used to assess cell zzso and the zzso response to zzso a major zzso zzso zzso expression at the protein level and in the cell membrane was significantly increased in zzso cells following exposure to zzso This zzso of zzso was implicated in increased cell zzso and enhanced zzso responses zzso and zzso to zzso treatment in zzso The increases in zzso expression and zzso potential in gastric cancer cells exposed to zzso were blocked by zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso zzso in gastric cancer cells in a zzso manner, and that zzso of zzso plays a role in cancer cell migration and zzso Thus, zzso the zzso axis could be an attractive therapeutic strategy for the treatment of gastric zzso
