zzso zzso drugs are zzso mainly through the formation of zzso and zzso A zzso These zzso have been suspected to be responsible for the toxicity of several zzso zzso drugs because of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In the present study we investigated the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso A zzso toward zzso rat liver zzso zzso zzso We observed that zzso but not zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso by both zzso zzso rat liver zzso and zzso from zzso and zzso rat zzso cell zzso zzso labeling with zzso suggested that the binding of this zzso may overlap the binding site of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso liquid zzso and mass zzso analysis showed that both zzso and zzso reactions were observed in the presence of zzso and zzso The formation of zzso could be zzso characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso is both a zzso inhibitor and a zzso of a zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso potency of zzso zzso derivatives toward zzso may have potential implications on the reported in zzso toxicity of some zzso zzso zzso
