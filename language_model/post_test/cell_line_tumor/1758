This study demonstrates the use of zzso zzso zzso flow zzso zzso zzso a zzso based high speed two zzso zzso point and zzso zzso protein separation device used for the zzso of zzso zzso performance was evaluated by first zzso zzso molecules at different zzso and zzso zzso proteins were analyzed by zzso liquid zzso mass zzso zzso to determine various zzso of the zzso as well as the relative ratio of zzso and unmodified zzso A narrow pH cut zzso of carrier zzso was used in zzso to finely resolve zzso by zzso When the channel lane of zzso zzso became zzso the relative ratio of zzso to unmodified or less zzso peptides zzso The current method was applied to prostate cancer cell zzso to demonstrate that zzso can examine the relative zzso of specific zzso known as zzso in prostate zzso While zzso enrichment methods remove unmodified zzso zzso offers intact zzso separation at the protein level without removing unmodified zzso zzso enables quantitative analysis without isotope zzso
