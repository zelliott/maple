The development of targeted molecular therapies has provided remarkable advances into the treatment of human zzso However, in most tumors the selective pressure triggered by zzso agents encourages cancer cells to acquire resistance zzso The generation of new rationally designed targeting agents acting on the zzso zzso at multiple levels is a promising approach for molecular zzso zzso derivatives have been highlighted for their properties of targeting zzso Met zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we evaluated the mechanism of action of one of the most active zzso zzso agents, zzso on a panel of cancer cells with distinct zzso We show that zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso of cancer cells carrying Met zzso Moreover, zzso zzso survival and zzso growth of cancer cells characterized by zzso zzso by interfering with zzso zzso A restrained effect of zzso on zzso genes zzso with the absence of major side effects in zzso zzso in addition to targeting Met, zzso alters zzso levels of the zzso pathway, zzso zzso dependency to Met, in addition to zzso and zzso resulting in altered cell cycle progression and zzso zzso Our findings show how the unusual binding plasticity of the Met active site towards structurally different zzso can be exploited to generate drugs able to target Met zzso dependency at distinct zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso Drug Screen revealed that zzso elicits a unique profile of growth zzso on cancer cell lines, indicating a novel mechanism of drug zzso The zzso activity zzso by zzso derivatives through combined zzso of distinct zzso in cancer cells reveal them to be promising zzso agents for further zzso
