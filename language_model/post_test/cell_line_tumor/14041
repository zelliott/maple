To investigate the effects of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso membrane potential and cell zzso of human liver cancer cell line zzso 

The changes in zzso cell growth and proliferation in response to zzso treatment were evaluated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso cells was investigated by flow zzso zzso microscope and electron microscope were employed for observing zzso changes of the treated zzso The zzso zzso membrane potential was measured in separate experiments using two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells treated with zzso were analyzed by flow zzso and cells treated with zzso by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso showed that low zzso of zzso produced no significant effect on the growth of zzso cells, whereas at high zzso zzso could obviously inhibit the cell growth in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso of zzso cells, and after a 24-hour treatment, zzso caused sharp zzso of the zzso membrane zzso 

zzso is capable of zzso the proliferation of zzso cells and inducing cell zzso by zzso zzso membrane zzso
