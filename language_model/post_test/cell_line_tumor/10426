zzso acid zzso is a vitamin of the zzso group that is essential for cell zzso zzso is a major zzso of zzso zzso in which zzso donates zzso groups that are crucial for neurological zzso Many roles for zzso acid have been reported, including zzso and zzso zzso On the other hand, increased zzso of zzso have proven zzso effects and zzso of zzso has been linked to different mood zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential protective effect of zzso acid on zzso cellular death in zzso zzso cell line and the possible zzso signaling zzso involved in such zzso Exposure to 1 zzso zzso for 48 h caused a significant reduction of cell viability measured as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Exposure of zzso cells for 72 h to increasing zzso of folate zzso zzso was not zzso However, zzso with folate zzso zzso reduced zzso toxicity in a significant zzso To explore the putative zzso signaling pathways implicated in the protective effect of folate we used different protein zzso zzso The protective effect of zzso acid on zzso zzso was reversed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso II zzso zzso and protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the results of this study show that zzso acid can protect against zzso zzso and its protective mechanism is related to a signaling zzso that involves zzso zzso and zzso
