Human zzso zzso zzso are globally silent in zzso zzso However, some zzso display high zzso in zzso zzso In particular, zzso zzso and zzso three zzso of distinct families, are highly transcribed in zzso and produce envelope proteins associated with zzso zzso As zzso of repeated elements is thought to occur mainly by DNA zzso we compared the zzso of zzso and related zzso to appreciate whether zzso zzso relies upon the family, the integration site, the zzso the long terminal repeat zzso function or the associated gene zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso was zzso but a joint zzso control was found for zzso zzso and its juxtaposed zzso a zzso apparent zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were all essentially zzso in zzso during pregnancy, but showed distinct and zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, they also exhibited different zzso profiles, compatible with their respective zzso zzso Comparative analyses of zzso activity and zzso zzso in cell lines further sustained a role for zzso in the control of functional zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso might not be family related but zzso and related to the zzso function and the zzso In particular, zzso and zzso could be zzso zzso regulated zzso
