zzso zzso is a vital regulatory component in various cellular zzso including cellular responses to viral zzso As zzso zzso zzso viruses have the capacity to manipulate the zzso zzso cycle to their advantage by zzso zzso proteins including zzso zzso However, how cellular zzso zzso specific viral infections, such as zzso is poorly zzso To examine the role of zzso during zzso infection, we used zzso a small zzso inhibitor of a subset of cellular zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and the human zzso Norwalk virus in a zzso system were significantly inhibited by zzso Chemical zzso identified the cellular zzso zzso as a target of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that also binds to zzso zzso 1 zzso a critical zzso of the unfolded protein response zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso did not alter zzso activity but activated the zzso binding zzso zzso through an zzso zzso In addition, zzso treatment or induction of the zzso also reduced infection of other zzso viruses including zzso virus, zzso virus, and La zzso virus but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso activity partially rescued the zzso effect of zzso Taken together, our studies support a model zzso induction of the zzso through cellular zzso zzso blocks specific viral infections, and suggest that cellular zzso and the zzso represent novel targets for future development of broad spectrum zzso zzso
