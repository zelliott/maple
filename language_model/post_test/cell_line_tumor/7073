zzso zzso is used as a treatment for multiple zzso although its clinical effects remain zzso Here, we investigated whether zzso altered the zzso production of zzso zzso or zzso both identified as key zzso regulating myeloma cell zzso and found that zzso but not zzso induced by zzso attenuated zzso signaling in myeloma cells via an zzso zzso Using reverse zzso chain reaction, expression of the zzso gene zzso and zzso was detected in two and three of eight myeloma cell lines, zzso When myeloma cells were cultured with zzso an increase of zzso and zzso production was detected in zzso and in zzso cells, zzso zzso inhibited the cell growth of these myeloma zzso zzso of an zzso zzso prolonged the zzso of zzso induced by zzso and significantly enhanced the cell growth suppression of zzso on zzso zzso However, a similar blocking of zzso in the presence of zzso did not affect the zzso of zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso but not zzso induced high levels of zzso zzso Although zzso of zzso was also observed in the presence of zzso alone in zzso cells, this expression was completely zzso by the zzso zzso The zzso cell line zzso with zzso showed the protection from the growth suppression of zzso These results suggest that zzso induced by zzso plays an important role in the zzso of myeloma cells via an zzso loop, and zzso zzso by zzso may be at least partially responsible for the zzso zzso of zzso signaling in myeloma zzso
