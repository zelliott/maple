zzso for zzso zzso have improved considerably over the past decade, but the growing therapeutic arsenal has not benefited adult zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso viruses such as zzso zzso virus zzso have recently emerged as a potential treatment of solid tumors and zzso in zzso and in zzso In the current study, we investigated the ability of zzso to lyse primary human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso from patients with zzso zzso zzso primary ATL cells were zzso for zzso and underwent rapid zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso infection showed neither viral replication nor zzso in zzso zzso cells from patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso from normal individuals or in ex zzso cell samples from patients with chronic zzso leukemia zzso Interestingly, zzso of primary zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and specifically with zzso was sufficient to induce limited viral replication and zzso However, at a similar level of zzso zzso zzso replication was increased fourfold in ATL cells compared to activated zzso zzso emphasizing the concept that zzso targets genetic defects unique to tumor cells to facilitate its zzso In conclusion, our findings provide the first essential information for the development of a zzso treatment for zzso
