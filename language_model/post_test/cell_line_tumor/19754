The ability of cancer cells to undergo invasion and migration is a prerequisite for tumor zzso zzso a zzso small zzso and the zzso coiled zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are key regulators of focal zzso zzso contraction, and thus cell zzso zzso of this zzso have been shown to inhibit tumor cell zzso and zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso an orally available inhibitor of zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso modify tumor cell zzso and inhibit tumor cell migration and zzso zzso In addition, we show that zzso inhibited tumor progression in three independent animal zzso In the zzso zzso dissemination model, tumor burden and zzso production were reduced by zzso 50% zzso zzso zzso In the zzso experimental lung zzso model, zzso decreased lung zzso by approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso breast cancer model with zzso there were zzso more zzso mice in the zzso group versus saline control group zzso zzso zzso zzso has been approved for the treatment of cerebral zzso and associated cerebral zzso zzso In patients, zzso is well tolerated without any serious adverse zzso zzso the concept of zzso zzso zzso as an zzso therapy for cancer can now be clinically zzso
