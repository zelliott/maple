zzso the formation and propagation of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso protein in zzso is vital for the development of zzso for this devastating zzso Using our recently developed zzso zzso sensor in zzso cells, we demonstrate that different zzso of zzso zzso zzso namely full-length zzso zzso and the zzso construct zzso zzso the repeat domain, initially accumulate in zzso zzso where they form zzso seeds that subsequently induce the zzso of zzso zzso Using zzso imaging, we confirm that zzso consisting of zzso and zzso zzso are released from cells and demonstrate their potential to spread zzso zzso Our data indicate a greater pathological risk and potential toxicity than zzso suspected for zzso soluble zzso
