zzso zzso is one of the most widely used diagnostic methods in scientific, zzso and biomedical zzso However, while useful for detailed examination of a small number zzso of microscopic entities, conventional optical zzso is incapable of statistically relevant screening of large populations zzso with high precision due to its low zzso and limited digital memory zzso We present an automated zzso zzso optical microscope that overcomes this limitation by performing sensitive zzso image acquisition and nonstop real-time zzso and zzso of zzso during high-speed zzso This is made possible by zzso zzso optical imaging technology, zzso zzso technology, zzso communication technology, and information zzso To show the system's utility, we demonstrate zzso zzso screening of budding zzso and rare breast cancer cells in blood with an unprecedented zzso of zzso and a record false positive rate of one in a zzso
