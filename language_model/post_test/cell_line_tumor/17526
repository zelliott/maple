We previously reported that vascular zzso growth factor zzso expression zzso with vessel density in human zzso zzso cell zzso However, tumor zzso is not controlled simply by the presence of zzso and is likely regulated by several zzso factors produced by tumor and host zzso The goal of the present study was to determine the zzso profile of zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso for zzso zzso derived zzso cell growth factor zzso basic zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso was examined in six zzso zzso cell lines and fresh biopsy specimens from 16 patients with invasive zzso zzso by zzso zzso analyses with zzso against zzso zzso zzso and zzso were performed on archival specimens of 60 normal zzso zzso 11 zzso and 49 zzso of the zzso zzso were stained with zzso zzso and zzso by counting the number of vessels in a zzso field in the most zzso areas of the zzso zzso zzso cell lines and tumor zzso expressed zzso for one or more these zzso factors at various zzso An initial increase in vessel density and enhanced expression of zzso and zzso were observed in zzso zzso zzso density was significantly higher in more advanced zzso zzso and zzso were not expressed in zzso and zzso zzso but expression was increased in late stage zzso cell zzso These findings suggest that the zzso switch is a very early event in the development of invasive zzso Several different zzso factors produced by tumor cells and host cells may regulate zzso during different steps of zzso zzso
