Most zzso bind directly to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso on target cells in zzso but recent research has shown that zzso can also use soluble components in body zzso for indirect binding to target zzso These mechanisms have been identified upon addressing the questions of how to zzso and zzso zzso zzso for human gene and cancer therapy, but the newly identified mechanisms also suggest that the role of body zzso and their components may also be of importance for natural, primary zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso and tear fluid promote binding and infection of zzso type 5 zzso in respiratory and zzso zzso cells, which zzso to the natural zzso of most zzso and that plasma promotes infection by zzso By using a set of binding and infection experiments, we also found that zzso and zzso require zzso factors IX zzso or X (FX) or just zzso respectively, for efficient binding and zzso The zzso of these factors that were required for maximum binding were zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso or zzso of cells with zzso I indicated that the role of cell surface zzso zzso during zzso and zzso zzso binding and infection is mechanistically zzso zzso We conclude that the use of zzso factors by zzso may be of importance not only for the liver zzso seen when administering zzso zzso to the circulation but also during primary infections by zzso viruses of their natural target cell zzso
