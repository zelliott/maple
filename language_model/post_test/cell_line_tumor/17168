We and others have shown that the zzso zzso zzso is zzso in human prostate zzso zzso and invasive zzso compared to normal prostate zzso However, the mechanism for this zzso is not zzso Evidence from our laboratory and others has indicated that zzso growth factors zzso can regulate the expression of certain zzso zzso In addition, human prostate zzso are known to express certain zzso including zzso The purpose of the work in this paper was to determine the mechanism involved in zzso induced zzso expression in prostate zzso zzso 

We tested the ability of zzso zzso to induce zzso expression in prostate zzso cell line, zzso zzso We measured the zzso message by using Northern analyses and protein levels by Western analysis after zzso zzso zzso signaling was investigated using dominant negative zzso for zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed using reporter plasmids of the zzso gene promoter region zzso zzso linked to the zzso zzso gene in the zzso zzso For dominant negative studies zzso dominant negative zzso in zzso zzso or zzso dominant negative zzso in zzso zzso was zzso with the zzso reporter zzso 

zzso zzso significantly induced zzso expression in zzso prostate zzso zzso zzso message increased with zzso treatment compared to that of zzso control zzso zzso zzso by digital image analysis revealed that this increase was twofold over zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso zzso cells with zzso resulted in a twofold to fourfold increase in zzso zzso activity compared with zzso zzso zzso of zzso with human zzso reporter construct and a dominant negative zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso expression in zzso cells was completely inhibited by the zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso zzso zzso is necessary for induction of zzso Further, expression of dominant negative zzso inhibited the zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso 

From these data, we conclude that zzso zzso zzso expression in prostate zzso cells through a zzso mechanism zzso through the zzso and the zzso factor, zzso These results confirm earlier data indicating that zzso zzso and zzso are involved in the signaling leading to the expression of a zzso Our findings support the idea that zzso and zzso factors play an important role in the regulation of zzso in human prostate zzso zzso
