During the past two decades, the knowledge of the molecular mechanism by which zzso exert various functions in different zzso and zzso has evolved zzso Recent reports demonstrated that zzso could decrease the cell growth in several types of cancer cells, including zzso cancer zzso Though experiments explored the possible mechanism of the zzso effect, the exact mechanism is responsible for the effect, which remains zzso The zzso is the main source of the estrogen, zzso zzso is expressed in several zzso cell types, including zzso surface zzso the tissue of origin of approximately zzso of the zzso zzso It was of great interest to analyze the effects of zzso zzso on zzso of zzso cancer cells, and the identification of zzso specific genes involved in zzso proliferation zzso thus may be a clue for understanding the progression of zzso cancer and for the design of new target zzso To zzso the mechanism involved, effects of pharmacological zzso of zzso were studied in human zzso cancer cell line zzso zzso zzso of cellular growth of zzso cells was seen with zzso at zzso higher than zzso zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso cannot block the zzso effect of zzso It was surprising to find that zzso zzso itself can inhibit the growth of zzso cells, and had a collaborative effect with zzso The decreased cell growth induced by zzso was shown to be zzso as analyzed by flow zzso zzso was detected in the zzso zzso cancer cell line but not zzso The expression of zzso was weak, which may partially explain why high but not low dose of zzso needed to induce the zzso of zzso zzso We also observed that membrane zzso zzso zzso have lost growth zzso on zzso cells, which excluded the membrane effect of zzso as previously reported by many zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso were partially protected zzso cells against growth zzso by zzso while inhibitor of zzso zzso enhanced cell death induced by zzso These results showed that zzso is implicated in cellular processes involving zzso
