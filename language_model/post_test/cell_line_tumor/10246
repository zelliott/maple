We previously reported that the degradation of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso results in a zzso in the activity of zzso We also reported that zzso transgenic mice develop zzso zzso tumors that are characterized by an increased zzso zzso of the zzso growth factor binding protein 4 zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso However, whether a link exists between a zzso in zzso activity and zzso of zzso was not zzso 

We analyzed the levels of zzso plasma protein A zzso the zzso of zzso in zzso transgenic mice and found that zzso levels are zzso Further, we found a zzso binding site in zzso 1 of the zzso gene and that both wild type and zzso zzso bind to this zzso However, binding of wild type zzso results in the zzso repression of zzso while binding of zzso zzso results in the zzso zzso of zzso Since zzso mice express wild type zzso and yet show elevated levels of zzso at first, these observations appeared zzso However, further analysis revealed that the zzso in zzso activity in zzso zzso cells does not only abolish the activity of wild type of zzso but actually mimics that of zzso zzso Our results suggest that in absence of zzso the zzso of zzso is increased and like zzso zzso the zzso of zzso is zzso 

These observations revealed a novel function of zzso as a zzso of zzso Further, they suggest that binding of zzso zzso in zzso 1 causes an zzso effect and increases the zzso of zzso zzso these findings indicate that the zzso in zzso function and the increased zzso of zzso we had observed, represent two components of the same pathway, which contributes to the zzso function of zzso
