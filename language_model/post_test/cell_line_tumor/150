To study zzso effects on human zzso cancer zzso tumors in mice by constructing zzso expression zzso containing zzso gene and zzso gene core promoter zzso 

zzso zzso was constructed and identified by means of zzso cutting, zzso and zzso Then, zzso into zzso cells by means of zzso and confirmed by green zzso protein zzso expression under laser zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso gene was tested by zzso Human zzso cancer zzso tumor models in nude mice were established and randomly divided into zzso group received viral zzso solution of zzso by tail vein injection, zzso groups received viral zzso solution of zzso by tail vein injection, and control groups received zzso buffer solution zzso The volume of tumors were measured and compared in each group to evaluated the zzso zzso 

All the constructed zzso of zzso were verified by zzso zzso There were green zzso from zzso of zzso cells zzso by zzso under laser zzso zzso and the zzso expression of zzso gene in zzso cells were also verified by zzso The growth of tumor in zzso group was significantly inhibited compared with those in zzso groups and control groups from the 8th day ( zzso However, there were not significant difference between zzso group and PBS group zzso On the 30th day, the tumors showed zzso necrosis and zzso zzso in each group, especially in zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso of zzso has been constructed successfully and could steady express in zzso cancer cell lines zzso The results shown that it could inhibit significantly the growth of human zzso cancer zzso tumors in mice and shown to be the target of gene zzso
