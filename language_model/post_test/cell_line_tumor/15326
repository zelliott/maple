To further zzso cancer involvement of basic zzso factor 3 zzso after detection of its zzso in gastric tumor zzso 

zzso zzso rates in human gastric tumor tissue samples zzso zzso zzso and adjacent normal tissue zzso zzso zzso specimens as well as in the gastric cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were analyzed via quantitative real-time zzso chain zzso The effect of stable zzso zzso via infection with a small interfering zzso zzso expressing zzso on zzso cells was measured via Western zzso analysis, proliferation zzso cell cycle and zzso profiling by flow zzso as well as colony forming zzso with a zzso zzso zzso 

A significant higher expression of zzso zzso was detected in tumors compared to normal gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso especially in section zzso from female patients compared to male patients, and all tested gastric cancer cell lines expressed high levels of zzso From days 1 to 5, the relative proliferation rates of stable zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso compared to the control, while the percentage of cells arrested in the zzso phase was significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso and the percentages of cells in the S zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly zzso In addition, the colony forming tendency was significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso and the zzso rate increased from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso was silenced in zzso zzso 

zzso expression is associated with enhanced cell zzso reduced cell cycle regulation and zzso and its zzso decreased colony forming and proliferation of gastric cancer zzso
