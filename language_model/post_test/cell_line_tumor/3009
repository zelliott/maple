The aim of this work is to investigate the effect of zzso substitution degree of zzso zzso zzso on cellular zzso zzso and zzso efficiency of zzso complex zzso zzso against zzso and zzso zzso The zzso with three substitution degrees zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso formed zzso zzso and zzso The zzso showed less pH dependency with smaller particle size and higher zzso potential than that of zzso complex zzso zzso at neutral zzso zzso showed stronger cellular zzso than that of zzso or zzso zzso showed higher zzso than zzso and a trend increasing toxicity with substitution degree zzso In zzso cells, the zzso efficiency increased with the substitution degree zzso while the opposite result was observed in zzso zzso zzso modified with zzso could increase its ability to facilitate DNA zzso and its zzso both of which showed the influence on zzso zzso It was able to increase cellular zzso and zzso efficiency of complex zzso in zzso cells to increase zzso substitution of zzso however, the higher sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso led to decreased zzso efficiency due to the increased zzso with zzso substitution zzso The zzso role of cellular zzso or toxicity in affecting zzso efficiency was different in two cell zzso These results provided an important guidepost for further development of zzso zzso complexes as zzso gene zzso
