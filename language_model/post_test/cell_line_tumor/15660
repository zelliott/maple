zzso zzso 6 zzso and zzso domain containing 1 zzso are considered as master regulators for zzso center zzso formation and terminal zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso has been associated with zzso Here, we show for the first time that direct zzso contact between zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso by influencing the expression of a set of zzso zzso regulates the expression of zzso and zzso We identify that, on cell zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression through zzso of zzso and zzso families and zzso zzso of zzso through zzso of zzso family in zzso and zzso zzso We further demonstrate that the zzso family directly controls zzso expression and zzso and zzso directly control zzso expression through targeting their zzso zzso the zzso zzso Our studies define a novel regulatory mechanism in which the zzso through induction of zzso in zzso zzso the regulation of zzso factors, promotes zzso center zzso survival and zzso zzso of zzso may interfere with zzso survival and zzso thus representing a novel molecular zzso as well as a potential therapeutic target in zzso zzso
