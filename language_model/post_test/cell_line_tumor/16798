The potential use of magnetic zzso in biomedical applications has witnessed an exponential growth in recent zzso 

In this study, we used zzso of magnetic zzso as carriers for controlled drug zzso The zzso are formed due to the presence of the block zzso of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso that surround the magnetic core of the zzso The administration of the drug carriers occurs by zzso and the drug is delivered zzso via the pulmonary zzso We tested the delivery of zzso and zzso which are used as models of zzso and zzso drugs, zzso 

The estimated zzso diameters are between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso techniques are two approaches for drug zzso The zzso composition of zzso and initial drug concentration showed a significant effect on both the drug zzso efficiency and release zzso Average drug zzso efficiencies ranged between zzso and zzso zzso loaded samples showed significantly slower release zzso The drug release mechanism is investigated by mathematical curve fitting to different drug release zzso zzso In most cases, the zzso model has shown good correlations zzso of zzso zzso between zzso and zzso with the examined release zzso The estimated release zzso are below zzso which indicates the zzso diffusion zzso For samples with an initial burst effect, the modified zzso model can provide a better understanding of the drug release zzso both in the samples loaded with zzso or those high zzso zzso 

Our work showed prolonged delivery of drugs zzso and zzso by diffusion from zzso with the potential to reduce zzso adverse zzso
