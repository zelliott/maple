zzso line zzso in zzso the gene that encodes the zzso zzso zzso activated in response to DNA damage, have been found to zzso an increased risk of some zzso We have previously reported the presence of the common deleterious zzso and four rare zzso zzso in inherited breast zzso Here, we report that predictions made by zzso analysis on the rare zzso indicate that two of these, zzso zzso and zzso are likely to be zzso We show that the proteins zzso by zzso and zzso are both unstable and zzso zzso at zzso in response to DNA damage, a step necessary for the zzso of zzso zzso is in turn necessary for additional zzso and full zzso of the zzso A second rare zzso zzso is zzso at zzso but fails to show a mobility shift on DNA damage, suggesting that it fails to become further zzso and hence fully zzso Our results indicate that zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins and are therefore likely to be zzso The findings from the zzso analysis correlate well with predictions made by zzso zzso In addition, the results imply that these zzso as well as zzso cannot act in a zzso manner to cause cancer, and zzso in association with these zzso may be due to zzso
