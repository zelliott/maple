zzso organize zzso zzso zzso and are comprised of zzso surrounded by ordered zzso zzso zzso are zzso structures composed of zzso and as zzso bodies they template the formation of zzso zzso in zzso assembly can lead to zzso and zzso zzso The assembly of zzso requires a set of zzso zzso It is initiated at the zzso transition by zzso and zzso which help recruit zzso and zzso to the vicinity of the mother zzso to organize the zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso assembly and zzso in zzso While zzso integrity is maintained by zzso and zzso through zzso stabilization, zzso zzso requires zzso and is restricted by zzso and zzso How strict control of zzso length is achieved remains zzso Here, we show that zzso and zzso are required to zzso zzso (but not zzso zzso or zzso to zzso zzso associates with zzso and zzso and depletion of any of these proteins results in short zzso Furthermore, zzso or zzso zzso results in excessive zzso zzso a process dependent on zzso zzso and zzso Our findings identify a shared function for these proteins in zzso length zzso
