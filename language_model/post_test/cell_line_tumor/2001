zzso zzso 1 zzso which encodes a component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex, has been identified as a tumor zzso in many zzso Nonetheless, the role of zzso in gastric tumor progression is not known zzso The aim of this research was to investigate the effect of zzso in the zzso and progression of gastric zzso 

zzso tumor zzso with different differentiation levels from clinical gastric zzso samples and adjacent control normal zzso were zzso zzso levels of zzso were detected by quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and Western zzso zzso cancer cell line zzso was zzso with zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso Cell proliferation activities were assessed by zzso cell count and cell cycle were detected by flow zzso zzso cell zzso were measured by zzso and zzso cell migration and zzso were evaluated by wound healing and zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso genes including zzso zzso zzso D1 and zzso A, zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso and zzso genes including zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso and tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso 1 zzso were detected by quantitative zzso and Western zzso 

zzso expression levels were lower in gastric zzso compared with adjacent control normal zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells inhibited its proliferation and zzso but increased zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso and proliferation related genes zzso and zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso A, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and there was no significant change in zzso 3 zzso 

zzso plays a key role in gastric zzso by affecting zzso zzso and zzso
