The zzso vaccination is burdened by low recruitment rate of zzso administered in zzso primed DC in liver zzso and lack of zzso them continuously in large zzso zzso it seemed rational to create a model of in zzso vaccination with specifically primed zzso DC and zzso T zzso being continuously supplied to the liver vascular zzso The question we raised was whether zzso zzso zzso DC flowing to liver zzso could adhere to and be zzso to tumor zzso We zzso rats with zzso tumor cells and zzso them with zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso population was isolated, its zzso by zzso adherence to zzso cells and zzso were zzso zzso cells home to the liver reaching it via zzso zzso These cells can be retrieved by simple zzso of liver zzso zzso zzso zzso cells - zzso Their adherence to and zzso against zzso cells were zzso Moreover, in zzso adherence of zzso zzso cells and zzso to zzso liver tumor sections was zzso We found that in zzso zzso of zzso population containing DC, zzso cells and zzso with zzso cells and stimulation with zzso activated these cells but did not significantly increase the zzso against zzso zzso There was also no increase in zzso of zzso zzso of zzso DC and zzso to liver zzso zzso on zzso was higher than to the adjacent liver zzso However, it was more expressed on tumor zzso than zzso zzso The level of zzso zzso cells zzso immune response was found only slightly increased after zzso Taken together, in the model of in zzso zzso against zzso cells, low level of zzso DC and zzso zzso zzso as well as adherence rate to tumor cells were zzso More effective methods of zzso zzso DC overcoming the zzso mechanisms should be looked zzso
