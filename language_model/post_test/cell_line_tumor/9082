Cell zzso and zzso depend strongly on the interactions between cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso onto artificial adhesive surfaces, cells first zzso and zzso extensively as they zzso At the molecular level, the interaction of zzso zzso with the zzso has been shown to initiate a complex cascade of signaling events zzso which subsequently triggers cellular zzso changes and results in the generation of zzso forces zzso Here, we focus on the early stages of cell spreading and probe their dynamics by quantitative zzso and zzso manipulation with a variety of cell types and adhesive surfaces, zzso zzso and zzso zzso We find that the dynamics of zzso follows a universal zzso zzso This is in sharp contrast with the common belief that spreading is regulated by either the diffusion of zzso receptors toward the growing adhesive patch zzso or by zzso zzso zzso To explain this, we propose a simple quantitative and zzso theory that models cells as viscous adhesive cortical shells enclosing a less viscous zzso Thus, although cell spreading is driven by zzso zzso zzso it is zzso limited by its zzso structure and material zzso
