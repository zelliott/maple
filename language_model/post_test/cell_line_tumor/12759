zzso sequence comparisons between individuals are usually restricted to the analysis of single zzso zzso zzso While the interrogation of zzso is efficient, they are not the only form of divergence between zzso In this report, we expand the scope of zzso detection by investigating the occurrence of double zzso zzso zzso and triple zzso zzso zzso in which two or three consecutive zzso are altered compared to the reference zzso We have found such zzso and zzso throughout two complete zzso and eight zzso Within zzso these novel zzso are zzso amongst zzso zzso nearly all zzso and zzso result in a change in zzso acid sequence and, in some cases, two adjacent zzso acids are zzso zzso and zzso represent a potentially important new source of genetic variation which may zzso human disease and they should be included in future medical zzso zzso As a confirmation of the damaging nature of zzso we have identified changes in the zzso of a zzso cell line that are important in zzso zzso We have found a zzso causing a single zzso acid change in zzso and a zzso causing a zzso of zzso
