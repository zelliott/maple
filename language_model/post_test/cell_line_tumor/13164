Rapid zzso trafficking of zzso nuclear hormone zzso zzso from the zzso to the nucleus is an extensively studied model for zzso retrograde cargo transport employed in constructive zzso and many other cellular zzso Unfortunately, potent and selective zzso zzso of this process are zzso which has restricted pharmacological zzso We describe here the development and validation of a zzso zzso screening zzso zzso to identify zzso of the rapid zzso retrograde zzso of zzso zzso nuclear hormone zzso green fluorescent fusion protein zzso into the zzso of zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso We selected zzso cells, because they express zzso under the control of a zzso zzso promoter and are exceptionally amenable to image acquisition and analysis zzso Initially, we investigated the zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells under zzso and zzso control to determine the optimal conditions to measure zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso on the zzso automated imaging zzso We then zzso the zzso into a zzso format and validated the performance of the zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso in our zzso zzso signal window and zzso validation zzso The molecular zzso heat shock protein 90 zzso plays an essential role in the regulation of zzso steroid binding affinity and zzso retrograde trafficking to the zzso We verified that the zzso zzso zzso captured the zzso zzso of zzso nuclear zzso by zzso a zzso zzso that selectively blocks the binding and zzso of zzso by zzso We screened the zzso compound library of zzso active compounds set in the zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso and used the zzso zzso data to eliminate zzso compounds and fluorescent zzso We identified five qualified hits that inhibited the rapid retrograde trafficking of zzso in a zzso zzso Bay zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The data presented here demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso provides an effective zzso screen and support the proposition that screening a larger library of diversity compounds will yield novel zzso zzso that will enable the further exploration of zzso retrograde transport of cargo along zzso a process which is essential to the zzso and function of all zzso
