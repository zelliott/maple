Human zzso zzso zzso class II molecules are zzso zzso that present peptides to zzso zzso The zzso zzso contributes to assemble zzso class zzso zzso We investigated the effect of zzso either zzso or zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso The delivery of zzso or zzso short hairpin zzso zzso in a zzso cell line caused a decrease by up to zzso and zzso at the respective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso decreased to zzso zzso B zzso and zzso gamma zzso production in comparison with zzso zzso with zzso expressing a zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso did not induce zzso zzso of zzso B zzso levels or high zzso zzso by zzso zzso vs zzso expressing zzso zzso targeting of zzso expression prevented more efficiently an zzso zzso response in comparison with the zzso of the expression of zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso molecules might contribute to the development of new zzso zzso therapeutic zzso
