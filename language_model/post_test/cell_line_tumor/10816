zzso resistance zzso is a zzso highly relevant zzso Under chemotherapy many tumors show an increasing resistance towards the applied zzso and to a certain extent also towards other zzso An important molecular cause of this phenomenon is an increased expression of zzso zzso The functional relationship between high expression levels and chemotherapy resistance makes these zzso and zzso zzso related zzso proteins to interesting therapeutic zzso We here wanted to systematically analyze, whether these proteins are tumor specific zzso which could be targeted zzso 

Using the reverse zzso approach, 30 zzso restricted zzso and zzso derived peptides zzso were zzso zzso T cell lines grew well and mainly contained activated zzso zzso zzso specificity and zzso restriction were proven in zzso analyses and in zzso tests against zzso loaded target cells for a total of twelve peptides derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Of note, two of these zzso are shared between zzso and zzso as well as zzso and zzso However, comparably weak zzso activities were additionally observed against zzso tumor cells even after zzso of zzso protein expression by in zzso zzso 

Taken together, these data demonstrate that human T cells can be zzso towards zzso and zzso there is no absolute zzso zzso However, our data also hint towards rather low zzso tumor cell processing and presentation of zzso in the context of zzso zzso zzso we conclude that zzso and zzso proteins must be considered as weak tumor specific zzso least for zzso zzso Their direct contribution to zzso implies however, that it is worth to further pursue this zzso
