LIGHT zzso name of which is derived from zzso to zzso exhibits zzso zzso competes with zzso zzso virus zzso D for zzso zzso virus entry zzso zzso and expressed by T zzso is a member of the zzso necrosis factor zzso that is involved in various inflammatory zzso We aimed to estimate the relevance of plasma LIGHT levels as a zzso for zzso zzso zzso In order to understand the putative role of LIGHT in zzso zzso we also investigate the effects of LIGHT on a zzso cell line, human acute zzso zzso cell line zzso We examined plasma LIGHT levels, total serum zzso serum value of zzso and peripheral blood zzso counts in patients with zzso and healthy zzso The effects of LIGHT on zzso and zzso in zzso cells were also zzso The plasma zzso of LIGHT in zzso patients were significantly higher than those in healthy individuals and the zzso decreased as the symptoms were improved by zzso The LIGHT plasma zzso correlated with zzso levels and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso In addition, LIGHT stimulation increased expression of zzso and induced production of zzso in zzso zzso zzso was zzso the zzso level increased and the zzso level decreased in zzso cells zzso with zzso compared to zzso control zzso These results suggest that plasma LIGHT levels may be one of the promising zzso for zzso
