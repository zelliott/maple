Several zzso zzso zzso were investigated as carriers of zzso for PET zzso The most widely used zzso for zzso labeling of zzso is zzso zzso zzso even though this complex exhibits only moderate in zzso zzso In this study, we prepared a series of alternative zzso zzso labeled with zzso measured in zzso zzso binding affinities in human breast cancer zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso and compared their in zzso stability in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared using zzso zzso as a zzso zzso The zzso zzso was selected since it binds with high affinity to the zzso which is zzso on human breast cancer zzso A convenient synthetic approach for the attachment of zzso to peptides on solid support is also zzso To facilitate the attachment of the zzso and zzso to the zzso via an zzso bond, a zzso zzso was introduced at the zzso of zzso The partially protected zzso zzso or zzso was then coupled to the resulting zzso zzso acid zzso with zzso on zzso After zzso and zzso the zzso were labeled with zzso using zzso in zzso M ammonium zzso buffer at 100 zzso for 15 zzso zzso efficacy was zzso for all zzso zzso was incubated an additional 150 zzso at 100 zzso to achieve this high zzso zzso activities varied from 76 to 101 zzso Competition zzso on zzso cells showed that all zzso complexes retained high affinity for the zzso All zzso zzso were stable for over 20 h when incubated at 37 zzso in mouse plasma zzso However, in zzso only 37% of the zzso complex remained intact after 20 h while the zzso complex was completely zzso In contrast, both zzso and zzso zzso remained stable during the 20 h time zzso Our results indicate that it is possible to successfully zzso zzso with zzso on solid zzso Our data also show that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are promising zzso for PET imaging of many human zzso zzso the zzso zzso
