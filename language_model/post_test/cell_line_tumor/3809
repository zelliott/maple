zzso zzso zzso are unique plasma membrane zzso zzso this zzso directly to the zzso zzso The three HAS zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressed in zzso cells differ in their zzso properties and regulation by external zzso but clearly distinct functions have not been zzso To overview the expression of different HAS zzso during embryonic development and their zzso zzso we zzso mouse embryonic samples and cultured cells with HAS zzso zzso their distribution to zzso zzso Their zzso zzso was further studied by zzso fusion zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed throughout the development in the zzso of zzso origin, like heart and zzso but also for example during the maturation of zzso and zzso zzso In general, zzso for one or several zzso correlated with zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was most zzso both zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso especially in early zzso zzso and zzso While zzso cells were mostly negative for zzso zzso zzso became HAS positive during zzso All HAS zzso showed zzso zzso both in tissue sections and cultured cells, while plasma membrane zzso was also zzso often in cellular zzso zzso had brightest signal in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso whereas most of the zzso zzso zzso was localized in the zzso This differential pattern was also observed with zzso zzso The large proportion of zzso zzso suggests that HAS forms a reserve that is transported to the plasma membrane for rapid zzso of zzso zzso
