The design of a broad application tumor vaccine requires the identification of tumor zzso expressed in a majority of tumors of various zzso We questioned whether the major zzso heat shock protein zzso (also known as zzso a protein frequently zzso in human tumors of various zzso origins, but not in most zzso normal zzso constitutes a tumor zzso We selected the zzso and zzso peptides from the sequence of the human zzso zzso that had a high affinity for zzso These peptides were able to trigger a zzso response in zzso in zzso zzso mice and in zzso in zzso healthy zzso zzso and zzso human and zzso zzso recognized human tumor cells zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso showed that these zzso zzso are targets of an immune response in many zzso breast cancer zzso zzso is a tumor zzso and the zzso peptides zzso and zzso could be used to raise a zzso response against tumors of various zzso
