We used flow zzso and a zzso dye zzso zzso to isolate a side population zzso of cells with stem cell characteristics from the human pancreatic zzso cell line, zzso zzso zzso combined zzso mouse zzso experiments showed that SP cells were enriched in tumor initiating capability compared with zzso zzso zzso SP cells were able to differentiate into daughter cells and zzso cells, through zzso zzso Our study demonstrated that SP cells had high zzso both in zzso and in zzso SP cells also showed significantly higher levels of zzso expression for zzso zzso and zzso when compared to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso tumors derived from injected SP cells and treated with zzso had more zzso cells than zzso zzso We therefore suggest that these SP cells from the zzso cell line were enriched with cancer stem zzso
