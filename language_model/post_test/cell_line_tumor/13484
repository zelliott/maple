Drug resistance remains a major clinical obstacle to successful treatment in breast cancer patients, and the evidence of zzso involvement in cancer drug resistance has been emerging zzso However, the role of zzso zzso in modulating zzso of breast cancer remains largely zzso Here, we investigated the zzso expression in tumor specimens obtained from zzso breast cancer patients who received zzso chemotherapy by quantitative real-time zzso zzso zzso was observed in zzso as compared to zzso In addition, zzso expression was observed to be zzso over zzso in human breast cancer cells resistant to zzso zzso as compared to the parental zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso of zzso mimics in breast cancer cells could enhance the zzso to zzso and reduce expression of zzso resistance 1 zzso and zzso Moreover, our study demonstrated that restoration of zzso in zzso cells could increase zzso zzso zzso determined by flow zzso Taken together, our findings suggest that zzso may act as a promising therapeutic target for improvement of responsiveness to chemotherapy in breast zzso
