zzso of the neural cell zzso zzso zzso on zzso cells of zzso zzso and zzso origin has been reported, but its role for tumor cell recognition by the immune system remained uncertain so zzso We have studied the zzso of the natural killer zzso cell line zzso and zzso zzso cells from different donors, against zzso and zzso zzso While the pancreatic zzso zzso and the zzso zzso showed no enhanced zzso to zzso zzso after zzso zzso de zzso zzso expression in zzso cervical zzso zzso zzso and the multiple myeloma lines zzso and zzso was associated with significantly decreased zzso by zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso to zzso target cells was able to reverse the reduced zzso zzso zzso formation of zzso tumor cells with zzso cells was blocked and could be restored by zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules which might engage in zzso zzso or zzso had no apparent zzso zzso The known zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also not directly involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell surface expression was zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in killer cell immune zzso zzso Its zzso may therefore contribute to the reduced zzso of zzso target zzso We conclude that zzso expression of zzso on tumor cells of different zzso origin can lead to zzso of target cell recognition and zzso by zzso zzso
