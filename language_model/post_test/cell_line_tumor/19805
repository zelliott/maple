zzso has been shown to have zzso zzso We previously found that zzso inhibited growth and induced zzso in 2 human melanoma cell zzso In this study we determined whether zzso would inhibit human melanoma zzso zzso zzso mice received control diets or diets containing 110 zzso or 263 zzso zzso 2 zzso prior to subcutaneous injection of the tumor zzso zzso growth was measured during a zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso by zzso zzso of 75 zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso were implanted into the mice, next to newly zzso tumors, and tumor growth zzso We also determined the effect of a major zzso zzso zzso on experimental lung zzso zzso at any concentration tested, did not have a statistically significant effect on tumor zzso The higher levels of zzso tested zzso in food or 100 zzso in zzso zzso tended to stimulate tumor growth zzso zzso zzso zzso and its major zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found in serum, liver, skin, and tumor zzso zzso did not affect the in zzso growth of a zzso melanoma cell line, but significantly zzso the number of lung zzso when these melanoma cells were directly injected into the tail vein of the zzso These results suggest that zzso is not likely to be useful in the treatment of melanoma and that the effects of zzso on cell cultures may not translate to the whole animal zzso
