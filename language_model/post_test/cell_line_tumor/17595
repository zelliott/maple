The zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the brain is a critical pathological process in Alzheimer's disease zzso Recent studies have implicated zzso zzso in zzso in zzso To investigate the generation of zzso zzso we established human zzso zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso precursor protein zzso Swedish zzso zzso zzso plus zzso 1 zzso and zzso 2 zzso zzso or familial zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso acid extracts by sensitive Western zzso zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso were zzso higher in cells expressing Swedish zzso compared with those expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso ratios were approximately zzso in these zzso These ratios were increased markedly in cells expressing zzso zzso or zzso compared with those expressing their zzso counterparts, consistent with the observed changes in zzso zzso zzso High total levels of zzso zzso were observed in cells expressing zzso zzso because of a marked zzso of zzso zzso zzso additionally revealed more intense zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells than in zzso cells, which was partially zzso with zzso for the zzso network and zzso The data collectively indicate that zzso zzso promote the zzso of zzso zzso which appears to be localized in multiple zzso zzso
