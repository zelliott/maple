A surface coating based on zzso acid zzso was designed and acted as a zzso for an zzso agent, zzso zzso Absolutely no chemical modification of zzso or of the drug was needed and the final architecture was obtained in an extremely simple way using the zzso zzso The zzso dose available for human zzso zzso cells zzso seeded on the films could be finely zzso Moreover, the accessibility of the drugs was controlled by adding on the top of the drug zzso a capping made of synthetic zzso zzso This capping was also required to allow zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity was maintained after embedding in the zzso zzso and cellular viability could be reduced by about zzso 96 h after zzso The strategy described in this paper could be valuable for various other zzso zzso
