The feasibility of zzso zzso zzso expression detection with zzso zzso zzso zzso was investigated in the zzso leukemia cell line, zzso and its zzso zzso cell line, zzso 

The expression level of zzso zzso was analyzed by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso of the zzso resistance zzso phenomenon was assessed via cellular zzso of zzso zzso a known zzso for zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso complementary to the sequences located at zzso to 14 of zzso zzso and its corresponding sense zzso were zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso via an zzso group linked to the terminal zzso at the zzso end at pH zzso The zzso complexes at zzso of zzso zzso were reacted with zzso at pH 5 for 1 zzso The zzso affinity of labeled zzso was evaluated with zzso zzso liquid zzso following incubation with the complementary zzso Cellular zzso of labeled zzso was examined in zzso Furthermore, enhancing effects of synthetic zzso carriers zzso on zzso delivery of zzso were zzso 

zzso cells displayed intense zzso zzso expression in comparison with zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was higher than that in zzso zzso zzso zzso up to zzso zzso was achieved via zzso of added zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso The zzso affinity of zzso zzso was preserved at approximately zzso irrespective of specific zzso Cellular zzso of zzso zzso did not differ from that of sense zzso in either zzso cells or zzso zzso However, zzso carrier incorporation significantly increased zzso delivery of zzso moreover, specific zzso of zzso zzso was demonstrated in zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso at high specific zzso and specific zzso of zzso zzso in drug-resistant cells may facilitate future gene imaging of zzso zzso
