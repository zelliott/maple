zzso to zzso cells is a key process in infection caused by zzso zzso coli zzso Several zzso factors that mediate the binding of zzso to zzso cells have been zzso but the receptors involved in their recognition are not fully zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins might act as receptors involved in the recognition of enteric zzso including zzso In this study, we sought to characterize the binding of zzso zzso to zzso proteins commonly present in the zzso We found that zzso zzso strains as well as other clinical zzso zzso more abundantly to surfaces coated with zzso zzso and collagen zzso Further characterization of this zzso by using zzso raised against the zzso putative major zzso zzso and by addition of zzso showed that a reduced binding of zzso to zzso proteins was observed in a long polar zzso zzso zzso We also found that the two regulators, zzso and zzso had an effect in zzso zzso binding to zzso supporting the roles of these tightly regulated zzso as adherence zzso zzso zzso major zzso bound to all of the zzso proteins zzso Finally, increased bacterial adherence was observed when zzso cells, zzso with zzso zzso were infected with zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that the interaction of zzso and zzso proteins contributes to the zzso colonization of the gastrointestinal zzso
