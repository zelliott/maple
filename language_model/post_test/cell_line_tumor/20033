A device for the capture and recollection of live target cells is zzso The platform was a silicon zzso zzso modified with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso egg zzso through a zzso zzso acid zzso zzso The modification processes of the zzso zzso surface were monitored by zzso transform infrared zzso total reflection zzso and zzso atomic force zzso zzso The attachment of zzso and its release reaction on the zzso surface via the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were observed directly by zzso The results of an zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso of the complex of zzso with the secondary zzso zzso hybrid zzso zzso from the zzso surface occurs with minimum zzso Furthermore, it was possible to collect zzso cells selectively that express zzso on their cell zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso facilitated the effective release of living zzso cells whose viability was verified by zzso experiments using zzso zzso Moreover, it was possible to zzso the recovered zzso This methodology represents an effective strategy for zzso intact target cells in the biological and medicinal sciences and related zzso
