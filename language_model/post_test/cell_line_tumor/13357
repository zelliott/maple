zzso signaling is important for both normal zzso processes and pathology of various zzso zzso zzso potential zzso 7 zzso gene has been reported to be a potential candidate for calcium zzso The present study aimed to investigate the possible role of zzso channels in zzso in rat zzso leukemia mast cell line zzso which is widely used in mast zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting rat zzso gene was constructed and zzso Cellular survival was assessed by zzso Cell zzso was evaluated by flow zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso efficiency by zzso zzso was about zzso zzso with zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso expression both at zzso and protein zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso led to significantly decreased cellular survival rates and increased zzso rates in zzso zzso 

This study indicates that zzso is involved in the zzso process in zzso zzso
