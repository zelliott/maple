zzso zzso plays a crucial role in zzso zzso Although it is well established that various cellular processes are modulated by DNA damage, whether the DNA damage signaling zzso regulates zzso has not yet been zzso In this study, we found that zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso key zzso for zzso were dramatically decreased upon zzso and zzso zzso and zzso promoter activities were also suppressed by zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso gene zzso are zzso upon DNA zzso We also found that the protein level of zzso which is a critical zzso factor for zzso gene zzso is decreased upon zzso The decreased zzso protein level was abolished by zzso a potent zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is zzso through the zzso zzso upon zzso These results reveal a novel link between zzso metabolism and the DNA damage signaling zzso and suggest a possible role for zzso and zzso in the DNA damage zzso
