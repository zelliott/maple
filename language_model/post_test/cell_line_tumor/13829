zzso zzso deposits and zzso of zzso and zzso are found in several common neurodegenerative zzso Recent evidence indicates that small zzso are the most relevant toxic zzso zzso While zzso zzso formation is zzso factors influencing zzso zzso and molecular interactions of zzso and zzso are not well zzso 

We used a novel approach applying zzso zzso zzso to investigate the influence of zzso zzso and metal zzso on zzso zzso formation and its zzso with zzso at the level of individual zzso We show that zzso at zzso relevant zzso and zzso zzso by zzso exert synergistic effects on the formation of a distinct zzso zzso zzso species even at zzso protein zzso Moreover, zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso enhanced both formation of mixed zzso and recruitment of zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings provide a new perspective on interactions of zzso zzso metal zzso and the formation of potentially toxic zzso species, and zzso molecular zzso between different zzso pathways involved in zzso
