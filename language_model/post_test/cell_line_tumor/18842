A simple zzso zzso system using zzso cell and zzso zzso cell, which mimic zzso processes occurring in humans such as zzso through the zzso and zzso zzso zzso involving zzso in both the zzso and liver cells, was used to investigate the toxicity of model chemical, zzso zzso It was found that both zzso and zzso zzso cells can metabolize zzso to toxic zzso including zzso zzso an immediate precursor to the zzso ultimate zzso of zzso zzso zzso possibly zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso However, in a zzso zzso system, no significant reduction of zzso zzso cell viability was found, although an approximately 50% reduction in viability was observed in pure zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso cells transfer zzso and its toxic zzso back to the zzso side, thus decreasing the zzso of toxic zzso including zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso These results appear to be correlated with in zzso data on the effects of orally administered zzso that is, low zzso zzso in the rats and almost no acute lethal toxicity in rats or zzso As such, the simple zzso zzso system can provide more accurate information regarding the toxic actions of the hazardous chemicals in humans than a pure culture system, as it also gives the final toxicity as a result of many complicated phenomena such as selective zzso in the zzso and zzso in the zzso and zzso
