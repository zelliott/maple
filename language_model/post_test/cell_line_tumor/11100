zzso can play a critical role in the development of breast zzso zzso which zzso the formation of aromatic zzso zzso from zzso zzso is regarded to be responsible for the cancer local production of zzso Studies not only from zzso zzso breast cancer cells, but also transgenic zzso which zzso zzso demonstrated that in zzso produced zzso plays more important roles than circulating zzso in breast tumor promotion and zzso zzso zzso have been implicated in the zzso process, which play important roles in the aggressiveness of cancer cells including invasion of adjacent tissue and zzso to distant zzso zzso of zzso and 9 may be zzso by zzso in hormonal dependent breast zzso since tumor zzso can stimulate breast cancer growth and progression in both an zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that causes relatively high zzso concentration in zzso may be positively related to zzso and 9 zzso indicate worse prognosis in breast zzso and maybe insensitive to tamoxifen zzso In the present study, we studied the expression of zzso activity and zzso in human breast zzso both in zzso and in zzso In human breast zzso cell lines including zzso zzso and zzso the expression of zzso levels both in zzso and protein activity was related to zzso and zzso In zzso breast cancer samples, we demonstrated that zzso expressions were strongly associated with zzso and zzso zzso It was interesting to observe that the positive relationship was only present in the zzso and/or zzso positive zzso This may indicate that both zzso and zzso were up regulated by zzso produced by zzso through zzso So in zzso therapy, either blocking the zzso by tamoxifen or zzso the zzso by zzso zzso for example zzso may both inhibit tumor growth and lower the zzso potential especially in zzso positive breast cancer patients by means of zzso of zzso
