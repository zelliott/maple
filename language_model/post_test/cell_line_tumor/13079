zzso dots zzso have shown great development potential in zzso imaging and monitoring of cancer cells in zzso because of their unique optical zzso However, the key issue of whether or not zzso cancer cells affect the zzso zzso and in zzso zzso ability has not been zzso The primary issue is if the results obtained from the zzso zzso of zzso tumors are zzso Here, we applied zzso zzso fluorescent zzso to label human zzso zzso cell zzso cell line zzso We performed in zzso zzso ability zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso capability zzso detected by flow zzso and plate clone formation experiment, and found that zzso zzso fluorescent zzso labeling did not affect the growth, zzso zzso and zzso ability of those cancer zzso Our study provides scientific foundation to support the application of zzso fluorescent zzso in zzso imaging and monitoring of cancer cells in zzso
