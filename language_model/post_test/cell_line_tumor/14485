Human zzso zzso zzso zzso mediate zzso secondary active transport of zzso zzso and zzso drugs into zzso Six zzso zzso and one zzso were assessed for their abilities to inhibit zzso transport in the zzso zzso zzso producing zzso zzso zzso or zzso Six of the zzso inhibited zzso with zzso zzso whereas only two zzso inhibited zzso with zzso zzso and none inhibited zzso To assess if the zzso zzso were also zzso currents evoked were measured in zzso of zzso zzso producing zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso inward zzso indicating zzso activity, were generated with zzso three of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso none of the zzso in zzso zzso and zzso all of the zzso in zzso zzso Four were not, or were only very zzso transported by zzso The zzso zzso zzso 3) and zzso zzso 4) were the most active zzso of zzso transport in zzso zzso and were an order of magnitude more effective than zzso a known zzso transport inhibitor of zzso Neither was toxic to cultured human zzso zzso cells, and both protected zzso cell lines with zzso but not with zzso against zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were potent zzso of zzso with negligible transportability and little apparent zzso suggesting that pending further evaluation for toxicity against normal cells, they may have utility in protecting normal zzso zzso from zzso resulting from zzso zzso drugs that enter via zzso
