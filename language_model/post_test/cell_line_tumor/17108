zzso zzso a zzso zzso is one of the most commonly used zzso drugs for the treatment of gastrointestinal zzso Some studies reported that the zzso of zzso is zzso in large part, by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso an essential DNA synthetic zzso The aim of this study was to determine if zzso zzso technology could augment the zzso of human cancer cells to zzso The full length coding region of zzso zzso was zzso cloned into the zzso expression zzso zzso and zzso into zzso zzso The expression and activity of zzso were significantly suppressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso of zzso zzso alone inhibited the cellular growth in zzso The zzso to zzso was significantly increased in the zzso zzso The 50% zzso values of zzso on zzso were approximately one forth that on parental zzso The zzso of zzso to zzso was also confirmed in a nude mice zzso The tumor growth of zzso cells was suppressed significantly more than that of zzso cells by the zzso The expression and activity of zzso in human colon cancer cells were effectively inhibited by zzso zzso treatment and the effect of zzso to cancer cells can be zzso The zzso zzso technology could be promising for treatments of gastrointestinal zzso
