Controlled zzso protein degradation is crucial for the maintenance of normal cell zzso An evolving concept claims that zzso in the exact timely degradation of proteins involved in growth control, zzso signaling and differentiation contribute to zzso This tightly regulated process is facilitated by the zzso zzso system, a zzso complex, and zzso of this zzso have already been developed as potential zzso zzso In order to generate zzso protein expression patterns of tumor cells and to provide an zzso tool we applied two-dimensional zzso zzso followed by mass zzso zzso with zzso zzso in ten individual tumor cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso widely used in tumor zzso A series of 39 zzso proteins was zzso identified by this zzso approach, zzso proteins of the zzso core complex, the zzso regulatory complex, the zzso regulator, components of the zzso zzso and zzso Construction of individual protein maps by zzso and mass zzso provides an zzso tool and reference base for studying the pivotal importance of the zzso and other zzso zzso in tumor cells, independent of zzso availability and zzso This preliminary database enables for designing studies in this area of research and reveals proteins that can be used as targets for new therapeutic zzso
