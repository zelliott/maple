zzso is among the most popular insect control agents in zzso countries such as zzso As a member of the zzso zzso group, zzso is notorious for its potential for conversion into highly zzso zzso zzso Due to the fact that the stomach has been identified as the major target for zzso zzso this investigation used a human gastric cell line, zzso in order to obtain results pertinent to the authentic adverse effects of this compound on human zzso This report reveals that at dose levels zzso zzso or zzso zzso cell growth, a zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso induced significant amounts of DNA zzso Most of the damaged DNA was repaired within 24 h after treatment zzso such that an outcome with a significant induction of zzso aberrations was not zzso Gene zzso and zzso independence, on the other hand, were significantly induced by this same zzso In conclusion, exposure to low doses of zzso zzso is not zzso nor zzso zzso has the potential to increase genetic instability and, possibly as a result, to enhance the zzso potential of treated zzso We suggest that although the damaged DNA was repaired during the transient zzso arrest period, it was probably not done in an appropriate way which would preserve the original genetic zzso
