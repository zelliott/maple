The zzso zzso of the dye zzso results in the rapid and unprecedented zzso synthesis of highly zzso representatives of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso systems, with the last two reflecting the core skeleton of the zzso marine natural products zzso and zzso and a ring zzso zzso The zzso compounds zzso whose structures were confirmed through zzso X-ray zzso analysis, arise from sequential zzso zzso zzso and in some cases, ring zzso zzso zzso studies on controlling the reaction path zzso and the potential reaction mechanisms, are also zzso zzso biological activity studies with these new zzso derivatives indicated promising in zzso zzso activity as well as good zzso zzso The chemistry described is new for the zzso zzso and cascade reactions from this readily available and cheap starting material should be more broadly zzso in the synthesis of additional new zzso systems difficult to access by other zzso
