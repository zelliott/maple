zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of alpha zzso zzso proteins and zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso of peptides zzso by these proteins to zzso zzso thus zzso zzso immune zzso zzso zzso is considered as a major regulator of innate and acquired immune zzso zzso we show that zzso molecules are expressed by human zzso zzso zzso cells zzso as indicated by zzso studies in minor zzso zzso biopsy zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as by the analyses of human long-term cultured zzso zzso lines zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso cell zzso In these cell lines zzso expression was evaluated by zzso flow zzso and zzso zzso Standard zzso zzso revealed that zzso and zzso are capable to bind and zzso the zzso zzso alpha zzso This zzso is specific, as zzso by zzso studies using zzso alpha zzso and a blocking zzso against human zzso zzso zzso our findings indicate that zzso functionally express zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso might be involved in the presentation of zzso zzso in zzso
