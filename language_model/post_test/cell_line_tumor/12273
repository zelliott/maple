zzso zzso zzso and zzso production are important contributors to zzso in both type 1 and type 2 zzso In diabetic humans and animal models, elevated levels of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso are observed in several zzso Our study shows that activity of zzso is significantly elevated in zzso of zzso or zzso type 1 diabetic zzso Using cultured zzso cells, we find that zzso of zzso enhances expression of zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, our studies demonstrate that zzso of zzso stimulates zzso of zzso protein alpha zzso at zzso 21 and increases its zzso activity in the context of zzso gene zzso Our results indicate that zzso mediates zzso zzso zzso in liver zzso
