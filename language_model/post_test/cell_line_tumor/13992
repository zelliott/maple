The potential of zzso knockout by zzso zzso zzso to affect zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cancer zzso cells with a zzso zzso zzso was zzso 

zzso zzso with zzso complementary to zzso and control zzso zzso were carried out in zzso 133 zzso In zzso proliferation was evaluated by cell counting of 10 random fields and by the zzso zzso A single pulse of 100 zzso zzso was added to each well and the cells were incubated for an additional zzso zzso was calculated as the ratio of zzso and zzso cells versus viable cells by flow zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso cells with zzso decreased the cell number by up to zzso zzso zzso zzso The proliferation rate also decreased up to zzso zzso zzso zzso without inducing zzso zzso rendered zzso cells sensitive to treatment with zzso inducing zzso in zzso of cells, as compared to zzso of cells zzso with the reverse zzso gene of zzso zzso and less than zzso of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso knockout with zzso complementary to zzso zzso sequences inhibited proliferation and increased zzso in the zzso cell line zzso
