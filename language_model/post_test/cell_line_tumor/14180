zzso are specialized structures at the ends of zzso that consist of tandem repeats of the DNA sequence zzso and several proteins that protect the DNA and regulate the plasticity of the zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso repeat binding factor 2) is critical for the control of zzso structure and zzso zzso dysfunction results in the exposure of the zzso ends and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA damage zzso Recent findings suggest that zzso attrition can cause zzso or zzso of zzso cells, but the function of zzso in differentiated zzso is zzso Here, we examined the impact of zzso dysfunction via zzso zzso in zzso zzso embryonic zzso zzso and zzso neural cells zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso dysfunction induced by zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso triggers a DNA damage response involving the formation of nuclear zzso containing zzso zzso zzso and activated zzso in each cell zzso In zzso neural cells zzso induced zzso of both zzso and zzso and zzso (as indicated by an zzso of zzso In contrast, in zzso zzso increased zzso but neither zzso nor zzso was zzso In addition, zzso zzso enhanced the zzso molecular and zzso differentiation of zzso zzso These findings demonstrate divergent molecular and zzso responses to zzso dysfunction in zzso neural cells and zzso indicate a role for zzso in regulating zzso zzso and suggest a potential therapeutic application of zzso of zzso function in the treatment of neural zzso
