zzso is a zzso zzso extracted from the roots of zzso zzso or zzso zzso Although previous studies have suggested that zzso possesses an in zzso zzso zzso activity, its in zzso effects and mechanisms of action are still not completely zzso In this study, zzso at zzso of zzso zzso exhibited significant zzso to three zzso zzso zzso cell lines but marginal zzso to a normal liver cell line in zzso Compared to a standard chemotherapy drug, zzso zzso zzso had greater effect on zzso cells but less toxicity on normal liver zzso Treatment with zzso dramatically reduced zzso zzso potential, and activated zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso with a zzso inhibitor partially attenuated zzso growth zzso in zzso zzso treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth of zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso was demonstrated in zzso zzso tumors by the terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment dramatically decreased the levels of zzso of zzso zzso and Bad in zzso and in zzso zzso of human zzso partially blocked zzso growth zzso zzso these findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor growth through zzso of zzso signaling and by inducing intrinsic zzso
