zzso decreases with aging in the zzso whereas the levels of zzso oxygen species zzso zzso In addition, zzso have been reported to inhibit zzso zzso Here, we investigated the effects of zzso on the zzso activity of zzso one of the major zzso factors that regulate the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling inhibited zzso zzso which was diminished by either treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor or the expression of a dominant negative form of zzso This suggests the involvement of zzso zzso which zzso the expression of zzso as well as its zzso in zzso zzso In transient zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Further studies using zzso zzso revealed that the protein level of zzso but not zzso itself, was important for the suppression of zzso zzso zzso directly zzso with zzso in zzso which blocked the DNA binding activity of zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso suppresses the expression of zzso zzso genes by zzso zzso zzso resulting in the reduction of zzso zzso These findings may provide a zzso explanation for the age-related decline in zzso steroid hormone zzso
