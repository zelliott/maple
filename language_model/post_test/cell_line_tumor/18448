To examine the expression of the zzso factor nuclear factor zzso B zzso in Barrett's zzso and zzso and the impact of zzso expression on tumor stage and response to zzso chemotherapy and radiation zzso 

zzso of Barrett's esophagus to zzso is associated with a wide range of cellular and molecular zzso Nuclear zzso B zzso regulates several genes involved in zzso immune and zzso responses, but its role in zzso inflammation and zzso has not been zzso 

zzso shift zzso was used to measure zzso activity in nuclear extracts of zzso zzso from tumor and zzso zzso zzso zzso 30) and zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression was assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso protein expressions were also examined by Western zzso 

zzso was not expressed in normal zzso zzso zzso in contrast to increased expression in zzso of patients with Barrett's zzso zzso percent of zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso displayed zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso tumors were Stage zzso and III compared with only zzso of patients with Stage I and zzso disease zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso correlated with major or complete zzso responses to zzso chemotherapy and radiation therapy, with zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group compared with zzso zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso Moreover, incubation of zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso with zzso acid or low pH induced zzso zzso 

zzso acids and low pH induce zzso expression in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso is common in zzso zzso In patients with Barrett's zzso and an associated zzso zzso there is a progressive expression of zzso through Barrett's zzso The absence of zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso with response to zzso zzso and may be of value in predicting response to zzso zzso
