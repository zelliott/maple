zzso is formed by zzso oxide following different pathways such as zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and is involved in the pathology of different neurological zzso Unlike zzso a zzso role of zzso against zzso cell injury has not been fully zzso This work targets the possible effects of testosterone on zzso cells exposed to zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso cells exposed to zzso were cultured in the presence of zzso zzso examination, proliferation and nuclear viability zzso were zzso The expression of zzso zzso and incorporation of zzso into protein were also zzso zzso exposed to zzso showed zzso shape, reduced zzso processes and growth zzso in comparison with zzso When testosterone was added to the zzso these changes were not zzso In addition, testosterone induced an zzso of zzso zzso a marker of zzso zzso and a decrease in zzso incorporation into zzso Our results suggest that testosterone exposure can diminish zzso toxic effects on the zzso and growth rate of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells would be consistent with concurrent plasticity zzso Failure in zzso zzso detected in cells exposed to both zzso and testosterone, may support the idea that testosterone interferes with zzso protein zzso Moreover, zzso zzso likely zzso a linkage with the zzso zzso as is suggested by the zzso zzso of the hormone zzso Finally, the zzso effects of testosterone in zzso cells could deal with the cellular zzso zzso system, as shown by zzso increase in zzso zzso
