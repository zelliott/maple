Various approaches have been evaluated for generation of efficient immune response against tumor zzso Our approach exploits usage of particulate delivery to generate immune response against prostate cancer zzso 

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of prostate cancer vaccine derived from a zzso prostate cancer cell line, zzso C2 in zzso model via oral route using zzso zzso zzso as a targeting zzso for zzso in the zzso zzso zzso 

The whole cell zzso zzso was obtained from zzso C2 zzso prostate cancer cell line and was formulated into particles using one step spray drying zzso For in zzso studies, 4-6 week old zzso male mice were vaccinated orally biweekly for 10 zzso zzso samples were analyzed at regular intervals to determine serum zzso zzso The mice were then challenged with live zzso C2 cells to determine efficacy of the zzso 

The serum zzso levels of vaccinated animals were higher compared to that of the zzso Moreover, the tumor growth was retarded significantly in the vaccinated mice compared to that of controls zzso zzso zzso 

The above findings suggest that oral particulate zzso vaccine can trigger an immune response against prostate cancer zzso
