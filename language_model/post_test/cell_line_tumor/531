zzso zzso is the most commonly used zzso agent for zzso cancer zzso However, resistance to this drug is a major obstacle in zzso zzso zzso prediction of response to zzso would avoid unnecessary chemotherapy and allow the selection of other effective zzso To identify a candidate predictor of zzso resistance, we isolated zzso proteins that were zzso or zzso in a zzso cancer cell line, compared with the parent cell line zzso using a stable zzso labeling zzso For zzso the clinical zzso of this method, levels of the identified proteins were determined in the zzso of 46 patients treated with zzso In total, zzso proteins with molecular weights ranging from 50 to 75 zzso were zzso Among these, 45 and 35 zzso proteins were zzso and zzso in the zzso cell line, zzso We observed significant zzso of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In particular, the level of zzso a key zzso in the zzso pathway, showed an increasing tendency in both zzso and zzso from zzso patients displaying no response to zzso chemotherapy zzso and stable disease zzso compared with that in complete or partial zzso to zzso zzso however, it did not reach the statistical zzso In conclusion, increasing pattern of zzso observed with zzso resistance induced in zzso and in zzso and zzso from zzso patients displaying poor response to zzso chemotherapy suggest the relevance of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
