zzso cell lung zzso zzso comprise multiple distinct zzso groups with different zzso For example, patients with zzso tumors have a better prognosis and exhibit greater sensitivity to zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso than patients with zzso zzso Here, we test the hypothesis that zzso zzso can be distinguished from zzso zzso on the basis of global DNA zzso zzso 

To determine whether zzso zzso of zzso can be defined on the basis of their DNA zzso patterns, we combined zzso gene expression analysis and zzso zzso zzso We derived robust zzso for both gene expression and zzso in cell lines and tested these zzso in surgically zzso zzso zzso We validate our approach using quantitative reverse zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso from patients with zzso who went on to fail front-line zzso 

We show that patterns of zzso divide zzso into zzso and zzso zzso as defined by gene expression and that these signatures are similarly correlated in zzso cell lines and zzso We identify multiple zzso zzso regions, including one in zzso and one in zzso whose zzso status is strongly associated with an zzso zzso in zzso cell lines, surgically zzso tumors, and zzso zzso from patients with zzso who went on to fail front-line zzso 

Our data show that patterns of DNA zzso can divide zzso into two zzso distinct zzso of tumors and provide proof of principle that differences in DNA zzso can be used as a platform for zzso zzso discovery and zzso
