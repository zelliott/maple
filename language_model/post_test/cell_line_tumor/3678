More than 50% of human breast zzso express receptors for zzso zzso hormone zzso These receptors can be used for targeted chemotherapy with agents like zzso in which zzso is linked to analog zzso We compared the effects of zzso and zzso in human breast cancer zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were zzso for expression of zzso using zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso and expression of zzso gene product zzso were measured by flow zzso zzso of zzso from zzso by serum zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso 

In zzso zzso and zzso cells we found cell surface expression of zzso In zzso cells only sparse surface expression was zzso In zzso cells, induction of zzso by zzso was stronger than by zzso in medium containing fetal calf serum zzso zzso with zzso increased zzso zzso in zzso positive zzso and zzso cells and reduced zzso in zzso zzso In zzso medium zzso induced by zzso was stronger than that induced by zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells, but weaker in zzso zzso In medium containing zzso both zzso and zzso induced surface expression of zzso gene product zzso but the effect of zzso was zzso zzso induced by zzso was inhibited by zzso with zzso zzso did not induce zzso in zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso analog zzso zzso zzso independent of zzso in zzso positive breast cancer zzso The efficacy and/or specificity of zzso is improved by suppression or absence of zzso zzso
