To clone the variable region genes of the zzso zzso zzso against human zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso them to assemble single chain zzso zzso gene and express in zzso zzso 

The specificity of the zzso zzso zzso to synthetic zzso zzso zzso protein in lung cancer cells were examined by zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso The variable region genes of heavy chain zzso and light chain zzso were amplified from zzso cell by reverse zzso chain zzso and then were linked by a zzso zzso using zzso zzso by overlap zzso to construct zzso zzso zzso The latter was cloned into the expression zzso zzso zzso and expressed in E coli zzso The expressed product was identified by zzso and competitive zzso zzso zzso 

It was shown that the zzso combined specifically with synthetic zzso zzso and zzso protein in three lung cancer zzso The cloned zzso gene and zzso gene were 345 zzso and 309 zzso respectively and were linked successfully to obtain zzso zzso The zzso protein was expressed in the form of inclusion body, with molecular weight of 28,000 and zzso to zzso 

zzso zzso zzso gene and zzso gene of zzso zzso were zzso constructed and functionally expressed in E zzso These results provide the experimental basis for zzso the role of zzso in lung zzso
