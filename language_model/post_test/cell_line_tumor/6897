In cell culture systems with zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso are difficult to establish because plateau effects zzso are often not reached because of limited drug zzso zzso the zzso potency of a compound will not be zzso using zzso values zzso exerting 50% of zzso Since alternative potency measures zzso values, the zzso required to double baseline signals have been zzso Using both methods, we reevaluated the zzso zzso of zzso zzso with 78 compounds in three different cell culture systems and found a close correlation between both methods zzso zzso zzso p zzso or zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso values are a valuable alternative to define rank orders of highly zzso zzso as a basis for the prediction of pharmacological interaction properties in clinical zzso Although it was only tested for zzso of zzso it seems likely that this method may be transferred to other zzso with other zzso
