Previous studies have shown that zzso zzso may be involved in the zzso process of zzso The correlation of the expression levels of zzso in zzso samples with the risk of disease progression and zzso was zzso Real time zzso was used to zzso zzso expression in a set of newly established zzso cell lines, 11 primaries and five zzso compared to the levels in 12 normal zzso cell lines established from healthy bone, and also in a set of 10 zzso zzso zzso In all cases long term clinical follow-up data was zzso The zzso expression level decreased gradually from the zzso to the primary cell lines zzso and further to those established from the tumor zzso zzso zzso the level of zzso expression correlated significantly zzso with patient survival zzso survival zzso in both sample sets zzso for the cell lines, zzso for the zzso In conclusion, the results indicate that zzso may be useful as a zzso marker of disease progression and survival in zzso
