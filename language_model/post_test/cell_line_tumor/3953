Ras can act on the plasma membrane zzso to mediate zzso signaling and zzso To identify key components controlling Ras PM zzso we performed an unbiased screen to seek zzso zzso zzso with reduced PM zzso Five zzso were found with zzso affecting the same zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso with various zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso a process which is zzso by its third zzso domain and the zzso zzso In zzso zzso the human zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, expressing zzso another zzso human zzso did not rescue zzso zzso in these zzso zzso zzso is widely zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso it zzso Ras PM zzso and transformation of zzso zzso These data strongly demonstrate that zzso zzso Ras proteins in a highly selective manner in the zzso compartment to facilitate PM targeting via the zzso network, a role that is most certainly critical for zzso zzso
