zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso tumor zzso have a frequent zzso spread and a poor zzso zzso zzso expression is often found in zzso zzso The aim of this study was to identify specific zzso expression patterns in these zzso We analyzed the expression of zzso in zzso and zzso in tissue samples and in the zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso zzso target zzso were modulated with mimic or inhibitor zzso zzso analysis was monitored by flow zzso and migration zzso A set of 107 zzso expressed zzso showed zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso Database revealed zzso and zzso zzso zzso invasion associated zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso zzso lower expressed in zzso than in zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with a zzso mimic and zzso inhibitor did neither increase the expression of the known target zzso nor decrease zzso zzso of zzso could be induced in zzso cells using zzso but zzso did not influence cell zzso Despite a comparable high rate of zzso invasion pediatric zzso and zzso show a different pattern of zzso expression possibly allowing risk zzso
