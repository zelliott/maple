zzso spread is an adverse outcome in zzso zzso Despite clinical efficiency, zzso zzso chemotherapy after zzso surgery is associated with high systemic and local zzso Two zzso delivery systems zzso and zzso were developed for zzso administration by zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso carrier with a zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to assess the zzso efficacy of these two zzso in a zzso model of human zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was generated in zzso mice by zzso injection of zzso zzso Free zzso zzso and zzso solutions were administered zzso at the same dose of 10 zzso zzso zzso For each treatment, tumor load and therapeutic efficacy were compared to zzso mice and assessed by zzso imaging and survival zzso zzso profiles in each group and zzso of zzso after zzso administration were also zzso 

zzso and zzso demonstrated significant zzso efficacy against zzso zzso Compared to zzso group, zzso improved median survival times from 58 to 105 zzso For zzso median survival was not reached after a follow-up of 120 zzso zzso showed high efficacy of zzso compared to free zzso but the difference was not zzso zzso study confirmed that free and active zzso were successively released from zzso in zzso zzso zzso were well tolerated by mice after zzso zzso 

zzso zzso demonstrated significant activity against zzso zzso in a zzso model of zzso zzso and their ability to release active zzso in zzso deposits and zzso These features are of clinical interest for zzso administration in the treatment of zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso
