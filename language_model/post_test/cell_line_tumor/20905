The identification of potential breast cancer stem cells is of importance as the characteristics of stem cells suggest that they are resistant to conventional forms of zzso Several techniques have been proposed to isolate or enrich for zzso breast cancer stem cells, including zzso culture of cells in zzso zzso conditions to form zzso and zzso sorting of the cells by their surface zzso zzso of zzso and zzso 

We have cultured zzso cells found in zzso zzso from breast cancer patients in zzso conditions without serum to form zzso zzso cells from these zzso were used to determine the zzso of these zzso zzso of zzso and zzso on zzso cells and zzso derived from the zzso zzso was zzso 

We found that the majority zzso of the zzso zzso tested contained cells capable of forming zzso of varying sizes that could be zzso After zzso and zzso with serum onto adherent dishes, the cells can zzso as determined by the increased expression of zzso and zzso Analysis of surface expression of zzso and zzso on zzso cells from 21 of the samples showed that the cells from some samples separated into two zzso but some did zzso The proportion of cells that could be considered zzso was highly variable and did not appear to correlate with the ability to form the larger zzso Of eight zzso zzso zzso tested in severe combined zzso disease zzso mice, four were found to induce zzso when only 5,000 or fewer cells were injected, whereas the same number of zzso cells did not form zzso The ability to induce zzso appeared to correlate with the ability to produce the larger zzso zzso cells from a highly zzso sample zzso were zzso negative for surface expression of both zzso and zzso 

This paper shows, for the first time, that zzso culture of zzso zzso zzso for cells capable of inducing zzso in zzso zzso The data suggest that zzso culture of these zzso cells could provide a highly appropriate model for studying the sensitivity of the zzso zzso cells to therapeutic agents and for further zzso of the zzso zzso of breast cancer zzso
