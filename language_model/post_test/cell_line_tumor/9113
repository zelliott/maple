A novel method for zzso zzso zzso zzso on glass chips is zzso zzso patterns zzso zzso were sputtered on glass chips via a zzso zzso The patterned chips were then zzso with zzso for example, zzso zzso to form a zzso coating zzso The zzso chain of zzso film on zzso patterns was zzso under zzso zzso exposing the fresh zzso zzso zzso The resulting chip could be used multiple times by repeating the coating and zzso processes with negligible deterioration of the zzso zzso film coated on zzso If zzso bare glass patterns could also be generated by removing the zzso patterns with zzso The patterned glass chips have been successfully used for zzso zzso
