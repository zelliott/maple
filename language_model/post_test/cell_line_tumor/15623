Human zzso reverse zzso zzso is the zzso component of a functional zzso complex, which is important in maintaining cell zzso In most normal human adult cells, the expression of zzso is very low and/or zzso In contrast, almost zzso of human tumors express a relatively high level of zzso zzso the possibility of using zzso as a universal candidate tumor zzso In this study, we show that human zzso zzso cells zzso lack zzso zzso Similar to other normal zzso cells, zzso express the zzso zzso component but not the zzso zzso zzso We also show that zzso activity could be zzso using either zzso zzso of the zzso zzso DNA or zzso with an zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso However, relative to zzso zzso zzso gene transfer produced higher levels of zzso zzso Nine of 10 zzso zzso were able to generate zzso responses, while only three of nine zzso zzso zzso zzso primed against zzso exhibited killing of zzso positive but not zzso negative tumor lines of diverse tissue zzso zzso specificity of these T cells to zzso was further determined by introducing zzso gene into a zzso negative cell line, zzso by zzso zzso Although some zzso specificity was directed against zzso zzso the majority of zzso were targeted against zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso particularly as delivered via the zzso zzso may be useful as vaccine to induce specific zzso tumor immunity in cancer zzso In addition, our results suggest that zzso activity and/or zzso expression after zzso gene transfer have a zzso value in the success of zzso cancer zzso
