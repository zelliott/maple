We identified and validated zzso a zzso (the zzso 3 zzso recognition zzso containing zzso compound as an imaging zzso for zzso activity in zzso zzso 

zzso was zzso with zzso using click zzso The affinity and selectivity of zzso for zzso were evaluated in zzso The zzso and metabolism pattern of zzso were assessed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scans were performed in a zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso After imaging, the mice were sacrificed, and individual zzso were collected, measured in a gamma counter, and tested for zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated specific zzso of zzso In zzso zzso is predominantly cleared through the zzso and zzso and is rapidly eliminated from the zzso There was a zzso increase in zzso activity and a fourfold increase of zzso retention in the zzso zzso of treated versus control zzso 

We report the use zzso as a PET zzso for imaging zzso Our data support further development of this zzso for clinical PET zzso
