zzso zzso is usually performed by the migration of growth cones that leave zzso zzso zzso are generated by enhanced zzso of zzso in the growth zzso Some kinds of zzso like zzso zzso cells, however, generate zzso as a result of migration of the cell body leaving zzso at the zzso The mechanism to generate zzso during such growth zzso zzso of zzso is not well zzso To establish an experimental model to study this zzso we cultured zzso zzso cells on zzso that facilitate cell zzso When cultured on zzso zzso cells migrated actively and left processes at the zzso We investigated the role of the zzso in this process zzso The zzso were always located at the base of the zzso zzso at the rear side of the zzso cell zzso Close observation of zzso revealed zzso limited around the zzso but concentrated at the periphery of the cells or within the zzso zzso regrowth experiments showed the ability of the zzso to zzso zzso We thus examined the role of zzso release from the zzso by knocking down the expression of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso into zzso cells reduced both the migration speed and the length of the zzso Taken together, zzso cells on zzso proved useful as a model to study the alternative type of zzso zzso in which cell migration leaves zzso at the zzso This model provided evidence for the involvement of zzso release from zzso in the mechanisms for this type of process zzso
