zzso analyses were performed to identify target genes that are shared by the acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso products zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was identified as one of the target zzso At the protein level, zzso was significantly induced by each of the three fusion zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso enhanced zzso protein stability in zzso cells and zzso exposure decreased zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso the main zzso zzso plays a role in the zzso of a variety of zzso Upon zzso zzso zzso zzso increased as a sign of functional zzso Interestingly, zzso protein expression decreased during zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity by a specific inhibitor zzso enhanced differentiation of zzso and zzso cells, further suggesting a role for zzso in the zzso zzso In addition, zzso dead zzso of zzso significantly impaired proliferation of zzso zzso zzso of primary zzso bone zzso zzso showed strong zzso zzso expression in 25 of 99 zzso specimens zzso zzso expression was associated with high levels of zzso zzso Taken together, we identified zzso as a target gene of several zzso fusion proteins in zzso zzso plays a role in zzso zzso These data suggest a role for zzso in the zzso fusion zzso differentiation zzso
