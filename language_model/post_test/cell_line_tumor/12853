zzso zzso of tumor zzso genes zzso by promoter zzso island zzso is a hallmark of zzso To zzso its extent in human lymphoma, zzso of 24 zzso was analyzed in zzso cell lines as well as in patient zzso 

We screened for zzso zzso using zzso multiplex zzso probe amplification zzso in 40 zzso cell lines representing zzso large cell lymphoma, zzso zzso zzso diffuse large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mantle cell zzso zzso as well as in 50 primary zzso zzso The zzso status of zzso zzso zzso was verified by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Gene expression of zzso and its zzso by DNA zzso was determined by quantitative real-time zzso and on the protein level by flow zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso was analyzed by zzso zzso and flow zzso 

On average 8 zzso zzso of 24 zzso were zzso per zzso cell line and zzso zzso 2 of 24 zzso in primary zzso whereas zzso zzso were zzso in zzso and blood zzso cells from healthy zzso zzso we identified that zzso was zzso and zzso silenced in all zzso and most FL and zzso cell lines, but was usually zzso and expressed in zzso cell zzso zzso results were obtained from primary zzso material: zzso was not zzso in zzso patients zzso whereas zzso was frequently zzso in zzso patients zzso In cell lines with zzso zzso expression was zzso at zzso and protein levels by treatment with the DNA zzso agent zzso confirming zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso can mediate zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines were consistently resistant towards zzso induced zzso 

Our data show that zzso is zzso regulated in zzso and zzso de zzso zzso in distinct zzso zzso like zzso Thus zzso may be a promising new zzso marker for diagnosis and a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of specific zzso zzso
