This study has developed a zzso delivery system to locally administer zzso acid for brain cancer zzso We zzso zzso acid composite films with various zzso of zzso zzso In zzso release study was performed by using a zzso zzso and zzso degradation rate was determined by analyzing the increased free zzso zzso zzso of brain cancer cells zzso zzso zzso and rat zzso zzso zzso was measured via direct and indirect cell culture on the films by zzso zzso zzso zzso Western zzso for zzso and zzso zzso were also zzso In the in zzso study, zzso rat zzso zzso cells were implanted zzso at the right flank region of nude mice and treatments were initiated by zzso the films zzso zzso growth was evaluated by measuring tumor volume using a zzso an ultrasound machine, and an optical imaging zzso The zzso acid composite films were zzso zzso and exhibited a sustained slow release of zzso zzso These materials could inhibit the cancer cell growth in an zzso acid zzso manner by inducing zzso of cancer cells as well as suppressing zzso These materials also significantly suppressed tumor tissue growth in zzso
