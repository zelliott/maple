Cellular responses toward zzso drugs are influenced by zzso between zzso signals and resistance zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is effective in zzso cancer cells of various zzso although the mechanisms largely remain to be zzso Breast cancer resistance protein zzso a drug zzso zzso zzso resistance to multiple zzso agents such as zzso and zzso Previous studies reported that zzso of the zzso pathway, by gene knockout or zzso zzso modulated zzso drug transport via zzso zzso in zzso stem cells, zzso polarized cells and zzso zzso cells of zzso In this study, we assessed the effects of zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso drug resistance of human cancer zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso reversed the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatment did not affect total or cell surface zzso levels as determined by western zzso and flow zzso but blocked zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso analyses also demonstrated unchanged cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells did not zzso zzso resistance, suggesting that zzso is not a transported zzso of zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso a member of zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso zzso zzso drug transport not by zzso zzso through the zzso signal but zzso as a competitive inhibitor in a major subset of cancer zzso Due to its dual effects, zzso could be a lead compound for developing more effective and tolerable zzso for cancer zzso
