Bone zzso proteins zzso are thought to be responsible for bone zzso they cause bone to form in soft zzso and are clinically used in helping fracture union or tumor zzso zzso zzso from zzso tumors may be either zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

We studied the expression of zzso in a variety of primary and secondary zzso of bone (both zzso and zzso to determine if there was a consistent relationship between bone formation and zzso zzso 

We compared a zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso using reverse zzso chain reaction, Northern zzso analysis, and zzso to detect zzso We also studied a number of zzso secondary zzso zzso that formed zzso zzso to the zzso and found zzso production in most of these zzso 

We found that zzso were expressed in both zzso and zzso benign musculoskeletal zzso In the first part of the study, zzso were found in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso Bone zzso proteins were also expressed by several zzso In the next part of the study zzso zzso zzso were expressed by a variety of tumors, irrespective of the zzso nature zzso or zzso of their zzso 

We conclude that zzso production alone cannot explain bone formation, and other factors either alone or in combination may be responsible for zzso zzso to the skeleton and for bone formation by primary bone zzso such as zzso zzso
