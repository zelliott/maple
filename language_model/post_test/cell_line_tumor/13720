Eight human and six chicken novel alternatively spliced zzso zzso of zzso reverse zzso zzso were identified, including a human zzso zzso containing an zzso deletion which removed zzso 4 through 13, zzso the zzso domain of zzso This zzso was expressed in zzso normal cells and zzso as well as in transformed zzso cell lines and cells which employ an alternative method to maintain zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso significantly elevated the proliferation rates of several cell types without enhancing zzso activity, while decreasing the zzso expression of this zzso by use of small interfering zzso zzso technology reduced cell zzso The expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In chicken cells, AS zzso zzso containing internal deletions or insertions that eliminated or reduced zzso activity also enhanced cell zzso This is the first report that naturally occurring AS zzso zzso which lack zzso activity stimulate cell zzso
