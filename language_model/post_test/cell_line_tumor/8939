zzso zzso is the most common primary bone zzso in children and young zzso zzso mechanisms underlying the zzso of zzso remain to be fully zzso Several members of the zzso hand zzso zzso protein family are zzso expressed in human zzso We previously showed that zzso is highly expressed in zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso in regulating zzso proliferation and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso expression was examined by zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso were used to assess zzso effects on cell zzso migration and invasion and zzso zzso zzso was assessed by using zzso zzso and flow zzso with zzso V zzso Early zzso marker alkaline zzso zzso and late markers zzso zzso and zzso zzso were assessed to determine the status of zzso zzso We found that zzso was elevated in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited cell zzso prolonged cell doubling time, and induced significant zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells delayed cell wounding closure and diminished the numbers of migrated zzso cells in zzso invasion zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso expression zzso zzso activity, as well as late markers zzso and zzso in both zzso cells and zzso stem zzso 

Our results strongly suggest that zzso may promote zzso tumor growth by regulating the cell cycle, reducing zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso may serve as a marker for zzso potential, as well as a therapeutic zzso
