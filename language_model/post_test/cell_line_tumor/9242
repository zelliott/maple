Small zzso modifier zzso is a protein zzso that is zzso to zzso zzso in a variety of target zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso is sufficient for zzso recognition and zzso modification of known zzso zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso that has lost its zzso activity retains its enhancement on zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the binding ability to zzso the zzso of zzso via the association of zzso and zzso is able to repress zzso zzso In the present study, we present several lines of evidence to explain the role of zzso zzso as a zzso in the nuclear zzso and zzso functions, including zzso activity that is independent of its ability to catalyze zzso zzso zzso an insight into the zzso interaction motif in its eight zzso zzso zzso selective zzso function in nuclear zzso zzso activities, and zzso a zzso zzso autonomous zzso repression domain in its far zzso zzso Taken together, our data suggest that the both the zzso interaction through the zzso zzso and its zzso activity provide the mechanism for regulating nuclear zzso zzso
