zzso causes a diverse range of pharmacological effects that are zzso and zzso and zzso The detailed mechanisms of caffeine in tumor suppression via tumor zzso protein zzso remain zzso The zzso of zzso are zzso proteins that are expressed in normal cells and generated via alternative zzso zzso sites and/or zzso initiation zzso In this study, we investigated how caffeine modulated cell cycle arrest and zzso via the expression of various alternatively spliced zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso expression and induced the expression of zzso which contains an alternatively spliced zzso zzso In zzso cells, the expression levels of many zzso zzso factors, including zzso zzso factors 2 and 3, were altered by zzso zzso zzso factor 3 was a promising candidate for the zzso zzso factors responsible for the alternative zzso of zzso in response to caffeine zzso In addition to zzso functions, multiple target genes of zzso zzso factor 3 suggest that caffeine can regulate zzso and hypoxic conditions to inhibit the survival of tumor zzso In zzso our data provide a new zzso of zzso tumor suppression via the alternative zzso of the target genes of zzso zzso factor zzso
