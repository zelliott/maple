The zzso tumor zzso protein zzso regulates zzso factor zzso zzso Here, we show that induction of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and induction of tumor cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor expression in zzso and zzso significant tumor cell zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso has been proposed to stabilize zzso by zzso the zzso zzso However, induction of zzso alone was insufficient to block zzso induced in zzso and has previously been shown to require additional zzso such as DNA zzso Here, we identify a new mechanism of action for zzso zzso activates a DNA damage response, resulting in zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso Unlike other DNA damage zzso agents, zzso treatment of cells induced a zzso increase in zzso of the alpha zzso of zzso initiation factor 2, requiring zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, and led to the subsequent zzso of zzso and zzso target zzso including zzso and zzso Through the identification of a new mechanism of action for zzso our study zzso a novel link between the DNA damage zzso zzso and the protein zzso zzso
