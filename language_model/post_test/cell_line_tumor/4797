Advances in neural tissue engineering require a comprehensive understanding of zzso growth in 3 zzso This study compared the gene expression of zzso human zzso cells cultured in zzso zzso with those cultured in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that, in response to varying zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited differential expression of zzso genes in collagen I, including those relevant to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso extended longer zzso in zzso collagen I cultures than in zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso chain reaction experiments and zzso analysis comparing collagen I and zzso tested whether the differential growth and gene expression reflected influences of culture dimension or culture zzso zzso zzso cells responded to geometry by zzso regulating cell spreading and genes associated with zzso in similar patterns for both materials; however, zzso outgrowth and the expression of the gene zzso for zzso varied with the type of zzso zzso zzso and mechanical analysis showed that collagen I was more zzso than zzso with larger zzso distance and higher zzso Taken together, these results suggest complex zzso zzso in which the dimension of the culture material influences gene expression and cell spreading and the structural and mechanical properties of the culture material influence gene expression and zzso zzso
