Recent prevalence of acquired forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso has urged the development of early diagnostic measures as well as therapeutic zzso To extend our previous findings on the value of zzso imaging zzso for these purposes, zzso derivatives with better zzso of zzso barrier zzso were developed and analyzed in this zzso The new zzso compounds clearly labeled prion protein zzso plaques in brain specimens from human zzso in a manner irrespective of pathogen strain, and a representative compound zzso detected abnormal zzso zzso in the brain of zzso mice when the probe was injected zzso On the other hand, most of the compounds inhibited abnormal zzso formation in zzso cells with zzso values in the zzso range, indicating that they represent one of the most potent classes of inhibitor ever zzso zzso prolonged the lives of mice infected zzso with zzso when the compound was given zzso at the zzso zzso The new compounds, however, failed to detect synaptic zzso deposition and to show zzso therapeutic zzso similar to the zzso imaging zzso we previously zzso The compounds were zzso permeable and zzso at doses for imaging and zzso therefore, they are expected to be of practical use in human zzso
