This study aimed at developing a novel zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso which is feasible for zzso production, exhibits good zzso zzso and further improves the therapeutic index of the zzso zzso acid was used to form zzso complex with zzso in order to enhance its zzso The zzso zzso loaded with zzso acid complex zzso were prepared using a simple zzso homogenization method and fully characterized from zzso and in zzso release zzso zzso the zzso and free zzso were compared with respect to their in zzso cellular zzso and zzso and their in zzso zzso and zzso behavior in mice were also zzso The obtained zzso could achieve high zzso efficiency of zzso zzso zzso under optimal zzso The in zzso release behavior displayed zzso drug release pattern with rapid release at the initial stage and prolonged release zzso The zzso exhibited higher growth zzso effect than free zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies showed that the cellular zzso of free zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and in zzso distribution studies in mice showed that zzso demonstrated significantly higher zzso level in blood and longer circulation time than free zzso Moreover, zzso significantly decreased zzso concentration in heart, lung and zzso These results suggested that zzso could be a promising zzso for the delivery of zzso in tumor zzso
