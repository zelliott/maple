To investigate the zzso zzso activity and the synergistic effect of zzso and zzso in a transplantation tumor model of human lung cancer in nude zzso 

Human lung cancer zzso cells were injected zzso into zzso nude zzso The mice were randomly divided into 4 groups: the control group, the zzso group, the zzso group, and the zzso combined with zzso zzso The tumor volume was measured in a 7 day zzso and the mice were sacrificed after 42 zzso The tumor zzso were collected and prepared for detection by zzso of expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso quantitative zzso was performed for detecting the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso version zzso was used for statistical zzso Data were present as zzso zzso zzso and means were compared with analysis of zzso The correlation of 2 variables was analyzed by liner correlation zzso 

The tumor volumes in the zzso group, zzso group, and zzso plus zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased significantly as compared with that of the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso F zzso zzso P zzso zzso Compared with the control group, the expression levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein in the zzso group, and zzso plus zzso group were significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso studies showed an increase in the expression of zzso in the zzso group (20 825 zzso zzso as compared to the control group (16 zzso zzso zzso F zzso zzso P zzso zzso but no significant differences in zzso and zzso (17 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared with the control group zzso zzso zzso 17 588 zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins were positively correlated with zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively P zzso zzso and zzso protein was positively correlated with zzso protein zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso was positively correlated with its protein zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

The combined use of zzso and zzso promoted zzso zzso activity, possible by zzso the zzso and zzso zzso
