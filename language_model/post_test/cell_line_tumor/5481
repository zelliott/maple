Human zzso a member of the zzso family, is indispensable for early embryonic zzso zzso plays an important zzso role during zzso and is zzso in a wide range of zzso zzso yet little is known about zzso in zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to analyze the roles of zzso in the progression and clinical characteristics in zzso clinical samples and cell zzso 

The expression of zzso at zzso level was detected by the reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and real time zzso and western zzso was used to examine the protein zzso zzso expression and its clinical characteristics were investigated by performing zzso analysis on a total of 37 zzso clinical tissue zzso zzso zzso were constructed to get an efficient expression of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells, with invalid zzso sequence as zzso After the zzso of the zzso zzso the growth, cell cycle and invasion of cells were detected by zzso zzso and zzso chamber zzso zzso Moreover, in zzso the proliferation of the tumor cells was evaluated in zzso nude mice model with zzso visualizing zzso 

The results of real-time zzso and western zzso showed that the expression level of zzso was markedly higher in zzso cell lines than that in the immortalized zzso zzso cell at both zzso and protein zzso zzso of 17 zzso zzso showed a high expression rate in zzso zzso zzso In an zzso study, zzso was found to express in zzso zzso cases of zzso In addition, zzso zzso was significantly associated with N zzso zzso zzso zzso distant zzso zzso zzso zzso and clinical stage zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso technique suppressed zzso cell growth and invasion in zzso In zzso the average weight zzso zzso zzso and volume zzso zzso zzso of tumor in zzso zzso mice group were significantly lower than those in the control zzso The zzso index was obviously lower in zzso zzso treated tumors zzso zzso zzso 

Data of this study suggest that zzso zzso is connected with the zzso and progression of zzso zzso zzso might be feasible for the zzso of the growth and invasion of zzso
