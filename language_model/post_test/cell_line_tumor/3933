There is accumulating evidence that zzso receptors zzso may be tumor zzso in head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso status and gene expression were assessed in a large panel of head and neck primary tumors, based on the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso zzso might silence the zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso 

zzso expression was examined in a panel of cell lines by using quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso status of the zzso promoter was studied using quantitative zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso to express zzso 

zzso expression was suppressed in zzso cell lines, whereas zzso cell lines exhibited stable zzso zzso zzso found in 31 of 100 zzso tumor specimens was significantly correlated with the zzso status of both zzso and zzso The observed zzso promoter zzso was statistically correlated with a decrease in zzso survival zzso test, zzso A zzso zzso analysis revealed a high odds ratio for recurring zzso of zzso and the gene pair zzso and zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso expression of zzso suppressed cell proliferation in zzso cells with zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso 

zzso promoter zzso in association with zzso and growth suppression after zzso supports the hypothesis that zzso may act to suppress tumor zzso zzso is a potentially significant therapeutic target and zzso factor for this cancer zzso
