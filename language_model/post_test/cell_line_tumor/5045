zzso of zzso system represent highly zzso diseases of dismal zzso We have previously introduced zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which showed excellent zzso efficacy for approximately half of the zzso cancer lines with an enhanced safety to normal zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether zzso modification zzso which enables zzso infection, can improve the zzso and efficacy of zzso for zzso zzso 

Expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were compared with the level of zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso fibers or zzso fibers in a panel of zzso cancer cell lines in zzso zzso replication and zzso in zzso of zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso were compared with those of its parent virus, zzso in various zzso cancer cells and in normal zzso In zzso zzso effects of these zzso viruses were compared in a zzso tumor zzso 

zzso of zzso significantly correlated with the zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso was abundantly expressed in almost all zzso cancer zzso Whereas zzso effectively zzso and zzso only the zzso cancer cells with a preserved expression of zzso zzso exhibited efficient replication and potent zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso showed attenuated replication and little zzso in human normal cells zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso Furthermore, in nude mice with zzso zzso of zzso human zzso cancer, zzso zzso therapy caused a marked zzso of tumor zzso 

The zzso modification strategy enhanced the zzso zzso and zzso effects of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso In addition, it preserved the merit of excellent safety of the zzso virus for normal zzso These results suggest a potential use of this agent for the treatment of zzso zzso
