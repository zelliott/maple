A major obstacle in the treatment of chronic zzso C virus zzso infection has been the lack of effective, zzso zzso zzso the recent development of the zzso cell culture infection system now allows not only for the study of the entire viral life cycle, but also for the screening of zzso against all aspects of zzso zzso However, in order to screen libraries of potential zzso compounds, it is necessary to develop a highly zzso accurate zzso for zzso infection adaptable for zzso screening zzso zzso Using an internally zzso zzso 520 zzso resonance energy transfer zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we report the development of a simple, zzso zzso zzso zzso infection zzso zzso for zzso This zzso makes use of zzso zzso human zzso zzso cells, which support zzso long-term zzso infection and can be readily scaled down to a zzso zzso We demonstrate that this stable cell culture method eliminates common problems associated with standard zzso zzso such as cell culture zzso poor zzso and low signal zzso zzso this zzso zzso zzso not only can identify zzso that act throughout the viral life cycle as effectively as zzso zzso zzso such as real-time quantitative zzso and Western zzso analysis, but also exhibits a high degree of accuracy with limited signal variation zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso providing the basis for a robust zzso campaign for screening compound libraries and identifying novel zzso zzso
