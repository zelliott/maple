zzso zzso is a zzso which can cause zzso effects and induce ecological changes in aquatic zzso a potential risk to public and environmental zzso Many studies of zzso on animal cells and algae have been performed, although few compare the toxic effects between the two zzso In this sense, we investigated the zzso stress induced by zzso zzso zzso in two different cellular models: zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso by zzso of zzso zzso levels as indicative of zzso zzso zzso Also was evaluated the zzso defense of these cells systems after exposure to zzso by the addition of antioxidants in zzso cells culture, and by the measure of antioxidants zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso The zzso levels of zzso cells increased from zzso to zzso for zzso and zzso zzso of zzso respectively, as compared to zzso zzso and zzso did not appear to protect the cell from zzso effect while, in cells treated with vitamin zzso the rates of zzso production decreased significantly, except for higher zzso of zzso No zzso productions were observed in zzso cells however some effects on zzso zzso activity were observed when algae were exposed to zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that the zzso of zzso that may induce zzso stress through zzso are different in animal and zzso zzso A combination of zzso and animal zzso should be conducted for reliable assessment of zzso stress induced by zzso
