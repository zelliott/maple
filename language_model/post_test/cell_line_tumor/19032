zzso zzso zzso zzso induce zzso in acute zzso leukemia zzso cells in zzso however, the zzso associated with cell death in zzso cells are higher than those clinically tolerated during prolonged zzso We therefore wished to determine whether short zzso to zzso might induce cell death in zzso cells at clinically zzso zzso The time and concentration dependence of zzso and zzso cells was determined and showed that cell death was zzso zzso values and zzso values determined on day 6 suggested that the sensitivity of zzso cells to statins may occur at lower zzso than previously zzso After 72 zzso zzso did not rescue zzso cells from zzso zzso of zzso suggesting that, although cell death was delayed, zzso induced lethal effects within 72 zzso In conjunction with previously reported Phase I studies, the data presented here suggest that the zzso short course statins may be useful for the treatment of patients with zzso
