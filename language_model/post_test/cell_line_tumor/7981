Lung cancer is the leading cause of zzso to death in both men and zzso zzso zzso for lung cancer were investigated using the expression of proteins from lung cancer cell line zzso and compared with those of normal lung zzso cell line zzso zzso gel zzso of zzso and zzso cells was carried out and followed by protein identification using zzso tandem mass zzso Most proteins over expressed in zzso cells were zzso such as zzso zzso 70 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, some proteins were expressed only in zzso cells such as zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso 60 was highly expressed in zzso zzso It is known to function in protein interactions and protein zzso The over expression of this protein in cells may result in abnormalities of protein zzso and lead to early stage zzso These proteins may be used as zzso of lung cancer for early detection and clinical zzso
