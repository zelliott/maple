This work reports results of experiments in zzso zzso zzso zzso cell cultures where the apparent diffusion zzso zzso of zzso water zzso was measured at diffusion times between zzso and 40 zzso The experiments were carried out before and after the onset of permanent zzso The changes in zzso following zzso were dependent on the diffusion time employed in the zzso An zzso decrease in the zzso was measured at short diffusion times, while at long diffusion times the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso measured at short diffusion times are interpreted to be a result of a decrease in the intrinsic zzso of zzso water due to energy zzso zzso in zzso measured at long diffusion times, are interpreted to result from cell zzso
