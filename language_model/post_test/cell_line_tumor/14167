The present update describes the biological activities of an alpha zzso zzso zzso termed the zzso zzso zzso which is a synthetic zzso acid segment produced from the native zzso The zzso has been shown to be zzso in both fetal and tumor cells but not in adult zzso Even though its mechanism of action has not been completely zzso zzso has been shown to engage in cellular events such as zzso cellular zzso zzso and zzso cell shape zzso The zzso was shown to be zzso in nine different human tumor types and to suppress the spread of tumor infiltrates and zzso in human and mouse zzso zzso It was further found that the zzso state zzso zzso linear zzso of the zzso determined its biological and zzso zzso The combined properties of tumor growth suppression and reduction of tumor zzso represent promising areas for zzso as a zzso zzso It was concluded that the zzso derived from full-length zzso represents a zzso motif possessing intrinsic properties that allow it to interact in cell surface events such as tumor zzso zzso and zzso
