zzso of zzso has been used successfully to improve the zzso properties and efficacy of the zzso To prepare a zzso form of human zzso zzso suitable for testing in zzso we have zzso 20 zzso zzso and used it to modify the zzso zzso group of the zzso The zzso protein retained approximately 50% of the activity of the unmodified protein and had significantly improved zzso properties following intravenous administration in zzso The clearance and volume of distribution at steady state were reduced approximately zzso and approximately zzso respectively, resulting in a significant increase in systemic exposure as determined by the area under the zzso The elimination zzso of the zzso protein was approximately zzso greater than for the unmodified zzso The unmodified and zzso proteins were tested for their ability to inhibit the formation of zzso oriented blood vessels entering the periphery of human zzso melanoma tumors in zzso nude zzso zzso zzso In a single dose comparison study, administration of 1 zzso zzso units of unmodified zzso resulted in a zzso reduction in vessel number, while 1 zzso zzso units of zzso zzso resulted in a zzso zzso Both treatments resulted in statistically significant reductions in mean vessel number as compared to the vehicle zzso mice, with the zzso zzso mice showing a statistically significantly greater reduction in mean vessel number as compared to the unmodified zzso zzso In a multiple versus single dose comparison study, daily administration of 1 zzso zzso units of unmodified zzso for 9 days resulted in a 51% reduction in vessel number, while a single dose of 1 zzso zzso units of the zzso protein resulted in a zzso zzso Both treatments resulted in statistically significant reductions in mean vessel number as compared to the zzso mice, with the zzso zzso mice showing a statistically significantly greater reduction in mean vessel number as compared to the unmodified zzso zzso zzso the improved zzso properties of the modified protein translated into improved zzso Since unmodified zzso is used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and zzso C virus infection, a zzso form of the protein such as 20 zzso zzso zzso may serve as a useful adjunct for the treatment of these zzso In addition, the zzso effects of zzso zzso may be harnessed for the treatment of certain zzso either as a sole agent or in combination with other zzso zzso
