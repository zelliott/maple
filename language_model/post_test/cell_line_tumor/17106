This work analyzes the effectiveness of zzso in boosting the zzso induced by different doses of X-rays, using the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cell lines differing in zzso and zzso status were zzso Since zzso is able to inhibit zzso protein zzso zzso and rejoining of zzso breaks zzso we have analyzed the zzso contents and expression after zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in our cell lines with the aim of explaining the differential effect of zzso as zzso Considering that zzso is the main protein complex involved in DNA zzso repair, the ability to remove zzso after zzso (with or without zzso was evaluated in the different cell lines by the use of zzso gel zzso Our results indicate a higher zzso in the zzso cell line that shows both high zzso contents of zzso and a high rate of DNA repair by the fast zzso In contrast, no zzso effect of zzso was observed in the zzso cell line, previously characterized as defective in zzso repair by a low repair zzso and - as our results show - with low zzso contents and later zzso expression of zzso No clear effect related to zzso status of the cell line was zzso These results suggest that high zzso contents of zzso are indicative of zzso zzso and analysis of the expression of this protein could be helpful in the optimal establishment of zzso as zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso
