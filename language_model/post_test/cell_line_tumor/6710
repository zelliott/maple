zzso has been shown to specifically alter its expression patterns in different types of zzso Recent evidence suggests that an interference of zzso exists in the zzso signaling zzso To determine the role of zzso in pancreatic cancer, pancreatic cancer samples were analyzed in comparison to normal pancreatic zzso Furthermore, four different pancreatic cancer cell lines with different zzso of the zzso zzso were zzso To evaluate if a potential relationship with zzso signaling zzso exists, we correlated zzso expression levels with the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Finally, we analyzed the influence of zzso on zzso expression in zzso All pancreatic cancer samples demonstrated a marked zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed strong and persistent zzso zzso zzso in cancer zzso In an zzso mobility shift zzso a disturbed nuclear zzso was zzso The expression of zzso showed a significant correlation with the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso responsive cell lines showed a zzso of zzso zzso upon zzso exposure, whereas in zzso cell lines, zzso zzso expression persisted at high zzso Furthermore, strong specific zzso of zzso impaired nuclear zzso and its cooperative action with the zzso pathway, suggesting that zzso plays a central role in human pancreatic zzso
