zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that has been implicated in cancer zzso zzso isolated from zzso colon zzso zzso produce greater amounts of zzso zzso than cells isolated from a primary tumor zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso with zzso zzso decreases zzso zzso Because zzso to the zzso zzso zzso is required for invasion and zzso we hypothesized that zzso zzso mediates zzso to zzso proteins such as zzso zzso and zzso and that zzso of zzso production or removal of zzso by zzso with zzso would impair zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso alone, zzso zzso zzso zzso and both zzso zzso and zzso were assessed for zzso to zzso Type 1 zzso or zzso zzso To confirm that zzso was zzso by zzso cells were treated with or without zzso prior to the zzso 

zzso zzso cells zzso well to zzso zzso cells demonstrated zzso less zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso to Type 1 collagen and zzso was zzso less than zzso to zzso zzso of zzso and/or zzso or zzso with zzso significantly decreased zzso of zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso was dependent upon zzso zzso 

zzso zzso cells that produce large amounts of zzso zzso zzso well to zzso zzso of zzso and/or zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso These data suggest that zzso promotes zzso to zzso and may thereby facilitate invasion of the basement membrane and zzso in colon zzso
