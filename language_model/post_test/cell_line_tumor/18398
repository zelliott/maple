zzso C virus zzso zzso replication is dependent on the zzso activities of the viral zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso domain (21 zzso zzso is zzso zzso To address the role of this domain in zzso replication in zzso we introduced a series of zzso into the zzso of an zzso zzso zzso and examined the replication capabilities of the zzso zzso by a colony formation zzso zzso lacking the zzso domain did not yield any zzso Furthermore, when zzso cells harboring the zzso zzso zzso were treated with a synthetic zzso consisting of the zzso zzso domain fused to the zzso zzso the membrane association of zzso was completely zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso was reduced by approximately zzso A scrambled zzso used as a control did not have any zzso These findings suggest that the membrane association of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, a related zzso domain derived from bovine viral zzso virus could not replace the zzso zzso zzso zzso This finding suggests that the zzso 21 zzso acids not only have a zzso function but also may perform additional functions for zzso synthesis in zzso
