zzso protein zzso is a normal cellular zzso that is expressed in almost all zzso including the central nervous zzso Much attention has been focused on this protein because conversion of the normal zzso to the diseased form zzso plays an essential role in zzso zzso zzso such as mad cow disease and zzso zzso In spite of the extensive effort, the normal zzso function of zzso remains zzso Emerging evidence suggests that zzso plays a protective role against cellular stresses including zzso induced by various zzso agents such as zzso and zzso zzso however, other reports showed zzso of zzso enhances zzso zzso In this study, we took a different approach by depleting zzso zzso using specific interfering zzso technique and compared the depleting and zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate here that zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso and zzso The enhanced zzso induced by zzso was shown by increased DNA zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso We also showed that overproduction of zzso had little or no effect on zzso DNA fragmentation in zzso cells but it zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, suggesting a cell zzso zzso In addition, the zzso effect of zzso on zzso cellular stress appears to be modulated in part through induction of cell cycle zzso zzso Together, our data suggest that zzso level of zzso zzso plays a protective role against zzso cellular zzso Loss of this protection could render cells more prone to cellular insults such as zzso
