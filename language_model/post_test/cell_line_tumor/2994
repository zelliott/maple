A zzso zzso deletion removing zzso 6 to 9 of the zzso associated protein zzso zzso zzso predicting to result into a truncated protein lacking the first zzso binding domain, was detected in a patient with zzso zzso zzso Cell culture experiments showed that the truncated zzso zzso had a dramatic decrease in the normal binding to zzso but acquired the ability to bind zzso associated zzso zzso This indicates that this zzso likely results both from a loss of function mechanism and from a deleterious gain of function by which zzso deleted forms of zzso zzso another zzso Both mechanisms could contribute to impair zzso zzso
