zzso virus zzso nuclear zzso 2 zzso a direct zzso zzso of viral and cellular zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso The functional role of zzso regions within the zzso zzso of the protein preceding the zzso region has yet to be fully zzso Thus, we tested whether the zzso zzso 30 zzso acid zzso containing zzso zzso region 1, are required for stimulating viral and cellular gene expression necessary for zzso transformation in a viral zzso zzso We found that these zzso are required for its ability to induce zzso expression in zzso cell lines zzso to stimulate zzso promoter reporter plasmids in zzso zzso and to rescue zzso growth following zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso 3 to 30 also impaired its ability to zzso in zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso 3 to 30 comprise an essential domain required for induction of zzso expression and, consequently, for maintenance of the immortalized zzso of zzso The ability to zzso into zzso or zzso zzso by this domain may be an important mechanism for these zzso
