We report the synthesis and characterization of eight new zzso W, or zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes with metal zzso ranging from 1 to zzso The compounds were zzso in water by treating zzso zzso zzso or zzso precursors with biologically active zzso zzso (R zzso zzso zzso R zzso zzso zzso and R zzso zzso zzso where Ale zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso contain two zzso zzso zzso which can rotate around a central zzso group while zzso and zzso are zzso zzso In zzso and zzso a central zzso zzso is surrounded by two zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso zzso can be viewed as the zzso of one zzso with one additional zzso zzso and two Ale zzso while zzso is a triangular zzso zzso These new zzso zzso complexes were all characterized by zzso X-ray zzso The stability of the Mo and W zzso was studied by zzso zzso zzso and showed that all compounds except the zzso zzso and zzso were stable in zzso zzso zzso performed on the zzso derivatives confirmed the zzso state of the V zzso and evidenced their stability in zzso zzso zzso studies on zzso and zzso showed reduction of zzso to zzso and magnetic zzso investigations on zzso enabled a detailed analysis of the magnetic zzso The presence of zzso or zzso correlated with the most potent activity zzso zzso against three human tumor cell zzso
