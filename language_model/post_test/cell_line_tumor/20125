Brain zzso commonly occur in patients with breast, lung and melanoma systemic zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binds cell surface proteins important for zzso invasion and zzso in the zzso zzso The objective of this study was to investigate the zzso effect of zzso in a zzso breast cancer brain zzso zzso Female nude rats received zzso infusion of human zzso zzso breast cancer cells zzso and were randomly assigned into four groups: zzso zzso zzso zzso mixed with cells in zzso 5 zzso before infusion without further zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 h before and weekly after cell zzso zzso zzso zzso weekly starting 7 days after cell zzso Brain zzso were detected by magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso Comparisons were made using the zzso test and zzso zzso Survival times were estimated using zzso zzso All control rats with brain tissue available for zzso (9 of 11 zzso developed multiple brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment either in zzso prior to cell infusion or intravenous before or after cell infusion prevented zzso formation on zzso and decreased the number of zzso on zzso zzso zzso 2, p zzso zzso including 30 % of animals without zzso tumors at the end of the zzso The overall survival was improved by zzso compared to controls zzso zzso zzso 52 days, p zzso zzso Our results suggest that breast cancer patients at risk of zzso might benefit from early zzso zzso
