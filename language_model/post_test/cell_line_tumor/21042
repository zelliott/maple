An zzso zzso zzso was prepared by attachment of low molecular weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso to zzso zzso through an zzso zzso The zzso zzso having a critical zzso concentration of zzso zzso was used to form zzso zzso with mean diameters of less than 100 zzso for zzso of free zzso The maximum zzso of free and zzso zzso achieved in this zzso were 28 and 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso to a drug to zzso ratio of zzso zzso The zzso properties of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were evaluated including stability, rate of zzso zzso activity, and drug release zzso The zzso activity of the drug in the zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated to be retained in three human cancer cell zzso zzso administration of zzso in the zzso zzso revealed relatively rapid zzso of the free drug from the zzso however, a zzso higher zzso equivalent area under the plasma zzso curve zzso was zzso in comparison to zzso administered as zzso The maximum tolerated dose of this zzso zzso was also zzso higher than that for zzso in healthy zzso
