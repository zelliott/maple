Mercury and aluminum are considered to be zzso metals, and they are often connected with the onset of neurodegenerative zzso In this study, zzso mercury, zzso and aluminum were studied in three different cell lines of neural zzso To evaluate the effects, zzso zzso and zzso induced by the metals were measured after various incubation zzso zzso zzso U zzso glioblastoma, and zzso zzso retinal zzso zzso cells were zzso to appropriate cell culture plates and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and aluminum zzso were added into the growth zzso In the zzso measuring the zzso zzso activity, zzso the cultures were exposed for 15 zzso 24 or 48 h before zzso zzso were allowed to recover from the exposure in part of the zzso zzso induced by the metals was measured after zzso zzso and zzso exposure times with the determination of activated zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso showed a clear zzso and exposure zzso to the zzso The most toxic was zzso zzso zzso zzso 48 zzso and the most sensitive cell line was the zzso cell line zzso Furthermore, there was marked zzso zzso especially in connection with aluminum and zzso at low zzso This zzso may be important during the initiation of cellular zzso All the metals tested induced zzso but with a different zzso and zzso zzso In microscopic photographs, zzso cells formed zzso zzso and zzso cells settled along the zzso in zzso of zzso and zzso cell lines during aluminum zzso The study emphasized the toxicity of zzso to neural cells and showed that aluminum alters various cellular zzso
