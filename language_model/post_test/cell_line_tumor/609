For multiple zzso zzso of zzso molecules to a zzso zzso zzso zzso we have constructed a human anti zzso zzso zzso with a zzso fusion zzso containing 1, 3, or 17 zzso zzso zzso The zzso extended fusion zzso of these zzso zzso fusion proteins are used as the zzso zzso for human zzso II zzso that transfers either zzso or zzso a modified zzso with a chemical handle, from their respective zzso to the zzso zzso group of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso fusion proteins are expressed in zzso coli as inclusion bodies and in zzso zzso and zzso with zzso Upon zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso fusion zzso showed that the zzso zzso fusion protein with a single zzso zzso is fully zzso with a single zzso whereas the zzso zzso fusion protein with 3 and 17 zzso zzso is found as an equal mixture of 2-3 and 5-8 zzso zzso fusion zzso zzso These fusion zzso proteins with the modified zzso are then zzso with a zzso probe, zzso that carries an zzso zzso zzso The zzso labeled zzso proteins bind specifically to a human breast cancer cell line zzso that zzso the zzso zzso indicating that the in zzso folded zzso fusion proteins are biologically active and the presence of zzso multiple zzso zzso in their zzso end does not interfere with their binding to the zzso
