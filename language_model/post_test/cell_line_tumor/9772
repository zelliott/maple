The zzso zzso family, including zzso 2 and 3, plays critical roles in regulating cell growth, zzso survival, zzso and many other cellular zzso Recent evidence indicates that zzso is frequently zzso active in many types of human cancer including gastric zzso In the present study, we applied zzso to tissue zzso to detect the expression of zzso followed by zzso small interference zzso zzso to examine knock down of the zzso gene on the growth zzso of human gastric cancer zzso zzso Our results indicate that the expression of zzso was significantly increased in gastric cancer compared to normal gastric tissue and adjacent zzso zzso The in zzso study shows that cell growth was significantly inhibited and zzso arrest was observed in zzso zzso In zzso the size of tumors was significantly smaller in zzso subcutaneous mice model treated with zzso than those treated with zzso and zzso Our studies demonstrated zzso can inhibit zzso zzso exerted growth zzso effect on zzso cells in zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso could be a new strategy in gastric cancer zzso
