zzso I zzso have been shown to have clinical activity against human zzso zzso Previous studies showed that the zzso of zzso a zzso I zzso occurs mainly in the S zzso of the cell cycle and is protectable by zzso an inhibitor of zzso DNA zzso in some zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso regulates the zzso transition, and recent studies have shown that zzso zzso the zzso of some zzso zzso zzso the present study was designed to investigate the effect of zzso zzso gene transfer on zzso of zzso cancer to zzso in zzso and in zzso Two human zzso cancer cells, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were treated with zzso alone or in combination with zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso was confirmed by Western zzso zzso zzso gene transfer at low doses (less than the zzso zzso markedly increased the sensitivity of human zzso cancer cells to zzso in zzso which is because of induction of zzso zzso did not have any protective effect on the zzso zzso The level of zzso I expression was not affected by combination treatment as well, suggesting that DNA replication and zzso I activity may not account for the molecular mechanism of cell killing in response to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression were not altered by treatment with zzso and/or zzso Moreover, combination of zzso and zzso has an additive zzso effect in an in zzso nude mouse zzso zzso When combined with zzso zzso zzso therapy resulted in a zzso decrease in tumor size compared to control groups ( zzso These results suggest a zzso strategy that may have clinical utility in human zzso zzso
