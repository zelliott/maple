zzso possess an affinity for zzso suggesting that labeling of such zzso with zzso could potentially produce zzso PET zzso able to identify zzso melanoma zzso in zzso with high sensitivity and zzso 

In this study, zzso zzso was zzso via a zzso zzso zzso The zzso binding affinity of zzso was determined along with the in zzso cellular zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso In zzso distribution and zzso PET studies were conducted on mice bearing zzso melanoma, zzso zzso melanoma, and zzso tumors, and comparative studies were performed with zzso PET in the melanoma zzso 

In zzso zzso of zzso was significantly higher in zzso cells treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso displayed significant tumor zzso at 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso percentage injected dose zzso per gram was observed in zzso tumors and only zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in zzso zzso and zzso tumors, zzso Lung zzso was significantly higher in zzso lungs bearing zzso zzso pulmonary zzso than in normal zzso lungs zzso zzso zzso zzso PET clearly identified zzso zzso in both primary and pulmonary zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso with zzso PET along with zzso further confirmed the presence of tumor zzso in the mouse zzso 

zzso specifically targets primary and zzso zzso melanoma zzso with high tumor zzso and may have zzso zzso
