The zzso zzso zzso has been associated with a variety of inflammatory diseases including zzso zzso zzso arthritis, pain, cancer and liver zzso Several classes of zzso zzso have been identified, but only one drug, zzso a zzso inhibitor of zzso has been approved for clinical zzso To better evaluate the efficacy of zzso zzso for pharmacological intervention, a rat model was modified to test the in zzso efficacy of zzso zzso zzso was produced by adding zzso into a newly formed air zzso and zzso zzso While zzso and zzso are present in the inflamed pouch, little zzso products are zzso Cellular zzso zzso was obtained by adding calcium zzso zzso into the zzso thus providing a novel model to evaluate the efficacy and selectivity of zzso zzso Also, we described modifications to the in zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso These zzso included a newly developed zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso an ex zzso human whole blood zzso and an zzso rat mast cell zzso all designed for zzso production of zzso zzso and zzso a competitive, zzso inhibitor of zzso were evaluated for their pharmacological properties using these zzso Although both compounds achieved zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity, zzso was zzso fold more potent than zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso confirmed that both compounds selectively inhibited all products downstream of zzso zzso acid zzso including zzso acid zzso without zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso In the rat air zzso model, oral dosing of zzso and zzso resulted in selective zzso zzso activity from zzso zzso and ex zzso rat whole blood with similar potency to in zzso zzso These data show that the rat air zzso model is a reliable and useful tool for evaluating in zzso efficacy of zzso zzso and may aid in the development of the next generation of zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso similar to zzso
