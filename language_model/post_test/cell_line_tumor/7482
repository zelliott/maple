Cancer cells escape zzso destruction by losing human zzso zzso zzso class I expression via various mechanisms, including loss of zzso zzso Our study illustrates the immune escape of zzso class zzso tumor cells and zzso sequence of appearance of tumor zzso gene zzso in successive zzso obtained from a patient with zzso zzso We observed a gradual decrease in zzso expression in consecutive zzso with few zzso zzso in the primary tumor and the emergence of a totally negative zzso at later stages of the zzso We detected loss of zzso in zzso nests of the primary tumor caused by a combination of two zzso zzso a zzso zzso to T zzso in zzso 67 in zzso 2 of zzso zzso producing a stop zzso and zzso loss of the second gene copy by loss of zzso zzso in zzso zzso The same zzso zzso was found in a zzso zzso zzso 10 months later and in a cell line established from a biopsy of a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed the presence of zzso in zzso 6 and 15 in tumor samples, showing an zzso of zzso loss at specific short tandem repeats in successive zzso during disease zzso zzso loss correlated with decreased tumor zzso zzso zzso Early zzso of zzso defects can cause an immune selection and expansion of highly aggressive melanoma clones with irreversible genetic defects causing total loss of zzso class I expression and should be taken into consideration as a therapeutic target in the development of cancer zzso zzso
