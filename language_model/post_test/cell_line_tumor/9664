In addition to its ability to act as a promising zzso of zzso cell death, TRAIL has also been shown to stimulate signaling pathways leading to cancer cell zzso We examined the changes of zzso zzso protein level following TRAIL treatment of human cell lines representing different stages of colon zzso zzso zzso or secondary zzso zzso together with cell line derived from human fetal colon zzso While TRAIL was capable of triggering an zzso signaling leading to significant early zzso zzso zzso of zzso in selected colon zzso cell lines, none or very limited effects were demonstrated in cell lines derived from colon zzso zzso zzso or fetal zzso zzso We demonstrated an immediate impact of zzso protein level zzso on the course of early acute zzso response of colon zzso cells to zzso It is therefore essential to consider the dynamics of zzso of zzso level and the balance between zzso zzso and zzso pathways when predicting the response of cells in different stages of cancer development, and designing the zzso therapy using zzso
