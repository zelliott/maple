zzso cancer is a devastating zzso characterized by low responsiveness to conventional zzso zzso an zzso growth factor zzso zzso inhibitor zzso has shown clinical activity against zzso zzso Since pancreatic zzso frequently zzso zzso zzso and its zzso our aim was to investigate the potential role of zzso in this zzso The zzso of zzso as well as the effects of zzso on growth factor actions in pancreatic cancer cell lines were analyzed using zzso zzso zzso analysis using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed to study cell cycle, zzso and cell zzso Western zzso analysis was carried out to investigate expression levels of the 4 members of the zzso family of receptors in pancreatic cancer cell lines, as well as zzso zzso and zzso zzso Soft zzso zzso were used to measure colony zzso zzso of cancer cells was analyzed using zzso zzso zzso inhibited cell proliferation of pancreatic cancer cell lines with zzso zzso ranging from zzso to over 10 zzso zzso zzso completely inhibited zzso cell zzso but did not significantly influence zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso also completely abolished zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited zzso and zzso zzso cell growth and zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso zzso pancreatic cancer cell growth through zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso growth and zzso suggesting that zzso may offer a new approach for the treatment of pancreatic zzso
