A novel zzso method for enhancing the zzso zzso signal of a zzso is zzso It zzso the second harmonic zzso of the exciting light generated by noble metal zzso in whose zzso the dye molecules are placed, to further enhance the zzso zzso signal in addition to the usual zzso zzso zzso This method enables demonstration, for the first time, of zzso zzso enhancement inside a biological system, namely live zzso A zzso zzso zzso containing a silver core, a protective zzso zzso which serves also as an zzso zzso inhibitor zzso a pH indicator dye zzso and a zzso zzso are zzso zzso this technique, an enhancement of up to 20 times in the zzso zzso of the indicator dye is zzso Although a significant portion of the enhanced zzso signal is due to zzso processes accompanying the zzso generation of the exciting light, this method preserves all the advantages of zzso zzso zzso enhanced penetration depth, localized zzso low zzso low zzso and low cellular zzso
