zzso zzso infection is associated with zzso zzso zzso and gastric zzso Due to its high global prevalence and uprising resistance to available zzso efforts are now directed to identify alternative source to treat and prevent associated zzso In the present study, effect of selected indigenous medicinal plants of Pakistan was evaluated on the zzso of zzso zzso and generation of zzso oxygen species zzso in a bid to zzso their medicinal use and to examine the zzso and zzso effects in gastric zzso zzso 

zzso cells and clinically isolated zzso zzso strain zzso were employed for zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso effects of the selected plants were determined by serial dilution method and DNA fragmentation zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso were performed to evaluate the effect on zzso zzso and zzso generation in zzso zzso zzso 

At zzso extracts of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Rosa zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibited strong zzso activity against zzso zzso Of these, four extracts of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso markedly inhibited zzso zzso at both 50 and zzso zzso zzso was further assessed at different zzso against zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which displayed significant suppression of zzso in a zzso Among the plants examined against zzso generation, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated significant suppression of zzso from zzso zzso cells ( zzso 

zzso of the study revealed zzso and zzso effects of selected medicinal plants which could partially validate the traditional use of these plants in zzso disorders particularly associated with zzso zzso Furthermore, results obtained may lead to possible future candidates of zzso against zzso zzso or gastric zzso
