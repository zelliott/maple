zzso cell zzso requires two positive signals for killing of zzso zzso receptors induce polarization of the zzso organization center and zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso formation and zzso zzso and under some circumstances may be sufficient for zzso cell zzso Although the zzso for direct killing of zzso is not known, zzso the zzso chain of zzso binds components of the capsule and cell wall of the opportunistic pathogen zzso zzso namely the zzso zzso and zzso zzso we also demonstrate that zzso was concentrated in regions of the zzso cell surface interacting with zzso zzso zzso there was compelling evidence to zzso that zzso cells would also use zzso to recognize and kill zzso zzso Using a combination of zzso cell lines that did or did not express zzso or by using a zzso functional blocking zzso we confirm that zzso cell zzso activity is critically dependent upon the expression of zzso zzso the events of tumor zzso zzso cells form zzso with zzso targets, rearrange the cell zzso to develop an zzso zzso zzso and release zzso zzso however, each of these events occurred independently of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso killing of zzso zzso was zzso in both zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso and in zzso cells lacking cell surface zzso zzso These results demonstrate that in the absence of zzso zzso zzso cells are fully capable of recognizing a target zzso zzso and retain all of the events required for zzso
