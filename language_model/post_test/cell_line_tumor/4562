zzso zzso 5 zzso has been used for gene therapy with limited success due to insufficient zzso in cells with low expression of the primary zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Evidence that zzso zzso receptors other than zzso may be of use was presented in previous studies that showed that the zzso zzso is expressed at high levels in zzso cancer zzso We hypothesized that combined use of unique zzso fibers in the context of novel mosaic zzso zzso would enhance zzso via zzso pathways in zzso cancer zzso 

We constructed and characterized zzso zzso that use zzso zzso and zzso fibers to generate a mosaic fiber zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso uses a zzso zzso 1 protein to zzso cells expressing zzso acid and junction zzso zzso zzso We therefore constructed a mosaic fiber zzso zzso designated zzso 1, zzso two zzso a zzso 1 zzso fiber and the zzso zzso fiber composed of an zzso zzso 

zzso zzso 1 used zzso acid, junction zzso zzso 1, and zzso zzso for cell zzso and achieved maximum zzso enhancement in zzso cancer cells with low zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso 1 achieved zzso enhancement in primary tissue slices of human zzso zzso 

We have developed a new type of zzso zzso with the novel zzso possessing fibers from zzso and zzso which exhibits enhanced zzso via zzso zzso In addition, the flexible genetic platform of zzso allows different combination of fiber zzso that can be incorporated within the same zzso
