zzso zzso expression and zzso of the zzso zzso have been associated with pancreatic zzso zzso but whether zzso activity is required for the development of pancreatic cancer has remained zzso Here, we report the results of three different approaches to inhibit the zzso zzso in a established transgenic mouse model of pancreatic zzso First, we found that zzso zzso cells were incapable of undergoing zzso to zzso zzso a process associated with development of zzso pancreatic zzso zzso zzso Second, we addressed the specific role of zzso zzso signaling through zzso expression of zzso an zzso zzso inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso Finally, we targeted the zzso zzso with zzso a therapeutic zzso that interacts with multiple zzso zzso Together, these approaches showed that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is required to initiate pancreatic zzso Moreover, they establish that zzso signaling is also critical for progression of pancreatic cancer, a finding with potential therapeutic zzso
