Human zzso protein belongs to the zzso of zzso large zzso that are involved in zzso membrane zzso zzso is induced by zzso zzso and is a key component of the zzso response against zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso to zzso that are positive for specific markers of the smooth zzso zzso such as zzso but is excluded from other membrane zzso zzso of zzso leads to a characteristic reorganization of the associated zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso and zzso which normally accumulate in zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, also zzso with zzso indicating that these markers were redistributed to the zzso zzso zzso zzso however, did not show any effect of zzso on zzso or the zzso zzso The present results demonstrate that zzso is an zzso zzso zzso protein that resembles the zzso expressed large zzso family members in its capacity to zzso to and reorganize zzso zzso
