zzso is frequently zzso in head and neck zzso cell cancer zzso zzso is a zzso zzso designed to interact with zzso block its zzso reduce the downstream signaling pathways and induce zzso zzso This study aims to investigate the role of the zzso signaling zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso cell line and to propose a new therapeutic strategy to zzso treatment of zzso The zzso cell line, zzso was sensitive to zzso but resistant to zzso zzso zzso an unexpected zzso zzso in zzso cells similarly to zzso but this zzso zzso does not trigger zzso zzso the process currently implicated in the response to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, whereas the level of zzso zzso is unmodified in zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso cells harbor a zzso zzso The treatment of zzso cells with zzso inhibitor and zzso restores the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso is impaired by zzso treatment in zzso cells and that the zzso zzso is a central element in zzso zzso The combination of zzso with a zzso inhibitor could be a good therapeutic option in zzso zzso
