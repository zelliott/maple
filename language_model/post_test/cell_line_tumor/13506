zzso zzso type 1 zzso converts zzso zzso into zzso zzso and is expressed in many zzso zzso and breast cancer cell zzso Because the potent zzso zzso stimulates the growth and development of zzso diseases, zzso of the final step of zzso synthesis is considered a promising strategy for the treatment of breast zzso On the basis of our previous study identifying zzso zzso as a lead compound for the zzso of zzso we conducted a number of structural modifications to reduce its zzso residual zzso zzso The steroid zzso zzso zzso emerged as a potent inhibitor of zzso with an zzso value of 68 zzso for the transformation of E1 into zzso When tested in the zzso breast cancer cell line zzso and in mice, zzso showed no zzso activity in the range of zzso zzso Furthermore, with the purpose of evaluating the zzso of zzso and zzso injected zzso zzso zzso we measured their zzso zzso as a function of time, calculated the area under the curve zzso and showed a significant improvement for zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso We next tested the in zzso efficiency of zzso on the zzso zzso tumor model in female zzso zzso nude zzso After a treatment with zzso tumor sizes in mice zzso with zzso E1 were completely reduced at the control group level (without E1 zzso As a conclusion, zzso is a promising zzso inhibitor of zzso for the treatment of zzso diseases such as breast zzso
