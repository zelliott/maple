zzso zzso zzso zzso infection is a major risk factor of zzso zzso gastric cancer, and gastric zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso The interplay between zzso zzso and host is an important issue for zzso of zzso of zzso zzso zzso We aimed to examine simultaneously dynamic changes of multiple molecular pathways of infection affected by different zzso zzso strains by zzso zzso 

To zzso the zzso between zzso zzso and gastric zzso cells, we isolated three different zzso zzso strains from patients with gastric cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso and gastric zzso zzso zzso The bacteria were zzso with gastric zzso cells zzso and total zzso were extracted from zzso cells and used for detection of genes represented in the zzso 

Of the zzso clones on the zzso there were 522 genes expressed differently in the three zzso Of the 522 zzso there were 4 zzso 4 genes and 13 zzso either zzso or zzso more than twofold change, in zzso cells induced specifically by zzso MA, and zzso strain, zzso The zzso and zzso strains induced more genes involving in zzso such as zzso zzso B, and zzso 

Our data by zzso zzso suggest bacterial factors may determine the outcomes of zzso zzso zzso The expression profiles of zzso zzso provide clues for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of zzso zzso zzso zzso
