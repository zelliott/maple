zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are expressed from distinct cellular areas and need to encounter to interact and assemble infectious zzso zzso particles may also incorporate zzso derived from other enveloped viruses via active or passive mechanisms, a process known as zzso To further understand the mechanisms of zzso we have investigated the capacity of zzso leukemia virus zzso or zzso core particles to recruit zzso derived from different virus families: the G protein of zzso zzso virus zzso the zzso from an influenza virus, the zzso zzso of zzso C virus zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cat zzso zzso The parameters that influenced the incorporation of viral zzso onto zzso core particles were zzso the intrinsic cell zzso properties of both viral zzso and zzso core zzso zzso the ability of the viral zzso to interact with the zzso core, and zzso the expression of the zzso zzso zzso Whereas the zzso and zzso zzso were recruited by zzso and zzso core proteins at the cell surface, the zzso and zzso zzso were most likely recruited in late zzso In addition, whereas these zzso could be passively incorporated on either zzso type, the zzso zzso was also actively recruited by zzso core zzso which, through interactions with the zzso tail of the latter zzso induced its zzso to late zzso zzso Finally, the expression of zzso proteins specifically enhanced the incorporation of the zzso zzso by increasing their zzso in late zzso
