zzso cancer is unusual among zzso in that it may be diagnosed at a zzso stage through detection of a protein in serum, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by both normal and zzso prostate zzso cells in response to zzso hormones and has found widespread use in cancer zzso Because zzso screening is controversial due to sensitivity and specificity issues, efforts continue to focus on the identification and characterization of additional markers that may be used for diagnostic and therapeutic zzso In this study, we report the application of quantitative zzso techniques that incorporate isotope coded affinity tag zzso and tandem mass zzso to zzso identify zzso and cell surface proteins from zzso prostate zzso zzso cells, a prostate zzso cell line that zzso zzso in response to zzso exposure, were grown in a low zzso media under zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the media identified in excess of 600 zzso zzso of which could be zzso Nine percent of the proteins had zzso ratios zzso zzso including zzso and zzso had ratios zzso zzso A subset of these zzso proteins appeared to be expressed in zzso Of these, selected mass zzso observations were confirmed by Western zzso The findings suggest that zzso release of proteins may occur through the zzso of zzso zzso rather than exclusively through zzso or zzso control zzso On the basis of their known functional roles, several of the abundant zzso proteins may participate in the progression of zzso zzso cell growth and should be considered as potential serum markers of zzso prostate zzso
