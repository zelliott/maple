zzso protein zzso zzso is involved in transformation and zzso and has been shown to be zzso in tumor cells compared to normal cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso shares zzso protein identity with the human zzso zzso zzso To study zzso protein as a target for active vaccination zzso zzso was administered as a zzso zzso zzso mice were zzso with either zzso protein and zzso as a molecular zzso or zzso zzso Two weeks following the final zzso mice were challenged zzso with zzso tumor cells that zzso zzso Two distinct zzso tumor cell lines were used for challenge in this model, zzso and zzso Half of the mice zzso with zzso and zzso rejected or delayed onset of zzso zzso tumor cell growth, and zzso of mice challenged with zzso rejected zzso tumor growth, as well as the formation of spontaneous lethal lung zzso Mice zzso with zzso and zzso generated zzso zzso zzso zzso responses indicating that zzso protein vaccination induced an zzso immune zzso In addition, mice that rejected tumor challenge generated zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso microscopic and gross evaluation of zzso from zzso zzso mice revealed no evidence of zzso as assessed by absence of T cell zzso and absence of microscopic zzso Together, these data demonstrate that zzso vaccination zzso an immune response that is capable of rejecting tumors that zzso zzso without the induction of harmful zzso
