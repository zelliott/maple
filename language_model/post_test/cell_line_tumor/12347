In addition to its well-documented role in integration of the viral zzso the zzso zzso IN zzso is thought to be involved in the preceding step of importing the viral zzso into the zzso The ability of zzso to transport its zzso through an intact nuclear envelope allows zzso to zzso zzso cells, which is thought to be crucial for the persistent nature of zzso Despite this, the mechanism zzso by zzso to import its zzso into the nucleus, and the viral proteins involved, remains zzso In the present study we zzso in zzso techniques to assess the nuclear import properties of the IN zzso and show that IN interacts with members of the zzso zzso family of nuclear transport proteins with high affinity and exhibits rapid nuclear zzso within an in zzso zzso indicating that IN possesses potent zzso zzso IN nuclear import appears to be dependent on the zzso zzso zzso and Ran zzso zzso in its zzso zzso but does not require zzso zzso we show that IN is capable of binding DNA and zzso its import into the nucleus of zzso cells via a process that involves basic zzso within zzso acids zzso of zzso These results confirm IN as an efficient zzso of DNA nuclear import in zzso and imply the potential for IN to zzso such a role in zzso These results may not only aid in highlighting potential therapeutic targets for zzso the progression of zzso but may also be relevant for zzso gene zzso
