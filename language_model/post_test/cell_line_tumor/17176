The zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso mediates biological and zzso actions of zzso zzso aromatic zzso such as zzso Although much is known about the zzso and molecular mechanisms of zzso action, little is known about the control of the expression of the zzso gene zzso zzso we aimed at the identification and characterization of regions important for zzso zzso gene zzso First, we screened zzso zzso of the zzso region of the zzso gene in 91 healthy Caucasian volunteers for naturally occurring genetic zzso Seven zzso were zzso However, they do not seem to influence zzso gene expression in zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso reporter gene construct and various deletion zzso a putative regulatory region was identified and characterized further by zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso zzso These investigations were confirmed by zzso experiments in zzso zzso zzso The obtained results prove an involvement of zzso in zzso gene zzso
