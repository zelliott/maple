The therapeutic zzso zzso is directed against the zzso zzso and is used for the treatment of zzso zzso leukemia zzso We investigated the mechanism of action of this zzso in zzso against different zzso B cells and compared it to the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were performed on freshly isolated zzso cells using human serum as the source of zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso release zzso using peripheral blood zzso cells as zzso cells, before and after 2 days of culture with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso cells from the 23 zzso samples through complement zzso zzso zzso much more efficiently than zzso did zzso zzso presumably because of the higher expression of zzso than of zzso All other zzso B cells, including 1 zzso zzso 2 zzso cell zzso and 6 zzso Hodgkin's zzso were effective targets for both zzso with zzso and zzso mean zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were highly expressed in these zzso In contrast, most zzso B cell samples were poorly zzso through zzso using freshly isolated peripheral blood zzso cells as zzso with either zzso zzso and regardless of target zzso zzso zzso was, however, significantly increased in all cases by zzso the zzso cells with zzso for 2 zzso 

zzso zzso is likely to be an important mechanism of action of zzso in zzso and combination with zzso may increase this zzso efficacy through zzso zzso zzso B cells other than zzso express high levels of zzso and are good targets for zzso zzso
