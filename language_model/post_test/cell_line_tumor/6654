New zzso complexes of the type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 8) have been zzso from the reaction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso The complexes obtained have been characterized by zzso analyses and zzso in the solid state, and by zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso complexes 1, 3 and 5 have also been tested against a panel of several human tumor cell lines in order to evaluate their zzso zzso zzso 1 and 5 showed zzso values appreciably lower than those exhibited by zzso the most used zzso zzso zzso It is worth noting that all three tested zzso complexes appear to be particularly effective against zzso zzso cells that are resistant to zzso zzso
