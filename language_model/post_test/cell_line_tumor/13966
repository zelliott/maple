In this study we show that zzso zzso media zzso zzso zzso 40 zzso zzso 40) expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso and can promote zzso differentiation to the invasive zzso resulting in switching of zzso and zzso zzso zzso This suggests that growth factors zzso by the zzso such as zzso mediate zzso zzso and may do so by modulating C zzso 40 expression and zzso To test this hypothesis we have zzso migration zzso using cell lines expressing C zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed with zzso zzso zzso C zzso 40 zzso and zzso cells seeded on zzso zzso with 8 zzso pores and incubated in the absence or presence of zzso zzso zzso Cell migration was only observed in the presence of zzso zzso zzso of C zzso 40 in zzso cells resulted in zzso of cell migration as compared to zzso zzso zzso of zzso to cultured zzso cells resulted in the zzso of C zzso 40 zzso zzso is known to stimulate zzso zzso and was detected in zzso therefore, we investigated the action of zzso on C zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso resulted in the zzso of C zzso 40 in the zzso cell zzso However, zzso had no effect on zzso cell zzso We conclude that zzso zzso of growth factors, such as zzso may act to prime zzso for zzso through zzso of zzso expression and zzso
