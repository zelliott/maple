We previously have generated a zzso T cell zzso fusion protein zzso zzso zzso genetically linked to a soluble zzso zzso recognizing a zzso of human zzso zzso In this report, we show that zzso zzso the growth of primary tumors derived from the zzso zzso human melanoma and exhibits significantly better zzso activity than zzso human zzso zzso Moreover, treatment with zzso results in tumor growth zzso in mice bearing large zzso tumors and other zzso human tumors but does not affect tumor outgrowth of zzso zzso This suggests that zzso targeting plays a substantial role in the efficacy of zzso against zzso zzso Further, the zzso activity of zzso was found to be likely zzso by zzso cell zzso and tumor zzso A biologically active zzso version of the zzso zzso also exhibits favorable zzso properties required of a clinical candidate for this novel class of potent zzso activities and targeted zzso zzso
