Increased expression of zzso protein zzso has recently been proved to be a crucial event for irremediable zzso zzso zzso stress resulting in the programmed cell death zzso of pancreatic zzso The present study demonstrated that treatment with zzso zzso zzso a potent zzso of zzso stress, drastically induced zzso expression accompanied by the generation of zzso zzso as an indicator of zzso in zzso human zzso zzso This result substantiated that zzso is also involved in zzso triggered by zzso zzso Moreover, we evaluated the effects of zzso a citrus zzso on zzso zzso and zzso expression in zzso cells, because we reported previously that this zzso might be able to reduce zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with 100 zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso for zzso strongly suppressed zzso and increased zzso expression induced by 1 zzso zzso treatment zzso In addition, we proved that the ability of 100 zzso zzso treatment to reduce zzso expression is exerted from zzso after the onset of zzso zzso the protective and zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso and impaired memory, which several studies using animal models have demonstrated, might arise in part from zzso ability to repress zzso zzso
