The aim of this study was to determine the effect of zzso against zzso zzso and the influence on the zzso capacity of zzso in zzso 22 zzso zzso zzso zzso mice were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso before the injection of zzso (5 zzso zzso for 5 days zzso zzso after zzso zzso cells were zzso All animals were killed on the fifth day after zzso treatment and zzso weight of each animal was zzso Liver pathological changes were examined by light zzso and zzso zzso The expressions of liver zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso oxide zzso 2) and zzso were assessed by Western zzso zzso showed a significant protection as evidenced by the decrease of elevated serum zzso and zzso zzso and improvement of zzso injury induced by zzso The formation of liver zzso with a zzso reduction of reduced zzso was also inhibited by zzso while the activities of liver zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were all increased, zzso In addition, the over expressions of liver zzso and zzso were suppressed by zzso The administration of zzso had no affect on the zzso capacity of zzso in mice bearing zzso zzso The zzso action of zzso provides a new approach for preventing the zzso induced by zzso in the zzso
