The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso is a major gatekeeper of the zzso cell cycle progression known to be regulated by both, its zzso zzso and its zzso To allow entrance into S phase and thereby zzso cell cycle progression zzso must be zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso whose task is to target zzso for degradation by the zzso The tumor zzso gene product zzso directly binds to zzso and protects it from degradation via zzso zzso zzso and zzso are known to be localized to both, the zzso and the nucleus, the zzso of zzso remained zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso is a zzso and nuclear zzso In addition we found an inverse correlation of the zzso protein levels of zzso with zzso and zzso in different transformed cells and under different growth zzso These data allow new important insights into this molecular network of cell cycle zzso
