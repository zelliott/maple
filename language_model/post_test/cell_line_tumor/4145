Previous studies have demonstrated that zzso of zzso signaling 3 zzso also known as zzso a member of the zzso family, plays an important zzso role through enhancing the zzso of zzso zzso response zzso protein zzso In this report, we delineate the zzso role of zzso in multiple myeloma zzso To do this, we developed a cell zzso model induced by zzso in zzso Our data indicate that decreased expression of zzso is correlated with reduced levels of zzso in the zzso zzso The negative role of zzso in cell zzso was further confirmed by knocking down zzso The zzso has been shown to influence tumor cell zzso in response to zzso Since cell zzso drug resistance remains a major obstacle for successful treatment of zzso we constructed a cell zzso model in zzso and detected the changing of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso reversed the high rate of zzso cell zzso to either zzso or zzso zzso zzso with the reduced zzso rate, the cells also exhibited reduced drug resistance to zzso zzso and zzso zzso these data indicate that zzso may be represented as a good candidate for pursuing clinical trials in zzso Moreover, our data provide a clinical therapeutic target for zzso and potentially other tumors that home and/or zzso to the zzso
