The protein zzso zzso zzso zzso has been reported to inhibit proliferation and to induce cell death in various zzso and solid cancer cell zzso zzso we examined the effects of zzso in several human zzso zzso cell zzso We found that zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells at zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso h of zzso The growth of a zzso immortalized human zzso cell line, zzso was inhibited at similar zzso There was a reduction in zzso incorporation and a moderate zzso zzso release as a sign of cell death in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso changes with zzso swelling and zzso in zzso cells treated with high zzso of zzso zzso zzso was associated with an increased zzso II complex zzso Furthermore, zzso induced cell cycle arrest in zzso There was an increase in the zzso and zzso levels in response to zzso However, there was no difference in zzso sensitivity between zzso colon zzso cells and zzso control zzso zzso cell death in zzso and zzso was unaffected by the zzso expression of the preferential zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression of the zzso zzso protein attenuated the zzso effects of zzso Moreover, the zzso expression of zzso zzso which acts as a zzso zzso zzso at zzso degrees C but assumes zzso zzso properties at zzso degrees C, in zzso or zzso cells, had no effect on zzso zzso at either zzso zzso did not act in zzso with zzso zzso zzso or various cancer chemotherapy drugs in zzso or zzso cell death zzso Thus, zzso protein zzso zzso are promising agents for the experimental treatment of zzso zzso
