zzso to growth factors is a fundamental feature of cellular zzso In this study, we found markedly decreased level of zzso a key scaffold protein in nuclear pore complex zzso in zzso human zzso zzso as well as in zzso of aged zzso zzso of zzso by specific zzso in young human zzso zzso prevented the effective nuclear zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso following zzso growth factor zzso zzso and decreased the expression of zzso in zzso The disturbances in zzso signaling in zzso depleted cells closely mirror the similar changes in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells caused cell death, rather than growth zzso indicating a greater sensitivity to zzso depletion in cancer cells than in normal zzso These findings support the notion that zzso may contribute significantly to the regulation of cell fate in aged and transformed cells by modulating nuclear trafficking of signal zzso
