zzso a member of the zzso zzso is an embryonic zzso that is zzso in different types of zzso zzso increases the zzso by inducing zzso and promoting zzso zzso zzso zzso suppresses the growth and invasion of zzso Since zzso zzso zzso are the major zzso zzso in most zzso we investigated whether zzso is involved in the differentiation of zzso Our results revealed that zzso zzso in tumor zzso zzso the production of zzso in zzso and reversed zzso to classically activated zzso zzso In contrast, treatment with zzso zzso zzso decreased the expression of zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso promoted zzso polarization to an alternatively activated zzso zzso and modulated its zzso These results suggest that zzso may play an important role in zzso polarization and zzso of zzso The rescued zzso function of zzso via the zzso of zzso expression could be a new therapeutic strategy for cancer zzso
