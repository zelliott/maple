We have previously reported that the zzso efficiency of zzso zzso labeled zzso zzso zzso zzso was enhanced by zzso gas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and ultrasound zzso exposure by improving zzso zzso However, it has not been well understood whether zzso and US exposure can enhance the zzso efficiency of other carriers except zzso zzso In this study, to evaluate whether zzso and US exposure can be generally applied to gene delivery carriers, we focused on folate as a model zzso and examined whether zzso and US exposure could enhance the zzso efficiency of zzso zzso zzso zzso could zzso into cells zzso whereas they could not deliver genes into zzso from zzso zzso zzso and US exposure could enhance the zzso efficiency of zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso alone without their direct induction into zzso These results suggested that zzso and US exposure could enhance the zzso efficiency of zzso zzso in the same manner as zzso zzso Thus, zzso and US exposure may be a promising tool to achieve efficient gene zzso into various gene carriers in zzso
