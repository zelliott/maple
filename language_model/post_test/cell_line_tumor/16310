zzso is a recently described zzso zzso of zzso zzso whose expression and zzso has been correlated with the biology of some zzso Little is known about the molecular functions of zzso although its zzso has been associated with cell zzso We have studied the effects of zzso zzso on cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and focal zzso zzso The small hairpin zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in increased cell zzso and a failure to properly zzso focal zzso zzso even in the zzso zzso On the contrary, the zzso induced zzso of zzso results in the zzso of cell zzso and zzso of focal zzso zzso This is zzso through the zzso of zzso zzso without affecting zzso affinity state or zzso binding zzso Furthermore, zzso signaling and focal zzso signaling zzso each other and signal in exclusion with each other, zzso a switch that zzso cell zzso zzso These data provide considerable insight into how zzso functions to regulate cell zzso and reveal a novel zzso through which zzso zzso can oppose zzso cell zzso
