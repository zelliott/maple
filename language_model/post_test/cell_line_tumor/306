The zzso growth factor zzso zzso is a validated target for therapy in zzso cell lung cancer zzso Most patients, however, either do not benefit or develop resistance to specific zzso of the zzso zzso zzso activity, such as zzso or zzso The zzso target of zzso zzso is a key zzso zzso zzso proliferation and survival pathways and has been associated with resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we assessed the effects of combining the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso with zzso on a panel of zzso cell lines characterized by zzso resistance and able to maintain zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso plus zzso induced a significant decrease in the zzso of zzso and zzso signaling pathways downstream of zzso and resulted in a zzso effect rather than in an enhancement of cell zzso A synergistic effect was observed in those cell lines characterized by high zzso index and low doubling zzso These data suggest that treatment with zzso and zzso might be of value in the treatment of selected zzso patients that exhibit high tumor zzso zzso
