zzso zzso D zzso has been identified as a negative regulator of zzso cell zzso however, its molecular zzso and downstream signaling pathways that mediate this activity have remained zzso In this study, we provide evidence that the zzso zzso zzso 1 like zzso an important regulator of the complex zzso zzso machinery, is a novel in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso 937 and zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso by binding of zzso proteins and thus impacts the control of local zzso zzso and zzso zzso during cell zzso In line with this, we show that the loss of zzso decreases zzso zzso zzso a more spread cell zzso and stimulates zzso migration of breast cancer cells in an zzso zzso Our data thus identify zzso as a central regulator of the zzso signaling network via direct zzso and regulation of zzso
