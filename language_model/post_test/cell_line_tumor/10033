Recently, zzso gene zzso induced by small interfering zzso zzso was found in zzso and human zzso However, previous studies focused on zzso zzso 

In this study, we designed zzso targeting the promoter of human zzso 16 zzso and zzso it into the cervical cancer cell line, zzso E6 and zzso zzso and protein expression were detected in cells treated by zzso zzso zzso cellular growth, zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso we investigated promoter DNA zzso and zzso zzso status in cells treated with zzso zzso 

We found that zzso zzso and protein were simultaneously reduced, cell growth and proliferation were inhibited and cell death, especially zzso was remarkably zzso Meanwhile, we also found a significantly increasing zzso zzso zzso on the promoter when zzso gene expression was zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso zzso effectively and simultaneously knocks down both extraneous zzso 16 E6 and zzso at the zzso level, and consequently zzso proliferation and zzso death in zzso zzso zzso This zzso repression is probably induced by zzso modification rather than by zzso of DNA zzso
