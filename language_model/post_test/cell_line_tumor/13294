The zzso agent, zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in arrest at the zzso phase of the cell cycle and zzso cell zzso However, the molecular mechanism of this growth zzso and zzso is poorly zzso In this study, we used zzso and zzso human breast zzso cells which have different zzso zzso zzso and tumor zzso zzso zzso to examine the mechanisms of zzso growth zzso and zzso Treatment of the cells with zzso resulted in a zzso zzso of cell zzso which was accompanied by an zzso of cells at zzso and the zzso zzso region, determined by flow zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso DNA zzso formation and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in both cell lines were observed following treatment with zzso indicating the occurrence of zzso cell zzso Western zzso analysis using whole cell zzso from zzso and zzso cells treated with zzso demonstrated that zzso treatment inhibited expression of zzso and zzso proteins in a zzso zzso The zzso effects of zzso on cell growth and zzso induced by zzso were also associated with the zzso of zzso zzso expression and a marked induction in the activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso elevated zzso promoter activity in both cell zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso arrest and zzso in human breast zzso cells is zzso through the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso
