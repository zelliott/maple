T cell factor 4 zzso interacts with zzso in the zzso signaling zzso and zzso downstream target genes involved in cancer zzso To identify proteins that regulate zzso biological responses, we performed a zzso zzso screen to search for a zzso zzso and found that zzso interacts with zzso We confirmed that zzso is a zzso protein by zzso Using the zzso reporter zzso we found that zzso blocks zzso zzso The zzso binding regions of zzso were identified by zzso deletion mapping and zzso mobility shift zzso zzso zzso and zzso interactions abolished the DNA binding ability of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cancer cells led to the conversion of zzso cells to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso promoter reporter analysis showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso expression and significantly induced zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso induction was accompanied by zzso zzso and the appearance of a zzso zzso zzso zzso also increased both zzso and protein levels of zzso a known zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso enhances the ability of zzso to bind the zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a novel zzso zzso This study provides the first evidence for the involvement of zzso in zzso zzso zzso
