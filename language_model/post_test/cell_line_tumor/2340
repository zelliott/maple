zzso dysfunction and lowered cerebral blood flow are thought to contribute to the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso zzso is a potent zzso the production of which is mainly zzso by zzso zzso zzso We previously showed that zzso is zzso by zzso zzso and its expression elevated in zzso zzso brain zzso We have now investigated whether there is a zzso increase in zzso We studied zzso zzso from 20 cases of sporadic zzso and 20 matched zzso The cellular distribution of zzso was assessed zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein were measured in zzso of superior zzso zzso by real-time zzso and sandwich zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso cells were incubated with 10 zzso zzso zzso for 24 zzso and zzso protein level was measured in cell culture zzso by sandwich zzso zzso to zzso labeled zzso throughout the zzso cortex, and the walls of some cerebral blood zzso zzso zzso measured in the zzso zzso was significantly elevated in zzso when zzso for expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso marker zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso protein was also significantly higher in zzso than in control zzso when adjusted for zzso content by measurement of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein in zzso cell zzso rose zzso after exposure to 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings provide evidence of zzso of the zzso system in zzso further supporting the suggestion that zzso zzso zzso may be of value for the treatment of this zzso
