It has been known for some time that the human zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso and zzso proteins work in concert to degrade zzso and to regulate selective export of late viral zzso during productive zzso Both of these functions rely on the formation by the zzso zzso protein of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complex containing zzso B and zzso zzso is believed to function as the zzso recognition module for the complex and, in addition to zzso zzso and DNA zzso IV have also been identified as zzso To discover additional zzso we have taken a zzso approach by using two-dimensional difference gel zzso to detect cellular proteins that decrease significantly in amount in zzso zzso human lung zzso cells after expression of zzso and zzso using zzso zzso Several species were detected and identified by mass zzso and for one of these, zzso zzso we went on in a parallel study to confirm it as a bone fide zzso of the complex zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although the system has some limitations, it may still be of some general use in identifying candidate zzso of any viral zzso zzso zzso zzso complex, and we suggest a series of criteria for zzso zzso
