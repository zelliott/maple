Brain cancer zzso cells zzso are cancer cells with neural stem cell zzso properties found in zzso zzso zzso and they are assigned a central role in tumor zzso progression and zzso The zzso zzso is important for maintenance and cell fate decisions in the normal zzso zzso zzso signaling is often zzso in zzso and recent results suggest that this zzso plays a significant role in zzso as zzso We therefore wished to further zzso the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso cells were cultured as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was accomplished either by blocking the zzso using the zzso inhibitor zzso or by zzso it by zzso the cells with the zzso active zzso zzso 

zzso zzso cultures with high zzso zzso zzso displayed sensitivity toward zzso zzso with regard to zzso features as demonstrated by increased zzso population and reduced colony formation zzso Of the zzso zzso only the primary sphere forming potential was affected, while no effect was observed on zzso or zzso In contrast, when zzso signaling was activated a decrease in the zzso population and an enhanced capability of colony formation was observed, along with increased zzso and zzso 

Based on the presented results we propose that active zzso signaling plays a role for cell growth and stem zzso features in zzso zzso cultures and that zzso zzso treatment could be feasible for zzso patients with high zzso zzso zzso zzso
