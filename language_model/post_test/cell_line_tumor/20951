zzso zzso is a zzso to produce an animal model of Parkinson's zzso zzso increased the formation of zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso damaged DNA, and induced zzso in human zzso zzso zzso Iron or copper zzso inhibited zzso zzso formation and zzso Thus, iron and copper are involved in the zzso zzso generated damage to DNA, a stimulus for initiating zzso This study examined DNA damage caused by zzso plus metal zzso using zzso DNA zzso zzso increased levels of zzso damaged DNA in the presence of zzso or zzso zzso DNA damage was stronger than zzso DNA zzso The zzso detection of zzso and the zzso method showed that zzso more effectively accelerated the zzso zzso and zzso generation than zzso This study suggests that copper, as well as iron, may play an important role in zzso zzso cell zzso
