The zzso E6 proteins produced by high-risk human zzso zzso are invariably expressed in cervical zzso and are zzso proteins capable of affecting zzso proliferation by binding and zzso key host molecules such as zzso zzso zzso including zzso have the unique ability to zzso the E6 viral transcript, resulting in the production of a truncated E6 protein known as zzso whose precise biological function is zzso This study explored the changes in gene expression of the cervical cancer zzso cell line zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso and observed the zzso of ten zzso Two of these genes were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which have been implicated in drug zzso The results demonstrated that expression of zzso but not full-length zzso specifically increased zzso transcript levels although it did not alter zzso transcript zzso zzso zzso alone also had the ability to cause a moderate increase in zzso at both zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso revealed that zzso activity was abolished in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso without altering their zzso zzso zzso Loss of zzso activity of the zzso zzso resulted in a significant loss of zzso expression and a decrease in drug zzso Analysis of the zzso promoter revealed that, unlike the E6 zzso zzso does not mediate zzso activity solely through zzso zzso Taken together, it was concluded that zzso has a novel function in zzso expression of zzso and, in concert with zzso has implications for drug treatment in zzso cervical zzso
