zzso zzso 6 zzso is a zzso zzso that regulates many important biological zzso including cell migration, viral infection and zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the significance of zzso in the invasion and zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso Three zzso cell lines and two primary cultures of zzso were used for biological zzso zzso for zzso protein was also examined in 70 zzso primary zzso zzso of the zzso gene in the zzso cell lines was carried out by treatment with zzso and their migration and invasion activities were examined by the scratch zzso and zzso invasion zzso zzso zzso expression was greater in all of the zzso cell lines compared to the primary cultures of zzso zzso of zzso markedly zzso the migration and invasion activities of all zzso cell lines ( zzso zzso of zzso protein to a level higher than that in the corresponding normal zzso was observed in 14 zzso of the 70 primary zzso and was significantly correlated with high clinical stage, number of tumors, vascular invasion and zzso zzso ( zzso These results suggest that zzso of the zzso protein is involved in the migration and invasion activities of zzso cells, and may be a good zzso for prediction of zzso zzso
