zzso is known to be zzso through zzso and zzso zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso protects the brain against zzso injury by inducing zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso protective effect was evaluated in zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso cells subjected to transient oxygen zzso zzso Cell viability zzso AM zzso and expression of zzso zzso EPO, zzso and zzso zzso and EPO zzso zzso zzso chain zzso were zzso zzso focal cerebral zzso in rats was induced by 2 hours middle cerebral artery zzso followed by 24 hours zzso zzso or saline was infused from 60 minutes zzso until 30 minutes zzso zzso volume and DNA fragmentation were assessed by zzso zzso and terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were conducted to determine cerebral EPO zzso 

zzso increased cell zzso zzso zzso EPO, and zzso zzso Small interfering zzso suppression of zzso zzso and EPO abolished zzso zzso In the rat stroke model, zzso reduced zzso volume by zzso and DNA fragmentation by zzso versus zzso increased EPO content paralleled these zzso actions of zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso zzso signaling cascade in zzso and zzso could protect the brain from zzso zzso
