zzso and zzso zzso frequently express zzso zzso that contributes to both zzso and clinically observed resistance to radiation zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso many pancreatic and zzso cancer cell lines that express zzso zzso at doses that inhibit the zzso and zzso of zzso but not zzso In the present study, we have examined the mechanism of zzso zzso in cell lines that express zzso zzso and found that zzso zzso is a contributor to radiation survival in tumor cells that express zzso zzso In these experiments, zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso growth factor zzso zzso led to similar levels of zzso as treatment with the zzso zzso Treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso led to similar levels of zzso and the combinations of zzso or zzso plus zzso of zzso zzso or zzso expression did not provide additional zzso compared with zzso or zzso zzso Finally, supplementing culture medium with the zzso zzso transforming growth factor alpha was able to reverse the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso zzso signaling is initiated by zzso zzso to promote radiation survival in pancreatic and zzso zzso
