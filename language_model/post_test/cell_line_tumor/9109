zzso zzso zzso zzso gene transfer has a potent therapeutic effect against superficial human zzso zzso zzso growing in the zzso of zzso nude zzso We determined whether the zzso of zzso might contribute to the zzso zzso 

We treated several human zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso and monitored its effects on the production of zzso factors using real-time zzso zzso chain reaction, Western zzso and zzso analysis and a gel shift based zzso factor zzso To assess the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso activity we used in zzso invasion zzso and evaluated the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso gene therapy in an zzso zzso model of human superficial zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso zzso infected zzso zzso cells vascular zzso growth factor was decreased and zzso zzso zzso protein 10 was zzso In contrast, the addition of as much as 100,000 zzso zzso zzso had no apparent effect on vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso medium derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso infected zzso zzso cells greatly decreased the invasive potential of human zzso cells and zzso their zzso zzso 2 expression compared to zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso nuclear signals, such as the zzso factors zzso zzso and 2, stimulating zzso nuclear factor zzso and zzso In zzso experiments revealed significant vascular zzso growth factor zzso and decreased tumor vessel density in the zzso zzso zzso zzso treated group compared to zzso 

Treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso increases the zzso activity of the zzso cancer zzso This zzso may prove beneficial for treating superficial zzso cancer with zzso zzso zzso and hopefully contribute to a decreased recurrence rate of this zzso
