zzso zzso substance zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso promotes liver zzso zzso and maintains the viability of zzso Surprisingly, we found that the levels of the zzso zzso and expressed protein were both strongly zzso at zzso after a zzso partial zzso zzso in zzso zzso the mechanism and effect of this extraordinary suppression can provide a novel path for exploring the molecular function of zzso during zzso We observed that the zzso levels in the serum were zzso correlated with zzso expression in zzso zzso Treating primary mouse zzso or zzso cells with zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso This suppression was zzso and was zzso by the effect of zzso on the zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso which regulates zzso zzso We further showed that the enhanced zzso of zzso after zzso promoted its interaction with the zzso promoter and zzso zzso expression at early zzso after zzso Interestingly, the zzso of zzso caused a dramatic decrease in zzso expression in zzso zzso expression was also significantly suppressed at zzso after zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso suppression after zzso Treatment with zzso zzso reversed the zzso zzso of zzso expression and led to enhanced zzso expression and reduced cell zzso Our findings suggest that zzso directly zzso the zzso promoter after zzso and that this zzso can zzso zzso zzso These data provide novel insight into the potential role of zzso in zzso structural reconstruction during zzso
