Cancer stem cells have been isolated from human zzso and many other zzso zzso It was previously assumed that many established zzso cell lines also contain a rare zzso of stem zzso This study was designed to investigate the fraction of cancer stem cells in the zzso zzso cell line using zzso and population zzso rather than zzso methods, which are based on specific zzso Interestingly, in the zzso zzso each of the 67 single zzso cells zzso per zzso was able to generate a clone and zzso which subsequently gave rise to a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso cells also possessed zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, our findings indicated that brief exposure to zzso zzso was harmful to the zzso and proliferation of individual zzso zzso zzso the zzso cells may be deprived of their stem cell features in the process of zzso zzso zzso as a step in zzso a zzso side population with flow zzso Thus, we concluded that the zzso line was mainly composed of cancer stem cells, although many of them were neither zzso nor side zzso
