The zzso factor zzso regulates the expression of important zzso zzso zzso of zzso is one of the central pathways by which ethanol generates zzso zzso zzso can be induced by ethanol and several low molecular mass chemicals such as zzso This review discusses zzso and zzso effects of zzso and the effects of zzso in modulating these actions of zzso Besides ethanol, zzso zzso and activates many other zzso important zzso One approach to try to understand the basic effects and actions of zzso was to establish zzso cell lines that zzso express human zzso zzso zzso fatty acids and iron were toxic to the zzso cells, which express zzso zzso zzso but not control zzso cells, which do not express zzso zzso was associated with enhanced zzso stress and could be prevented by antioxidants and zzso if zzso was zzso The zzso cells had higher zzso levels and a twofold increase in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso than control zzso cells due to zzso of their respective zzso These zzso were prevented by zzso suggesting that zzso oxygen species generated by zzso were responsible for the zzso of these zzso zzso This zzso may reflect an zzso mechanism to remove zzso zzso zzso in zzso protein and zzso were observed in zzso of chronic zzso mice or rats and of zzso rats or mice, conditions known to elevate zzso zzso cells showed increased zzso zzso and protein expression compared with control zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes in zzso cells is dependent on zzso and is prevented by zzso zzso zzso by zzso decreases zzso and increases zzso oxygen species and zzso zzso resulting in decreased zzso membrane potential and loss of cell viability of zzso cells, but not zzso zzso zzso is activated and levels of zzso protein and zzso are increased when zzso is zzso These results suggest that zzso plays a key role in the zzso response against increased zzso stress caused by zzso in the zzso zzso However, it is not clear whether zzso is protective against zzso toxicity in zzso as zzso which zzso zzso in zzso mice did not elevate zzso in zzso knockout mice, although zzso produced toxicity in the zzso knockout zzso
