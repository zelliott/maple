To investigate zzso junctions between zzso zzso zzso cells, we examined cultured human and rat zzso zzso cells at the zzso and molecular zzso zzso junctions between cultured human zzso cells, which developed irrespective of the type of culture zzso were detected by transmission electron zzso On the basis of their characteristic zzso these junctions were identified in cultured human zzso zzso cells as zzso junctions but not as tight zzso zzso or gap zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso were detected by Western zzso in rat zzso cells as molecular components of the zzso adhesive zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso were also detected in cultured human zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso were zzso at the contact regions between the cultured human zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso between the zzso cells can be formed both in zzso and in zzso Thus, zzso zzso cells may participate in the structural organization of the cells in liver zzso through the formation of zzso zzso zzso This is the first description of the presence of zzso junctions between zzso zzso cells in zzso at the fine structural and molecular zzso
