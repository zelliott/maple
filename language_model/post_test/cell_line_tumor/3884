zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso function mediates poor therapeutic response in patients with zzso Aurora zzso A zzso and human double minute 2 zzso are negative regulators of zzso zzso we examined the role of zzso in regulating zzso and its subsequent effects on zzso zzso function in gastric zzso 

zzso tumors and in zzso gastric cancer cell models with zzso or zzso of zzso were zzso The role of zzso in regulating zzso and cell survival coupled with zzso expression and activity were zzso 

zzso of zzso enhanced the zzso protein zzso conversely, zzso of zzso zzso decreased expression of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data indicated that zzso was associated with zzso in a protein zzso The in zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso and zzso proteins followed by zzso revealed that zzso directly interacts and zzso zzso protein in zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso led to induction of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso of zzso in gastric cancer zzso zzso of zzso using an zzso zzso specific zzso zzso decreased the zzso protein level and induced zzso zzso zzso These effects markedly decreased cell survival in zzso and zzso tumor growth in zzso zzso analysis of zzso on tissue zzso revealed significant zzso of zzso and zzso in human gastric cancer samples zzso zzso zzso 

zzso our novel findings indicate that zzso promotes tumor growth and cell survival through regulation of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
