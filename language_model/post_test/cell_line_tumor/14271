zzso invasion of brain tissue is a major reason for the poor prognosis of patients with zzso zzso 2, a member of the large zzso family of zzso and zzso zzso is expressed at high protein levels in human zzso and has been proposed as a marker of zzso zzso while its functional role in these zzso is unknown so zzso The ability of zzso 2 to interact with the zzso zzso as well as its potential to bind zzso zzso suggests that it could participate in zzso processes in human zzso zzso we zzso here functional consequences of zzso zzso zzso of zzso 2 in zzso and zzso human zzso cell zzso While no impact of zzso 2 zzso on proliferation and zzso was observed, our analyses revealed that migration of zzso and zzso cells was significantly inhibited following zzso 2 zzso This effect was not related to a zzso increase of the related zzso 1 or zzso Our findings identify zzso 2 as a potential candidate involved in zzso invasion and support the potential of zzso interference as powerful tool in the decryption of zzso invasion zzso
