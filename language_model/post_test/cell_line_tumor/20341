zzso of the human tumor zzso gene 101 zzso are zzso spliced in many zzso A major zzso zzso event on the zzso zzso involves joining of distant alternative zzso and 3' zzso sites within zzso 2 and zzso 9, respectively, resulting in the extensive elimination of the zzso The estimated strengths of the alternative zzso sites are much lower than those of authentic zzso zzso We observed that the equivalent zzso zzso could be generated from an zzso zzso gene expressed zzso in breast cancer zzso zzso we identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso consisting solely of zzso zzso predicted to be generated by a zzso between zzso 2 and zzso 9 on the spliced zzso Our results provide evidence for a zzso zzso zzso in which the initial zzso zzso removes all 14 authentic zzso sites, thereby bringing the weak alternative zzso sites into close zzso We also demonstrate that zzso zzso skipping of the fragile zzso zzso zzso zzso in cancer cells occurs via zzso of spliced zzso zzso The zzso of mature zzso can potentially generate zzso diversity in cancer zzso zzso a mechanism may exist in normal cells to prevent potentially deleterious zzso zzso zzso
