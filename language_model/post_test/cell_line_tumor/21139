The zzso zzso zzso enhances zzso of zzso a zzso zzso important in drug resistance and cellular defense against zzso stress, by enabling cellular zzso of zzso a zzso zzso Because it is known to regulate zzso levels and growth of various cancer cell types, and is expressed in the zzso we zzso that it is involved in growth and drug resistance of pancreatic zzso To examine this, we zzso expression of the zzso zzso in pancreatic cancer cell lines, zzso zzso zzso and zzso as subjected to zzso and zzso zzso The results indicate that these cell lines depend on zzso zzso zzso for growth, as well as survival in zzso stress conditions, and can zzso zzso expression to accommodate growth zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso was zzso expressed in normal pancreatic zzso and zzso in pancreatic cancer zzso from two zzso Furthermore, zzso resistance of cells was associated with elevated zzso expression and specific zzso zzso by zzso zzso led to growth zzso The results suggest that the zzso zzso by enhancing zzso zzso plays a major role in pancreatic cancer growth, therapy resistance and represents a potential therapeutic target for the zzso
