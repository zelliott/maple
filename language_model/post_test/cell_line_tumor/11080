A zzso expression zzso zzso zzso was constructed and identified, then zzso protein expression in zzso lung cancer cell line was zzso A 273 zzso zzso zzso was amplified from the total zzso of normal lung tissue by using zzso and cloned into expression zzso zzso 1, and the zzso zzso was identified by employing double zzso restriction zzso zzso III and zzso I and the zzso sequence was zzso by the zzso zzso chain termination zzso The segment was then zzso into the zzso lung cancer cell zzso The protein expression of zzso was detected by zzso and Western zzso Our results showed that the zzso zzso included the entire coding region zzso zzso The zzso zzso cell expression zzso of zzso zzso was successfully constructed, and the sequence of the insert was identical to the published zzso zzso cells line zzso with the zzso zzso expressed high level of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso may serve as an effective tool for the study of zzso and tumor zzso
