The origin of soluble zzso zzso in the circulation is zzso To examine whether zzso could be an zzso protein zzso the levels of zzso zzso and zzso protein were determined by zzso in serum and zzso fluid zzso of patients with various zzso and the regulation of zzso synthesis was examined in liver zzso In patients with zzso or zzso zzso arthritis zzso zzso serum levels of zzso were higher than or similar to those found in zzso arthritis zzso zzso zzso a relation with bacteria zzso zzso of zzso were similar in zzso and serum, and did not correlate with the number of zzso zzso excluding an important source from zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso In contrast, serum levels of zzso in patients correlated with those of zzso zzso a classical zzso and zzso a zzso known to regulate the synthesis of zzso in the zzso zzso levels of zzso also correlated with disease activity in zzso arthritis and zzso arthritis zzso zzso zzso the production of zzso by zzso zzso zzso By real-time zzso the zzso of zzso by zzso was also observed at the zzso level both in zzso cells and human primary zzso These in zzso results were confirmed by in zzso studies in zzso mice injected with zzso an experimental model of zzso zzso Liver levels of zzso zzso increased in zzso but not in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso can be considered as a type 2 zzso
