zzso combined with zzso is used for the treatment of chronic zzso zzso However, zzso has mechanisms to resist the zzso actions of zzso In order to study the molecular mechanisms of this resistance, the effect of zzso gene expression on zzso nuclear import of zzso zzso factors and the expression of zzso zzso protein were zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso core and zzso proteins clearly inhibited the nuclear import of zzso and zzso protein expression zzso zzso whereas other viral proteins had only a marginal zzso To confirm these zzso human zzso cell lines, which zzso express zzso core zzso the entire structural region zzso the zzso complex, zzso zzso or zzso proteins were also zzso zzso nuclear zzso of zzso was almost completely and zzso was partially blocked in cell lines expressing high levels of zzso core zzso zzso in these cells, zzso zzso protein expression was zzso zzso necrosis zzso zzso nuclear import of zzso was only zzso or not at all zzso suggesting that the nuclear import machinery in general was not zzso The results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which zzso gene expression may interfere with zzso host zzso zzso
