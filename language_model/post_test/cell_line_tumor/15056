This study is designed to screen the zzso related signal zzso zzso in zzso cells and construction of gene zzso zzso Analysis results showed zzso differential genes zzso including zzso of 209 genes and zzso of 205 zzso Basing on the ratio of signal in experimental group to signal in control group, 45 genes zzso genes zzso and seven genes zzso with significant ( zzso change in expression levels were screened according to the screening standard zzso log zzso or zzso These genes involved into zzso cell cycle and zzso signal zzso and stress zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso expression level in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells was zzso 72 h after zzso This value was significantly ( zzso lower than that in blank and negative control zzso zzso protein expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells was significantly ( zzso lower than that in blank and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso can significantly inhibit zzso zzso and protein expression in zzso zzso
