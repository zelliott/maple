zzso play an important role in targeted cancer zzso The optimal zzso delivery system should provide efficient and highly specific recognition of the target cells and rapid zzso of the therapeutic cargo to reduce systemic toxicity as well as to increase the zzso to cancer zzso To this end, we developed a zzso zzso targeted delivery system based on zzso and zzso zzso that uses zzso click reactions for specific zzso of zzso The zzso zzso zzso humanized zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso groups labels cancer cells that zzso zzso surface zzso The drug carrier zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso specifically with the zzso zzso These two components form zzso clusters on the cell surface, which zzso the zzso of the zzso This strategy demonstrated substantial cellular zzso of clusters consisted of zzso zzso modified zzso and zzso zzso zzso and subsequent significant zzso in zzso zzso breast cancer zzso Our results show high efficacy of this strategy for targeted zzso We zzso to broaden the applications of this strategy using agents such as zzso zzso and interfering zzso
