The current study characterizes the impact of zzso zzso distribution on efficacy following sustained zzso zzso chemotherapy in zzso models of zzso zzso A zzso zzso depot zzso was used to deliver zzso in a sustained manner over zzso following zzso zzso Distribution and efficacy studies were carried out in zzso mice bearing zzso zzso solid tumors or zzso mice with zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, a subcutaneous zzso zzso model was used to determine whether systemic drug levels that result from zzso administration of the zzso influence zzso zzso zzso zzso and SC zzso tumor sections were used to study cell death, zzso drug distribution and tumor zzso zzso zzso of zzso were observed in zzso zzso tumor and zzso over the entire study zzso Drug zzso was several fold greater in tumors and zzso when compared to plasma zzso zzso chemotherapy resulted in significant reduction in tumor burden and zzso zzso zzso tumors showed greater cell death compared to the SC tumors as seen by higher zzso and zzso zzso At the zzso level, zzso distributed more towards the core of zzso tumors compared to the SC zzso zzso penetration of drug from nearest blood vessel was zzso fold greater in the zzso tumors than the SC zzso Overall, favorable drug distribution at the zzso zzso and zzso levels in combination with local and systemic sustained drug exposure contribute to the high efficacy zzso These results encourage the clinical use of zzso sustained chemotherapy for zzso zzso
