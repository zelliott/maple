We have recently reported that Ras acts as an intermediate zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Since zzso plays a crucial role in linking inflammatory and zzso zzso we investigated whether this zzso signaling axis observed in zzso also exists in other tumors of diverse origin under zzso Treatment with zzso induced Ras in zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of Ras activity attenuated zzso zzso Our findings suggest that Ras links zzso and zzso in tumors of diverse zzso As we have previously reported that the zzso inhibitor zzso decreases Ras activity in zzso cells, we investigated whether zzso could regulate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso tumor zzso In addition, zzso also decreased zzso induced zzso responses in tumor zzso
