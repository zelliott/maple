zzso zzso zzso designed according to the consensus zzso zzso zzso zzso were used in order to amplify expressed zzso zzso molecules from human gastric zzso zzso From such profiles, more than zzso different types of zzso zzso were identified from gastric cancer zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be expressed in a zzso profile with only low zzso The most zzso gene to zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be zzso in cases of human zzso cancer, but its expression is cases of gastric cancer is not zzso 

The zzso expression of zzso and zzso by zzso was investigated, and the protein expression status of zzso was zzso using zzso to zzso zzso associations of the zzso and zzso family within human stomach zzso 

zzso and zzso were expressed in all gastric cancer cell lines and clinical cancer tissue specimens zzso Following the examination of 92 gastric cancer patients' pathological zzso zzso expression showed no statistical significance with respect to the patients' zzso A statistically significant correlation between zzso zzso and the differentiation status of gastric cancer tissue was, however, zzso 

This finding indicates that both zzso and zzso are expressed within human gastric cancer cells and that zzso seems to play an important role in gastric cancer differentiation and the progression of zzso
