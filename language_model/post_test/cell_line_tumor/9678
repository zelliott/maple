The isolation and analysis of circulating tumor cells zzso from blood are the subject of intense zzso Although tests to detect zzso on a molecular level are available, progress has been hampered by a lack of zzso markers and predictable DNA zzso The main challenge in this endeavor is the small number of available cells of interest, 1-2 per zzso in whole zzso We have designed a zzso device to zzso whole blood using physical means to enrich for and/or isolate rare cells from peripheral zzso It has zzso of four successively zzso channels, each consisting of a two-dimensional array of zzso Current devices have channels ranging in zzso from 20 to 5 zzso and in depth from 20 to 5 zzso Several zzso resulting in the fabrication of a total of 10 zzso devices have been carried out; only two types are used in this zzso Both have increasingly zzso gap zzso between the columns along the flow axis with 20, 15, 10, and 5 zzso spacing all on one zzso The first 20 zzso wide segment zzso the cell suspension and creates an evenly distributed flow over the entire device, whereas the others were designed to retain increasingly smaller zzso The channel depth is constant across the entire device, the first type was 10 zzso deep and the second type is 20 zzso zzso When cells from each of eight tumor cell lines were loaded into the device, all zzso cells were zzso In mixing experiments using human whole blood, we were able to zzso cancer cells without interference from the blood zzso Additionally, either intact cells, or DNA, could be extracted for molecular zzso The ultimate goal of this work is to characterize the cells on the molecular level to provide zzso methods to monitor patients, stage disease, and assess treatment zzso Furthermore, this work will use gene expression profiles to gain insights into zzso
