Stem cell zzso have been advocated as experimental treatments for neurological diseases by virtue of their ability to offer zzso support for injured zzso and, zzso to replace dead zzso Human embryonic stem cells zzso are a rich source of neural precursors zzso for zzso but have been questioned for their tendency to form zzso Here we studied the ability of zzso zzso zzso zzso for cell number and differentiation stage prior to zzso to survive and zzso differentiate and integrate in the zzso zzso zzso of young adult nude rats over long periods of time (6 zzso zzso were derived from adherent zzso cultures of zzso exposed to zzso After zzso zzso showed a drastic reduction in zzso activity and an avid differentiation into zzso that projected via major white matter tracts to a variety of zzso zzso A third of zzso zzso expressed the zzso zzso marker zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formed mature zzso with host zzso structures, including zzso shafts and zzso zzso zzso in white matter tracts showed a tendency toward zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso in the zzso zzso persisted as zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate the long-term ability of zzso human zzso to structurally integrate zzso into the mature zzso zzso while maintaining some cell fate plasticity that is strongly influenced by particular central nervous system zzso zzso
