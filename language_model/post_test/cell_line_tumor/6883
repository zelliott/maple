A comprehensive analysis of the zzso gene and its protein status was carried out on a panel of 56 zzso cancer cell zzso This analysis was based on a combination of zzso zzso zzso screening of all zzso of the zzso zzso sequencing the zzso and assessing the function of the zzso protein by zzso the induced expression of zzso zzso and zzso after exposing cells to zzso In a few cases where there was no production of zzso message nor evidence of functional zzso zzso all of the zzso zzso were zzso zzso Thirteen of the 56 cell lines had functional zzso 21 lines had zzso zzso (one of which made no zzso zzso 4 lines produced no zzso zzso and the remaining 18 lines carried zzso zzso zzso Thus, our results showed a relatively high frequency of zzso zzso zzso in our cell lines, with almost half of the zzso being zzso zzso This is a rather higher frequency of such zzso than usually zzso Of the 18 cell lines with zzso zzso 12 had zzso truncated protein based on Western zzso analysis, whereas no protein was detected in the remaining 6 cell zzso Our data provide a valuable source of zzso 53 zzso for further studies and raise the question of the extent to which zzso zzso may have dominant negative effects, even when no truncated protein can be detected by standard zzso
