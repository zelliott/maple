zzso zzso causes cellular zzso and is associated with fetal growth restriction and zzso In response to zzso the repertoire of genes expressed in zzso zzso changes, which influences key cellular processes such as differentiation and zzso zzso zzso were recently found to zzso the cellular response to zzso Here we show that zzso which was previously shown to be zzso by zzso in zzso cell types, is uniquely zzso in primary human zzso by zzso or chemicals known to hinder cell zzso We also identify zzso as a direct target of zzso in human zzso This effect is unique to zzso and is not seen with other members of this zzso family that are expressed in zzso such as zzso and zzso Our findings establish a unique role for zzso during differentiation of human zzso
