zzso C virus zzso infection is a major problem throughout the zzso Combination therapy of zzso zzso and zzso is the best treatment for zzso at present, but the mechanism is not completely zzso We used the zzso zzso system to investigate this zzso The effects of six drugs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were examined by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction, cloning and zzso The zzso replication was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso at 10 zzso zzso at 100 zzso zzso at 1000 zzso and by zzso zzso at 100 zzso but not by the other drugs at zzso h after zzso Furthermore, the combination treatment was superior to zzso zzso and to zzso zzso at 72 h zzso zzso analyses of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso domain and zzso regions within the zzso zzso region revealed that the total numbers of zzso caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso or combination treatment zzso zzso zzso were more than those of zzso alone zzso zzso 5) and controls zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso system is the most efficient system for zzso replication and is an excellent choice for testing zzso drugs and zzso Our results further suggested that the combination of zzso zzso and zzso might induce zzso and inhibit zzso zzso synthesis in zzso to a greater extent than zzso zzso
