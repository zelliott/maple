zzso zzso protein 3 zzso is a zzso protein with a distinct tissue distribution that may play an important role in fatty acid zzso cell growth, cellular zzso and gene zzso Previously, we have found that zzso was involved in zzso zzso cardiac zzso but the underlying mechanisms have not yet been zzso In the present study, we investigated the characteristics of zzso dysfunction in embryonic cancer cells zzso zzso that zzso zzso We demonstrated that in zzso zzso cells a lower cellular zzso production was accompanied by a dramatic decrease in zzso membrane potential zzso despite the lack of a substantial decrease in the zzso copy zzso In addition, zzso zzso also led to an imbalance in zzso dynamics and to excess zzso zzso oxygen species zzso zzso our results indicated that zzso of zzso in zzso cells caused zzso dysfunction that might be responsible for the development of zzso zzso
