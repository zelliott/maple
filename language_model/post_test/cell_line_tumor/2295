zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in control of plasma LDL zzso zzso cholesterol metabolism by modulating the degradation of zzso LDL zzso Previous studies demonstrated that zzso is a target gene of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso that activates zzso gene zzso through an zzso motif of the zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso nuclear factor zzso positively regulates zzso gene zzso in zzso cells through a binding site located zzso upstream from zzso In the present study, we have identified a novel zzso zzso nuclear factor P) recognition motif residing between the zzso motif and zzso that is essential for zzso and zzso transcriptions of the zzso zzso zzso of this motif lowers the zzso promoter activity and zzso the zzso repression as well as the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso We show further that the activity of zzso in stimulating zzso promoter activity is greatly enhanced by zzso Additional experiments suggest that zzso and its zzso zzso zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso zzso form a functional complex, and zzso may subsequently recruit the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to facilitate the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso each markedly reduces the amount of zzso zzso zzso on the zzso promoter region and lowers zzso protein zzso zzso by utilizing zzso zzso we have demonstrated a direct interaction between zzso and zzso and its zzso zzso Taken together, these new findings identify zzso as a zzso in zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso
