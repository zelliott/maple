The development of zzso involves the zzso of cells from the primary tumor to penetrate the basement zzso invade and then exit the zzso to seed, and colonize distant zzso The last step, establishment of zzso tumors at distant sites, is the least well zzso Four zzso mouse breast cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso that differ in their ability to zzso when implanted into the zzso fat pad are used to model the steps of zzso Only zzso forms zzso lung and liver zzso Because some zzso are zzso in cancer and affect cellular zzso tumor formation, and zzso we examined whether changes in zzso expression might explain the differences in zzso of these zzso 

zzso expression was analyzed by zzso zzso and quantitative zzso in zzso mouse breast cancer cells with distinct zzso zzso zzso cells that form zzso zzso had elevated expression of zzso family zzso compared to related cells that invade distant zzso but are unable to zzso Moreover, zzso zzso in zzso cells enabled them to zzso to lung and zzso These findings are surprising since the zzso family was previously shown to promote zzso characteristics by zzso the zzso zzso zzso and thereby enhancing zzso zzso We confirmed these findings in these zzso The most zzso zzso cells acquired zzso properties zzso expression of zzso and zzso compared to the less zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso which promotes a zzso to zzso cell transition zzso by zzso zzso zzso unexpectedly enhances zzso zzso in mouse breast cancer cell zzso These results suggest that for some tumors, tumor colonization at zzso sites might be enhanced by zzso Therefore the zzso nature of a tumor does not predict zzso zzso
