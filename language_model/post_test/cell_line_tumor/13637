zzso zzso are a group of zzso zzso derivatives with important regulatory roles in various plant zzso zzso The aim of this study was to examine the mechanism of the zzso activity of natural zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso human prostate cancer cell zzso The effects of zzso on prostate cancer cells were surveyed using flow zzso Western zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso The studied zzso inhibited cell growth and induced zzso blocks in zzso cells accompanied by reductions in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Following zzso treatment of zzso cells, increases in proportions of cells in the zzso phase of cell cycle were observed, accompanied by zzso of zzso A and zzso Changes in zzso zzso patterns in zzso cells treated with zzso were shown by zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso detection methods demonstrated induction of zzso zzso by zzso in both cell lines, although changes in the expression of zzso proteins were modulated differently by zzso and zzso in each cell zzso The studied zzso seem to exert potent growth zzso and zzso effects and could be therefore highly valuable new candidates for prostate zzso zzso
