zzso is the cell surface zzso abundantly expressed in cancer cells and has been shown to be involved in tumor zzso and zzso Recently, we identified a 37 zzso segment on the zzso zzso promoter with the ability to suppress zzso zzso This 37 zzso putative negative regulatory element zzso binds to a zzso regulator zzso Yang 1 zzso In the present study, we examined whether binding of zzso is responsible for the negative regulatory effect by the 37 zzso segment using a zzso pancreatic cancer cell line, zzso cells, zzso with various expression zzso zzso Our results showed that: zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso activity of the full-length zzso zzso promoter in a zzso manner; zzso the zzso of the zzso binding site did not affect either the zzso zzso activity or the increased zzso activity by zzso and zzso even the deletion of the 37 zzso zzso segment could not abrogate the increased zzso activity by zzso We conclude that the zzso acts in a zzso manner and that zzso instead enhances zzso zzso zzso Further study of the precise mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso gene expression should be zzso
