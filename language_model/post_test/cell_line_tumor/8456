Our aim was to identify frequent zzso aberrations in both zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso and to discover important copy zzso genes and zzso zzso in zzso 

We conducted zzso comparative zzso zzso zzso zzso on 59 zzso zzso samples and 16 zzso biopsy zzso zzso of genes at zzso was analyzed by real-time zzso zzso and zzso zzso Integrated analysis was conducted to identify genes or zzso with copy zzso zzso 

zzso zzso identified 11 zzso and eight zzso deletions in zzso Integrated analysis of array zzso data with matched gene expression zzso data showed that 90 zzso genes and 24 zzso genes were consistent with DNA copy number changes, including 12 copy zzso zzso In zzso zzso six gains, four losses, 12 zzso and four zzso deletions were zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso deletion at zzso zzso were consistent zzso changes in both zzso and zzso zzso at zzso was zzso at the zzso and protein levels in tumors, and higher zzso expression was correlated with the copy number zzso In particular, zzso expression was elevated in moderate zzso compared with normal zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso was positively correlated with zzso zzso zzso and advanced clinical zzso zzso of zzso significantly inhibited the proliferation of zzso and zzso zzso 

Copy number aberrations in both zzso zzso and zzso may be useful as potential zzso for early zzso In addition, zzso may be a candidate target gene in zzso zzso
