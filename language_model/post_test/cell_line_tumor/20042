zzso zzso is a zzso derived from various natural plants and is capable of inducing several types of death in cancer zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso breast cancer cell zzso remain zzso The present study aimed to prove that zzso zzso the proliferation of zzso human breast cancer cells in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso markedly induced the generation of zzso oxygen species zzso decreased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso activity, diminished zzso zzso induced zzso 3 zzso and was associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso Our findings also indicate that zzso may play an important role in zzso zzso as zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso In conclusion, our results demonstrate that zzso zzso the proliferation of breast cancer cells through the generation of zzso and the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso We also demonstrate that these effects may be zzso by zzso with zzso Our results suggest that zzso may function as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of breast zzso
