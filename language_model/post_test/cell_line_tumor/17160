zzso zzso cells can zzso particles zzso zzso in size, encompassing zzso zzso for drug delivery or zzso applied in gene zzso In the present study, we have investigated the effect of particle size on the zzso of entry and subsequent zzso fate in zzso zzso cells, using a range of fluorescent latex beads of defined sizes zzso zzso Our data reveal that particles as large as 500 zzso were zzso by cells via an zzso zzso With an increase in size zzso zzso cholesterol depletion increased the efficiency of zzso of zzso The processing of the smaller particles was significantly zzso upon zzso zzso while displaying a negligible effect on that of the 500 zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies revealed that the mechanism by which the beads were zzso and their subsequent zzso zzso was strongly dependent on particle zzso zzso of zzso with a diameter zzso zzso involved zzso zzso With increasing size, a shift to a mechanism that relied on zzso zzso became apparent, which became the zzso zzso of entry for particles of 500 zzso in zzso At these conditions, delivery to the zzso was no longer zzso The data indicate that the size itself of zzso particles can determine the zzso of zzso The zzso zzso of zzso shows an upper size limit for zzso of zzso 200 zzso and kinetic parameters may determine the almost exclusive zzso of such particles along this zzso rather than via zzso
