Many potent zzso drugs have an zzso mode of action, but are limited in crossing the cell zzso resulting in a reduced clinical zzso zzso zzso is known to facilitate the penetration of drugs into tumors zzso However zzso imaging techniques that monitor in zzso the underlying processes of zzso drug delivery are zzso The objective of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of using a fluorescent nuclear acid stain zzso as a model drug to monitor in real-time zzso delivery by in zzso zzso zzso Following zzso of zzso and zzso US was applied to the zzso The time course of the drug delivery process was monitored by zzso zzso zzso analysis and in zzso experiments were performed to investigate the results in more zzso A significant signal intensity enhancement of the zzso tumor was observed that indicates zzso delivery of the zzso In the control tumor zzso signal was strongly associated with zzso which was not the case for the zzso zzso The capability of zzso to zzso zzso was confirmed in zzso This study demonstrates that an optical contrast agent with similar characteristics to an zzso drug may be used for continuous in zzso monitoring of the drug delivery zzso
