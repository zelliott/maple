zzso zzso are zzso zzso shed normally or as a result of various zzso zzso zzso contain a wealth of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is present on the surface of many zzso As zzso and zzso zzso are zzso yet distinct zzso the purpose of this study was to systematically and directly assess zzso exposure on zzso We examined zzso from various human cellular sources zzso breast cancer, zzso red and white blood zzso by flow zzso using a zzso probe, zzso and two zzso zzso zzso V and zzso zzso and zzso exposure percentage was comparable on vascular and blood zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso However, the percentage of zzso breast cancer zzso exposing zzso zzso was significantly higher than zzso zzso Thus, while zzso and zzso exposure can result from a general loss of membrane zzso there may also be distinct mechanisms of zzso and zzso exposure on zzso that vary by cellular zzso
