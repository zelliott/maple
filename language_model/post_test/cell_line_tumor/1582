To investigate the combined effects of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso on zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stress and we hypothesized that zzso zzso activity under zzso stress would further inhibit cancer cell growth by enhancing protein zzso 

The effectiveness of the combination of zzso and zzso on zzso cancer cells zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed by zzso zzso colony formation zzso cell cycle analysis, and zzso zzso In zzso efficacy was evaluated using mice subcutaneous tumor zzso zzso of zzso stress, protein zzso zzso zzso and changes in the expression of zzso zzso zzso were evaluated by Western zzso 

zzso in combination with zzso induced zzso and inhibited zzso cancer growth zzso at clinically feasible zzso In subcutaneous tumor models using zzso cells, 10-day treatment with the combination was well tolerated and inhibited tumor growth zzso zzso induced zzso stress and the combination enhanced protein zzso zzso The combination was also found to induce zzso zzso by suppressing the zzso zzso 

The combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso cancer growth zzso The effectiveness of the combination is caused by protein zzso and zzso zzso Our results provide a rationale for investigating the combination in patients with zzso zzso
