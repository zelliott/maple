zzso cells zzso are powerful zzso cells that process zzso and present zzso zzso in the context of the major zzso complex molecules to generate immune zzso zzso are being studied as potential zzso vaccines because of their ability to present zzso to zzso T cells and to stimulate the expansion of zzso zzso zzso We investigated an zzso vaccination using zzso modified by transfer of a zzso zzso zzso a zzso of human zzso in a transgenic model of breast zzso zzso mice develop breast zzso as a consequence of zzso zzso expression of an activated zzso zzso We vaccinated zzso mice with bone zzso zzso zzso with zzso a zzso zzso expressing a truncated zzso zzso The vaccine zzso the production of specific zzso zzso enhanced zzso expression by T cells, and prevented or delayed the onset of zzso zzso in the zzso Over zzso of vaccinated mice remained tumor free at 28 weeks of age, whereas all of the mice in the control groups developed zzso When challenged with a zzso breast cancer cell line, vaccinated zzso animals had delayed tumor growth compared with zzso The zzso effect of the vaccine was specific for expression of zzso Studies showed that zzso T cells were required in order to generate zzso zzso zzso the effectiveness of the vaccine was not diminished by zzso immunity to zzso whereas the protection afforded by vaccination that used direct injection of zzso was markedly reduced in mice with zzso zzso zzso zzso modified by zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso may provide an effective zzso vaccination zzso
