zzso zzso can be designed to zzso the molecular pathways involved in tumor zzso A compelling example is the use of small zzso drugs, such as zzso zzso which inhibit the zzso zzso zzso in gastrointestinal zzso tumors zzso zzso are needed to determine which inhibitor is most effective at zzso the zzso zzso in each zzso zzso The aim of this study was to develop a zzso zzso zzso to measure tumor zzso to zzso small zzso zzso We created an zzso zzso cell line zzso that was treated in zzso with several zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso was inhibited with zzso and zzso with zzso Treatment response was assessed in zzso preparations by zzso zzso with zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was performed to maximize zzso in the absence of zzso and minimize zzso in the presence of zzso zzso cells demonstrated strong, robust zzso expression in the absence of zzso This expression was completely inhibited by treatment with upstream signaling zzso zzso zzso and zzso Other zzso zzso had weaker baseline zzso in the absence of zzso The accuracy of the zzso results on the zzso preparations was validated by zzso zzso Our study demonstrates the feasibility of zzso methods to monitor zzso zzso responses in tumor cells during drug zzso Such approaches will be enhanced by the development of additional zzso zzso zzso particularly those zzso for use in zzso zzso
