Previously, we reported that zzso zzso has potent zzso effects on various cancer cells, but the underlying molecular mechanism responsible was not zzso In the present study, zzso caused cervical cancer cell cycle arrest at the zzso phase and subsequent zzso zzso The zzso arrest caused by zzso found to be due to increases in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso B1 complex and the zzso of zzso zzso In addition, zzso induced the zzso of zzso and the association between zzso arrest deficient 2 zzso and cell division cycle protein zzso These findings suggested that zzso activated the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso checkpoint proteins zzso or zzso using specific small interfering zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso In addition, zzso induced the appearance of zzso abnormalities by inducing zzso zzso In zzso mice bearing a zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited tumor zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso zzso cell growth via zzso arrest by zzso the zzso zzso checkpoint and by inducing zzso zzso and that these events ultimately lead to the zzso of human cervical cancer cells and inhibit tumor growth in zzso zzso zzso
