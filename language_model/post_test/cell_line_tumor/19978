zzso cancer is frequently associated with bone zzso with marked zzso changes and low zzso activity but its mechanism is not well zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso zzso zzso the proliferation and the zzso of zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of zzso on zzso 

Two human prostate cancer cell lines and zzso were directly injected into human adult bone zzso implanted into zzso mice, followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso were treated with zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso caused a significant decrease of zzso precursors and zzso in zzso accompanied by zzso proliferation and new bone formation, while zzso zzso showed increasing zzso with zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso was dependent of zzso activity of zzso and was specific to immature zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso plays a crucial role for zzso bone zzso by promoting both zzso proliferation and zzso of zzso zzso
