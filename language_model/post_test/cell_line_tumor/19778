zzso zzso a gastrointestinal hormone, binds its zzso zzso zzso zzso to regulate the growth of normal and zzso zzso zzso molecular mechanisms remain largely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates diverse cellular zzso including cell growth and zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso the zzso of zzso in the human colon cancer cell line zzso zzso or zzso which possesses zzso zzso The effect of zzso was blocked by zzso of protein zzso C zzso but not by zzso of zzso or zzso zzso suggesting a zzso role for zzso in zzso zzso by zzso zzso with zzso (which zzso zzso and zzso or zzso of zzso zzso or zzso blocked zzso zzso (but not zzso zzso Moreover, a selective zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso (but not zzso zzso suggesting a role for zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso and an undefined zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso Treatment with zzso or the zzso inhibitor zzso increased the expression of zzso zzso a downstream zzso protein of zzso and a critical protein for the proliferation of various zzso Our results indicate that zzso uses zzso pathways to zzso zzso which may play a role in the zzso regulation of zzso cell zzso
