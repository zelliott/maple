zzso genes control zzso patterning and are increasingly being found to be zzso in zzso The zzso zzso gene maps to the zzso region that is amplified in some zzso zzso zzso Because amplification of this region zzso with poor zzso we investigated whether zzso zzso contributes to aggressive behavior of this zzso zzso was not detected in normal zzso and zzso whereas its expression in zzso zzso was strongly associated with high tumor grade and advanced disease zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cancer cells promoted growth in low serum and colony zzso Imaging of mice bearing zzso tumors revealed that zzso zzso substantially increased tumor zzso zzso that zzso zzso were more zzso than zzso zzso zzso medium of zzso tumor cells was more effective than medium zzso by zzso cells in stimulating zzso cell zzso These observations were associated with the ability of zzso to induce expression of vascular zzso growth factor as well as zzso and zzso zzso of zzso growth zzso Moreover, increased levels of these zzso growth zzso zzso induced vascular zzso growth factor expression in tumor zzso This study reveals a novel role for a zzso gene in zzso zzso by its induction of a zzso zzso molecular zzso
