zzso is a useful method for the production of zzso scaffolds in the field of tissue zzso zzso has been used as a zzso for zzso and can be used in a variety of biomedical applications because it is a natural zzso giving it the ability to improve cell affinity of zzso In this study, zzso was extracted from zzso slime thread zzso and blended with zzso acid zzso zzso solution to construct a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used as a control for the comparison of zzso physical, and biological zzso The results of zzso transform infrared zzso showed the presence of both zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso Observations with a scanning electron microscope revealed that zzso zzso and zzso had similar average diameters zzso zzso Cell attachment experiments showed that zzso cells zzso more rapidly and spread better onto zzso than onto the pure zzso or zzso Cell proliferation zzso DNA content, zzso and alkaline zzso activity zzso showed that zzso scaffolds could accelerate the zzso zzso and osteogenesis of zzso cells relative to pure zzso or zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso can improve cellular attraction and has great potential to be used as a zzso in bone tissue zzso
