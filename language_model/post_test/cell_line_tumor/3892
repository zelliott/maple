zzso zzso are zzso structures, but increasing evidence indicates that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are components of these zzso zzso zzso is an zzso protein that has been shown to play important roles in the stabilization of the membrane cortical zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso associates with zzso zzso and is crucial for proper zzso assembly and zzso zzso zzso of zzso at zzso and zzso by zzso zzso 1 enables zzso to bind to zzso zzso and therefore to associate with zzso zzso zzso depletion resulted in zzso zzso and zzso zzso accompanied by zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso defects caused by zzso depletion were rescued by zzso of zzso but not of an zzso zzso defective in zzso zzso Together, our findings unveil a novel function for zzso in zzso zzso assembly through its interaction with zzso
