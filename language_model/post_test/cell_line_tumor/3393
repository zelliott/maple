zzso of the cell zzso zzso zzso in zzso is an independent factor for the risk of zzso with a zzso value superior to that of tumor zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso at the zzso interface of invading melanoma masses with zzso zzso and that these two zzso molecules interact via the zzso zzso zzso To address the functional consequences of zzso zzso we investigated invasion and migration of zzso and melanoma cells that zzso express zzso using two different in zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso expression markedly enhances cell invasion and zzso The enhanced invasion and migration of zzso cells was dependent on the presence of zzso within the full-length zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso cell invasion and cell migration in a zzso zzso Furthermore, the enhanced invasion and migration of zzso melanoma cells was blocked by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso These results strengthen the view that zzso and zzso zzso are functionally interconnected with respect to the invasive growth of zzso
