zzso brain zzso are rare but are the most challenging types of zzso to zzso Despite conventional zzso approaches available for their management, the outlook for most patients remains dismal due to the ability of the zzso cells to invade the normal zzso Attention has now focused on novel therapeutic interventions such as as the use of zzso Both zzso extract zzso zzso which is rich in natural zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso found in turmeric zzso zzso have been reported to possess zzso properties in other zzso The aim of this study was to extend our previous research to evaluate the therapeutic potential of these two agents by testing their ability to induce zzso in an established zzso cell line zzso This was accomplished by treating the cells for zzso with either zzso extract or zzso and using the zzso zzso Gene profiles of 8 zzso zzso 9, 14, 15, 16, 17, 24 and 25) and 4 zzso zzso 2, 3 and 4) were zzso for effects of zzso of invasion by quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso values determined for zzso and zzso extract were 15 and zzso zzso Our results also suggest that zzso zzso zzso but zzso extract is zzso to this cell zzso It is possible that zzso extract kills the cells by other zzso zzso In addition, the zzso results show zzso of the gene expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso for both zzso Taken together, the comparative data suggest that both zzso and zzso extract may exhibit their zzso potential by inducing zzso and zzso invasion by reducing zzso gene zzso
