zzso zzso of zzso in adult zzso is associated with a wide variety of zzso especially in the zzso zzso Classic transgenic and knockout zzso models in which zzso is activated in large fields of cells have provided experimental support in favor of a role for this zzso in zzso However, these models do not reproduce the sporadic nature of the majority of human zzso beginning with the zzso of an zzso at random in a single zzso 

We used the zzso and zzso strategy to generate a mouse model in which the expression of an activated form of zzso occurs sporadically in zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were observed in the stomach of zzso of mice aged 8 months and zzso These zzso were associated with loss of Sonic zzso zzso and a zzso relationship between zzso zzso and zzso zzso was established in gastric cells in zzso No zzso was detected in the zzso or in the zzso In addition, one third of female zzso mice developed benign zzso zzso zzso mice were also hypersensitive to chemically induced zzso skin zzso 

These results challenge the view that zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso because they show in mice that sporadically activated zzso is sufficient for tumor zzso yet without further zzso zzso and that it zzso cells to environmental zzso This model represents a powerful tool to investigate the interplay between genetic and environmental factors in tumor zzso
