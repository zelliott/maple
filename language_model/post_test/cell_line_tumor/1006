zzso acid zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso derived from the zzso of zzso zzso is known to be an inhibitor of zzso of nuclear transcript factor zzso Its effects on zzso currents have been investigated in zzso zzso zzso This compound increased zzso zzso current zzso in a zzso manner with an zzso value of 14 zzso 2 zzso However, the magnitude of zzso stimulation of zzso was attenuated in zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso zzso slightly suppressed zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso (20 zzso applied to the zzso face of the detached patch enhanced the activity of large zzso zzso zzso zzso channels with no modification in single-channel zzso After zzso channel activity was increased by zzso (20 zzso subsequent application of zzso acid (20 zzso did not further increase the channel zzso zzso channel activity was dependent on membrane zzso zzso could also increase zzso sensitivity of zzso channels in these zzso Its increase in the open probability could primarily involve a decrease in the mean closed zzso In zzso conditions, zzso zzso the membrane potential and reduced the firing of action zzso The zzso effects on these channels may partly contribute to the underlying mechanisms through which this compound influences the functional activities of zzso or neuroendocrine zzso zzso has to be used in zzso its response in the zzso of zzso
