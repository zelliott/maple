To explore the biological impact of 40 zzso acid deletion at the zzso of zzso B virus X on the proliferation of zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso cell line were zzso with zzso and its zzso zzso harboring the 40 zzso acid deletion at the zzso zzso zzso Cell growth curve, colony formation in soft zzso plate and zzso zzso in nude mice were used to observe the zzso induced by the zzso of zzso and zzso The expression level of zzso in tumor cells was also zzso 

The growth rates of the cells zzso with zzso and zzso were markedly increased as compared with that of the control zzso The colony formation rates were enhanced in the cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso comparing with the control zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso the size and weight of tumors were significantly increased in the cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso % and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared with the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression level of zzso in tumors was increased in both zzso zzso zzso zzso % and zzso zzso zzso zzso % zzso cells, comparing with the control zzso zzso zzso zzso Overall, the cells zzso with zzso demonstrated the highest zzso zzso 

The deletion of 40 zzso acids in the zzso of zzso is correlated with an enhanced proliferation of zzso cells and may play an important role in the zzso transformation of the zzso
