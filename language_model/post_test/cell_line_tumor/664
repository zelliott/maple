zzso I zzso is a proven target for cancer zzso and the level of zzso in tumors has been used as a zzso for zzso zzso In this study, we report the development and validation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso which we used to measure zzso levels in the zzso cancer cell line zzso zzso levels ranged from zzso to zzso zzso protein extract in these cell zzso zzso varied both within and between cancer types but were generally highest in colon cancer and leukemia cell lines and lowest in central nervous system and zzso cancer cell zzso zzso zzso levels in the zzso cell lines were also measured by zzso zzso values generally showed a good correlation with protein levels zzso correlation zzso zzso When these expression levels were compared with the activity of the zzso class of zzso zzso across the zzso cell panel, low levels of zzso were associated with increased resistance to these zzso The results of our studies indicate that our zzso zzso can be used to zzso zzso levels in zzso cells as well as cells treated with zzso zzso and that the zzso has the potential to be adapted for use in predicting clinical response to zzso zzso zzso
