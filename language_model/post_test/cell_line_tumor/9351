zzso membrane potential plays an important role in cell zzso zzso in zzso zzso which indicate the imminent destruction of the zzso have been observed in damaged zzso cells both in zzso and in zzso In this study, zzso mouse zzso were put under stress using zzso a zzso zzso zzso after which the change in zzso membrane potential was monitored with a zzso zzso zzso This was done in an attempt to identify a novel compound that can suppress zzso membrane potential reduction and cell zzso In this zzso system, the novel compound zzso zzso was found to protect mouse zzso against zzso (3 zzso zzso membrane potential reduction zzso zzso zzso also prevented zzso or zzso shifts in zzso membrane potential but it did not have any effect on the changes induced by zzso zzso or zzso The potent zzso zzso and zzso A prevented the effect of zzso but did not prevent the zzso or zzso zzso zzso agents, an zzso a protein zzso C zzso and zzso agents were not effective against zzso zzso zzso transition which implies that zzso exerts a protective effect via its specific zzso In addition, zzso demonstrated a zzso effect against zzso zzso cell death in zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest the potential of zzso as novel zzso zzso
