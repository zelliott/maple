zzso zzso zzso is considered to play essential roles in cancer zzso We examined the efficacy of zzso a citrus zzso zzso for suppressing zzso expression in the human zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso remarkably inhibited the production of zzso zzso without affecting its zzso expression zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso target of zzso zzso showed similar results, suggesting that zzso suppresses zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, however, zzso showed no effects on the zzso of zzso zzso whereas the zzso levels of zzso binding protein zzso and zzso translation initiation factor zzso were substantially zzso In addition, zzso remarkably zzso zzso activated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso led to a significant reduction of zzso protein production as well as of the zzso of zzso These results demonstrate that zzso targets the translation step for zzso protein synthesis by zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso
