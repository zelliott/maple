zzso infection of the zzso tree is a zzso serious complication in patients receiving treatment with oxygen and mechanical zzso resulting in increased morbidity and zzso Using human airway zzso cell culture models, we examined the effect of zzso on bacterial adherence and the expression of zzso zzso an important zzso involved in the inflammatory zzso A zzso exposure to zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso adherence 57% in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso but had little effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso Exposure to zzso followed by a zzso incubation with zzso further enhanced PA adherence zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso colonization may enhance the zzso of lung zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso expression was also increased in cells exposed to both zzso and zzso zzso or transient zzso of zzso zzso zzso reduced both zzso and zzso levels of PA adherence and zzso levels in response to exposure to either zzso or zzso These data indicate that zzso increases zzso to infection and that the pathways are zzso by zzso oxygen zzso zzso intervention strategies designed to prevent zzso of zzso zzso oxygen species may reduce opportunistic pulmonary zzso
