Recently, a series of zzso zzso that are stable against zzso in zzso conditions have been zzso In the present study, the zzso effects of one of these compounds, zzso zzso zzso zzso was investigated in an zzso rat zzso zzso zzso model as well as using a zzso cell zzso The rat zzso model was induced by injection of rat zzso cells, zzso into the left lobe of the zzso Seven days after tumor cell zzso zzso was injected directly into the tumor zzso at different doses, followed by the same doses via zzso injection twice a zzso zzso administration significantly prolonged the survival of zzso zzso zzso zzso induced necrosis as well as zzso in the tumor zzso but not in the normal liver zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment neither caused significant drop in body weight of the rats nor affected plasma zzso zzso zzso In the in zzso studies, we observed that zzso treatment inhibited the proliferation of zzso zzso zzso zzso genes that increase zzso stabilize zzso decrease proliferation and zzso genes playing roles in zzso invasion, and zzso as demonstrated by zzso In particular, the compound zzso 2 members of the growth arrest and DNA damage zzso zzso gene family, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso cells by small hairpin zzso reduced the zzso zzso and growth zzso indicating that zzso zzso its effects via zzso of zzso and zzso zzso from our study demonstrated that zzso might be a novel promising zzso agent for treating zzso
