zzso a zzso protein of the zzso family, has recently been identified as an zzso of several zzso signaling pathways in prostate cancer zzso Thus, zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso leads to BAD zzso and zzso of zzso Increased levels of BAD in prostate zzso have also been zzso It appears contradictory that instead of limiting expression of zzso zzso prostate cancer cells choose to increase BAD levels while keeping it under tight zzso zzso Analysis of the effect of BAD on prostate cancer zzso has shown that increased BAD expression enhances tumor growth, while zzso of BAD expression by zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso culture experiments demonstrated that increased BAD expression stimulates proliferation of prostate cancer zzso These results suggest that increased expression of BAD provides a zzso advantage to prostate tumors, while BAD zzso increases sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to zzso Combination of zzso and zzso properties zzso prostate cancer cells to be zzso to increased levels of zzso zzso Thus, zzso that zzso BAD are plausible therapeutic zzso while monitoring BAD zzso could be used to predict tumor response to zzso
