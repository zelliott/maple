This work studied the zzso of five types of cells zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso CBS zzso and zzso zzso two bacterial zzso zzso coli and zzso zzso and one human leukemia zzso zzso as a function of cooling rate during zzso The range of investigated cooling rates extended from 5 to 30,000 degrees zzso Cell viability was classified into three zzso zzso high viability for low cooling rates (5 to 180 degrees zzso which allow cell water zzso to occur completely and do not allow any zzso zzso zzso low viability for rapid cooling rates zzso to 5,000 degrees zzso which allow the heat flow to prevail over water zzso (in this case, cell water zzso would occur as water was flowing out of the zzso zzso high viability for very high cooling rates zzso degrees zzso which allow the heat flow to be very rapid and induce zzso zzso and/or zzso before any water zzso from the zzso Finally, an assumption relating cell death to the cell water zzso as water is flowing out of the cell is zzso In addition, this general cell behavior is different for each type of cell and seems to be moderated by the cell size, the water zzso properties, and the presence of a cell zzso
