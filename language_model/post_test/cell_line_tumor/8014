The zzso family zzso zzso exchange factor zzso was originally identified as the product of the gene associated with slowed zzso zzso of peripheral zzso However, the function of zzso in zzso cells is totally unknown at a molecular zzso zzso contains no distinctive functional zzso except for tandem zzso zzso zzso and putative zzso zzso 

Here we show that zzso is a zzso for zzso In both zzso and M zzso zzso was localized in the zzso in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in zzso zzso formation in M zzso Each zzso pole seems to contain a zzso consisting of two zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso similar zzso and zzso zzso zzso formation following zzso zzso was rescued by zzso expression of zzso activated zzso zzso cells were not increased upon zzso zzso in contrast to treatment with zzso a specific pharmacological inhibitor for the zzso zzso zzso zzso which induced not only zzso zzso formation, but also zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rather than aberration in zzso may be responsible for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We further isolated the zzso motor protein zzso as a binding partner of zzso zzso of zzso again caused zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was also observed in S zzso zzso zzso cells when the expression of zzso zzso or zzso was zzso by zzso zzso 

zzso our results suggest that a novel zzso signaling zzso under the control of zzso has a pivotal role in the regulation of the cell division zzso This zzso is not involved in the regulation of zzso but instead may regulate zzso zzso The zzso motor protein zzso may zzso the zzso zzso through the binding to zzso
