The expression of zzso zzso subdivided into zzso A and C, is zzso zzso zzso acid zzso differentiation of zzso embryonic zzso cells, in which zzso zzso are zzso increases the expression of zzso zzso We previously zzso using zzso cells as a model system, that the zzso zzso promoter has a zzso zzso element zzso and that zzso and zzso bind the zzso box of the zzso In this study, we report that zzso zzso and zzso increase zzso of the zzso during zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulate the zzso zzso promoter in zzso zzso cells and contribute to zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso causes zzso of a zzso promoter consisting of four tandem zzso repeats fused with the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso also zzso a reporter construct with five tandem zzso sites, only when zzso with either zzso or zzso fusion zzso Furthermore, we detect a zzso interaction between zzso with zzso in zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso and zzso play an important role in gene expression through the zzso during zzso zzso
