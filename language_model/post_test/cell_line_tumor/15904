Many cancer cells display the Warburg effect, that is, enhanced zzso followed by zzso zzso of zzso to zzso Recently, the molecular basis for these effects has started to be zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso of zzso zzso is felt to be a major molecular zzso of this zzso Moreover, zzso expression in tumor tissue and zzso levels in blood portend a bad zzso and zzso blockade can lead to tumor growth zzso in tumor transplant zzso We have extended existing data zzso of which were published during the time when we were carrying out our zzso in two important ways: 1) zzso of zzso in a zzso lung cancer cell line results in zzso oxygen zzso zzso and increased sensitivity to the zzso drug zzso and 2) zzso of zzso zzso can also be accomplished by zzso of the zzso zzso complex by the drug zzso now undergoing clinical trials, and that this phenomenon can be monitored in zzso in a zzso real-time manner through magnetic resonance zzso using zzso zzso zzso these data suggest that in zzso effects of drugs that redirect the fate of zzso and hence are aimed at reversing the Warburg effect, could be monitored through the use of zzso magnetic resonance zzso a method that is zzso to human zzso
