zzso acid zzso is an zzso currently under investigation as an zzso agent in zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation of zzso factors zzso 1, 3, and zzso These proteins are known to be zzso in many human zzso 

To evaluate the protein expression of zzso in canine zzso and efficacy of zzso against several canine tumor cell zzso 

Six canine cell lines (2 zzso 2 zzso zzso 2 zzso were zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso and their downstream targets were evaluated using Western zzso Cell survival and zzso zzso were performed on cell lines, and zzso expression was evaluated on zzso samples from zzso canine zzso 

Six immortalized canine cancer cell lines derived from dogs were zzso zzso tissue samples were also zzso 

zzso were highly expressed in all 6 cell lines and zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso decreased expression of zzso zzso in all cell zzso All of the downstream targets of zzso were inhibited in the cell zzso zzso zzso expression was identified in all zzso samples zzso zzso significantly inhibited cell survival in all cell lines in a dose zzso zzso The number of cells undergoing zzso was significantly increased zzso in all cell lines after exposure to zzso in a zzso zzso zzso AND zzso zzso zzso acid is a potential zzso zzso and further investigation is needed to determine its usefulness in a clinical zzso
