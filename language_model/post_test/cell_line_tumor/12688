Controlling the size distribution of zzso zzso is a challenging task due to their flexible core and surface zzso To accomplish such as task requires very precise control at the molecular zzso Here we demonstrate a new approach zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be reliably generated using a digital zzso zzso generator zzso zzso A zzso environment enabled precise control over the processing zzso and therefore high zzso zzso and robust production of zzso with a very narrow size distribution could be zzso zzso adjustment of the mixing ratios of the building blocks on the zzso chip allowed us to rapidly scan a variety of synthesis conditions without consuming significant amounts of zzso Nearly uniform zzso with sizes ranging from 35 to zzso were obtained and characterized by transmission electron zzso and dynamic light zzso In addition, we could fine-tune the surface chemistry of the zzso by incorporating an additional building block zzso with specific zzso for targeting zzso The sizes and surface properties of these zzso correlated strongly with their cell zzso zzso This study showed a feasible method for zzso zzso production and provided a great means for preparing zzso zzso with desired surface zzso zzso
