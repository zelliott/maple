zzso are zzso proteins unique to zzso that play a fundamental role in zzso zzso They have been proposed to act as zzso zzso thereby regulating zzso zzso in cellular zzso We cloned and characterized a novel zzso zzso that is specifically expressed in zzso and named it zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso form zzso When expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso partially to the plasma membrane resulting in increased zzso of zzso zzso and zzso supporting a role for zzso in the inward zzso zzso across cellular zzso In mouse zzso zzso protein is detected in zzso cells, from zzso zzso to mature zzso and its zzso zzso is tightly related with zzso formation, a process that involves intensive zzso zzso formation and zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso by zzso interference in zzso zzso cells profoundly zzso the structural organization of the zzso complex and causes loss of zzso zzso at lower zzso Our findings point to an essential role of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso function, suggesting a crucial role for this novel zzso zzso in zzso
