The zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes zzso DNA zzso an zzso involved in DNA zzso In this study, we show that the zzso start site of the zzso gene is located at zzso zzso of the viral zzso and zzso zzso a zzso switch zzso activates the zzso promoter via zzso zzso Three consensus zzso sites found in the zzso promoter are critical for the binding of zzso protein and zzso the zzso zzso In addition, a negative regulatory region has been determined in the zzso promoter, which mediates the suppression of the zzso zzso The functional negative region of the zzso promoter is mainly composed of the zzso zzso Like the negative region of the zzso promoter, addition of zzso sequences alone in an zzso promoter efficiently zzso the suppression of the zzso zzso Furthermore, sodium zzso a zzso inducing agent for the zzso zzso cycle, is able to relieve the negative regulation of the zzso promoter in the zzso zzso zzso The identification of multiple positive and negative zzso regulatory elements in the viral promoters emphasizes the elaborate controls in the zzso zzso cycle, which ensure the adequate expression of each viral zzso zzso
