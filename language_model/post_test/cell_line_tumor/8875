Mass measurement and precursor mass assignment are independent processes in zzso data zzso Due to zzso to zzso peak, or for other reasons, extensive precursor mass shifts zzso zzso of the measured from calculated precursor neutral zzso in zzso data obtained with the zzso zzso mass zzso have been reported in previous zzso Although zzso methods for zzso zzso to zzso mass have been developed to zzso the zzso zzso prior to database search, a simpler method for zzso the fraction of zzso with precursor mass shift so as to determine whether the data require zzso remains zzso Here, we provide the evidence that an easy approach, which applies a large precursor tolerance zzso or zzso in zzso search against a forward and decoy protein sequence database and then filters the data with zzso zzso identification probability zzso could detect most of the zzso zzso containing inaccurate precursor zzso Furthermore, through the zzso of artificial mass shifts on zzso randomly selected zzso zzso which originally had accurate precursor mass assigned by the mass zzso we demonstrated that the accuracy of the precursor mass has almost negligible influence on the efficacy and zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso precursor mass shift is a known problem and thus zzso data should be handled and analyzed properly to avoid losing important protein identification and/or zzso zzso A quick and easy approach for zzso the number of zzso zzso with inaccurate precursor mass assignments would be helpful for evaluating the performance of the zzso determining whether the data requires zzso prior to database search or should be searched with specific search zzso Here we demonstrated most of the zzso zzso with inaccurate mass assignments zzso or zzso zzso that could be easily identified by database search with large precursor tolerance zzso
