Both cellular and clinical studies have shown that zzso is one of the most potent zzso for the action of zzso zzso Although zzso improvement in clinical outcome is suggested to be linked to its ability to induce cell cycle arrest and zzso and to activate the immune system and to cause increases in blood flow and tumor zzso the mechanism behind this is still zzso Previously, we demonstrated that zzso deprivation zzso a common characteristic of the tumor zzso induced zzso which is implicated in tumor progression and zzso through the production of zzso oxygen species zzso in zzso lung zzso zzso We examined the effects of heat shock on zzso production and necrosis in response to zzso Here we show that mild, but not harsh, heat shock prevented zzso necrosis and switched the cell death mode to zzso in zzso cells through the zzso zzso that could suppress zzso zzso release and zzso zzso These results demonstrate that contrary to severe heat zzso mild heat shock has the ability to decrease zzso stress in cells, thereby causing the cell death mode switch from tumor promoting necrosis to tumor zzso zzso which may contribute to its zzso zzso
