The aim of this study was to perform a comprehensive evaluation of the zzso system zzso in prostate zzso 

We investigated the expression of zzso components in prostate cancer cells treated with hormonal zzso zzso zzso data showed the expression of the zzso zzso zzso I converting zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso precursor in all 87 prostate tissue zzso 

zzso of these genes in hormone zzso prostate cancer zzso was significantly higher than that in normal prostate tissue and zzso prostate cancer zzso Western zzso showed that protein expression of the zzso zzso and zzso was enhanced in zzso cells cultivated in zzso zzso When zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso drugs, protein expression of the zzso zzso and zzso was zzso 

The present data suggest that zzso zzso is zzso in zzso zzso and expression of its components is influenced by several kinds of hormonal zzso
