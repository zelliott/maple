To define the factors that zzso regulatory T zzso cells in the tumor setting, we zzso various tumor cells with either zzso zzso cells, or with zzso zzso We found that zzso expansion occurred only with zzso zzso suggesting that accessory cells and/or factors produced by them play an essential role in zzso zzso zzso We performed gene expression profiling on zzso zzso cells to identify candidate signaling molecules and studied their effects on zzso zzso zzso We inadvertently discovered that zzso zzso treatment blocked zzso expansion in an zzso zzso zzso Additional studies showed that zzso acts by stimulating zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso which may partially account for the zzso effects of zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment was found to decrease zzso production, which may lead to zzso zzso of zzso cells, as zzso is required for their survival and zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso signaling directly causes cell cycle arrest in zzso zzso This study shows that an zzso axis can suppress zzso zzso zzso This mechanism may counteract the ability of zzso cells to promote tumor growth in zzso
