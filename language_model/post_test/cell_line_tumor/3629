Early growth zzso zzso is an zzso gene induced by zzso in the zzso zzso and breast cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein levels in zzso human breast cancer cells and reporter gene activity in cells zzso with zzso a construct containing the zzso to zzso region of the zzso promoter linked to the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso promoter identified a minimal zzso region of the promoter that contained serum response element zzso zzso to zzso which bound zzso and serum response factor zzso in gel mobility shift zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells was specifically inhibited by zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso These results contrasted with zzso zzso of the zzso in the zzso promoter, which was inhibited by both zzso and zzso zzso in zzso of the zzso in zzso and zzso were related to promoter zzso which defines the affinities of zzso and zzso to their respective binding zzso Thus, zzso like zzso is activated through zzso zzso pathways of zzso action in breast cancer zzso
