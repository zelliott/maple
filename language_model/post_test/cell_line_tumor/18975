zzso gene therapy for zzso zzso cancer is limited in clinical trials by inefficient tumor cell zzso and development of zzso zzso We have shown previously that normal virus zzso can be zzso by physically shielding the virus surface with zzso zzso zzso and that linkage of novel zzso enables virus zzso through chosen zzso To achieve zzso infection, zzso virus was zzso using zzso zzso growth factor zzso The resulting zzso coated zzso lost its normal broad zzso and zzso cells selectively via the zzso zzso zzso We assessed whether this approach could be used to target zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso model of human zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso was retained following zzso coating and zzso zzso zzso formation was markedly decreased compared with the unmodified virus, and no zzso zzso were observed following treatment with zzso zzso zzso Restricting virus zzso by physical zzso coupled with zzso zzso promises to combine good zzso efficacy with acceptable zzso enabling application of elevated virus doses leading to an improved therapeutic zzso
