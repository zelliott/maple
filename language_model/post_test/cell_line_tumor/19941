We used human zzso zzso cells, in which zzso production is under the control of a zzso zzso to investigate changes induced in the host cell by zzso replication that could contribute to zzso zzso zzso of zzso stress zzso zzso and cell proliferation were determined at different times after induction zzso zzso In zzso cells, the zzso status peaked at 72 zzso zzso zzso array analysis at 72 h post induction revealed 3 groups of genes that were zzso by zzso zzso heat shock zzso zzso zzso and zzso stress and zzso growth and zzso related zzso Continuous zzso production did not accelerate zzso changes in cells cultured for 4 months (18 zzso 

zzso replication zzso host gene expression and zzso zzso zzso In this zzso model early events zzso zzso in the host cell after induction of zzso replication can be studied under strictly defined zzso
