zzso inhibitor of activated zzso zzso is a novel zzso of the zzso signaling zzso that zzso regulates the inflammatory zzso It has been also reported to be zzso in a variety of human cancer cell zzso However, the role of zzso in gastric cancer remains zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso value of zzso expression and its regulated mechanisms in gastric cancer cell zzso zzso the expression of zzso was explored in gastric cancer zzso and adjacent zzso of gastric cancer with 31 cases of patients, and the zzso value was zzso In addition, the growth and invasion in zzso cells were investigated in the restoration of zzso expression with zzso or zzso or PBS treatment, and the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected by western zzso The tumor migratory factors zzso zzso and zzso were analyzed by western zzso The results demonstrated that 22 of 31 zzso gastric cancer specimens showed low levels of zzso expression from zzso zzso using tissue zzso zzso analysis suggested that the zzso of zzso was significantly correlated with tumor zzso Furthermore, we found that the restoration of zzso expression zzso by zzso virus suppressed cell proliferation and invasion accompanied by the zzso of zzso and zzso protein expression and activity, but not zzso zzso zzso zzso restoration with the zzso of zzso robustly decreased the expression of tumor migratory factors including zzso zzso and zzso compared to zzso These data suggest that zzso may function as a tumor zzso to regulate gastric cancer cell zzso by targeting the zzso signaling zzso
