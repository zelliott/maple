zzso represent a recent trend in cancer chemotherapy that adopts the concept of selective zzso targeting of tumor cells by binding to specific zzso zzso zzso Following preferential zzso of sugar zzso into cancer cells, they are presumably subject to zzso zzso by specific zzso to liberate the free active zzso zzso that act selectively on cancer cells and spare other zzso zzso In this sense, the role of zzso and zzso in the zzso and zzso of zzso has been addressed in the current zzso The zzso of zzso has been investigated over zzso h in a panel of human colon cancer cells zzso zzso zzso and zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was accomplished using a host of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was determined using zzso zzso has proven zzso efficacy in a zzso and zzso zzso The sensitivity rank order of tumor cells towards the zzso was zzso This sensitivity ranking was well correlated with the zzso activity of zzso assessed in these cell zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were increased in all colon cancer cells following exposure to zzso and were well correlated with the zzso rank order of the zzso zzso was zzso by zzso and zzso zzso but not by other zzso zzso such as zzso zzso pancreatic zzso or zzso zzso In conclusion, the current data could possibly unravel the zzso role of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso of zzso within colon cancer zzso
