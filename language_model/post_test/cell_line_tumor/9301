zzso zzso zzso zzso has recently been identified as a zzso of zzso plasticity and can initiate conversion of the zzso of zzso zzso factor zzso into its mature zzso zzso also increases zzso gene expression implicating zzso as a downstream zzso of zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso induction of zzso zzso requires an increase in zzso gene zzso zzso zzso harboring zzso zzso of the human zzso promoter zzso zzso in zzso mouse primary cortical zzso This regulation was zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed the presence of two zzso zzso one located between zzso and zzso zzso and the other within the zzso zzso The upstream region was shown to zzso zzso responsiveness in a zzso manner when attached to a zzso zzso We also identify zzso regions within the zzso and bovine zzso gene promoters and demonstrate that the equivalent upstream zzso sequence functions as a zzso zzso when inserted zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso relies on zzso modular promoter elements including a novel upstream zzso domain and the zzso zzso gene zzso
