Stress shielding resulting from mismatch in dynamic mechanical properties contributes to the reduced stability of zzso zzso Our objective was to develop zzso zzso having mechanical properties similar to those of cortical zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso containing zzso glass particles zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with or without zzso treatment were zzso Young's zzso of zzso containing zzso glass (16 zzso were significantly greater than those of zzso containing zzso glass zzso zzso or of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso glass reduced water zzso by the zzso and incorporation of zzso glass prevented zzso increases in water zzso zzso cells attached equally well to zzso zzso and composite containing zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso treatment improved the mechanical properties of zzso glass zzso without compromising zzso This material has a Young's zzso comparable to that of cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso glass zzso when used as implant or cement materials, would reduce stress shielding and improve implant zzso
