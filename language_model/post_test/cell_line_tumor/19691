The zzso tumor zzso protein is zzso in zzso zzso mouse colon tumors, making them a good model for human colon zzso that retain a wild type zzso zzso Cellular zzso and zzso experiments using a cell line derived from an zzso colon tumor zzso zzso pointed to zzso expressed zzso as being an important negative regulator of zzso in these zzso Although the zzso zzso protein zzso was expressed in zzso cells, its level of expression was not sufficient for zzso zzso We tested the response of zzso cells to the recently developed zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to activate zzso DNA binding in zzso cells, to a level comparable to zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso increased expression of the zzso target genes zzso and zzso to a greater extent than zzso or zzso and triggered a zzso phase arrest in these cells, compared to a zzso arrest triggered by zzso and zzso The differences in the cellular response may be related to differences in the zzso of zzso zzso and/or its zzso modification zzso In an ex zzso experiment, zzso was found to activate zzso target gene expression and zzso in zzso tumor zzso but not in normal adjacent zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso may be an effective means of selectively targeting colon zzso that retain a zzso zzso gene while sparing normal tissue and that the zzso model is an appropriate model for the zzso development of these zzso
