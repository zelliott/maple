zzso zzso are required for faithful DNA synthesis and repair, and their de zzso zzso is regulated by zzso zzso 1 zzso The zzso transcript contains a heavy chain zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso internal zzso entry site zzso that regulates zzso zzso In this study a zzso dose of zzso is shown to increase zzso zzso activity and protein levels in four different cell zzso The mechanism for the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso involves an increase in heavy chain zzso and zzso nuclear zzso zzso expression and the zzso of zzso protein 1 from the nucleus to the zzso The zzso increase in zzso translation is accompanied by an increase in the small zzso zzso nuclear zzso of the de zzso zzso zzso zzso and a decrease in DNA strand breaks, indicating a role for zzso and nuclear folate metabolism in DNA zzso
