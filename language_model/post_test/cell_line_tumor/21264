The present study was designed to examine the effect of zzso on primary cancer cells isolated from the zzso or zzso zzso of patients with zzso zzso 

zzso cancer cells were isolated from the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso Compared with culture cell lines, the response of these cancer cells to zzso and zzso agents commonly used in clinical practice were determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso in primary cancer cells was determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to examine the role of zzso associated genes in the zzso effect of zzso 

The primary cancer cells isolated from zzso showed sensitivity to zzso with zzso values of zzso similar to the zzso in established cell zzso Patients with gastric zzso were more sensitive to zzso than patients with lung zzso zzso Four cancer cells isolated from zzso were resistant to zzso which also had increased tolerance to zzso zzso and zzso We also observed a weak but significant correlation between sensitivity to zzso and cellular expression of zzso zzso zzso 

Using cancer cells isolated from the zzso or zzso zzso this study shows the potential zzso effect of zzso against primary cancer zzso
