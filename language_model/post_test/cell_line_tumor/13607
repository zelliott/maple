Cancer cells, with and without fluorescent protein zzso were zzso with various doses of zzso zzso 400, and 600 zzso zzso Lewis lung zzso cells zzso and zzso human zzso cells, expressing zzso in the nucleus and zzso in the zzso and zzso LLC and zzso cells were cultured in zzso zzso Eight hours after seeding, the cells were zzso with the various doses of zzso The resulting cell number was determined after 24 zzso Compared to zzso LLC cells, the number of zzso LLC cells decreased significantly due to zzso zzso with 100 zzso zzso Although there was no significant difference in the number of zzso and zzso zzso cells after 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso the number of zzso zzso cells decreased significantly with respect to zzso cells due to zzso zzso with 400 zzso and 600 zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, both zzso LLC and zzso zzso cells were more sensitive to zzso light than zzso LLC and zzso zzso These results suggest that the expression of fluorescent proteins in cancer cells can enhance zzso therapy zzso using zzso and possibly with other zzso of light as zzso
