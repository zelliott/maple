The zzso zzso family in man contains proteins that recognize invasive zzso zzso a member of this family, is activated by specific zzso zzso that contain zzso zzso Plants contain a large family of proteins known as resistance zzso proteins that have common structural features with the zzso receptors and are essential for protection against a variety of plant zzso zzso genetic studies have shown that the R protein function is determined by multiple proteins including zzso zzso and zzso Here we show that zzso positively regulates zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso did not affect stability of zzso protein or of downstream signaling molecules but did prevent multiple cellular responses associated with zzso zzso In contrast, depletion of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso had no effect on zzso cellular zzso Finally, depletion of zzso or addition of a zzso inhibitor of zzso resulted in loss of zzso zzso Thus, we show common regulatory pathways in plant R protein and human zzso pathways and provide the basis for understanding the zzso zzso
