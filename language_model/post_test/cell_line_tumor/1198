zzso of the zzso zzso zzso aggressive behavior in human zzso Likewise, zzso of the intermediate filament zzso a zzso stem cell marker, is linked to increased aggressiveness in several nervous system zzso We investigated the interaction of these two proteins in human zzso zzso zzso cell zzso with high levels of zzso protein have significantly higher zzso protein levels than zzso cell lines, suggesting that the zzso factor zzso may regulate zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso sequence into zzso zzso zzso cells results in a zzso reduction in zzso protein without altering zzso zzso However, cell functions attributed to zzso zzso rate, zzso growth, and zzso all decrease zzso zzso studies that zzso zzso levels also result in commensurate changes in zzso zzso and protein amounts as well as in cell proliferation and zzso Thus, zzso appears to be downstream of and regulated by zzso zzso mobility shift zzso show that zzso binds specifically to zzso sequences in the regulatory second zzso of the zzso gene and nuclear zzso studies show that increases in zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies indicate that zzso is present in the nucleus as well as in the zzso of zzso cell zzso Finally, DNA zzso experiments show that zzso binds DNA in zzso zzso cell zzso Thus, zzso may be one zzso of zzso tumor aggressiveness of human zzso
