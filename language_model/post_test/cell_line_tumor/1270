The improvement of therapeutic efficacy for cancer agents has been a big challenge which includes the increase of tumor selectivity and the reduction of adverse effects at zzso zzso In order to achieve those goals, zzso approaches have been extensively zzso In this report, the potential zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in pancreatic cancer cells were selected and the feasibility of zzso specific zzso of zzso was zzso All zzso exhibited the range of zzso zzso of half life in zzso cell zzso with the presence and the absence of selective zzso zzso zzso exhibited longer half life only with the presence of zzso zzso Human zzso B and D selectively zzso zzso and zzso compared to the other tested zzso The wide range of growth zzso effect by zzso zzso in zzso cells was observed due to the different affinities of zzso zzso to zzso In conclusion, it is feasible to design zzso which are activated by specific zzso zzso D might be a good candidate as a target zzso for zzso zzso and zzso may be the best candidate among the tested zzso zzso
