zzso zzso zzso are widely used drugs to interfere with cholesterol zzso Besides this zzso evidence is increasing that statins might also be useful in therapy of viral infections or zzso We investigated the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the viability of primary mouse and human zzso as well as mouse zzso and human zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Our results show selective zzso effects of zzso zzso and zzso on zzso cells in comparison to primary zzso Using human zzso cells we found significant reduction of cell viability and induction of zzso in zzso cells, while statins did not affect zzso cells at zzso not toxic for primary zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso which is zzso in zzso cells, was able to restore zzso of zzso cells towards zzso zzso The zzso effect of statins did not depend on a lack of cholesterol production, but was restored by supplementation of zzso or zzso zzso zzso for zzso of small G zzso In conclusion, statins display a selective zzso effect on human zzso cells, with zzso zzso and zzso being both, most selective for tumor cells and most effective in inducing tumor cell zzso Additionally, our results zzso that zzso activity of statins requires cell proliferation and is reduced by zzso zzso
