zzso zzso zzso is the most common zzso zzso with a dismal zzso Although zzso zzso chemotherapy following neurosurgery has been proven to be effective, not all patients benefit clinically because of zzso zzso Given that protein expression of zzso zzso is the most important zzso of zzso resistance, great efforts have been made to suppress it by regulating zzso zzso zzso The study presented here demonstrates that zzso a natural zzso is able to reverse zzso resistance of zzso zzso cells which have relatively high zzso zzso The data showed that combination treatment with zzso and zzso resulted in an enhanced zzso potential of zzso decreased the 50% zzso concentration zzso of zzso and increased the induction of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed increased zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and nuclear and zzso zzso in cells receiving combination zzso Western zzso analysis zzso a significant decreased zzso content and nuclear zzso of zzso and increased zzso of zzso in cells exposed to combination treatment, compared to those in cells treated with zzso zzso In addition, zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso remarkably promoted nuclear zzso of zzso and abolished the zzso reversal induced by combination treatment, suggesting an underlying zzso zzso Our study improved the knowledge on the mechanism of zzso resistance and suggested a novel strategy for zzso chemotherapy in zzso zzso
