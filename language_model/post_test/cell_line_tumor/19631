The zzso of zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso has been shown to induce growth arrest and differentiation of various cancer zzso In the current study, we investigated the effect of zzso zzso on the expression of zzso and proliferation of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso and zzso increase in zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso expression in response to zzso was attenuated by zzso with zzso I, zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso was linked to the generation of zzso oxygen species zzso both of which were indispensable for zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso with zzso I or zzso blocked zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso signaling is also involved in the induction of zzso Furthermore, the growth zzso effect of zzso was significantly zzso by prolonged incubation with zzso and was attenuated in the presence of zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso These effects were associated with an induction of cell cycle arrest at zzso phase, which was accompanied by the induction of zzso expression and decreased zzso D1 zzso Taken together, these observations indicate that zzso zzso with zzso zzso to inhibit cell growth through zzso of zzso zzso
