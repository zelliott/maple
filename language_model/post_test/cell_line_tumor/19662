The zzso zzso is one of the most sensitive tests for the evaluation of functional state of a zzso The agents, which promote zzso of zzso zzso as well as those, which suppress it, are well zzso The goal of the present work was tracing the possibilities for altering zzso zzso into one or another direction, as a result of combined influence of some zzso zzso radiation at a dose of zzso zzso zzso with frequency of 45 zzso zzso zzso in one case, and addition to this combination of the zzso zzso zzso acid, at different zzso The following data have been zzso combination of zzso radiation of zzso zzso increased effect against the effect of its constituents, while addition of zzso acid at dilution of zzso increased effect even zzso In the other series of experiments, combination of zzso radiation of zzso zzso and zzso was used in the same zzso as a result, the sum effect decreased against its constituents, while addition of highly diluted zzso zzso acid practically arrested this zzso It is concluded that effect of a combined influence depends on a dose of the zzso
