The zzso of zzso zzso in human zzso zzso and normal adjacent tissue was examined using zzso In normal zzso zzso was strongly localized in the zzso zzso zzso in tumor zzso zzso for zzso was dispersed throughout the zzso weak in zzso zzso and strong in zzso inflammatory zzso The addition of 50 zzso zzso acid zzso resulted in decreased cell proliferation after 72 zzso but lower zzso (5 or 10 zzso had no effect compared to vehicle treated zzso zzso In addition, zzso had no effect on zzso or differentiation of the zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso from zzso cells treated with 5 zzso zzso revealed changes in 17 zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso with zzso In zzso nude mice, zzso tumors derived from zzso zzso cells were smaller than tumors derived from zzso zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso zzso changes in gene expression and has zzso zzso
