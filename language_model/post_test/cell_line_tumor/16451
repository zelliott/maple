The zzso gene controls the switch between zzso and zzso infection by zzso virus zzso We previously reported that both the zzso and zzso elements within the zzso promoter, zzso are potent zzso zzso within the context of an intact zzso zzso We report here identification of another sequence element, zzso which zzso with zzso in zzso zzso via binding zzso or zzso We then determined the zzso of a zzso of zzso strain zzso in which the zzso zzso and zzso elements were zzso zzso zzso cell lines infected with this triple zzso zzso virus spontaneously zzso 6- to zzso more viral zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 3- to zzso more viral zzso zzso and zzso zzso 3- to zzso more viral DNA, and 7- to zzso more infectious virus than did zzso cell lines zzso infected with either the zzso zzso double zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso While zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso efficiently infected human primary blood B cells in zzso it was highly defective in zzso zzso Instead of the nearly complete zzso of zzso gene expression that occurs within 4 days after primary infection with zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells continued to zzso zzso zzso with zzso of them dying within 9 days zzso zzso cells infected with this zzso virus also exhibited increased synthesis of zzso and zzso zzso Thus, we conclude that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso elements act zzso to repress zzso from zzso thereby tightly controlling zzso gene zzso which is crucial for establishing and maintaining zzso zzso
