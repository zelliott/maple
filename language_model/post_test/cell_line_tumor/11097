We studied the expression levels of fatty acid binding proteins in breast normal and cancer cell zzso Liver fatty acid binding protein zzso and zzso fatty acid binding proteins were shown to be zzso in breast cancer cell lines while zzso and zzso acid binding proteins were down regulated in breast cancer cells compared to normal breast cell zzso We have previously shown that blocking the expression of zzso resulted in remarkable effects on zzso and cell proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines zzso et al zzso To study the mechanism of effect of the liver fatty acid binding protein in breast cancer cells, we designed an zzso zzso to block the production of zzso in zzso zzso The zzso was shown to inhibit the expression of zzso and to induce zzso in zzso zzso This study examines the mechanism by which zzso zzso regulates proliferation and zzso in breast cancer cell zzso We used human zzso zzso to explore zzso expressed genes in zzso breast cancer cells treated with zzso zzso zzso Some of the genes that were zzso expressed were confirmed using quantitative zzso Genes related to cell growth, proliferation and zzso showed significant zzso This suggests a possible use of these zzso zzso as therapeutic agents for breast cancer in zzso
