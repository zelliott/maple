In an attempt to discover new potent zzso for zzso tuberculosis zzso a series of zzso derivatives with a wide range of zzso at zzso zzso and zzso were designed by considering Lipinski zzso The designed compounds were zzso characterized and evaluated for their zzso potential against zzso zzso by in zzso zzso The compounds, zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed noticeable zzso activity against zzso zzso with minimum zzso concentration zzso of zzso zzso and 25 zzso zzso An attempt has been made to understand the mechanism of action by binding interactions of these molecules with zzso zzso protein through zzso zzso The zzso zzso for compounds zzso and zzso were found to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
