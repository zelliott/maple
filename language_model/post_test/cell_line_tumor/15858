During the last decade, zzso studies uncovered the tremendous impact of zzso zzso zzso type 2 zzso zzso as risk factors of the progression of zzso zzso we studied the impact of zzso zzso and insulin zzso on the activities of zzso cells, because little is known about how high zzso and insulin levels are influencing gene activities causing changes in the signal cascade activities with respect to zzso involved in the proliferation and migration of cancer zzso 

To address this question we zzso the activity of more than 400 gene signatures related to zzso cell cycle, zzso cell movement as well as zzso signal zzso We examined zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by comparing zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso (without and with zzso 

zzso zzso revealed that high levels of zzso (11 zzso and insulin zzso zzso zzso did promote the proliferation of the zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Using a zzso zzso we have shown that high zzso zzso caused increased zzso rates of the zzso zzso The increase in migratory activity at high zzso and insulin zzso was zzso by an zzso of zzso zzso and zzso as figured out by the pharmacological zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

We present molecular and functional data, which could help to understand how zzso and zzso might trigger zzso cell proliferation and zzso in patients, zzso
