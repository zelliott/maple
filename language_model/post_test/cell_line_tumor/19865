zzso involves the generation of a jet of viscous solution, and results in the formation of zzso zzso zzso fibers prepared using this technology and via the zzso process were evaluated as scaffolds for bone tissue zzso We found that human zzso zzso cells successfully zzso on individual zzso zzso and proliferated on zzso In an zzso ability study, zzso particles covered the fibers after soaking in simulated body fluid for 7 zzso Energy zzso X-ray analysis revealed that zzso atomic ratio of the particles was similar to that of human zzso In addition, X-ray zzso analysis revealed that zzso structure of the particles agreed with that of zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso fibers are a potential candidate for scaffolding material in bone tissue zzso
