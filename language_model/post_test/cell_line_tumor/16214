zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the most lethal zzso Novel zzso targeted therapies are urgently zzso Here, we extended our studies on the role of protein zzso D1 zzso in zzso cell zzso Given that zzso express moderate levels of zzso we used zzso gene transfer to create a zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we used zzso targeting zzso in zzso to produce a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso cells exhibit significantly increased zzso growth in soft zzso and increased in zzso invasion compared with zzso zzso zzso cells show a significant decrease in zzso growth and zzso as compared with zzso zzso The selective zzso family inhibitor zzso markedly decreased zzso ability and zzso by either zzso or zzso zzso zzso of the zzso factors vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso was significantly elevated by zzso zzso in zzso cells and reduced either by depletion of zzso via zzso in zzso cells or by addition of zzso to either zzso or zzso zzso Furthermore, human zzso vein zzso cell zzso tube formation was significantly enhanced by zzso with zzso compared with zzso in an zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso depletion in zzso cells decreased their ability to induce zzso formation by zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso was markedly inhibited by zzso Our results lend further support to the hypothesis that zzso family members provide a novel target for zzso zzso
