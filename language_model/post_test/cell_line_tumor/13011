zzso cells are known to be the major source of tumor propagation and might be an attractive therapeutic zzso The present study dissected the roles of zzso as a zzso cell marker in zzso cancer and investigated the zzso impact of this marker zzso zzso zzso using 6 zzso cancer cell lines revealed that the frequency of zzso cells varied widely among the cell types and that zzso and zzso cells contained significantly higher ratio zzso of such zzso therefore, these were subjected to the subsequent zzso zzso zzso cells showed more aggressive zzso potential in zzso and more increased zzso in nude or zzso mice than zzso cells and generated both zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, they showed apparent resistance to zzso or zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso cells had a greater zzso fraction than zzso cells, and the serum zzso that induced zzso zzso decreased the population of zzso zzso Finally, we zzso analyzed the zzso expression in zzso cancer specimens from 62 zzso zzso expression was not significantly associated with any of the zzso characteristic of zzso However, the zzso analysis revealed that tumors with high zzso expression showed worse overall survival zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than those with low zzso zzso and the Cox zzso hazard model found that high zzso expression was an independent zzso factor zzso zzso zzso Thus, the present study demonstrates that zzso is not only a zzso cell marker but also a critical zzso marker in zzso zzso
