zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a hallmark for the Philadelphia zzso zzso diseases zzso zzso essential zzso and primary zzso We tested the efficacy of a selective zzso inhibitor in cellular and in zzso models of zzso zzso 

A novel inhibitor of zzso was characterized using zzso zzso Cellular effects of this compound were measured in cell lines bearing the zzso or zzso zzso and its zzso activity against primary zzso patient cells was determined using zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso was determined using a zzso zzso model, and effects of the compound on survival, zzso body weight, and zzso inflammatory markers were zzso 

zzso zzso inhibited proliferation of cell lines and primary cells from zzso patients carrying the zzso or zzso zzso by blocking zzso signaling and inducing zzso In zzso zzso reduced zzso cell burden, reversed zzso and zzso zzso architecture, improved body weight gains, and extended survival in a model of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, these mice suffered from markedly elevated levels of inflammatory zzso similar to advanced zzso disease patients, which was reversed upon zzso 

These data showed that administration of the dual zzso inhibitor zzso reduces zzso cell burden, zzso zzso size and architecture, suppresses inflammatory zzso improves weight gain, and extends survival in a zzso model of zzso zzso zzso Thus, selective zzso of zzso and zzso represent a novel therapy for the patients with zzso diseases and other zzso associated with zzso zzso
