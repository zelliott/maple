The small zzso zzso zzso zzso cell protein zzso is associated with reorganization of zzso filaments and cell movement, but its activity has not been reported in human cancer zzso Here, we investigated the association of zzso expression with clinical features of lung zzso cell zzso High levels of zzso protein were detected in zzso of zzso samples, and in zzso of adjacent zzso normal zzso The number of primary zzso with elevated zzso levels was significantly higher in primary zzso with zzso zzso zzso as opposed to those without, and also in zzso from patients with more advanced zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso of cells, as zzso zzso caused the reorganization of zzso zzso decreased the formation of zzso and inhibited the migration of a lung cancer cell zzso We further showed that zzso zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso resulted in the degradation of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in approximately zzso of primary zzso with zzso zzso zzso We zzso that zzso is associated with zzso potential of lung zzso cell zzso through its interaction with zzso
