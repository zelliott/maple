zzso zzso expresses two zzso zzso zzso and zzso which share zzso with distinct families of zzso zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that the zzso zzso zzso can catalyze the zzso zzso of zzso containing zzso and that zzso contributes to zzso zzso The zzso specificity of zzso is typical for zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso being the most rapidly zzso zzso In a mouse pneumonia model the zzso zzso zzso did not cause significant differences in the survival times of mice compared with the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, a detailed analysis of bacterial outgrowth over time in the zzso zzso zzso blood, and zzso showed a rapid elimination of zzso zzso from the upper airways but did not reveal significant differences in the zzso blood, and zzso These results suggested that zzso is involved in colonization but does not contribute significantly to invasive zzso zzso In cell culture infection experiments, the absence of zzso impaired adherence to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso zzso of the zzso zzso could not be restored by zzso added zzso zzso zzso in zzso did not reduce binding activity to host target zzso but resulted in enhanced zzso by professional zzso In conclusion, zzso is a functional, zzso zzso and contributes to zzso zzso in the first stage of infection, zzso colonization of the upper zzso most likely by modulating the biological function of important zzso zzso
