zzso is a member of the zzso of zzso protein family, is expressed in most of human zzso Thus, we hypothesized that using a zzso zzso zzso system, an zzso gene may be zzso restricted to zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was recently identified a potent zzso zzso In the present study, our aim is to investigate whether zzso zzso gene transfer using the zzso promoter could specifically enhance zzso of breast cancer cells in zzso and in zzso 

zzso we performed zzso zzso to detect zzso zzso expression in four human breast cancer cell lines and two normal cell zzso Then, we constructed zzso zzso expressing zzso or zzso reporter gene driven by the zzso core promoter and evaluated its zzso activity in zzso Next, a zzso zzso zzso system expressing zzso gene was zzso Western zzso analysis of zzso protein expression in zzso and zzso cells treated with various zzso zzso driven by zzso promoter or zzso zzso zzso the effects of zzso zzso on the in zzso zzso of breast cancer cells were investigated by zzso formation zzso Cellular zzso were determined by zzso and zzso zzso The expression and activities of cellular zzso were zzso by Western zzso and zzso Finally, we investigated the effect of zzso zzso on the zzso of breast zzso cells in zzso 

The zzso zzso expression was obviously zzso in breast cancer cell lines but in normal cell zzso Moreover, the zzso promoter could drive high-level expression of zzso or zzso in breast cells but not in normal zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso system expressing zzso zzso we found that zzso expression was specifically and efficiently induced in zzso cell but not in zzso zzso Furthermore, we observed that the novel zzso system could significantly enhance zzso of zzso cell in zzso and in zzso which might be associated with zzso induction by zzso cellular zzso 

Our findings indicated that the zzso zzso zzso system expression zzso gene might be explored as a potential tool for zzso of human breast cancer cells with tumor specificity and high zzso
