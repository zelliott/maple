The aim of this study was to characterize the different zzso of zzso by zzso comparing the zzso of 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso mouse models that reflect the zzso of the human zzso 

Mouse zzso zzso human zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were injected zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso PET imaging with zzso zzso and zzso was performed in these mouse models, and a ratio between the standardized zzso value of the primary tumor and a control area of bone was calculated and compared among the zzso zzso and zzso were performed to confirm the PET zzso 

The pattern of zzso zzso differed among the primary tumors of the 3 models in accordance with the zzso and zzso on primary tumor zzso The zzso tumors in the zzso model showed the highest zzso of zzso an indicator of zzso zzso which was significantly higher zzso zzso zzso than in the zzso model and correlated with the percentage of zzso cells in the primary zzso zzso indicated by zzso zzso was higher in the zzso and zzso cell zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso Finally zzso a marker of bone zzso correlated with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso tumors showed a significantly higher zzso than the moderately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso 

zzso PET imaging with zzso indicating zzso activity, zzso or bone zzso will be helpful for the characterization of different zzso zzso and subsequent evaluation of more specific treatment zzso targeting the processes that are zzso in each specific tumor type or zzso
