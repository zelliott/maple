Jack bean zzso zzso the decomposition of zzso into zzso which in turn increases the pH of the surrounding zzso Based on these two properties, we have investigated the zzso effects of zzso in zzso and in zzso on human lung and breast cancer cell lines either by the zzso itself or in combination with other zzso zzso First, through the generation of toxic zzso zzso exerted direct zzso on zzso and zzso tumor cells with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso effects could effectively be blocked using the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso Complete protection was observed at dose zzso or zzso 2 zzso In addition, nude mouse zzso models demonstrated that zzso zzso injections (1 - 10 zzso inhibited zzso and zzso tumor growth in zzso Second, when combined with zzso zzso drugs, zzso provided indirect zzso effects via pH zzso zzso of zzso pH by zzso (2 zzso and zzso zzso or zzso 2 zzso was found to enhance the zzso efficacy of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
