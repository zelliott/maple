zzso carrier zzso zzso plays a crucial role in the trafficking and metabolism of cholesterol and other lipids in zzso zzso zzso zzso generated under zzso stress conditions are relatively zzso zzso that damage cell zzso and play an important role in zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso stressed cells might enhance zzso if highly sensitive sites are targeted and zzso capacity is zzso We tested this using a clone zzso of rat zzso cells that zzso mature zzso zzso When challenged with zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were found to be much more sensitive to viability loss than zzso control zzso zzso zzso zzso cells imported zzso more zzso The clones were equally sensitive to zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso effect was zzso Fluorescence intensity of the zzso zzso and zzso increased more rapidly in zzso than VC cells after zzso exposure, consistent with more rapid zzso and zzso turnover in the zzso zzso zzso accumulated much faster in zzso zzso than in zzso whereas other zzso zzso showed little rate zzso In keeping with this, zzso zzso cells exhibited a faster loss of zzso membrane potential and development of zzso This is the first reported evidence that zzso stress damage can be selectively targeted and exacerbated by an zzso zzso transfer zzso
