zzso enhances zzso expression and the invasion and zzso potential of melanoma zzso zzso has been shown to induce zzso in multiple zzso To investigate the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso we performed zzso zzso zzso in 206 normal and melanoma tissue samples, and analyzed the correlation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in melanoma cell lines supports that zzso directly binds to zzso zzso Moreover, we made a series of deletion zzso of zzso promoter, and identified a zzso zzso binding zzso Point zzso in this site significantly decreased zzso response to zzso zzso knocking down zzso zzso zzso response to zzso in melanoma cell zzso zzso could not be efficiently activated by zzso in zzso depletion zzso zzso data showed that zzso zzso was reduced in zzso depletion cells than control under zzso zzso To verify the data from cell culture model, we performed in zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso showed reduced zzso level in zzso depleted zzso compared to the control group, with the zzso level being zzso Our study demonstrates a novel zzso zzso by zzso to promote the zzso zzso induced by zzso and helps to understand the interplay between zzso and melanoma zzso
