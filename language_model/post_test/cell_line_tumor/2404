The zzso acid zzso cycle is the central hub of zzso zzso running in the classic forward direction to provide carbon for zzso and reducing agents for generation of zzso Our zzso zzso studies in melanoma cells showed that in hypoxic conditions the zzso cycle is largely disconnected from zzso By studying the zzso branch point zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso and fatty zzso we developed a comprehensive picture of the zzso of the zzso cycle that occurs in zzso zzso tumor cells maintain proliferation by running the zzso cycle in zzso The source of carbon for zzso zzso zzso and fatty acids switches from zzso in zzso to zzso in zzso This hypoxic flux from zzso into fatty acids is zzso by reductive zzso This reductive zzso is zzso by two zzso zzso zzso and zzso Their combined action is necessary and sufficient to effect the reverse zzso flux and maintain cellular zzso
