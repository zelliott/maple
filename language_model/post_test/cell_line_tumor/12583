The zzso zzso factor 3 zzso gene is induced by a variety of signals, including many of those encountered by cancer zzso We present evidence that zzso is induced by zzso in the zzso breast cancer cells and plays an integral role for zzso to zzso its target genes zzso zzso and twist, and to enhance cell zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso the expression of the zzso gene itself, forming a zzso loop for zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso leads to zzso changes and zzso of markers consistent with zzso transition zzso It also leads to features associated with zzso zzso increased zzso population of cells, zzso formation and zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduces zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso knocking down twist, a downstream target, reduces the ability of zzso to enhance zzso formation, indicating the functional significance of twist in zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the ability of zzso to enhance breast zzso cell features and to feedback on zzso Because zzso is an zzso gene and is induced by various zzso signals, these findings have significant implications for how the tumor zzso might affect cancer zzso
