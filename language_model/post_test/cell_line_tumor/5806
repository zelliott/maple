zzso response factor zzso is a zzso expressed zzso factor that regulates zzso functions such as muscle development and breast cancer zzso The zzso zzso factors zzso which are zzso zzso zzso zzso functions of zzso are also zzso zzso How zzso and zzso drive zzso zzso is still not fully zzso Here we show that zzso domain only 7 zzso is a zzso regulator of zzso and plays an important role in breast cancer cell zzso zzso activates zzso by zzso zzso zzso in a manner that requires, and is synergistic with, zzso zzso Whereas zzso is required for zzso to activate full-length zzso that have three zzso zzso zzso the disruption of individual zzso interactions is sufficient to eliminate the zzso dependency and to allow the strong zzso function of zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso with zzso and reduces the zzso ratio via a zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso cells compromises both zzso and zzso zzso activities and zzso the migration of zzso breast cancer zzso We also show that zzso is zzso in the zzso of invasive breast zzso in a manner that zzso with the increased expression of zzso target genes that regulate muscle and zzso zzso zzso Together, this study reveals a novel zzso mechanism regulating zzso signaling and breast cancer cell migration and identifies a role for zzso interactions in zzso zzso and zzso signals to achieve both the synergistic and zzso zzso of zzso
