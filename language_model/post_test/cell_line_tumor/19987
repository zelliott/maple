The human Cell Line zzso Test zzso an in zzso skin zzso test, is based on the zzso of zzso and zzso expression in zzso cells following exposure to zzso The zzso was found to be capable of determining the hazard of skin zzso In contrast, the local zzso zzso zzso zzso widely used as a zzso method in Europe and zzso identifies the same zzso but also zzso the potency by using the estimated concentration of zzso zzso In this study, several values calculated from the zzso data were evaluated for its correlation to the zzso zzso zzso A statistically significant correlation was observed between zzso concentration providing a cell viability of zzso zzso zzso estimated concentration of zzso for zzso zzso and for zzso zzso with zzso zzso From zzso and zzso a minimum induction threshold zzso was determined as the smaller of either zzso or zzso zzso showed a correlation with zzso zzso Also, zzso had an approximate zzso accuracy for zzso of the globally zzso system zzso when a tentative threshold of 13 zzso was zzso From these data, the zzso values may be one of the useful tools to predict the allergic potency of zzso
