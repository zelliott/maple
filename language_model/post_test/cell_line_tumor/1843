The addition of zzso to prostate cancer cells enhances cell death zzso by tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso an zzso zzso stress zzso can zzso zzso zzso in human prostate cancer zzso We evaluated the combination of zzso and TRAIL and found synergistic promotion of zzso in prostate cancer zzso The combined treatment with zzso and TRAIL significantly induced zzso and zzso zzso zzso and -9 activity, as well as the zzso of zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso promoted zzso zzso by the zzso of death zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso of cellular inhibitor of zzso 2 zzso In addition, zzso of zzso expression using small interfering zzso significantly attenuated the zzso induced by zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that the combination of zzso and TRAIL may provide a novel strategy for treating prostate cancer by overcoming critical mechanisms of zzso zzso
