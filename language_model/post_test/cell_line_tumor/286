Both of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are ubiquitous and persistent environmental zzso These two chemicals coexist in various environmental media and human samples and thus may have combined effects on human zzso However, the toxic effects and related mechanism of zzso to zzso and zzso remain zzso In a series of experiments using the zzso cells exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso we measured the rate of zzso zzso formation, zzso activity and expression of zzso zzso repair zzso proteins zzso and zzso We found that the exposure to zzso or zzso alone could effectively increase the zzso activity and the zzso zzso zzso alone had a profound enhancement of MN zzso Compared with zzso alone, zzso to both zzso and zzso significantly enhanced the zzso activity and the formation of MN but reduced the expression of both zzso and zzso The synergistic effect of zzso on zzso MN formation was inhibited by zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso Our findings suggest that zzso may enhance zzso DNA damage and zzso by increasing zzso zzso zzso activity and decreasing the zzso zzso
