Clinical evidence reveals that the efficacy of dietary factors to prevent cancer is probably zzso The ability to demonstrate zzso effects of dietary compounds on normal, zzso and zzso cell models may provide insights into puzzling clinical results from cancer zzso zzso The relevance of these models to the field of cancer prevention is immense and will undoubtedly facilitate the ability to discover which dietary factors are most effective at preventing cancer and which, if any, specific steps in zzso transformation render cells zzso to the effects of dietary zzso There are illustrative examples where exposure of high-risk individuals to dietary zzso agents increases rather than decreases cancer zzso While zzso and clinical zzso acknowledge the zzso zzso along which tumors develop in specific zzso tumor cells, rather than normal and zzso cells, continue to be the primary in zzso zzso tool employed to zzso mechanisms underlying disease progression and to investigate the potential utility of dietary as well as other zzso zzso Currently, there are few relevant model systems to study the progression of zzso zzso especially in zzso zzso We highlight examples of model systems isolated from zzso breast, zzso and zzso zzso with special emphasis on a specific set of zzso zzso zzso cell lines derived from zzso mice zzso zzso Adult Mouse zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that have yielded important information on early events in zzso zzso zzso These cell lines are an illustrative example of how researchers can examine zzso effects of specific dietary components on zzso The zzso of cell culture systems modeling early, middle and late stages of zzso will yield important insights into mechanisms by which dietary components impact cancer zzso
