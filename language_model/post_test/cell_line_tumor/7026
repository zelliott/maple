To evaluate the zzso expression of zzso tumors and correlate their expression with degrees of zzso and proliferation activity of zzso 

zzso expression in eight normal brain zzso 44 freshly zzso zzso tumor specimens and four zzso zzso cell lines were examined by Northern zzso analysis and zzso zzso The proliferation activity of tumors was measured by zzso labeling index zzso with zzso Scrape loading and dye transfer zzso was used for examination of gap junction zzso communication zzso in zzso cell zzso 

zzso out of 44 zzso tumors zzso expressed both zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression was decreased with the ascending of tumor grade and zzso correlated with zzso zzso was interrupted in zzso cell lines deficient in zzso zzso 

zzso expression level is zzso correlated with the tumor grade and proliferation activity of zzso suggesting the potential role of zzso in the zzso progression of zzso zzso
