zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso a powerful zzso of the zzso environment, promotes migration, invasion, and proliferation of zzso To perform its potent zzso activity in a controlled manner, zzso has to be regulated zzso However, our knowledge about zzso and regulatory proteins is still very zzso In this study we identify a catalog of proteins that directly or indirectly interact with zzso We expressed a zzso zzso zzso in human zzso melanoma zzso zzso We prepared cell zzso using zzso and zzso was affinity zzso together with zzso proteins using an zzso zzso A distinct set of membrane proteins was found to zzso with zzso when zzso proteins were zzso The proteins were analyzed with an integrated system composed of zzso liquid zzso and tandem mass zzso We identified 158 proteins including several previously reported to bind zzso although most had not previously been zzso Six of these membrane zzso including one previously shown to interact with zzso were zzso with zzso in zzso zzso Five of the latter were found to associate with zzso in an zzso zzso zzso of cells expressing each of these test proteins revealed that one zzso with zzso at the zzso membrane and the other at the zzso zzso In contrast, another protein which did not zzso with zzso showed no zzso zzso zzso zzso two of the tested proteins at least in zzso Thus, we provide a valuable resource to identify zzso and regulators of zzso in tumor zzso
