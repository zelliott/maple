The influence of ripe zzso cells zzso on the zzso activity of zzso zzso and the zzso activity of zzso of zzso mice was zzso As zzso of DC zzso the combination of zzso components incorporated into the vaccine zzso zzso zzso pneumoniae, zzso zzso zzso coli, zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso This study demonstrated that DC activated with these preparations enhanced the zzso activity of zzso zzso the activity of zzso being higher than that of zzso zzso zzso The increase of zzso activity was accompanied by a rise in the zzso of mouse zzso with respect to the zzso tumor line zzso or zzso tumor zzso The incubation of the zzso with ripe DC (with the use of the preparations under study as zzso zzso loaded with tumor zzso made it possible to obtain zzso zzso having high zzso activity with respect, zzso to those tumor lines from which zzso for the treatment of DC had been zzso The zzso of DC with bacterial zzso led to an increase in the zzso function of these cells, to their higher capacity for regulating the differentiation of zzso zzso and for zzso the zzso of natural zzso
