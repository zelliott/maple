The discovery of potent zzso of the zzso zzso has revolutionized therapy for melanoma harboring zzso in zzso yet zzso melanoma remains without an effective zzso Because direct pharmacological zzso of the zzso zzso has thus far been zzso we explored systems biology approaches to identify synergistic drug zzso that can mimic zzso zzso Here, leveraging an zzso mouse model of zzso melanoma, we show that pharmacological zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso activates zzso but not zzso arrest, which is in contrast to complete genetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which triggers both of these zzso Network modeling zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso as a key driver of this differential zzso zzso combined pharmacological zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso led to substantial zzso in therapeutic zzso We suggest a zzso model of zzso zzso signaling in which the output is zzso resulting in the decoupling of discrete downstream biological zzso as a result of incomplete zzso Such a gated signaling model offers a new framework to identify zzso zzso zzso for combined pharmacological zzso in zzso zzso
