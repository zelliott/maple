DNA zzso is crucial for normal development, but gene expression altered by DNA zzso is often associated with human diseases, especially zzso The gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was previously identified in zzso screens for genes induced by the zzso of DNA zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso The zzso showed a high frequency of DNA zzso zzso in both zzso cell lines and primary zzso zzso We now report that zzso is also zzso by DNA zzso and could be a putative zzso target gene in gastric zzso We found that the expression of zzso zzso was frequently zzso and zzso correlated with DNA zzso in seven out of nine gastric cancer cell zzso zzso zzso expression was also restored after treating with a DNA zzso zzso In primary gastric tumors, zzso zzso results in 23 of the 36 zzso cases revealed that the zzso at zzso islands of the zzso was zzso at a high zzso Furthermore, zzso suppressed the growth of gastric cancer cells as demonstrated by a colony formation zzso Thus, strong associations between zzso expression and zzso were observed, and zzso zzso at a zzso island of zzso may play an important role in development of gastric zzso
