The interactions of zzso aromatic zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are complex; zzso are zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso breast cancer cells, exposure to zzso to 1 zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso levels greater than 1 zzso inhibited zzso zzso Time course studies showed that induction of zzso zzso metabolism persisted after the disappearance of zzso or zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso retaining zzso zzso zzso activity were responsible for prolonged zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso through the use of zzso zzso and zzso reporter zzso to induce zzso in zzso zzso zzso formed by zzso at the zzso region of zzso had zzso for zzso induction exceeding those of zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso were somewhat less potent than zzso The activities of expressed human zzso and zzso with zzso as zzso were investigated by use of zzso with zzso zzso and by zzso The results showed that both zzso efficiently zzso the formation of zzso zzso and zzso from zzso These studies indicate that the zzso effects of zzso zzso as potent zzso zzso are likely to be additional important factors in zzso interactions that affect metabolism and zzso of other zzso ultimately modulating zzso toxicity and zzso
