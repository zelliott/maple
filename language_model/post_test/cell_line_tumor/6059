zzso is used to prevent zzso in zzso However, its mechanism of zzso induction is zzso This study was undertaken to determine whether sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso in human oral cells and if so, whether Bad protein is involved in the zzso zzso showed higher zzso and zzso activity against human oral zzso cell zzso cells zzso than against human zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis showed that zzso enhanced the expression and zzso of Bad zzso This study demonstrates for the first time that Bad protein forms a complex with zzso zzso II zzso and zzso stimulates the detachment of zzso from the zzso complex and the replacement by the formation of zzso zzso zzso of Bad and zzso zzso by zzso inhibited and enhanced the zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study suggests that zzso zzso regulates the zzso zzso by forming a complex with zzso
