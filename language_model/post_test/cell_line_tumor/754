One of the mechanisms that has been put forward for the development of the zzso status is neuroendocrine zzso zzso cells zzso zzso that may represent one of the possible molecular bases by which zzso prostate cancer cells could escape zzso zzso prostate cancer cells were treated with either zzso or zzso zzso changes related to zzso and cell viability were zzso Changes in zzso zzso content were zzso analyzed by electron probe X-ray zzso zzso treatment consistently zzso a decrease in K and an increase in zzso which are inhibited by zzso or zzso The zzso ratio increased markedly after exposure to zzso and both zzso and zzso blocked this zzso zzso also caused changes in the zzso P and S zzso that to a large extent could be blocked by zzso These results support the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso capabilities onto zzso cells in close proximity to neuroendocrine zzso
