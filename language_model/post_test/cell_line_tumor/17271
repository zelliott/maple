zzso zzso zzso a zzso essential for bacterial growth, is an attractive target for use in the discovery of novel zzso zzso zzso chemical libraries were constructed and screened for zzso of zzso activity, zzso of zzso zzso growth, and zzso Positive compounds were selected based on the results of all three zzso zzso zzso was identified as having the most favorable properties through an integrated zzso and medicinal chemistry zzso This compound is a potent zzso inhibitor with a zzso of zzso zzso against the zzso coli zzso zzso possesses activity against zzso and zzso bacterial zzso and has a low zzso zzso experiments demonstrate that the compound zzso bacterial growth through zzso zzso zzso studies of this drug in mice indicate that zzso is orally zzso and rapidly distributed among various zzso zzso has in zzso activity against zzso zzso in a zzso zzso model, with 50% effective doses of 32, 17, and 21 zzso of body weight after dosing by intravenous zzso subcutaneous zzso and oral zzso administration, zzso In zzso zzso toxicity studies, no adverse effects were observed after dosing with more than 400 zzso of zzso per zzso by zzso zzso or zzso zzso The in zzso efficacy and low toxicity of zzso suggest the potential for developing this class of compounds to be used in future zzso zzso
