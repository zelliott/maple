The zzso gene was initially identified and cloned in our laboratory from human normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We revealed the expression of zzso protein was zzso in zzso zzso zzso samples using tissue zzso The low zzso protein expression was significantly associated with regional zzso zzso zzso primary tumor size, and tumor stage in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso in zzso due to the zzso in the gene zzso The treatment with zzso which is a DNA zzso inhibitor restored zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso The result indicated that promoter zzso may be 1 main mechanism leading to the zzso of zzso The high expression of zzso in patients with zzso was associated with longer survival compared with those with low zzso expression by zzso survival analysis zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was an independent zzso factor for zzso by multivariable Cox zzso hazards zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso The restoration of zzso expression in zzso cells inhibited cell zzso colony formation, zzso growth, cell cycle progression and tumor growth in zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso gene in zzso cells inhibited the expression of zzso and nuclear zzso in addition to the expression of zzso a zzso target zzso was zzso Taken together, zzso is a novel candidate tumor zzso gene in zzso and zzso protein is a candidate zzso marker for zzso
