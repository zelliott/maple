The molecular and cellular mechanism of the development of pancreatic cancer is under constant and intensive study, and yet the cure is still out of zzso While surgical treatment is zzso conventional chemotherapy or zzso remains the best zzso Among others, zzso is proven to be a popular and, to a certain extent, effective chemotherapy zzso We proposed that the combination of zzso and membrane permeable zzso would enhance the fatality of cancer cells, and reported that the combination increased cell death of both head and neck and zzso cancer zzso In this study, we treated pancreatic cancer cells zzso zzso with zzso and zzso at the zzso of clinical zzso and treatment was then followed up with an investigation of the molecular mechanism of the zzso of zzso and zzso The results of Western zzso analysis indicated that the combo zzso induced zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso and zzso zzso We also found that the combination zzso induced zzso zzso in a synergistic zzso Furthermore, we observed that zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso was blocked by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our results demonstrated that the combination of zzso and zzso zzso induced pancreatic cancer cell death through differential zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso may further enhance the zzso and zzso zzso
