A synthetic vitamin K zzso compound 5 zzso zzso is a potent inhibitor of cell zzso The aim was to investigate whether zzso was involved in zzso zzso cell growth zzso 

Human zzso cells zzso zzso were cultured and treated with zzso 5, and zzso protein expression and zzso were investigated using Western zzso zzso 

zzso 5 was found to inhibit zzso protein expression and induce zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was induced by both zzso zzso persistent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 5 increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly decreased and zzso levels were restored in zzso 5 treated cells, suggesting that zzso zzso increase of zzso activity enhanced zzso degradation and resulted in reduction of zzso zzso The lower zzso levels were found to cause altered expression of two zzso target zzso growth arrest gene zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The results suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in enhanced zzso protein degradation and reduced zzso protein levels, which may contribute to cell growth zzso by zzso zzso
