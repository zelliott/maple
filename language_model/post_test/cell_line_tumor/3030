zzso zzso a new zzso compound isolated from zzso zzso (by zzso zzso showed zzso activity in the gastric zzso cell line zzso The growth of zzso cells was inhibited as demonstrated by zzso zzso and several cellular characteristic changes, such as cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso body formation with programmed cell zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso cell cycle was arrested at zzso phase by zzso and the zzso rate of zzso cells increased with respect to zzso in a zzso zzso zzso also activated zzso decreased the expression of zzso and caused a decrease in the zzso membrane potential zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso could significantly induce zzso in zzso cells and should be considered as a potential candidate for a zzso drug against zzso
