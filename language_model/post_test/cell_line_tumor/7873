To explore zzso zzso signaling in 4 zzso cancer cell lines, zzso zzso cells zzso have been shown to release and respond to various putative zzso 

zzso zzso chain reaction was used to detect the presence of zzso transcripts in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso lines of cancer zzso zzso was used to detect expression of zzso zzso Cancer and normal zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso calcium zzso levels were measured using zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso was performed, and changes in zzso zzso were zzso 

None of the cancer cell lines expressed zzso zzso unlike normal zzso which expressed zzso None of the 4 zzso cancer cell lines responded to zzso However, zzso of normal zzso responded to zzso The zzso zzso cells expressed both zzso transcript and zzso Thirteen percent of zzso zzso cells responded to zzso 

This is the first description of altered zzso signaling in cancer zzso Unlike normal zzso zzso zzso cancer cells neither expressed zzso transcript nor responded to zzso as measured by changes in zzso We could partially reverse this zzso in one of the cancer cell lines, zzso by zzso these cells with the zzso zzso Although the effects of zzso zzso signaling on zzso cell are unknown, this signaling zzso may play a role in zzso cell zzso similar to that in zzso
