zzso is one of the most effective zzso agents against zzso zzso some patients develop zzso Unfortunately, their causes and mechanisms remain zzso We created zzso zzso from human zzso cancer zzso and investigated the roles of zzso DNA zzso and zzso oxygen species zzso on zzso zzso zzso had greatly increased zzso zzso Reduction of zzso content in zzso by zzso zzso treatment reduced the zzso These results indicate the possible roles of zzso zzso in zzso respiratory chain zzso in resistant zzso zzso A, an zzso zzso eliminated zzso resistance in zzso in contrast, zzso of other zzso did zzso zzso interference targeted to zzso zzso restored zzso zzso to zzso These results indicate the roles of zzso for resistant zzso zzso induced zzso generation in zzso but not in zzso and zzso zzso zzso eliminated zzso zzso suggesting roles of zzso in zzso cell zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso by zzso A induced zzso zzso generation in zzso Taken together, zzso acquired zzso resistance through increasing zzso which led to diminish zzso zzso generation and subsequently inhibited cell zzso In conclusion, zzso plays an important role in developing zzso resistance through the reduction of zzso generation by regulating zzso
