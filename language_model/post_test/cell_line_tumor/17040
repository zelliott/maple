To overcome the poor zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the side effects of the zzso in the marketed zzso we have developed a zzso zzso using a nontoxic and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The prepared zzso exhibited a zzso structure, and zzso was successfully zzso in the core with an zzso efficiency of zzso zzso zzso and a drug loading efficiency of zzso zzso zzso The zzso were zzso with a zzso diameter of approximately 20 zzso which could meet the requirement for in zzso administration, and were expected to enhance the drug's zzso efficacy and to decrease its zzso To evaluate the zzso zzso we chose a well marketed zzso zzso as the zzso The prepared zzso zzso had a similar zzso effect to zzso in zzso but a significantly better zzso efficacy than zzso in zzso which may be caused by passive targeting of the tumor by the zzso In addition, the safety evaluation revealed that the zzso zzso was a qualified drug for use in zzso Based on the experimental results, we propose that zzso zzso is a potent carrier for zzso
