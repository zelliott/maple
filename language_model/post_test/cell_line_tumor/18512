The expression of zzso zzso is increased in human zzso including zzso This study was designed to evaluate the effect and mechanisms of the selective zzso inhibitor zzso in the growth control of human zzso zzso zzso analysis using human zzso zzso showed increased levels of zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso a protein zzso activated by zzso zzso in human zzso zzso Treatment of cultured human zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso with zzso resulted in a zzso and zzso reduction of cell zzso Fluorescence zzso Western zzso and zzso activity zzso demonstrated that zzso induced zzso features of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and release of zzso zzso The zzso cell death was significantly blocked by zzso a zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso cells treated with zzso showed significant reduction of zzso zzso whereas the levels of zzso and zzso were not zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso significantly decreased the viability of human zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso growth partly through induction of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
