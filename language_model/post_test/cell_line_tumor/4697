zzso studies of breast cancer patients suggest that primary tumor zzso zzso or zzso therapy is associated with a devastating complication: the development of central nervous system zzso zzso zzso we present zzso expression trends from zzso human brain zzso and data from an experimental brain zzso zzso both indicative of a functional contribution of zzso to brain zzso zzso Of 124 archival zzso brain zzso from breast cancer patients, zzso zzso zzso indicating an enrichment in the frequency of tumor zzso zzso at this zzso zzso Using quantitative real-time zzso of laser capture zzso zzso cells, zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso levels in a cohort of 12 frozen brain zzso were increased up to zzso and zzso respectively, over those of zzso primary zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was also observed in a subset of brain zzso We then tested the hypothesis that zzso of zzso increases the colonization of breast cancer cells in the brain in zzso A zzso of zzso human breast zzso cells that selectively zzso to brain zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with low zzso to zzso or high zzso to zzso levels of zzso In zzso in a model of brain zzso low or high zzso zzso clones produced comparable numbers of zzso in the brain as control zzso however, the zzso zzso yielded zzso greater large zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso increases the outgrowth of zzso tumor cells in the brain in this model zzso
