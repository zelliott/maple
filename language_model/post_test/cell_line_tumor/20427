zzso availability represents a key component of current cancer zzso However, no approaches have been adopted to do this zzso and the current standard of care is invasive tissue zzso A zzso methodology capable of zzso available zzso binding potential of tumors in zzso within a clinically relevant time scale is zzso 

To test the methodology, a zzso zzso adaptation was validated against ex zzso and in zzso measures of zzso growth factor zzso zzso binding potential in four tumor lines in mice, each line expected to express a different level of zzso 

A strong correlation was observed between in zzso and ex zzso measures of binding potential for all tumor lines zzso p zzso zzso and zzso and between in zzso and in zzso for the three lines expressing the least amount of zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso 

By providing a fast and robust measure of zzso density in tumors, the presented methodology has powerful implications for improving choices in cancer intervention, zzso and monitoring, and can be scaled to the clinic with an imaging zzso like zzso
