zzso prostate and some zzso prostate cancer zzso cell lines undergo zzso differentiation and form zzso in three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso formed by zzso and zzso less pronounced also in other zzso cell lines, spontaneously undergo an invasive switch, leading to the disintegration of zzso structures and the zzso zzso and formation of zzso This demonstrates the highly dynamic nature of zzso zzso balancing zzso transition against zzso zzso zzso This study assessed the role of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso cells completely failed to form zzso structures in zzso zzso Adding back zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso rescued zzso zzso and zzso invasion zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso functions by zzso zzso interference zzso or the specific zzso inhibitor zzso promoted invasion, while zzso of other zzso receptors responsive to zzso or zzso mainly caused growth arrest or had no zzso The zzso zzso and zzso were identified as key zzso of zzso zzso via stimulation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and 2, zzso zzso while zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso may be zzso zzso with these pathways specifically zzso zzso polarization in transformed zzso In contrast, blocking the same pathways in zzso normal cells promoted zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso effectively promote zzso maturation and block invasion of zzso cells in 3-D zzso The analysis of clinical zzso data confirmed reduced expression of zzso in a subset of zzso Our study demonstrates a zzso function for zzso and zzso zzso regulating cell zzso and invasion versus zzso zzso
