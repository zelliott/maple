To examine zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso expression zzso in human zzso cell zzso zzso cell lines and zzso zzso as well as in corresponding normal kidney zzso 

We examined zzso zzso expression zzso in six human zzso cell lines by real-time reverse zzso chain zzso In addition, we evaluated the relationship between cell growth zzso by zzso zzso and the level of zzso zzso zzso We compared the expression of zzso zzso in 47 zzso zzso with that in corresponding normal kidney zzso and investigated the relationship between zzso features and the level of zzso zzso zzso 

Among the six zzso cell lines, five showed decreased zzso zzso zzso There was no relationship between the zzso effects of zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression zzso Of the zzso from 47 zzso patients, 25 zzso showed decreased expression of zzso zzso compared to corresponding normal kidney zzso and one was equivalent to normal zzso These patients had distant zzso at diagnosis more frequently than the remaining patients with high zzso There was also a trend for these patients to have a higher zzso 

Most zzso cell lines showed decreased expression of zzso zzso However, the level of zzso zzso expression did not affect cell growth zzso by zzso zzso More than half of the zzso from zzso patients had low expression of zzso zzso and such zzso might have more aggressive zzso
