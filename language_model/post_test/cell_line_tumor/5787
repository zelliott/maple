Cancer cell lines represent in zzso models for studying zzso general cell biology, drug discovery and zzso Whether they can be considered as exact representative models of the parental tumors remains uncertain given the acquisition of additional ex zzso changes of the cells and the lack of tissue architecture and zzso Previously, within the zzso zzso we characterized a collection of bone zzso cell lines on zzso and zzso zzso Here, we address the zzso and functional characterization of the unique set of zzso cell lines zzso in zzso and in zzso For functional analysis of differentiation capacity, cells were zzso towards zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, all cell lines were injected zzso and zzso into nude mice to zzso their in zzso tumor formation capacity as well as for zzso analysis of the zzso All formed tumors were further characterized zzso and zzso Out of 19 cell lines, 17 zzso showed zzso zzso zzso zzso could differentiate towards zzso and in zzso zzso cell lines zzso differentiation was zzso About half of the cell lines zzso zzso produced tumors in zzso after subcutaneous and intramuscular zzso Several cell lines showed invasion into adjacent zzso and one tumor developed several lung zzso The use of cell lines, especially in cancer research, is of paramount zzso Here, we identify zzso characterized zzso cell lines, which robustly represent clinical zzso providing researchers useful in zzso and in zzso models to study the zzso and functional characteristics of this highly zzso zzso
