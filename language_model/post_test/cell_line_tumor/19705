zzso zzso growth factor zzso plays a key role in tumor zzso by stimulating the zzso signaling of zzso cells via zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are an attractive therapeutic target for cancer zzso In the present study, we show that a zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso inhibitor for zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells at in zzso zzso zzso values zzso zzso zzso zzso It also inhibited zzso zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso but not zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso and proliferation of zzso zzso In addition, it inhibited zzso migration of human zzso vein zzso zzso Following zzso administration to zzso rats, zzso decreased the zzso density within tumor zzso and attenuated zzso zzso levels in tumor zzso It also displayed zzso activity against a wide variety of human tumor zzso including zzso breast, zzso zzso zzso and prostate zzso Furthermore, dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso analysis revealed that a significant reduction in tumor vascular zzso was closely associated with the zzso activity of zzso These findings suggest that zzso is a highly zzso zzso active zzso and zzso agent and that zzso would be useful in detecting early responses to zzso in a clinical zzso zzso is currently in phase I clinical development for the treatment of patients with advanced zzso
