Treatment of zzso zzso cell cancer zzso with zzso agents that block vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso 2 signaling produces tumor zzso in a substantial fraction of zzso however, resistance typically develops within 6 to 12 zzso The purpose of this study was to identify molecular pathways involved in zzso Treatment of mice bearing either zzso or zzso human zzso zzso with zzso or zzso produced tumor growth stabilization followed by regrowth despite continued drug administration analogous to the clinical zzso zzso and plasma were harvested at day 3 of therapy and at the time of resistance to assess pathways that may be involved in zzso zzso zzso imaging, and plasma and tumor collections were obtained in mice treated with either zzso or zzso alone or in combination with zzso injections of the zzso zzso zzso zzso administration led to an early zzso of zzso levels as well as reduction of zzso zzso and downstream zzso zzso zzso to 11 within the zzso zzso injection of zzso although producing minimal effects by itself, when combined with zzso resulted in delayed resistance in zzso accompanied by a prolonged reduction of zzso density and tumor zzso as measured by zzso imaging relative to zzso zzso These results provide evidence that resistance to zzso zzso therapy is due at least in part to resumption of zzso in association with reduction of zzso zzso zzso and that this resistance can be delayed by zzso administration of zzso
