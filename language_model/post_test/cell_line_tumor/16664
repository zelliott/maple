zzso zzso is commonly used in Mexican traditional medicine for the empirical treatment of zzso However, there are no studies regarding the zzso or zzso activities of zzso zzso 

The in zzso toxicity of zzso extracts of zzso zzso zzso was evaluated in mice according to the zzso zzso The in zzso zzso effects of zzso were evaluated zzso the effects of zzso on the zzso NO production and zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso on the proliferation of zzso zzso and zzso cell activity were also zzso The zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso were evaluated using the zzso zzso whereas the zzso effect of zzso on zzso cells was evaluated using zzso zzso Also, different doses of zzso were injected zzso daily into zzso mice bearing tumors of zzso cells during 25 zzso The growth and weight of tumors was zzso In addition, the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso serum and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso with a similar potency than zzso 1 zzso In addition, zzso zzso the proliferation of zzso zzso and induced the zzso cell zzso zzso showed zzso zzso zzso and zzso effects against zzso zzso The zzso was 125 zzso by zzso route zzso and 375 zzso by oral zzso zzso zzso at 1, 5 and 10 zzso zzso inhibited the tumor growth by zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in mice bearing zzso zzso zzso increased the in zzso and in zzso release of zzso zzso and zzso but lacked effect on zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso shows moderate toxic effects in zzso exerts zzso and zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso also has zzso effects in mice bearing zzso tumor and zzso zzso activities in zzso The results suggest that zzso effects of zzso are related with the production of zzso zzso
