zzso zzso zzso are zzso to be important regulators in various zzso including zzso In a large-scale zzso expression profiling analysis of 435 human zzso in 52 acute zzso leukemia zzso samples, we found that zzso and its minor counterpart in zzso zzso zzso were specifically zzso zzso in core binding factor zzso zzso including both zzso and zzso zzso Our in zzso zzso and zzso experiments showed that forced expression of zzso inhibited zzso and increased the viability of zzso cells, whereas the opposite effect was observed when zzso expression of zzso was knocked zzso In addition, through in zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated that forced expression of zzso enhanced proliferation and zzso capacity of mouse normal bone zzso zzso cells alone and particularly, in cooperation with zzso a fusion gene resulting from zzso Thus, our data shows that zzso may play a critical role in the development of zzso zzso In the present chapter, the materials and protocols for the study of zzso in leukemia are zzso
