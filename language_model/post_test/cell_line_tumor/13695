zzso zzso has been identified as a candidate zzso gene in zzso zzso anomaly face syndrome zzso zzso can function as a zzso zzso as well as a zzso Although the zzso role of zzso has been the focus of a number of published studies, its zzso activity has been largely zzso Thus, this study centers on the identification of potential zzso targets of zzso By zzso zzso we compared the expression profiles of control mouse zzso cells and zzso cells depleted of zzso via zzso zzso We identified zzso genes that were potentially zzso by zzso Of the zzso zzso we focused on zzso and zzso and carried out promoter zzso The results showed that zzso potentially zzso the promoter activities of these genes via zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso within the zzso zzso shift zzso also showed that zzso specifically interacts with certain portions of these promoter zzso Moreover, the construction of zzso zzso containing known human zzso zzso showed that these zzso result in the loss of zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso functions as a zzso in a gene regulation network, wherein zzso and zzso are 2 of the targets zzso by zzso via zzso binding zzso zzso the loss of zzso zzso activity could be associated with the disease zzso of patients with zzso
