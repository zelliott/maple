zzso of cell signaling pathways plays a crucial role in the development of zzso The identification of such pathways requires effective analysis tools that facilitate the interpretation of expression zzso Here, we present a novel and highly efficient method for identifying zzso zzso in a regulatory zzso Given a score for each zzso that measures the degree of deregulation of the corresponding gene or zzso the zzso zzso the heaviest connected zzso of a specified size reachable from a designated root zzso This root zzso can be interpreted as a molecular key player responsible for the observed zzso To demonstrate the potential of our approach, we analyzed three gene expression data zzso In one scenario, we compared expression profiles of zzso primary zzso zzso cells derived from zzso zzso carriers and of zzso cells without zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso stress plays an important role in zzso cells of zzso zzso carriers and that the zzso of stress proteins may result in avoidance of zzso leading to an increased overall survival of cells with genetic zzso In zzso our approach opens new avenues for the zzso of zzso mechanisms and for the detection of molecular key zzso
