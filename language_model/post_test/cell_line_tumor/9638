To examine the effects of vascular zzso growth factor zzso small interfering zzso zzso on proliferation of gastric cancer cells in zzso 

Several zzso were zzso into human gastric cancer cell line zzso with zzso zzso zzso not zzso with zzso 2000 or scrambled zzso zzso served as zzso The zzso effect of zzso on the expression of zzso zzso and protein was detected by zzso and zzso zzso zzso was used to examine the zzso rate of cell zzso The change in cell cycling of zzso cells was detected by flow zzso 

zzso targeting human zzso effectively inhibited the proliferation of gastric cancer cell line zzso and the distribution of cell zzso The percentage of zzso phase was significantly higher in zzso and zzso cells than in control zzso The expression of zzso zzso was significantly inhibited in zzso and zzso cells compared with that in control zzso zzso protein notably decreased in zzso cells, but had no effect on zzso zzso
