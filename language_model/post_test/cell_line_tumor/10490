Several zzso factors have zzso significance in zzso zzso The objective of this study was to evaluate whether traditional chemotherapy affects zzso factors in zzso zzso and to assess the clinical significance of these zzso To screen for zzso factors of possible zzso zzso and zzso zzso cancer cells were treated with zzso doses of zzso zzso or zzso or with zzso and zzso expression of several zzso factors was zzso zzso zzso bone zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso were statistically significantly induced by zzso At protein level, zzso also induced zzso zzso but not vascular zzso growth zzso In zzso samples taken before and after zzso zzso chemotherapy from 28 patients with advanced, high-grade zzso zzso zzso zzso and factors most induced by zzso zzso and zzso were analyzed by zzso Strong expression of zzso before chemotherapy was an independent zzso factor of longer zzso time zzso zzso zzso and overall survival zzso zzso zzso but it was not associated with zzso (as evaluated by zzso However, changes in zzso expression in samples analyzed before and after chemotherapy zzso in zzso zzso were not associated with zzso zzso expression was not associated with clinical zzso Our results indicate that in zzso zzso zzso zzso has zzso significance, which is not zzso We also show that zzso zzso several zzso growth factors in zzso and future studies are warranted to clarify the clinical significance of this zzso
