zzso zzso growth factor zzso a crucial promoter of blood vessel growth, not only stimulates zzso cell zzso migration and survival, but also increases vascular zzso The promotion of zzso is a well-known prerequisite for tumor growth, invasion and zzso Evidence has shown that zzso is zzso in many types of tumor zzso Small interfering zzso zzso targeting zzso may effectively suppress cell proliferation and induce zzso in tumor zzso In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso gastric cancer growth in zzso The zzso of zzso zzso into zzso human gastric cancer cells zzso the expression of zzso and zzso but zzso the expression of zzso In a nude mouse model of subcutaneous zzso 24 days after zzso zzso treatment, the tumor volume and weight were significantly smaller in the zzso zzso group compared to the control scrambled zzso zzso Furthermore, the expression of zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso was zzso whereas the expression of zzso and zzso was zzso in the tumor cells, indicating that zzso zzso induced zzso in gastric cancer cells by zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of downstream zzso while suppressing zzso and zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso targeting zzso offers a potential strategy to prevent the growth of gastric zzso
