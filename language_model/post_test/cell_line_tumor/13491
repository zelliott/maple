Gene chip technology can be used to identify and zzso signal zzso genes associated with zzso We used the human zzso zzso gene chip to detect differences in gene expression profiles among high zzso and low zzso zzso human zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso and normal zzso zzso zzso to identify zzso signal zzso genes and determine their zzso zzso A total of 37 signal zzso genes showed more than twofold differences in expression levels between the H and L zzso zzso cancer cell zzso of these, 21 genes were zzso zzso log ratio zzso and 16 genes were zzso zzso Most genes were located on zzso 1 (7 zzso zzso followed by zzso 8 (5 zzso zzso then zzso 6, 11, and 17 (3 genes each, zzso A total of 21 of the zzso expressed genes zzso were localized on the short arm of the zzso zzso The disruption of signal zzso gene expression may be an important factor associated with zzso cancer zzso The affected signal zzso genes were localized to zzso 1, 8, 6, 11, and zzso
