The great potential of zzso zzso for clinical application in cancer therapy is greatly limited due to its poor zzso The purpose of this study was to increase the water zzso of zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso as drug zzso The zzso zzso zzso were prepared by thin film zzso zzso The obtained zzso could be zzso into powder form, which could be zzso in water to form homogeneous zzso This study showed that zzso was successfully incorporated in the zzso structure of zzso zzso and maintained its zzso zzso The average particle size was zzso zzso zzso zzso and the mean zzso potential was zzso zzso zzso zzso The actual drug loading and zzso efficiency were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could be released from zzso zzso in a sustained manner in zzso The zzso profiles of zzso from zzso and zzso water saturated solution through excised mouse skin demonstrated that zzso showed much better zzso penetration performance than zzso water saturated zzso The prepared zzso have great potential for both direct zzso administration and being further developed as a zzso drug delivery system in cancer zzso
