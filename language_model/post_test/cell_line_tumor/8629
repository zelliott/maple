Nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso is of growing importance for discovery of human disease zzso Identification and validation of disease zzso using statistical significance analysis zzso is critical for translation to clinical zzso zzso is performed by assessing a zzso hypothesis test using a zzso of the zzso zzso test, zzso a Welch's zzso zzso Choosing how to correct the significance level for rejecting zzso hypotheses in the case of multiple testing to maintain a constant zzso type I error rate is a common problem in such zzso The multiple testing problem arises because the likelihood of falsely rejecting the zzso hypothesis, zzso a false positive, grows as the number of tests applied to the same data set zzso Several methods have been introduced to address this zzso zzso correction zzso assumes all variables are independent and therefore sacrifices sensitivity for detecting true zzso in partially dependent data zzso False discovery rate zzso methods are more sensitive than BC but zzso ascribe highest stringency to lowest p value zzso Here, we introduce standard zzso step down zzso which is more sensitive and appropriate than BC for partially dependent data zzso zzso and type I error rate of zzso can be adjusted based on the degree of variable zzso zzso generates fundamentally different profiles of critical p values compared with zzso methods potentially leading to reduced type II error zzso zzso is increasingly sensitive for more concentrated zzso zzso is demonstrated using zzso zzso data collected on three different breast cancer cell line zzso
