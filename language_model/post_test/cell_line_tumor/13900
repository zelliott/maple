zzso zzso is one of the zzso zzso zzso derived from cooked zzso In previous animal studies, spontaneous zzso formation in zzso mice was associated with zzso loss of the zzso zzso zzso by loss of the entire zzso 18 or by zzso The objective of this study was to examine genetic changes caused by zzso in a mouse zzso cell line and in zzso from hybrid mice by keeping track of the zzso carrying the two zzso zzso We transformed the zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso derived from the zzso mice by exposure to zzso and studied the effect on zzso status and zzso zzso zzso transformed cultures were obtained and all of them had retained the zzso zzso Five of seven transformed cultures were zzso after zzso in nude zzso zzso analysis of these five cultures and the parent zzso cell line showed that the zzso cells were zzso with an average of 77 zzso while the zzso cell cultures were all zzso to zzso with a range of zzso zzso The number of copies of zzso 18 was about four in the zzso line and this copy number was retained in the transformed lines derived from zzso Changes in zzso 18 and zzso during zzso development in zzso were examined in spontaneously formed and zzso zzso zzso from two hybrid mice zzso zzso zzso - a zzso zzso model - crossed with either zzso or zzso We evaluated the zzso status of zzso and the zzso zzso markers zzso and zzso located at the upper and lower ends of zzso 18, zzso In zzso from zzso animals, instability in the zzso and zzso was zzso Upon zzso exposure, the zzso hybrid mouse zzso differed distinctly in genetic profile from those obtained from zzso animals and we detected three genetically different zzso groups, all of which had apparently retained zzso One group had zzso balance between the zzso and zzso the second had zzso imbalance between the zzso and zzso zzso indicative of zzso stability in the first group and instability in the lower end of zzso 18 in the second group, zzso The third group showed variable zzso status of the three zzso A similar change in genetic profile was also seen in zzso zzso of zzso zzso hybrid mice, but it was less zzso zzso breaks and/or zzso events could be alternative explanations for the observed zzso imbalances in zzso 18 markers in zzso zzso from zzso zzso
