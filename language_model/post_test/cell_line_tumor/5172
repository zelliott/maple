A goal of personalized medicine as applied to zzso is to identify compounds that exploit a defined molecular zzso in a zzso zzso A compound called zzso compound 1 zzso was reported that enhances the activity of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso death in cancer cells in culture and in mouse zzso zzso Experimental evidence indicates that zzso activates zzso in zzso through zzso of zzso zinc zzso Described zzso is the synthesis and biological activity of a family of zzso derivatives where key functional groups have been systematically zzso Analysis of these compounds reveals a strong correlation between the in zzso zzso zzso effect and their ability to induce death in cancer cells in zzso zzso we also show that a zzso labeled version of zzso zzso with sites of zzso activity in cancer zzso The data presented zzso further bolster the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso in cancer cells through the direct zzso of zzso has implications for the design and discovery of next-generation zzso zzso compounds, and sheds light on the zzso role of cellular zzso
