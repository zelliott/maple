zzso completion of zzso requires the zzso regulation of protein zzso and the coordinated activity of protein zzso and zzso Many zzso protein zzso are well characterized while zzso zzso are largely zzso Here, we show that the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso in zzso cells, functioning specifically at the zzso zzso zzso zzso induce zzso in zzso cells and prolong the time cells spend connected via an extended zzso zzso Upon zzso influx during zzso zzso is zzso targeting a set of proteins for zzso including zzso II zzso At the zzso bridge, zzso and zzso are zzso to dual zzso zzso rings zzso that reside on either side of the central zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso of the zzso coincide with zzso Thus, zzso activity at the zzso plays a key role in regulating the completion of zzso in zzso zzso
