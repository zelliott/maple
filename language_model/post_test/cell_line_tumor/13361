zzso zzso acid zzso zzso are promising new single entity gene regulation materials capable of both cellular zzso and gene zzso but thus far are zzso structures, exhibiting excellent genetic but little cellular zzso In this communication, we describe a strategy to impart targeting capabilities to these zzso through zzso zzso with a complementary zzso zzso As a zzso we designed zzso zzso and demonstrated that such structures exhibit cell type selectivity in terms of their zzso and significantly greater gene zzso in cells zzso the target zzso as compared to the analogous zzso and zzso zzso
