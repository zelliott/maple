zzso promoter zzso is one of the major mechanisms in zzso and some critical growth regulatory genes have shown zzso in zzso across solid zzso Twenty-six zzso 14 identified through zzso in colon and breast zzso were evaluated using primary lung zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso former and never zzso zzso specificity of zzso was validated through comparison of 14 lung cancer cell lines to normal human zzso zzso cells derived from zzso of 20 zzso zzso Twenty-five genes were zzso in zzso of primary zzso zzso for zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was significantly higher in zzso from never smokers than zzso The relation between zzso of individual genes was examined using zzso zzso A significant association was seen between 138 zzso of the possible 325 zzso zzso Most notably, zzso of zzso zzso or zzso was significantly associated with zzso of zzso other zzso thus predicting for a widespread zzso zzso zzso zzso test and zzso hazard models identified a significant association between zzso of zzso (a pro-growth, zzso and zzso zzso and better patient survival zzso ratio zzso zzso These results demonstrate a high degree of zzso for targeted zzso of genes between lung and other solid tumors and suggest that promoter zzso in cancer is a highly zzso zzso
