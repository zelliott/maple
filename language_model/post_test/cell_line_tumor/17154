zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mediate long-term zzso expression in resting cells in zzso and in zzso because of low toxicity and zzso However, in zzso cells, expression is transient since zzso zzso do not possess elements that allow for replication and segregation of the zzso zzso to daughter zzso We developed a zzso zzso system that, under certain conditions, allows for significantly prolonged zzso maintenance of zzso zzso in zzso tissue culture cells, resulting in sustained zzso zzso After zzso of target cells the linear zzso zzso were zzso by the DNA zzso zzso which was expressed from the second zzso The zzso replication system derived from zzso virus, as well as the human replication origin from the zzso B2 zzso were used as zzso elements to test for replication of the zzso circular zzso zzso with or without selective zzso Depending on the system, up to zzso of the zzso zzso were zzso and zzso to daughter cells, as demonstrated by Southern zzso and as confirmed by monitoring zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, in the absence of zzso zzso a small but significant number of zzso zzso spontaneously zzso after zzso of target zzso These circles, found to contain zzso joined zzso zzso zzso with increased efficiency compared to zzso zzso by zzso After further improvements, this zzso system might be suitable for gene therapy applications requiring long-term zzso zzso
