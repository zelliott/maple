zzso zzso is a common treatment for advanced head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso zzso is the backbone of chemotherapy regimens used to treat zzso zzso the aim of this study was to identify zzso markers for zzso treatment outcome in zzso The intrinsic zzso sensitivity zzso was determined in a panel of zzso cell zzso From this panel, one sensitive and two resistant cell lines were selected for comparative transcript profiling using zzso zzso The enrichment of Gene zzso zzso categories in sensitive versus resistant cell lines were assessed using the Gene zzso Tree zzso zzso zzso In total, zzso transcripts were found to be zzso expressed and 11 GO categories were zzso zzso contributing to this enrichment were further analyzed using zzso zzso Analysis zzso for identification of key regulator zzso zzso recognized 20 key regulator genes of which five were zzso expressed in sensitive versus resistant cell zzso The zzso level of these five genes was further assessed in a panel of 25 zzso cell lines using quantitative real-time zzso Among these key regulators, zzso and zzso are implicated as potential zzso of zzso Taken together, zzso zzso analysis identified single zzso GO categories as well as molecular networks that are zzso expressed in zzso cell lines with different zzso Furthermore, two novel zzso zzso for zzso resistance, zzso and zzso were zzso
