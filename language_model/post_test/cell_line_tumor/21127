zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso type zzso with zzso zzso zzso was prepared by the dialysis zzso The drug loading content and zzso efficiency were determined by zzso The average size and its distribution were determined by dynamic light scattering zzso The zzso release rate in zzso from zzso was measured by zzso The cell zzso in zzso was observed with zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso zzso were evaluated in zzso test of nude mice using human liver cancer zzso The results indicated that zzso could be zzso in zzso zzso zzso and its size was in the range of zzso zzso which increased with an increase in molecular weight of zzso in zzso in zzso the zzso could be released zzso from the zzso In high concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso displayed much less cell zzso than zzso injections with zzso zzso ( zzso the tumor zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso was similar to that of zzso injections with zzso zzso in the same zzso zzso It was concluded that the zzso zzso zzso had more uniform size and size distribution, excellent drug zzso behavior, less zzso good zzso activity similar to zzso injections with zzso zzso So zzso zzso zzso would be a novel zzso preparation in clinic for the treatment of zzso
