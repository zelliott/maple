Although patients with localized and regional kidney tumors have a high survival rate, zzso of mortality significantly increases for patients with zzso zzso It is imperative to decipher the molecular mechanisms of kidney tumor migration and invasion in order to develop effective therapies for patients with advanced zzso zzso a small zzso zzso has been implicated in cancer cell growth and zzso Here, we profile migratory and invasive properties of commonly used zzso cell zzso zzso cell lines and correlate that with expression and function of the zzso zzso zzso We report that levels of zzso zzso correlate with invasion but not zzso We also report that forced zzso of zzso decreases invasion of zzso cells but does not impact their rate of zzso Low expression levels of zzso in zzso cells are due, at least in part, to promoter zzso Rescued expression of zzso with a zzso drug, zzso zzso decreases the zzso zzso cell invasion of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell lines express distinct levels of cell zzso proteins and the forced zzso of zzso attenuated levels of both zzso and zzso that are known to regulate the cancer cells zzso These results demonstrate that targeted restoration of zzso expression may serve as a potential therapeutic approach to reduce zzso of kidney zzso
