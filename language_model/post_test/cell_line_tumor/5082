zzso of zzso zzso zzso is implicated in the zzso of mantle cell zzso zzso The genetic change in zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso in zzso has not been zzso 

Thirty-five primary zzso cases and 2 zzso cell lines zzso and zzso were used to investigate zzso zzso and gene copy number of zzso Gene copy number was determined using quantitative real-time zzso and zzso in zzso zzso We used quantitative real-time reverse zzso to measure zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10 zzso and zzso zzso protein levels were analyzed using Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso was used to assess zzso after treatment of zzso cell lines and one control cell line with zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso 

Fifteen of 22 zzso zzso cases and the zzso cell lines zzso a gain zzso or zzso of zzso gene copy zzso In addition, cases with increased zzso gene copy number had elevated zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, amplification of zzso correlated with the status of zzso zzso in 7 of 12 zzso primary zzso zzso zzso of zzso induced increased zzso in the zzso cell zzso zzso protein expression was present in all 14 primary zzso cases and cell lines by Western zzso whereas 5 of 33 zzso cases tested by zzso had loss of zzso zzso 

We conclude that a gain of gene copy number of zzso is frequent genetic zzso that contributes to zzso zzso zzso is a promising therapeutic target in zzso
