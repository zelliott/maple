zzso an zzso zzso derived from the herbal zzso zzso has been recently reported to have zzso effects on a large variety of cancer zzso The present study was undertaken to investigate the in zzso zzso and zzso inducing effects of zzso on zzso cell lines and its mechanisms of zzso zzso cells in culture medium in zzso were treated with different zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to detect the cell growth zzso rate, and the cell viability was assessed by the zzso blue zzso zzso Cell zzso and the zzso membrane potential zzso zzso zzso were investigated by flow zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA fragmentation zzso The expression of zzso and different zzso zzso including zzso and zzso family members, was analyzed by Western zzso The results revealed that zzso could significantly inhibit the growth of zzso cells and cause zzso and the suppression was both zzso and zzso After treatment with zzso for 48 zzso the percentage of disruption of delta zzso m gradually increased in a zzso manner along with marked changes of cell zzso and zzso cells increased remarkably after the cells were treated with zzso for 72 zzso Western zzso showed zzso of the zzso zzso protein (32 zzso with the appearance of its zzso zzso when zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso was zzso remarkably while expression of zzso and Bid was zzso zzso after the cells were treated with zzso for 24 zzso Of note, the expressions of zzso and other zzso family members including zzso and Bad remained constant before and after zzso zzso We therefore conclude that zzso has significant zzso effects on zzso cells by induction of zzso as well as directly causing cell necrosis and that zzso zzso on zzso cells is mainly related to the disruption of delta zzso m and zzso of zzso as well as zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso of zzso proteins zzso and zzso The results indicate that zzso may serve as a potential zzso zzso
