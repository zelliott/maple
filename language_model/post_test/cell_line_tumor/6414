zzso a novel zzso agent, is reported to zzso stem cell zzso and have direct zzso activity as well as inhibit inflammation and zzso On the basis of this varied pharmacological profile, zzso is under investigation as a treatment for a range of zzso zzso 

zzso was evaluated against the zzso in zzso panel using zzso exposure at zzso ranging from 1 zzso to 10 zzso It was tested against the zzso in zzso panels at a dose of 30 zzso administered orally zzso once daily for a planned for 6 zzso 

In zzso activity was not observed at zzso up to 10 zzso zzso was well zzso and induced significant differences in zzso distribution compared to control in 7 of 37 zzso of the zzso solid tumor zzso and in 0 of 8 zzso of the zzso ALL zzso The best response in the solid tumor panel was zzso zzso disease with growth delay zzso zzso zzso zzso observed in 4 of 37 zzso solid tumor zzso A single ALL zzso showed a zzso zzso 

zzso zzso effects of zzso were not observed in zzso In zzso zzso demonstrated low activity against tumors in zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso utility in the pediatric clinical setting may depend upon its ability to induce zzso activity through effects on host immune and zzso cells rather than through direct effects on tumor zzso
