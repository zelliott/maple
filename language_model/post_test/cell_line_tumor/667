The zzso and the zzso systems are two zzso zzso mechanisms for degrading zzso zzso They are functionally coupled and suppression of the zzso promotes zzso Although suppression of the zzso leads to cell death, suppression of zzso can be either zzso or zzso To understand the underlining mechanism of this zzso and its potential clinical zzso we treated various transformed and zzso human cells with zzso zzso We found that whether zzso served a zzso role in this scenario was contingent on the cellular zzso zzso Thus, zzso suppression enhanced zzso induced by zzso zzso in transformed cells, but not in zzso zzso zzso transformation enhanced the ability of cells to initiate zzso in response to stress, reflecting a stronger dependence of transformed cells on zzso for zzso Indeed, a combined use of zzso the only Food and Drug zzso zzso inhibitor for clinical use, and zzso which zzso zzso by disturbing zzso functions, suppressed tumor growth more significantly than either agent alone in a zzso zzso These findings indicate that suppression of both zzso degradation systems could constitute a novel strategy for enhanced cancer control in a zzso zzso
