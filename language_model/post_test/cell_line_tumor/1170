The risks for developing breast zzso and dying from the disease increase with zzso zzso from breast zzso usually is due to zzso zzso zzso cells are able to invade into the vascular tissue in a growth zzso zzso Because breast zzso mortality increases with age, examination of breast zzso interactions with young and aged zzso cells is zzso 

We studied a series of breast zzso cells zzso zzso that exhibited either zzso characteristics zzso zzso or zzso growth factor zzso invasive characteristics zzso zzso 

Increased invasion of zzso cells was observed across an aged rat brain zzso zzso cell zzso zzso that was isolated from aged rats (24 zzso compared with young rats (age 1 zzso This increased invasion was inhibited by the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso and by the zzso zzso zzso zzso To analyze further the contribution of zzso B-2 to the zzso invasion of zzso cells, zzso cells were treated with the zzso zzso therapeutic zzso zzso and with the specific inhibitor zzso and were then zzso for zzso Both zzso led to a significant decrease in zzso zzso zzso B-2 expression was found to be elevated in zzso cells ( approximately zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso However, treatment of zzso cells with the specific zzso B-2 zzso zzso failed to inhibit zzso signaling to zzso zzso or zzso zzso 1 and zzso 

The current study findings indicate that aging of zzso may contribute to the invasive zzso of breast zzso cells and that zzso between zzso B-2 and zzso zzso is required for the zzso of these cells into the surrounding zzso
