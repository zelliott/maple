We have previously demonstrated that spontaneous DNA synthesis in immature zzso of zzso mice is zzso and that treatment with the zzso zzso zzso zzso this increased DNA synthesis and prevents the development of zzso zzso zzso of zzso may drive the uncontrolled proliferation of zzso zzso since zzso of zzso parallels the elevated DNA synthesis in the zzso In this study, we show that the zzso zzso zzso is expressed at high levels in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso cells, although serum zzso zzso levels in zzso mice are similar to those in zzso zzso In cultured zzso zzso zzso cells treated with zzso zzso nuclear zzso occurs, resulting in suppression of DNA synthesis and zzso expression at both the zzso and protein zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso zzso also causes zzso nuclear zzso but does not affect DNA synthesis and zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso As expected, zzso reverses the zzso effects of zzso on DNA synthesis and zzso zzso Administration of zzso to zzso mice decreases the elevated zzso protein levels in their zzso These findings suggest that zzso signaling plays an important role in regulating zzso expression in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
