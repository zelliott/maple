It is well established that zzso are essential for local inflammation including cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a critical factor in wound healing, tumor zzso and zzso zzso the aim of the present work was to evaluate effects by zzso on tumor vascular density at early onset of tumor growth where zzso is zzso zzso mice zzso zzso bearing either zzso tumors or a zzso melanoma zzso with either high or insignificant zzso production and subsequently different in sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso was estimated by zzso zzso and immune zzso analysis in wild type and zzso or zzso zzso zzso knockout mice zzso Both zzso and zzso tumor cells zzso early outgrowth of tumor vessels in proportion to intrinsic growth rate of tumor zzso zzso had no effects on tumor growth or tumor related vascular area in zzso bearing zzso By contrast, zzso decreased tumor cell proliferation and increased zzso in zzso tumors with subsequent adaptation in tumor vascular zzso zzso of zzso on early growth of zzso tumors were not related to tumor content of zzso zzso while our earlier studies on long-term tumor growth have shown decreased zzso levels of zzso during zzso zzso Early onset of tumor growth was significantly promoted in zzso but not in zzso although long-term tumor growth is attenuated in zzso as reported zzso Our results demonstrate that tumor production of zzso promotes primarily net growth of tumor cells with subsequent adaptations in development of the tumor zzso zzso it is likely that zzso is not a limiting step at the early onset of tumor zzso
