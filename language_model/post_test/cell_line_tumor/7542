zzso zzso are well-known as zzso and environmentally acceptable zzso In this study, a series of zzso zzso zzso compounds with different degrees of zzso were used to prepare zzso zzso for a poorly zzso drug zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso acid zzso and in zzso zzso zzso and zzso efficacy of zzso delivered by zzso zzso were zzso The area under the plasma concentration time curve zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso times higher than that of zzso solution and zzso zzso solution, zzso In addition, the mean residence time zzso was increased zzso and zzso respectively and the total body clearance zzso was reduced zzso and zzso zzso The zzso study indicated that most of the zzso in the zzso group was distributed in the liver and there was delayed liver zzso compared with the zzso solution and zzso zzso solution zzso Furthermore, the zzso efficacy of zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated in in zzso zzso models involving mice zzso with the human gastric cancer cell line zzso At the same dose of zzso the zzso zzso group demonstrated a better tumor growth zzso and induced differentiation than the groups given zzso solution and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso appear to be a potentially useful drug delivery system for zzso and suitable for the chemotherapy of gastric zzso
