zzso zzso plays a prominent role in cancer zzso zzso constitute a majority of the zzso cells in zzso and yet the functional contributions of these cells to tumor zzso and invasion are poorly zzso especially the zzso drug interference to these zzso To estimate the effects of zzso zzso on zzso tumor invasion and zzso we evaluated the response of zzso and human zzso vein zzso cell zzso migration, tube formation in zzso as well as zzso formation of rat zzso zzso rings to hypoxic zzso zzso medium zzso by zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso significantly inhibited zzso and zzso migration and zzso induced by hypoxic zzso zzso We also showed that hypoxic zzso CM zzso had a higher level of zzso zzso factor 1 zzso zzso while zzso zzso the zzso expression in zzso and zzso This increased activity of zzso zzso was clearly attenuated by zzso zzso It was further found that zzso zzso and zzso with zzso a zzso zzso markedly reversed the zzso promoting cell migration and zzso while adding zzso zzso attenuated the zzso effects of CM collected from zzso hypoxic zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso indirectly decreased zzso migration and zzso through its effect on hypoxic zzso via zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso could interrupt the influence of zzso on zzso and zzso to exert an zzso zzso zzso zzso should be taken into consideration when evaluating and developing zzso zzso
