zzso zzso channel expression in the plasma membrane is characteristic for many tumor entities and has been attributed to zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso and therapy zzso The present study aimed to define the function of these zzso channels for zzso of leukemia zzso zzso zzso leukemia cells were zzso zzso X zzso zzso channel expression and activity, zzso and protein zzso cell cycle zzso and cell survival were assessed by quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction, zzso recording, zzso zzso zzso flow zzso and zzso survival zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso arrest was preceded by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Channel zzso in turn resulted in enhanced zzso entry and subsequent zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso channel zzso by zzso and zzso zzso and zzso or zzso by zzso interference led to release from zzso zzso arrest, increased zzso and decreased zzso zzso Together, these findings indicate the functional significance of zzso zzso channels for the zzso of zzso leukemia zzso
