zzso often show characteristics similar to those of neural stem cells in zzso and in zzso However, few zzso cell lines that exhibit neural stem zzso properties have been zzso In this study, we have characterized a novel cell line, designated zzso established from zzso that arose in mice zzso zzso with human BK zzso zzso zzso cells in nude mice zzso expressed viral large T zzso in the nucleus and zzso zzso and zzso marker proteins in zzso zzso individual zzso cells in dispersed cultures simultaneously expressed marker proteins of neural stem cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression of these zzso marker proteins was also observed in cloned zzso zzso The zzso cells formed zzso zzso when cultured in the presence of growth zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that expression of zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein significantly increased in zzso cells cultured under growth zzso zzso Among zzso zzso zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) and zzso were expressed in the zzso cells, in which neither zzso nor zzso was zzso These results suggest that this zzso zzso cell line zzso the gene expression profile in zzso cells undergoing zzso zzso
