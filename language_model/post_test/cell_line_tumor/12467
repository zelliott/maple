Clinical experiences often document, that a successful tumor control requires high doses of drug zzso It is widely believed that unavoidable adverse reactions could be minimized by using zzso strategies protecting the zzso healthy tissue as well as the zzso One new approach in this direction is the use of zzso zzso realizing a selective drug targeting to gain zzso amounts at the target site, even with drastically reduced application zzso zzso breast cancer cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso are considered as appropriate candidates for such a targeted zzso The zzso composed zzso carrier consisting of different units designed to facilitate the passage across the cell zzso and for zzso addressing of diagnostic and/or therapeutic molecules could be considered as an eligible delivery zzso Here we used the zzso zzso as a carrier for zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso realizing local zzso zzso sufficient for cell zzso The zzso values are 12 zzso in the case of zzso and 100 zzso for zzso zzso which confirms the advantage of zzso zzso to realize local zzso sufficient for cell zzso Our paper focuses on the design, synthesis and application of the zzso zzso composed of the zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso to the zzso drug zzso The zzso was carried out by the zzso zzso zzso with inverse electron demand zzso
