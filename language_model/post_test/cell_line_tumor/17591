zzso zzso induce cell cycle arrest and zzso in zzso leukemia zzso To investigate cell cycle effects of zzso in the absence of obscuring zzso events, we used human zzso leukemia cells protected from cell death by transgenic zzso zzso treatment arrested these cells in the zzso phase of the cell cycle due to repression of zzso D3 and zzso zzso E and zzso protein levels remained high, but the zzso complex was inactive due to increased levels of bound zzso zzso expression of zzso D3 and/or zzso was sufficient to prevent zzso zzso arrest and zzso zzso but, importantly, did not interfere with the induction of zzso The combined data suggest that repression of both, zzso and zzso zzso is necessary to arrest human leukemia cells in the zzso phase of the cell division cycle, but that neither one is required for zzso zzso
