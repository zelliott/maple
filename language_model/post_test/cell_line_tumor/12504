The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso on cell viability and diagnostic yield zzso marker zzso using flow zzso and human zzso cells in zzso 

zzso human zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso line) were allocated into five study groups in zzso Park Memorial Institute zzso By using manual zzso cells were then processed by aspiration alone, by zzso zzso at 600 cuts per minute zzso and 1,500 zzso or by zzso zzso at both 600 and 1,500 zzso To assess cell viability and cell surface marker zzso samples underwent standard flow zzso analysis for suspected zzso using zzso D and zzso against zzso zzso zzso and zzso light zzso 

Twenty-five samples were processed after being divided into four zzso groups and one zzso group zzso The mean cell viability was zzso for both the zzso and zzso zzso The percentage of cells positive for zzso or zzso light chain was the same in the zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the level of expression of these molecules was not significantly different in all five zzso Similarly, no difference was seen for these markers between zzso and zzso zzso at either a cut rate of 600 or 1,500 zzso The percentage positive for zzso was significantly lower for the zzso zzso at 1,500 zzso compared with the zzso zzso at both 600 and 1,500 zzso Percentage of zzso cells was greater for the zzso zzso at 600 zzso than the zzso zzso 

Compared with simple zzso both zzso and zzso zzso seem to have no significant effect on cell viability or diagnostic yield for zzso zzso cells zzso cell line) in suspension based on flow zzso Further studies need to be conducted to study and compare zzso versus zzso zzso on zzso cells in human zzso or in an animal zzso
