zzso a member of the class II small zzso zzso family, regulates the assembly and diameter of collagen fibers in the zzso zzso of various zzso We previously reported that zzso expression in the zzso zzso of pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso with tumor invasion, and tends to correlate with poor zzso zzso stimulates growth and zzso the invasion of a zzso cell zzso In the present study, we performed a global shotgun zzso analysis using zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso cells to identify candidate proteins that are regulated by zzso and related to cell growth and invasion in zzso zzso A total of zzso proteins were identified from zzso zzso and control zzso Additionally, zzso proteins were identified from zzso zzso cells and control zzso As a result of zzso based on spectral zzso 174 zzso expressed proteins were identified by zzso zzso and 143 zzso expressed proteins were identified by zzso zzso The expression levels of 24 zzso including zzso and zzso proteins correlated with zzso expression zzso It is likely that the expression of these proteins is regulated by zzso and that they are involved in zzso and invasion in zzso These findings suggest that zzso may be involved in cell growth and invasion through the regulation of these 24 proteins expressed in zzso
