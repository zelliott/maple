Human zzso cell zzso zzso zzso is zzso in many zzso zzso zzso have shown promise in zzso studies, but showed no tumor zzso in a recent phase II clinical zzso zzso we generated a novel zzso zzso zzso and assessed whether it showed enhanced zzso zzso 

Chemical zzso was conducted to zzso zzso zzso a toxin known to inhibit DNA transcription, with zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso to generate the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso was tested in human pancreatic zzso and zzso zzso zzso breast zzso and zzso duct zzso cancer cell lines in zzso using zzso incorporation zzso zzso activity of zzso was assessed in zzso in zzso mice bearing subcutaneous human zzso pancreatic zzso zzso tumors zzso zzso 66 zzso Cell proliferation and zzso were evaluated in zzso tumors by zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

In all cell lines, zzso reduced cell proliferation zzso half zzso zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso A single dose of zzso inhibited zzso zzso tumor growth zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso dose of 15 zzso with respect to zzso and 50 zzso with respect to zzso mean relative increase in tumor volume on day 16 zzso zzso zzso zzso difference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso Two higher doses of zzso zzso zzso with respect to zzso administered 1 week apart zzso zzso 10 mice per group), led to complete tumor zzso in nine of 10 zzso mice compared with zzso during the observation period of 16 zzso increased zzso and reduced cell proliferation were observed in mice treated with zzso 

This zzso study suggests that zzso zzso zzso with zzso have the potential to be highly effective therapeutic agents for pancreatic zzso and various zzso zzso
