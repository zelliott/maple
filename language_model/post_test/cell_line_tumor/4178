zzso gene zzso regulatory networks is critical to deciphering the molecular mechanisms of different cellular zzso Most studies focus on zzso zzso zzso In the current study, we used the zzso system as a model to understand the dynamics of zzso networks composed of zzso factors zzso and target genes zzso The hormone zzso activates and stimulates signaling pathways leading to various cellular states through zzso zzso zzso of zzso can result in zzso tumors, for zzso However, the regulatory networks involving zzso are highly complex, and the roles of most of the components of these networks are zzso We used time series zzso data of zzso zzso cells treated with zzso combined with zzso zzso relationships integrated from different sources, and we reconstructed the dynamic activities of zzso using network component analysis zzso Based on the peak expression of zzso and activity of zzso we created active zzso at four time ranges after zzso treatment, namely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and very late zzso Network analysis revealed that the active zzso were zzso different at the early and late time zzso Gene zzso analysis unveiled that each active zzso was highly enriched in a particular biological zzso Interestingly, network motif patterns were also distinct between the zzso This analysis can be applied to other time series zzso zzso focusing on smaller zzso that are activated in a zzso allowing better overview of the mechanisms involved at each time zzso
