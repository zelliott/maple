zzso the most common zzso tumor of childhood, is derived from neural crest zzso cells that fail to differentiate along their zzso route to sympathetic zzso or zzso adrenal zzso Although expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is of major importance in zzso the significance of the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso Here, we analyzed zzso expression of zzso on a tissue zzso of 93 primary zzso tumors and assessed the functional consequences of zzso expression in zzso cell zzso We found the zzso zzso protein to be expressed in zzso cells of zzso as well as zzso zzso but not in poorly differentiated zzso In an unrelated cohort of 110 zzso tumors, zzso zzso expression levels correlated with zzso and patients with tumors that expressed zzso at high levels had an increased zzso and overall zzso In addition, we did not detect zzso expression in 8 established zzso cell lines examined with zzso zzso These cell lines exhibited an zzso zzso and were all derived from aggressive, zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso cell line significantly reduced zzso increased the fraction of zzso cells in zzso and resulted in a loss of zzso in nude zzso Taken together, our data suggest that expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is correlated with a reduced level of zzso and that induction of zzso expression may be an option to zzso features of an aggressive tumor zzso
