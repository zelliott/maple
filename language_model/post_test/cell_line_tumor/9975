To zzso short term and long term X-ray zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso of zzso melanoma cells in zzso and zzso in zzso 

zzso melanoma cells were zzso with different doses of X-ray zzso zzso zzso in the range from zzso zzso One, two and three days respectively 7, 14 and 21 days after treatment cells were zzso concerning cell growth, zzso zzso cell cycle distribution, zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso the capability of the cells for in zzso zzso was zzso 

As short term response on zzso we detected decreased cell growth, viability and arrest in the zzso phase of the cell zzso Long term response involves zzso of zzso increased cell growth and zzso zzso but still decreased viability and zzso acid zzso In zzso zzso is lost immediately after zzso and regained to a low extent beyond two weeks time for recurrence of cells before zzso 

In zzso data suggest that surviving melanoma cells compensate the initial zzso damage of proliferation within three weeks possibly by increase in zzso zzso For zzso in zzso the role of additional mechanisms is strongly zzso
