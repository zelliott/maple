Despite advances in surgical and medical therapies, approximate 50% survival rate of head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso has had marginal improvement in the last 30 zzso zzso alternative strategies are required for the management of zzso Here, we report the zzso effect of zzso on zzso cells using in zzso and in zzso zzso Treatment of human zzso cell lines from different zzso such as oral cavity zzso zzso zzso tongue zzso and zzso zzso with grape seed zzso zzso reduced their cell viability and induced cell death in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of cell viability was associated with: zzso zzso arrest, zzso zzso of expressions of zzso zzso D1 and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso increased expression of the zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso enhanced binding of zzso zzso to zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly ( zzso increased zzso of zzso and zzso cells with induction of zzso reduced expression of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso also reduced the expression of zzso growth factor zzso zzso and treatment of zzso cells with zzso an zzso small zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly ( zzso reduced cell viability and increased cell zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso in supplementation with zzso control diet inhibited the growth of zzso tumor zzso in zzso nude mice, which was associated with: zzso zzso of cell zzso zzso induction of zzso of tumor zzso cells, zzso decreased expression of zzso and zzso zzso decreased expression of zzso and zzso increased expression of zzso and zzso proteins and their increased binding to zzso in tumor zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso may be a promising candidate for head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso
