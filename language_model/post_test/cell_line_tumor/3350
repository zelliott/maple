Despite the potential of the inhibitor of zzso proteins zzso to block zzso zzso zzso zzso the critical function of zzso in regulating zzso zzso remains zzso We report that the ability of zzso zzso to effectively regulate zzso zzso depends on the differentiation state of the zzso Despite being expressed at equivalent levels, zzso zzso afforded no protection against zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells, but were remarkably effective in doing so in zzso differentiated zzso zzso differentiation was also accompanied with a marked reduction in zzso resulting in a significant decrease in zzso zzso zzso this decrease in zzso protein was directly linked to the increased ability of zzso to zzso regulate zzso in zzso differentiated zzso and primary zzso These data illustrate specifically how the zzso zzso acquires increased regulation with cellular zzso and are the first to show that zzso function and zzso activity are coupled in zzso
