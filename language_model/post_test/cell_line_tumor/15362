Studies have shown that the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso and zzso binding cassette zzso proteins is associated with zzso and poor prognosis in colon zzso However, molecular regulation mechanism of the three proteins has not been zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso and zzso in colon cancer cells by binding to both the zzso region and the coding sequences of the three zzso The zzso was markedly decreased in colon cancer zzso in which it was zzso correlated with the expression of zzso zzso and zzso Reduction of zzso zzso to poor differentiation and bigger tumor size in colon zzso Moreover, zzso levels were reduced in cells that formed spheres compared to cells that were cultured in regular zzso zzso of zzso mimics in colon cancer cells zzso zzso D1 zzso induced zzso phase cell cycle arrest, and elevated the sensitivity of the cells to zzso Furthermore, zzso suppressed zzso and zzso of the zzso promoter was associated with a reduction in zzso Finally, the zzso inhibited the growth of colon cancer cells in zzso which was accompanied by the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in tumor zzso Our results zzso a novel regulation zzso in colon cancer cells and suggest a potential therapeutic approach for colon cancer zzso
