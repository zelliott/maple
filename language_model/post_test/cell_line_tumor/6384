zzso killer zzso cells are a subset of zzso cells capable of zzso freshly isolated tumor zzso While zzso activity is typically measured using the zzso zzso here we used a zzso flow zzso method to demonstrate zzso zzso zzso zzso peripheral blood zzso cells zzso were zzso in zzso with zzso human zzso 2 zzso to generate zzso zzso An zzso tumor cell line, zzso labeled with zzso zzso zzso zzso was used as target zzso Following incubation of the targets with different zzso of zzso cells, zzso V was added to identify the early zzso zzso With increasing zzso to target cell ratios, zzso zzso was zzso We also measured zzso zzso B and zzso zzso expression in the zzso cell cultures as possible surrogate markers for zzso cell activity and found zzso B zzso expression correlated best with zzso zzso Also, we found that the reduced zzso activity of young horses was associated with decreased zzso B zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso detection of zzso cell activity provides a suitable zzso alternative to zzso zzso and zzso expression of zzso B can be used as surrogate marker for these zzso zzso
