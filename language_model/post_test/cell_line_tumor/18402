In a process seeking out a good model cell line for zzso virus zzso gastric cancer, we found that one previously established gastric zzso cell line is infected with type 1 zzso This zzso cell line from a Korean patient expressed zzso without zzso or zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso were zzso while zzso and zzso were zzso None of the tested zzso zzso proteins were detected in this cell line unless zzso with zzso zzso zzso infection was also shown in the original zzso tissue of zzso cell zzso Our results support the possibility of a zzso zzso infection of gastric zzso cells in zzso As the zzso zzso gene expression pattern of zzso closely resembles that of the zzso gastric cancer, this naturally derived cell line may serve as a valuable model system to clarify the precise role of zzso in gastric zzso
