We have previously found that expression of zzso was remarkably zzso in multiple tumor zzso but unclear in zzso zzso zzso and its function has not been explored zzso In the present study, to uncover the underlying mechanism of zzso in the zzso and development of zzso we investigated the expression pattern of zzso and its effect on tumor proliferation in zzso The results indicated the frequent zzso of zzso in clinic samples and cell lines of zzso resulted from promoter zzso as well as genetic zzso Furthermore, treatment of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells with the zzso agent zzso zzso restored its zzso zzso of zzso suppressed the proliferation of zzso cells in zzso and in zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso by zzso significantly enhanced these zzso zzso zzso could enhance zzso of zzso cells to zzso and zzso zzso to these results, the expression of zzso and zzso D1 were zzso whereas zzso and zzso were increased in zzso zzso We also demonstrated that zzso of zzso resulted in zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso Moreover, the effect of the decreased cell growth rate was significantly reversed when zzso cells were zzso with zzso or zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso is a tumor zzso by zzso regulating zzso tumor growth and zzso of zzso cells via increasing zzso and zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso may be a potential target for zzso zzso
