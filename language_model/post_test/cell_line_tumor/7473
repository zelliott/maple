The viability of cells cultured in zzso for drug screening purposes is usually tested with a variety of zzso zzso In this work we propose an alternative way of assessing cell zzso sensor array that can be connected in series with cell zzso as compatible detection zzso It is zzso that the presented device is capable of zzso effect detection and zzso of cell viability after treatment with zzso and zzso which proves that it can be used for truly zzso fast, reliable, continuous cell culture monitoring in zzso
