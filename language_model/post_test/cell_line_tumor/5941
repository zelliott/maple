zzso of the Sonic zzso zzso zzso and increased expression of zzso play an important role in proliferation and transformation of zzso cell zzso zzso in the developing zzso zzso arising from zzso zzso are frequently driven by zzso zzso zzso however, molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso and transformation of neural zzso remain poorly zzso We report that the zzso factor and zzso zzso zzso is directly induced by zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso was sufficient to induce zzso and zzso cell proliferation in the absence of zzso zzso In addition, enforced expression of zzso increased transformation of zzso cells in zzso and in zzso Analysis of potential zzso targets in neural cells revealed a novel zzso target, zzso a zzso factor known to play a role in zzso zzso proliferation and zzso zzso We found that zzso directly induced zzso of zzso in human zzso cells and that depletion of zzso zzso the zzso proliferation and zzso Taken together, these results provide further insight into the mechanism of zzso transformation of neural zzso cells and suggest that induction of zzso may serve to amplify the zzso potential of zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso
