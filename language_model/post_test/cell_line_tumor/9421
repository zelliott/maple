zzso is a fascinating member of the inhibitor of zzso protein zzso family with its dual roles in zzso and zzso and emerges as an attractive target for cancer zzso Multiple myeloma zzso is a plasma cell zzso characterized by zzso zzso zzso processes and fatal zzso We thus investigated zzso expression in myeloma cells and its role in zzso biology to evaluate its potential interest as a target in zzso zzso Our results describe the zzso zzso of zzso in myeloma cells and show a significant correlation between zzso expression at protein level and clinical course of zzso Moreover, zzso zzso by zzso interference led to growth rate zzso of myeloma cells related to zzso induction and deep zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso myeloma cells to conventional zzso zzso Altogether, these data argue for the interest to evaluate zzso zzso in zzso zzso
