Signaling through the zzso for zzso growth factor zzso zzso is frequently zzso in solid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Pharmaceuticals, zzso Melville, zzso is a low molecular weight, orally zzso inhibitor of the zzso that has been approved for both zzso cell lung cancer and pancreatic zzso Previous studies have indicated that sensitivity to zzso zzso correlated with zzso signaling for zzso cell lung zzso zzso we have sought to understand the signaling pathways that mediate zzso sensitivity for pancreatic and zzso zzso In a panel of 12 pancreatic tumor cell lines, we find that zzso is zzso with zzso in all cell lines sensitive to zzso but not in insensitive cell zzso zzso can block zzso zzso in these sensitive cell lines, suggesting that zzso is zzso by zzso zzso of zzso in zzso an zzso pancreatic tumor cell line, results in zzso of the zzso for both zzso and zzso and is associated with a decrease in cell proliferation and reduced sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso mediates zzso signaling and can contribute to zzso sensitivity for pancreatic zzso We extended our analysis to a panel of 13 zzso tumor cell lines and find that, like zzso zzso is zzso with zzso in the most zzso cell lines but not in zzso cell zzso These studies suggest that zzso could be used as a zzso to select patients who are most likely to respond to zzso zzso
