zzso transport is essential for many zzso zzso including zzso In zzso cells zzso cholesterol transport is controlled by a protein complex that includes zzso acute regulatory protein zzso Star is expressed as zzso zzso and zzso transcripts that differ only in their zzso zzso Because these transcripts share the same promoter, zzso stability may be involved in their differential regulation and zzso Recently, the identification of natural zzso transcripts zzso has added another level of regulation to zzso gene zzso Here we identified a new zzso that is complementary to the spliced Star zzso zzso Using zzso and 3' zzso zzso zzso and zzso protection zzso we demonstrated that Star zzso is expressed in zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we established that human zzso zzso stimulates Star zzso expression via zzso Our results show that zzso Star zzso may be zzso regulated since they are zzso in zzso zzso zzso of Star zzso had a differential effect on the expression of the different Star sense transcripts following zzso zzso Meanwhile, the levels of zzso protein and zzso production were zzso in the presence of Star zzso Our data identify zzso zzso as an additional mechanism involved in the regulation of steroid zzso
