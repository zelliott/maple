To study the effect of sodium zzso on the zzso of nude mice with human gastric zzso 

zzso mice zzso models of human gastric cancer were established by injecting gastric zzso cell zzso into zzso zzso of zzso and zzso labeling by zzso in human gastric cancer cells were measured by zzso 

zzso scores of zzso in medium dose and high dose group with sodium zzso treatment were lower than those in low dose and control group zzso zzso zzso There was no significant difference between medium dose and high dose group or low dose and control group zzso zzso zzso zzso values in medium and high dose group with sodium zzso treatment were lower than those in low dose and control group zzso zzso zzso but there was no significant difference between medium dose and high dose group zzso zzso zzso 

sodium zzso can inhibit the growth of the tumor by zzso zzso expression of the zzso cell and the zzso of the zzso
