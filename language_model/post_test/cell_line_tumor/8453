The majority of pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso which contributes to enhanced zzso invasion, and zzso However, the zzso regulatory network is still zzso Here, we investigated the regulation of a panel of zzso factors and explored the potential of zzso zzso treatment in zzso 

The expression and functional regulation of the zzso factors zzso zzso and the zzso zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso leukemia zzso factor 1 zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso were studied in pancreatic cancer cell lines, patient tumor samples, and zzso pancreatic cancer mouse zzso 

We found that zzso is zzso in pancreatic cancer and is involved in an intricate zzso regulatory loop with zzso which zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso repression leads to zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso zzso axis leads to increased zzso zzso of zzso in pancreatic cancer cells results in reduced tumor growth, zzso and increased survival through direct targeting zzso zzso and zzso Most interestingly, reduced levels of zzso in human tissue samples are associated with zzso of these zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso and predict poor zzso zzso zzso expression links this tumor network signature and zzso poor patient zzso High zzso zzso the network and predicts better prognosis and increased zzso 

zzso acts as a central tumor zzso and zzso the molecular makeup of a critical zzso in pancreatic cancer, indicating a potential zzso marker signature and the therapeutic potential of attacking this zzso network through a central vantage zzso
