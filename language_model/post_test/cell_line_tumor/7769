We have previously reported that zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso against zzso possessed a strong zzso activity in various tumor cells, via induction of zzso and zzso signaling zzso The present study further demonstrates that zzso oxygen species zzso were generated in abundance in zzso leukemia cells upon zzso stimulation and that zzso zzso subsequently evoked sustained zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso loss of zzso membrane potential, and release of zzso G zzso zzso from zzso into the zzso The reducing agent, zzso zzso effectively inhibited the sustained zzso of zzso release of zzso G, and cell death in zzso cells treated by zzso Moreover, a zzso form of zzso (but not of zzso enhanced zzso zzso suppressed zzso recruitment in zzso signaling complexes zzso and reduced adverse effects on zzso thereby zzso zzso cell death in zzso leukemia zzso These data provide novel information on the zzso cell zzso zzso and may shed new light on effective strategies for leukemia and solid tumor zzso
