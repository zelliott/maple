zzso of zzso zzso the proliferation and expression of transformed zzso in several cell types, including breast cancer zzso zzso has been shown to act as a zzso factor in many types of cancer zzso In the present work, we have studied the impact of zzso zzso on zzso proliferation of breast cancer zzso Here we report that treatment of zzso zzso negative human breast cancer cell line zzso with zzso or zzso zzso agents has positive and negative effects on cell zzso zzso Surprisingly, we find that zzso strongly zzso the zzso action of zzso zzso agents, by zzso to cell cycle arrest at zzso phase and inducing zzso zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso completely prevented the zzso effects induced by the combination between zzso and zzso zzso zzso The above zzso effects were paralleled by the decrease of zzso D1 and A and by the increase of inhibitor zzso cell cycle regulating protein zzso In these conditions we found also a strong decrease of zzso zzso protein zzso Altogether, our data extend the evidence of zzso zzso as a growth zzso system and of zzso as a growth promoting factor in breast cancer zzso zzso our results suggest that when zzso levels are increased, zzso drives cells towards zzso and that targeting both zzso levels and zzso zzso might represent a simple novel way for therapeutic intervention in breast zzso
