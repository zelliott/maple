zzso zzso such as zzso represent a well known class of zzso zzso agents that generally interfere with DNA synthesis and inhibit zzso zzso But in addition, these zzso molecules often display secondary effects on other zzso pathways including protein zzso In order to identify novel zzso drugs, we evaluated the mechanism of action of a novel series of zzso and zzso As expected, these molecules were found to interact with DNA and inhibit the zzso zzso DNA zzso Interestingly when tested on human zzso cells either sensitive zzso or resistant zzso to zzso II zzso these molecules proved zzso against the two cell lines, suggesting that they do not only rely on zzso II zzso to exert their zzso zzso In order to identify alternative targets, we tested the capacity of zzso zzso to inhibit the zzso zzso Four zzso inhibited the zzso in zzso with zzso values up to 40 times lower than that of the reference zzso inhibitor zzso Moreover, unlike zzso zzso used as reference zzso for the zzso these new zzso compounds demonstrated a good selectivity towards the zzso when tested against four unrelated zzso A cellular zzso based on the degradation of a zzso protein zzso indicated that at least two of the zzso maintained this zzso zzso activity in a cellular zzso This is the first report of zzso that demonstrate dual zzso II and zzso zzso zzso This new dual activity could represent a novel zzso approach to circumvent certain forms of zzso zzso
