zzso pollution is a major public health concern because zzso studies have demonstrated that exposure to particles is associated with respiratory diseases and lung zzso zzso exhaust particles zzso which is classified as a human zzso zzso zzso are considered a major contributor to zzso particulate matter zzso in urban zzso zzso consists of various compounds, including zzso and metals which are the principal components that contribute to the toxicity of zzso The present study aimed to investigate effects of PM on induction of zzso DNA damage and inflammation by using zzso in zzso and in human exposed to PM in the zzso Human zzso zzso zzso were treated with zzso zzso zzso at various zzso zzso zzso to compare the extent of responses with zzso zzso cells zzso zzso generation was determined in each cell cycle phase of zzso cells in order to investigate the influence of the cell cycle stage on induction of zzso zzso The zzso DNA damage was determined by measurement of zzso zzso whereas the inflammatory responses were determined by zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso Clara cell protein zzso and lung zzso zzso zzso The results showed that zzso zzso and zzso cells had a similar pattern of zzso responses to zzso in terms of particle zzso zzso generation with highest level found in zzso phase, zzso formation, and induction of zzso and zzso zzso The human study was conducted in 51 healthy subjects residing in zzso zzso The effects of exposure to zzso and zzso zzso and toxic metals on the levels of zzso in zzso DNA, zzso expression in zzso and serum zzso were zzso zzso levels correlated with the exposure levels of zzso ( zzso and zzso ( zzso but this was not the case with zzso zzso zzso showed significantly negative correlations with zzso equivalent ( zzso levels, but positive correlation with zzso ( zzso In conclusion, a similar pattern of the zzso responses to zzso in the zzso and lung cells suggests that circulating zzso could be used as a surrogate for assessing zzso zzso DNA damage and inflammatory responses in the zzso Human exposure to PM leads to zzso DNA damage whereas zzso inflammation was not conclusive and should be further zzso
