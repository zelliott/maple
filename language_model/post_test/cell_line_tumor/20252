zzso and reliable multiple organ zzso model systems might contribute to understanding the zzso of zzso of lung cancer, which may lead to overcoming zzso and improvement in the treatment outcome of lung zzso We isolated a highly zzso zzso zzso from the human pulmonary zzso cell line, zzso using an in zzso selection zzso The expression of zzso genes was compared between zzso and parental zzso by zzso zzso zzso Among the zzso expressed zzso expression of four genes in human lung cancer zzso and adjacent normal lung zzso were compared using real-time reverse zzso zzso chain zzso Although zzso nude mice zzso with parental zzso cells had few zzso almost all mice zzso with zzso cells developed zzso in multiple zzso including the zzso bone and adrenal zzso the same progression seen in human lung zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso genes were zzso (more than zzso expressed between the two cell zzso zzso zzso revealed that many of those genes were associated with cell growth, cell communication, development and zzso zzso of three zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso was higher in human cancer tissue compared to normal lung zzso while expression of zzso which was zzso was lower in the cancer tissue compared to the normal zzso These results suggest that the newly established zzso cell line may provide a mouse model of widespread zzso of lung zzso This model system may provide insights into the key genetic zzso of widespread zzso of lung zzso
