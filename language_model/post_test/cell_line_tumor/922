The hypoxic environment in solid tumors results from oxygen consumption by rapid proliferation of tumor zzso zzso has been shown to facilitate the survival of tumor cells and to be a cause of zzso zzso zzso also is well known to zzso the therapeutic activity of various therapies in cancer zzso These observations indicate that zzso plays a critical role in tumor zzso However, little is known about the effects of zzso on zzso especially on zzso induced by tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso a potent zzso zzso that has been shown to specifically limit tumor growth without damaging normal cells and zzso in zzso To address the effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso human colon zzso cells were exposed to hypoxic or zzso conditions and treated with soluble TRAIL zzso zzso dramatically inhibited zzso zzso in zzso cells, which are highly susceptible to TRAIL in zzso zzso increased zzso zzso family member proteins and zzso of zzso zzso Interestingly, these zzso zzso molecules were decreased by TRAIL treatment to the levels lower than those of the zzso conditions, suggesting that zzso zzso zzso zzso via other mechanisms rather than zzso of these zzso zzso Additional characterization revealed that zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso of zzso from the zzso to the zzso in zzso and zzso cells, with the zzso zzso of zzso c release from the zzso zzso zzso cells were completely resistant to TRAIL regardless of oxygen content, demonstrating a pivotal role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso Thus, our data indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso by blocking zzso zzso to the zzso thereby converting cells to a zzso zzso
