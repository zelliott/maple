Resistance to chemotherapy predicts an zzso outcome for patients with zzso zzso zzso To investigate the mechanisms underlying this resistance, we evaluated the expression of four different inhibitor of zzso zzso and their zzso zzso in zzso cancer cells that survived 48 hours of exposure to zzso zzso or zzso We found high levels of zzso after zzso treatment and increased expression of zzso following exposure to zzso zzso that endured treatment with zzso showed reduced expression of zzso and released minimal amounts of this protein from the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso increased the zzso of zzso and zzso whereas zzso of zzso improved the efficacy of zzso Finally, zzso cancer cells permanently resistant to zzso or zzso showed increased expression of zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso of these proteins by zzso interference restored sensitivity to zzso and zzso Thus, in zzso cancer cells, early resistance to zzso agents requires high levels of zzso and zzso and low levels of zzso Furthermore, increased expression of zzso and zzso contributes to the acquisition of permanent resistance to zzso zzso
