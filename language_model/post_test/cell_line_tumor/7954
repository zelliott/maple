zzso zzso a member of the zzso family, regulates zzso signaling zzso which are involved in many biological zzso including cancer zzso zzso was found to exert a complex and ambiguous role as zzso or tumor zzso depending on the cellular zzso Here we investigated zzso expression and function in a panel of zzso finding its expression in all the cell zzso The exception was the primary vertical melanoma cell line, zzso characterized by the lack of zzso and then zzso as a recipient for zzso gene zzso to address a series of functional zzso The alleged yet controversial role of zzso zzso on cell regulation was also tested by zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso increased zzso as indicated by enhanced zzso migration, invasion and capacity of forming zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited melanoma cell growth reducing some of the typical traits of zzso Finally, we detected a zzso fraction of zzso associated with cell released zzso particles able to stimulate in zzso zzso independence, migration and invasion in a zzso fashion and, more important, competent to convey zzso asset from the donor melanoma to the less aggressive recipient cell zzso A direct correlation between zzso levels, the amount of zzso released in the culture medium and zzso expression was also zzso
