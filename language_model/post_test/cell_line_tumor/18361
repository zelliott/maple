zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso factors zzso are zzso adapter proteins that link a wide variety of cell surface receptors to the zzso signaling zzso The purpose of this study was to delineate the signaling pathways and zzso promoter elements responsible for zzso zzso zzso induction in human colon zzso Here, we found that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso I, induced zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso D blocked zzso zzso expression suggesting induction at the zzso zzso In contrast, expression of other zzso zzso 3 and 4) was minimally altered by zzso Various zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso and promoter zzso zzso a selective zzso zzso had no effect suggesting that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso play a role in zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso suppressed zzso zzso promoter activity indicating a role for zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of a zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso promoter activity whereas zzso of zzso Ras or treatment with Ras zzso had minimal to no effect on zzso induction suggesting dependence on zzso but not zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso of functional zzso sites zzso the most zzso zzso in the zzso promoter significantly decreased zzso promoter zzso In conclusion, our results demonstrate selective induction of zzso in human colon cancer cells through a zzso zzso zzso
