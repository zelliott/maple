DNA zzso of promoter zzso islands is associated with zzso zzso of tumor zzso genes in oral zzso cell zzso zzso We used a zzso domain protein capture method coupled with next-generation sequencing zzso to survey global DNA zzso patterns in zzso with and without zzso zzso and normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Of zzso zzso zzso zzso islands identified in zzso relative to normal controls, zzso profiling uncovered zzso zzso linked to zzso zzso zzso zzso network analysis revealed a subset of these zzso zzso zzso 23), including the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are potential regulators and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso observed in zzso without zzso zzso whereas relatively lower zzso levels were present in zzso tumors, implicating an active state of zzso zzso in the latter zzso The zzso cell line, zzso displayed reduced zzso expression that corresponded to extensive promoter zzso island zzso zzso treatment with zzso agents induced zzso expression and increased invasion and migration zzso zzso of zzso activity in zzso cells with high zzso expression zzso zzso and zzso decreased cell growth and resulted in changes in invasive potential and zzso marker expression that were zzso zzso Although zzso is susceptible to zzso zzso during oral zzso zzso this default state may be necessary for modulating invasive processes involved in zzso zzso Given the complex response of zzso cells to zzso zzso future studies are required to assess the feasibility of targeting zzso to treat invasive zzso
