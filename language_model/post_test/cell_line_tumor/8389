Investigation of the crude extract obtained from the aerial parts of zzso zzso led to the isolation of a new zzso zzso together with twelve known zzso The structures of these compounds were zzso by interpretation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso data, accurate mass zzso and comparison with zzso data of previously known zzso Most of the isolated compounds have been reported for the first time from zzso zzso The zzso activities of the isolated compounds were evaluated on five different bacterial strains using zzso diffusion zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso bacteria zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso were employed for this zzso The new zzso named zzso zzso demonstrated significant zzso activity against all microbial strains tested, especially the pathogen zzso zzso In addition, the compounds 3, 4 and 9 exhibited zzso activity against zzso zzso strain zzso and weak zzso against zzso cell zzso
