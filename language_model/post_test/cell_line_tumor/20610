zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso inhibitor and zzso is its zzso Our previous analysis revealed that zzso is expressed in zzso cells to terminate zzso whereas zzso is expressed in zzso zzso cells mobilized from bone zzso to promote zzso in a mouse model of zzso subcutaneous zzso To test the possible involvement of zzso in the zzso we examined human zzso cancer cells for the presence of zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso protein was zzso detected in cancer cells of zzso zzso zzso We then used zzso and zzso two representative human zzso zzso cell lines, and examined the role of zzso in the zzso The zzso of zzso showed little effect on the proliferation of cancer cells in zzso but notably inhibited tumor growth, zzso zzso and tumor zzso in a zzso zzso zzso Next, we zzso zzso the human zzso gene into two types of zzso tumor cells, zzso and zzso in which zzso zzso was zzso When either zzso or zzso cells were zzso into zzso zzso mice, the zzso zzso formed bigger tumors when compared with the controls, and the tumor zzso density was significantly zzso zzso zzso the migration of zzso cells, and its increased expression in cancer cells is related to the decrease of zzso These results indicate that zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso cells promoted tumor growth and zzso dissemination by promoting zzso
