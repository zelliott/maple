The zzso properties of zzso zzso cells zzso toward tumors turn them into attractive tools for combining cell and gene zzso The aim of this study was to select in a feasible way a human bone zzso zzso zzso that might exhibit a selective ability to target the tumor zzso Using differential in zzso adhesive capacities during cells isolation, we selected a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso that exhibited enhanced zzso capacity and increased cell surface expression of specific zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which correlated with an enhanced zzso zzso toward their specific zzso Moreover, zzso exhibited a higher migration toward zzso media from different cancer cell lines and fresh human breast cancer samples in the presence or not of a human zzso zzso Further in zzso studies demonstrated increased tumor zzso of zzso toward established zzso and zzso breast cancer and zzso melanoma tumor zzso zzso penetration by zzso was highly dependent on zzso production as it was inhibited by the specific inhibitor zzso zzso Finally, zzso administered zzso preloaded with an zzso zzso significantly inhibited tumor growth in mice harboring established zzso zzso overcoming the natural resistance of the tumor to in zzso administration of the zzso zzso In zzso this work characterizes a novel zzso zzso with increased tumor zzso capacity that can be used to transport therapeutic zzso
