The aim of these studies was to characterize the action of zzso in a zzso tumor cell line both in zzso and in zzso In addition, its efficacy was determined against zzso derived from patients who failed zzso zzso 

The effects of zzso zzso and zzso zzso on cell zzso cell cycle, and zzso were assessed in zzso in drug-resistant cells zzso and the parental cell line zzso Mice bearing an zzso tumor on one flank and an zzso tumor on the other flank were used to assess the in zzso zzso Furthermore, the responses to zzso of three zzso derived from drug-resistant patients, were zzso 

In this study, zzso caused cell cycle arrest, zzso B1 zzso and subsequent zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were only active in the zzso parental cell zzso Although both zzso and zzso inhibited the growth of zzso derived from zzso cells, only zzso inhibited the growth of tumors derived from zzso zzso zzso was ineffective at the dose tested against both tumor zzso Two out of the three newly derived zzso zzso including a zzso zzso zzso responded to zzso but not to zzso zzso 

zzso shows excellent efficacy in both zzso and zzso breast cancer zzso models, in contrast to zzso and zzso The clinical potential of zzso was further highlighted by the efficacy seen in zzso recently derived from patients who had failed on zzso zzso
