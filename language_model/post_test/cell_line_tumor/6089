We have previously reported that many types of tumors can induce changes in human T cells that lead to the acquisition of zzso function and zzso zzso resembling those found in zzso T zzso In the present study, we find a role for zzso 7 zzso in protecting T cells from these changes and further define involved signaling zzso 

We evaluated the ability of zzso treatment to prevent the gain of zzso function and zzso zzso in human T cells after a short zzso with tumor cells in zzso We then used zzso of components of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and short interfering zzso zzso of zzso and zzso to evaluate the role of these signaling pathways in zzso zzso 

We found that zzso zzso zzso loss and maintains zzso capacity, zzso production, and reduced zzso zzso The protective ability of zzso depended on zzso of the zzso pathway, which inhibited zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso which, in turn, prevented the zzso and loss of zzso We further showed a key role for zzso in that its zzso or zzso zzso the effects of zzso In addition, zzso of the zzso binding partner and zzso protein zzso protected T cells from these dysfunctional zzso 

These observations confirm the role for zzso family members in zzso signaling and suggest that zzso treatment in combination with other zzso could lead to new clinical strategies to maintain normal zzso function and reduce zzso generation of dysfunctional and zzso T zzso
