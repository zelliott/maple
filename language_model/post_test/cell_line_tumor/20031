zzso pancreatic zzso zzso extracted from zzso stomach has been used for the treatment of pancreatic cancer zzso Unfortunately, no information is available on the in zzso and in zzso effect on the zzso and other zzso 

We used Syrian Golden zzso a unique pancreatic cancer model, to obtain basic information on zzso for its eventual use for the treatment of pancreatic zzso 

zzso was used in different zzso in zzso and in zzso The stability of the zzso in the water solution was zzso It was given to the zzso by zzso in zzso of zzso and 400 zzso for short periods and in zzso solution for 65 zzso Plasma zzso and insulin, the size of zzso and the number of the insulin cells per zzso were zzso 

The zzso activity of zzso was maintained in water solution for at least 24 zzso Due to its content of calcium zzso it showed a high toxicity to normal and zzso zzso pancreatic cancer cells and human pancreatic cancer cell lines in zzso zzso did not alter the plasma pancreatic zzso levels regardless of the dose, duration and application zzso On the contrary, zzso reduced their levels zzso zzso it also reduced the level of insulin, the size of the zzso and the number of insulin cells in the zzso zzso 

The results imply that zzso does not enter the blood circulation but it appears to slow down the function of both the zzso and zzso zzso
