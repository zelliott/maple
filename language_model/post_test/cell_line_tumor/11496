Development of effective zzso zzso for the successful application in cancer therapy still remains a great challenge in current zzso In the present study we present a zzso zzso zzso drug zzso that specifically targets and kills cancer cell lines expressing zzso growth factor zzso zzso The zzso was provided with a zzso core as a zzso zzso point, zzso zzso coupled through a zzso zzso a zzso marker, zzso zzso as zzso and shielding zzso and a zzso zzso zzso through the zzso zzso The study provides the proof of principle that zzso technology can be used to generate zzso zzso efficiently modified with zzso zzso to specifically target and destroy cancer zzso
