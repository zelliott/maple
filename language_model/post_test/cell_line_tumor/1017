Both zzso and zzso activities of zzso zzso factor have been zzso however, less is known about the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso To zzso how zzso regulates zzso zzso we performed functional analyses using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso cells with zzso zzso agent zzso as a zzso zzso for generating zzso zzso In this report, we show that zzso increased zzso generation and subsequently activated zzso which in turn zzso zzso expression and increased the stability and DNA binding activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity induced the expression of zzso genes zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso lack of zzso zzso and zzso as well as expression of a dominant negative zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso was not inhibited in zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso plays an essential role in zzso of zzso zzso tumor zzso to initiate zzso signaling in response to zzso of zzso Thus, these findings reveal a mechanism of zzso zzso zzso
