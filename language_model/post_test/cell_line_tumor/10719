Although cancer cells have traditionally been thought to rely on the zzso zzso to generate zzso recent studies suggest that cancer cells can shift to the fatty acid zzso zzso as an alternative energy zzso All of the factors that induce and regulate this zzso shift in metabolism are not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is produced at high levels in colon cancer, and multiple lines of evidence from zzso zzso and cell zzso studies indicate that zzso plays a zzso role in zzso cancer zzso We have shown previously that exposure of colon cancer cells to zzso promotes cell survival, in part by inducing the expression of the nuclear orphan zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso increased fatty acid zzso by inducing the expression of multiple proteins in the fatty acid zzso zzso zzso was found to bind directly to zzso response elements located within the regulatory region of these zzso zzso response element binding also resulted in the recruitment of zzso zzso and induction of gene zzso zzso our findings suggest that zzso plays a key role as a zzso integration point between the zzso and fatty acid zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a potential regulator of the zzso shift to energy zzso via fatty acid zzso that has been observed in several types of zzso
