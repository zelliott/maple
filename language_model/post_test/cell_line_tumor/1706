zzso zzso island 1 zzso zzso a type III section system that zzso zzso proteins into host cells, is essential for the enteric pathogen zzso to penetrate the zzso zzso and subsequently to cause zzso Using random zzso zzso we found that a zzso disruption in the zzso zzso zzso induced zzso expression when the strain was grown under conditions designed to repress zzso by mimicking the environment of the large zzso through the use of the zzso fatty acid zzso Our genetic studies showed that only zzso within this zzso was required for this effect, and that zzso zzso of zzso alone significantly reduced the expression of zzso zzso including the invasion regulator zzso and the zzso zzso zzso type III section system zzso zzso and zzso invasion of cultured zzso zzso zzso has been known to inhibit the zzso machinery through repression of the zzso master regulator zzso We found that the repressive effect of zzso on invasion genes was completely abolished in the absence of zzso or zzso the latter previously shown to induce zzso indicating that this regulatory zzso is required for invasion control by zzso Although this zzso zzso was necessary for zzso to zzso control invasion zzso zzso was not essential for the repressive effect of zzso on zzso placing zzso high in the regulatory cascade for both invasion and zzso
