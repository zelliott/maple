Breast cancer is a complex and zzso disease at the molecular zzso Evolution is difficult to predict according to classical zzso zzso zzso Different studies highlight the importance of large-scale molecular expression analyses to improve zzso of breast cancer and zzso zzso Identification of new molecular markers that refine this zzso and improve patient management is a priority in the field of breast cancer zzso are cell zzso molecules involved in the regulation of zzso zzso We present here zzso as a new zzso and zzso tumor associated marker for breast zzso 

zzso of zzso protein was measured on a panel of 78 primary cells and cell lines from different origins and 57 breast tumors by zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was measured by quantitative zzso zzso zzso was detected by zzso and compared with zzso and zzso zzso on panels of 45 zzso from healthy donors, 53 zzso from patients with zzso breast zzso zzso at diagnosis, and 182 zzso from patients with zzso Distribution of zzso molecular markers and zzso parameters were compared using the standard zzso zzso 

zzso was not detected in normal breast zzso By contrast, zzso was expressed in zzso of zzso breast zzso vs zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso strongly correlated with the zzso markers zzso zzso and zzso and zzso correlated with the zzso markers zzso zzso and zzso All but one zzso tumors expressed zzso The detection of zzso in serum improves the follow-up of patients with zzso the association zzso allowed to monitor zzso of these patients compared to zzso with the association zzso zzso zzso is a marker of disease zzso and levels correlate with the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is also a marker of therapeutic efficiency and zzso in zzso of cases, with clinical zzso 

zzso is a new zzso zzso for breast zzso zzso is a new zzso whose use could help refine breast cancer zzso and improve patients' zzso zzso emerges as a potential target for breast cancer zzso
