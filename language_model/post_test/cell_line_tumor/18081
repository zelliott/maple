zzso (a zzso and zzso 10 is a key member of the zzso family of zzso and zzso which process zzso proteins to soluble forms in a process known as zzso Among the major targets of zzso are zzso zzso and zzso In many zzso studies of zzso the activity of zzso appears to overlap with that of zzso which has a similar zzso zzso relative to the other zzso active zzso The tissue zzso of zzso zzso have proved useful in the study of zzso function, since zzso zzso zzso but not zzso however, both zzso are inhibited by zzso In the present study, we show that, in comparison with zzso and the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso alone are insufficient for the zzso of zzso This knowledge could form the basis for the design of directed zzso against different zzso
