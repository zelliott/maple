The topography and mechanical properties of single zzso cells have been investigated by atomic force zzso zzso With the assistance of zzso patterned zzso the surface topography and zzso of single living zzso cell were zzso by zzso The zzso of zzso cells induced by zzso alone was observed by zzso zzso zzso zzso double fluorescent zzso The zzso changes of mechanical properties in zzso cells were measured zzso and the results showed that zzso cells became dramatically zzso after incubation with zzso These results can improve our understanding of zzso and will facilitate the further investigation of the underlying zzso
