zzso shed by zzso cells contain zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein that has been zzso zzso Relative to full-length zzso migration of the zzso soluble zzso zzso zzso on zzso gels indicated a loss of approximately 6 zzso zzso and zzso cells also shed a similar zzso zzso zzso zzso shed by zzso cells following stimulation with calcium and zzso contained zzso similar to that present in zzso shed zzso zzso cells zzso to express full-length zzso produced zzso but cells that expressed zzso with a truncated zzso domain produced no equivalent to zzso In zzso cells, zzso activity was required for release of zzso with shed zzso and zzso of zzso in cells that rounded up and released from the plastic zzso in response to zzso treatment was blocked by zzso These experiments show that zzso zzso modified in the zzso domain, can be released with zzso shed by zzso zzso modification of the zzso zzso domain occurs during cell zzso and release from the culture zzso This zzso zzso zzso was the principal form of soluble zzso released by the zzso
