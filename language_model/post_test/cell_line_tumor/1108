zzso is an important component of proteins essential for normal functioning of the zzso However, it has been shown in zzso that this metal, at elevated levels, can be toxic to cells leading to their zzso We investigated possible mechanisms of cell death caused by zzso zzso generation of zzso oxygen species, and zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso Cell viability was assessed by means of the zzso zzso salt zzso zzso and confirmed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We measured the zzso status of zzso and zzso as indicators of zzso activity, using Western zzso zzso A time curve was established when zzso zzso cells were exposed to 100 zzso of zinc for 4, 12, and 24 zzso zzso caused a significant reduction in cell viability as early as 4 zzso and indirectly zzso the zzso of zzso oxygen species as determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Investigation of the zzso zzso indicated that zzso was zzso while zzso was zzso Our results therefore led us to conclude that in zzso zinc toxicity involved the generation of zzso oxygen species and the zzso of the zzso zzso
