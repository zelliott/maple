The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is critical for zzso function and invasion of zzso Given its critical nature, a phase III human zzso malaria vaccine trial is zzso The zzso is composed of three regions as zzso an N zzso that binds zzso zzso zzso a four zzso acid repeat region zzso and a C zzso that contains a zzso type I repeat zzso zzso Despite the importance of zzso little is known about its zzso zzso zzso forms of zzso were produced by expression in both zzso coli zzso and then zzso zzso or in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for structural zzso To analyze the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that recognized zzso zzso zzso zzso and inhibited zzso invasion of zzso cells in zzso were zzso These zzso zzso recognized all zzso zzso indicating the zzso zzso contain a properly folded zzso domain zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso by dynamic light scattering and zzso zzso demonstrated that both forms of zzso appeared as highly extended proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, high resolution atomic force zzso revealed flexible, zzso structures with a zzso zzso Using this information, we modeled the zzso repeat and zzso domain of zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso results, the repeat region formed a zzso structure about 21-25 zzso in length and zzso zzso in zzso Thus native zzso appears as a zzso flexible zzso protein on the zzso zzso
