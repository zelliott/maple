For imaging of zzso and zzso zzso zzso is routinely used, whereas zzso zzso is sporadically applied for zzso zzso zzso in zzso Both substances are taken up by zzso zzso zzso In competition, some other cell types are able to take up catecholamines and related compounds probably by organic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso of zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells were used and compared with zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso In order to gain a more selective zzso in zzso expressing tumor cells, different specific zzso were zzso zzso of zzso into zzso cells was similar or even better as into both zzso cell lines, whereas zzso and zzso zzso was much lower in zzso zzso In presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso into zzso and zzso cells was only slightly zzso In contrast, this process was significantly inhibited in zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as in zzso cells, which naturally express zzso We conclude that the well-known zzso zzso might be used in combination with zzso or zzso to improve specific imaging of zzso and zzso and to reduce zzso dose to zzso zzso in zzso zzso
