zzso tumor cells can reduce the efficacy of zzso zzso therapy may zzso zzso the tumor zzso to make it more efficient for oxygen zzso The aim of this study is to investigate whether the zzso human zzso zzso can create a zzso zzso zzso to alleviate zzso and enhance the zzso effects of radiation therapy in human zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso changes in zzso of tumor zzso and hypoxic tumor cell fraction in response to zzso were detected in mice bearing zzso and zzso human zzso zzso Various treatment schedules were tested to assess the influence of zzso on the effect of radiation zzso Several important factors relevant to the zzso were identified through zzso zzso During zzso treatment, tumor zzso zzso while the basement membrane and zzso coverage associated with zzso cells increased, which supported the idea of vessel zzso zzso tumor cell fraction also decreased after the zzso The transient zzso of tumor physiology caused by zzso improved the effect of radiation treatment compared with other treatment zzso The expressions of vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso while the level of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso 

zzso zzso tumor zzso which alleviated zzso and significantly zzso the function of radiation in zzso in human zzso The results provide an important experimental basis for combining zzso with radiation therapy in human zzso
