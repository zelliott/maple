zzso protein binds zzso to zzso zzso and regulates gene expression by causing changes in zzso zzso The mechanism by which impaired zzso activity can induce pathological abnormalities in the nervous system of patients with zzso syndrome zzso is not clearly zzso To gain further insight into the role of zzso in human zzso we compared the neural differentiation process in zzso stem cells zzso obtained from a zzso patient and from healthy zzso We further analyzed neural differentiation in a human zzso cell line carrying a partially silenced zzso zzso zzso and reduced expression of neural markers were observed in zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso patient, which suggests that impaired activity of zzso protein may impair neural zzso as observed in zzso zzso Next, we used an zzso expression system to silence zzso in zzso cells before and after the induction of neural differentiation via zzso acid zzso This approach was used to test whether zzso zzso affected the cell fate of neural zzso and/or zzso differentiation and zzso Overall, our data suggest that neural cell fate and zzso maintenance may be zzso by zzso triggered by impaired zzso activity either before or after neural zzso
