While health implications caused by cholesterol zzso products zzso seem to be generally accepted, research on zzso zzso products zzso is still zzso Since zzso are commercially not available knowledge on their toxic activities is mainly derived from blends instead of pure zzso Therefore the aim of the present study was to examine the zzso of three individual zzso products of zzso zzso zzso zzso a mixture of zzso zzso zzso and a mixture of polar zzso towards zzso All tested compounds were found to reduce cell viability in a significant and concentration dependent way, particularly zzso and zzso showed to be highly zzso Only for zzso an increase in early zzso cells was zzso Enhancement of zzso production was assessed for all zzso whereas zzso zzso levels were increased by zzso and zzso zzso However, cell death did not appear to be necessarily dependent on the generation of zzso zzso Further no DNA strand breaks were observed with the zzso zzso By assessing the zzso of single zzso products in the cells a link between higher proportions of zzso inside the cells and their zzso potential could be zzso
