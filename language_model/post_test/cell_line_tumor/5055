The biological importance of zzso in zzso and cell division makes them an interesting target for the development of zzso zzso Small molecules such as zzso are attractive as zzso of zzso zzso Thus, a new class of zzso of zzso zzso based on the zzso molecular zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the zzso ring, was zzso and evaluated for zzso activity, zzso of zzso zzso and cell cycle zzso Adding a zzso group at the zzso position resulted in increased zzso The most promising compound in this series was zzso which zzso cancer cell growth at zzso zzso and interacts strongly with zzso by binding to the zzso zzso
