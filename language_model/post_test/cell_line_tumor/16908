zzso zzso and zzso zzso play a major role in zzso and zzso water movement as water channel membrane zzso Little is known of their expression and significance in human zzso zzso Thus, we examined the expression of zzso and zzso in normal, zzso and zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with human zzso cancer cell zzso 

zzso analyses demonstrated zzso in the zzso membrane of normal C cells, but not in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was not found in C cells but was identified in normal zzso zzso zzso was positive in zzso of zzso disease zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and we failed to demonstrate zzso in these zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso we observed zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso but in no other zzso cell zzso zzso was demonstrated in zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso while it was negative in all zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso analyses revealed zzso zzso expression only in zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso tumors except for zzso zzso In zzso cancer cell lines, using zzso and western zzso zzso zzso and protein were only identified in the zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso cell line) and zzso in the other cell zzso In addition, zzso zzso expression was zzso by zzso and calcium administration in both a dose and time dependent manner in zzso zzso 

The differential expressions of zzso and zzso may reflect the biological nature and/or function of normal, zzso and zzso zzso cells and additionally may have value in determining differential diagnoses of zzso zzso
