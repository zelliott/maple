zzso of zzso zzso has been associated previously to the absence of zzso expression zzso in response to zzso Among zzso molecules zzso promising zzso agents able to inhibit the activity of zzso zzso family zzso we evaluated the effect of one of them, zzso on various zzso zzso cell zzso In response to zzso the zzso zzso cell line underwent massive cell death, whereas other cell lines presented a partial response zzso zzso and zzso or did not respond to this zzso zzso and zzso However, the expression of zzso targets zzso and zzso did not correlate to these different zzso In contrast, cell death was associated with the disappearance of zzso after exposure to zzso We showed that, in the zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso small interfering zzso zzso zzso allowed zzso massive zzso in the absence of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso was also able to sensitize highly zzso zzso cells to zzso Taken together, these results show that zzso and zzso are able to cooperate to protect zzso zzso cells against zzso stress or zzso zzso and suggest that the development of zzso strategies directed against these two zzso proteins may constitute a major challenge for the therapeutic care of zzso zzso zzso zzso compounds represent promising tools for this purpose either on their own zzso or indirect zzso or in combination with new drugs aiming to zzso zzso
