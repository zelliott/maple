Head and neck zzso cell zzso tumors zzso contain a dense zzso zzso which is known to promote tumor growth, although the mechanism of zzso growth remains zzso As zzso zzso zzso zzso to cancer, there is incremental zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is associated with tumor growth and zzso Here, we present evidence that gain of zzso expression allows tumor growth to be less dependent on zzso by modulating zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso cell lines zzso cell growth, but when zzso tumor cells were zzso with zzso or zzso with zzso into severe combined zzso mice, the growth zzso by zzso zzso was blunted by the presence of zzso zzso experiments showed zzso tumor cell growth occurred via a zzso zzso Analysis of tumor gene expression revealed expression of zzso was zzso related to zzso zzso To determine the role of zzso signaling in zzso tumor cells, zzso and zzso of zzso were zzso Both zzso and zzso enhanced tumor growth in zzso cells compared with control zzso cells, whereas zzso of zzso with blocking zzso or with a synthetic inhibitor zzso inhibited tumor cell growth in zzso zzso suggesting the importance of zzso signaling in zzso tumor zzso Analysis of zzso tumors revealed that zzso tumors had a larger zzso compartment compared with zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso acquired during tumor progression promotes zzso tumor zzso
