We previously reported that zzso zzso 26 zzso enhances the spontaneous zzso of mouse zzso melanoma zzso In contrast, daily zzso injections of an zzso zzso named zzso zzso zzso the spontaneous zzso of zzso zzso In the present study, we chemically zzso a novel zzso zzso named zzso and found that it also efficiently suppressed the spontaneous zzso of zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso inhibited the gap zzso zzso communications zzso that are formed between zzso cells by the zzso expression of the zzso and zzso human zzso zzso however, they had no effect on zzso zzso by zzso zzso or zzso zzso labeled zzso primarily localized not only at plasma membrane but also at zzso This suggests that this zzso zzso may also act on the zzso molecules that accumulate in the zzso because of their zzso zzso neither zzso had a zzso effect on zzso cells when they were added into the tissue culture zzso Taken together, we propose that the zzso and zzso zzso derivatives may serve as prototypes for novel and clinically important zzso zzso
