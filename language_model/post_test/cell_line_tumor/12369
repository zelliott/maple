To prepare zzso stabilized zzso modified with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and investigate their zzso and in zzso zzso 

An zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso soy zzso zzso was zzso and incorporated to zzso stabilized zzso After mild zzso of the zzso groups by zzso zzso were zzso linked with zzso zzso and formed zzso stabilized zzso zzso efficiency, zzso density, size distribution, zzso of zzso zzso stabilized zzso zzso and specific binding properties of the zzso to fixed zzso cells were determined, zzso 

Higher initial zzso zzso ratios resulted in higher zzso density on the surface of zzso but lower zzso zzso The optimal zzso efficiency of zzso was obtained while zzso density in zzso was 106 zzso zzso zzso (as initial zzso zzso 1 : zzso The zzso had a narrow size distribution after zzso and the mean size of this zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso can be preserved after efficient attachment of zzso zzso to the surface of zzso But calculated per zzso zzso the zzso of zzso would obviously decrease compared to that of zzso or zzso zzso zzso higher binding of zzso to fixed zzso cells directed by zzso was obtained compared to other preparations in serial zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso prepared by zzso method remained most zzso of zzso and was able to bind nuclear zzso in zzso
