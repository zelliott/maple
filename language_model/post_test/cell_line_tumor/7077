We have investigated the ability of zzso a zzso zzso used in the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease zzso to protect against cell death induced by zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso with either the active zzso or inactive zzso forms of zzso (10 zzso decreased cell death in response to zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cells and in zzso zzso zzso The protective effect was not prevented by zzso zzso blockade using zzso or zzso Protection occurred at zzso at which zzso did not demonstrate zzso activity, as shown by the failure to maintain zzso zzso However, zzso reduced zzso zzso decreased the release of zzso c and prevented the fall in the zzso membrane potential induced by zzso and zzso This suggests that zzso has zzso zzso The results extend the evidence for the zzso effects of zzso and indicate that this is not dependent on zzso zzso occupation or zzso zzso Further evaluation is required to determine whether the zzso action of zzso is translated to a zzso effect in zzso zzso
