The in zzso culture of zzso provides an attractive tool to study cell proliferation and insulin synthesis and zzso However, only a few human beta cell lines have been zzso with long-term passage resulting in loss of insulin zzso zzso we set out to establish and characterize human zzso cell zzso 

We generated zzso primary cultures from two independent human zzso and from a human zzso all of which were cultured up to passage number zzso All cell lines zzso human insulin and zzso These cell lines expressed neuroendocrine and zzso zzso confirming the expression profile found in the zzso Although all beta cell lineages survived an zzso independent culture, none of them were able to invade an zzso zzso zzso 

We have established three human zzso cell lines which maintain zzso characteristics and insulin zzso profiles of the original zzso These cell lines represent valuable tools for the study of molecular events underlying beta cell function and zzso
