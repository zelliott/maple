zzso zzso of nuclear zzso zzso is a frequent molecular zzso in pancreatic cancer and a number of studies have suggested that zzso zzso activity plays a key role in the aggressive behavior of this zzso In an attempt to identify an effective therapeutic agent for pancreatic cancer, the authors studied the role of zzso a synthetic zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso and the induction of zzso zzso 

To examine the effect of zzso on the zzso of zzso and the induction of zzso in pancreatic cancer cell lines, Western and Northern zzso zzso zzso shift zzso zzso reporter zzso DNA zzso zzso in zzso zzso small interfering zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

In a zzso and zzso manner, zzso inhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso thereby zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso which in turn activated the zzso zzso and Bid pathways and induced zzso in pancreatic cancer zzso zzso zzso of zzso death domain zzso and zzso was suppressed by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, expression of the zzso factor zzso was zzso by zzso and was involved in zzso zzso zzso 

These results suggested a possible mechanism by which zzso may disrupt interconnected signaling pathways by both suppressing the zzso zzso activity and inducing zzso zzso zzso by this unique function as a zzso inhibitor and zzso zzso this well-established synthetic zzso zzso inhibitor with zzso poorly understood mechanisms of actions appears to be a potentially therapeutic agent for pancreatic zzso
