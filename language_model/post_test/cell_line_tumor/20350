zzso interactions in the zzso promote zzso spread by zzso circulating tumor cell binding to zzso host zzso zzso identifying the zzso zzso on tumor cells is critical to the prevention of zzso zzso A current challenge is to distinguish between structures expressed by circulating tumor cells that can bind zzso in zzso from the functional zzso whose depletion suppresses zzso binding under flow in zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso which can bind zzso and zzso is zzso in a number of zzso including those of the breast, zzso and zzso In this work, we show that zzso pancreatic cancer cells zzso zzso compared with zzso pancreatic zzso zzso We further demonstrate via tissue zzso that zzso of pancreatic zzso zzso stain positive for zzso In cases of focal zzso positive zzso is restricted to the invasive front of primary zzso By combining zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso zzso we evaluated the functional role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso under zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso is a functional zzso and zzso zzso expressed by zzso pancreatic cancer cells, as specific depletion of this zzso from the cell surface significantly interferes with zzso zzso zzso these data support a correlation between zzso zzso expression and enhanced binding to zzso by zzso pancreatic cancer cells and offer additional perspective on the zzso of zzso in aggressive zzso
