zzso surface zzso resonance imaging zzso is a method for the accurate assessment of both cell zzso and zzso In zzso cells and/or proteins of interest are flowed across zzso immobilized on a zzso sensor zzso The surface of the chip is illuminated with zzso light that couples with surface zzso in the zzso At a specific angle of zzso the zzso angle, the maximum amount of zzso zzso Shifts in the zzso angle can be correlated with zzso index changes following cell or zzso capture by the immobilized zzso In addition, zzso can image the cells as they are being zzso zzso zzso format allows for the parallel assessment of up to 400 individual zzso zzso In this paper, we demonstrate zzso ability to identify cells and proteins of interest and compare results to a traditional flow zzso zzso This technology represents a fast and powerful method for the simultaneous assessment of cell zzso and zzso
