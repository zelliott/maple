The zzso of zzso zzso protein has been shown to cause zzso resistance in tumor cell zzso zzso is a member of the ABC zzso proteins that function as zzso pumps with diverse zzso zzso Several zzso cell zzso including the zzso C4 zzso and zzso zzso are zzso for zzso zzso zzso expression in certain tumor cells was demonstrated to zzso hypersensitivity to zzso modulating zzso In this report we have investigated the mechanism of collateral sensitivity seen in tumor cells zzso zzso zzso The results of this study show that zzso expression in tumor cells zzso with their hypersensitivity to various zzso modulating agents, as demonstrated in zzso selected and zzso zzso This effect was triggered either through zzso of zzso synthesis with zzso or by increasing zzso zzso transport with zzso or zzso In addition, our results show that the hypersensitivity of zzso cells to zzso zzso or zzso was preceded by an increase in zzso oxygen species (or zzso A decrease in zzso level is also observed prior the increase in zzso In addition, we show that hypersensitivity to the zzso zzso or zzso leads to tumor cell death by zzso Together, the results of this study demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso stress in tumor cells through reductions in cellular zzso zzso
