We have previously shown that the sustained expression of zzso transcripts in zzso and neural zzso zzso declines after exposure to zzso zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso confirmed the zzso zzso of zzso identified by FISH in a zzso cell zzso This background together with literature data on the zzso association of zzso with zzso zzso prompted us to investigate the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein aiming at achieving insights on its possible role in the zzso of zzso 

zzso was carried out to validate the specificity of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso Mass zzso was applied for zzso protein identification in a representative zzso cell zzso Combined zzso zzso and zzso analyses were performed to confirm the zzso zzso of zzso achieved by zzso in zzso cell zzso 

By assigning zzso protein within the band zzso by the specific zzso we validated our zzso zzso We demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso at all zzso stages and resides in zzso zzso zzso associates with the zzso and the zzso and respective zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso observed in zzso cell zzso 

The overall data merge on the multiplex entry of zzso into the cell cycle and link it to the zzso zzso in zzso cell lines suggesting a possible role of this zzso in the abnormal zzso processes of human zzso
