The effect of zzso with various low doses of zzso zzso zzso on tumor cell zzso in zzso mice was zzso Two cell lines, zzso and zzso and two strains of mice, were zzso First, zzso mice were zzso or zzso at 200 zzso and zzso h later, 1000 zzso cells were zzso in the hind zzso Based on the results, zzso zzso of zzso was given 6 h before zzso of 100 or 1000 cells in the subsequent zzso All mice were observed for 50 days after zzso zzso were judged as grown when the volume of palpable zzso exceeded 200 zzso zzso zzso rate was significantly higher in the groups zzso at 1500 zzso than in the zzso groups in both zzso and zzso zzso There were no differences in zzso rates between the control group and the groups zzso at various doses of zzso zzso However, the mean time to tumor appearance was significantly zzso in zzso mice receiving zzso at 200 zzso and zzso with 100 or 1000 zzso cells 6 h zzso This phenomenon was also observed in zzso mice receiving 100 zzso zzso and zzso with 1000 zzso zzso The present study might suggest that zzso zzso to mice may delay tumor growth under certain zzso
