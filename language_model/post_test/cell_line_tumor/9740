Current zzso zzso regimens for the treatment of zzso cancer rely on zzso zzso whereas intravenous regimens rely on zzso zzso A major question in the field is whether zzso can replace zzso for zzso zzso We compared the zzso of zzso administered zzso and zzso into human zzso zzso zzso of various sizes growing on the zzso surface of zzso zzso 

Human 2008 cells expressing zzso were zzso zzso in zzso zzso When small tumor zzso became visible by external imaging, a maximum tolerated dose of zzso or either an zzso or zzso dose of zzso was injected zzso Platinum zzso concentration in tumor zzso was measured by zzso coupled plasma mass zzso 

A total of zzso tumors harvested from 33 mice were analyzed for Pt zzso zzso produced a zzso higher level of Pt in tumor zzso when compared to an zzso dose of zzso zzso However, when zzso and zzso were injected at doses that were zzso to the mice, tumor Pt levels were equivalent zzso Although Pt zzso of zzso zzso were highly zzso tumor Pt content zzso zzso zzso decreased with increasing zzso size following zzso zzso an effect not seen with zzso administration of zzso doses of zzso ( zzso 

These results suggest that zzso zzso has comparable or better drug penetration when compared to zzso given at zzso doses, and thus provide support for replacing zzso with zzso in the zzso treatment of patients with zzso zzso
