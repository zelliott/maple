Two major systems exist for folate cell zzso the reduced folate carrier zzso and the folate zzso zzso Although defective zzso transport was frequently identified as a mechanism of zzso zzso resistance in zzso the status of zzso and its role in this disease are zzso 

zzso for zzso alpha was measured in 107 zzso specimens using quantitative reverse zzso and was related to zzso zzso The effect of zzso alpha zzso on zzso resistance and natural folate zzso was studied using zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso alpha zzso in comparison with those zzso with sense or zzso zzso in the same genetic zzso 

zzso samples zzso had zzso zzso alpha zzso and zzso had higher levels than the zzso cancer cell line zzso No correlation was found between zzso levels of zzso alpha and zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso had minor effects on the transport of zzso and sensitivity to this zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso only the zzso alpha was able to zzso zzso when the zzso concentration was reduced to 2 zzso which zzso a growth advantage in zzso folate zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso this was not similarly achieved by zzso zzso 

This study suggests that zzso alpha plays a role in the zzso of zzso when the concentration zzso is insufficient for zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso is unlikely secondary to the decreased zzso expression in zzso
