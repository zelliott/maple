Various studies have detailed the role of zzso proteins in both zzso zzso and zzso Further study has shown that distinct promoter zzso but zzso the same zzso zzso zzso positive or negative zzso control and that this reflects binding of either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso We now show that the specificity of binding of an zzso or zzso zzso protein is determined by adjacent sequences that bind a cooperating zzso zzso We propose that the functional zzso element is a module zzso not only the zzso site but also the adjacent site for the cooperating zzso zzso
