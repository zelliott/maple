Following observations indicating the existence of a relationship between immune and cancer cells in the course of tumor development, it was the aim of the study to establish the role of zzso D3 zzso zzso in the functional equilibrium between cells from two human colon zzso zzso zzso production by peripheral blood zzso cells zzso zzso were incubated with zzso and zzso human colon cancer cells with and without zzso D at final zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso The production of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as the effect of the vitamin on tumor cell proliferation were zzso zzso of zzso with either zzso or zzso cells caused a significant stimulation of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso D to the incubation mixture containing zzso and cells of both colon zzso lines caused a marked zzso of the generation of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and to a lesser zzso the zzso zzso D did not affect the proliferation of the cancer zzso The results indicate the existence of a functional zzso between immune and cancer cells expressed by an zzso of their capacity for zzso production and support the role of inflammation in zzso The ability of zzso D to zzso production of the zzso zzso when added to the incubation mixture containing zzso and cancer cells endorses observations as for the beneficial role of the vitamin in suppressing inflammation with subsequent colon cancer zzso
