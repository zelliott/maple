Human melanoma zzso zzso a zzso zzso is expressed in both human zzso and zzso We used zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to investigate whether zzso zzso cerebral zzso express the zzso zzso zzso and to determine whether zzso could be targeted for selective delivery of radiation in zzso zzso zzso zzso stained zzso zzso zzso cells grown in culture and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso showed zzso positive images of zzso against a negative zzso At 96 h after injection, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso greater than that of the zzso control zzso and zzso greater than that detected in normal cerebral zzso Our results show zzso zzso cerebral zzso express zzso and zzso zzso zzso accumulates selectively and specifically at high concentration and is retained within zzso cerebral zzso Thus, zzso is a potential target for zzso selective delivery of radiation to cerebral zzso in zzso
