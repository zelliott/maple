zzso is often zzso in cell lines that are exposed to hypoxic conditions zzso - zzso zzso but this repression requires prolonged exposure zzso 16 zzso We report here that prolonged exposure to zzso results in the depletion of zzso from the media and that the loss of zzso zzso with the shut down in zzso Furthermore, we show that the addition of zzso or zzso restores translation in hypoxic zzso zzso This indicates that both zzso depletion and zzso are required for zzso zzso We also show that zzso zzso is reversed by zzso zzso Moreover, we present data that strongly indicate that zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso that occurs when cells are grown under conditions of zzso depletion and zzso is pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso We believe this is the first report to show that zzso depletion is required for zzso repression under hypoxic conditions and that this explains why prolonged exposure to zzso is required for this zzso Since the zzso conditions that lead to tumor zzso would also likely lead to reduced zzso levels, understanding the interplay of zzso and zzso in regulating tumor metabolism will provide important information on the growth and development of solid zzso
