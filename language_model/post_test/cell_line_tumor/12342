The current reference treatment of zzso prostate cancer consists mainly of chemotherapy with zzso To improve the management of advanced prostate cancer, one should examine the benefits of adding other agents to zzso We examined the growth zzso effects of a triple zzso including the zzso growth factor zzso drug zzso zzso and zzso (the main zzso zzso of zzso on the human prostate cancer cell lines zzso and zzso which are both devoid of zzso zzso zzso synergistic zzso effects were observed with the application of the double combination of zzso for both cell lines and to a lesser magnitude with the triple zzso For zzso cells, all conditions resulted in synergistic zzso The combination between zzso and zzso resulted in an approximately 50% reduction in zzso zzso activity (the molecular target of zzso zzso the active zzso zzso with an higher impact observed with zzso cells than with zzso zzso Neither zzso nor zzso alone displayed marked effects on zzso zzso activity (the zzso that zzso at the cellular level the final and crucial step in the zzso cascade of zzso in contrast to their combination that resulted in a strong increase in zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso These data may serve as a rational basis for setting up clinical trials in advanced prostate cancer combining zzso growth factor zzso agents like zzso together with zzso and zzso
