The synthesis of a series of zzso derivatives zzso a zzso zzso function and related zzso zzso structurally suitable for zzso zzso was achieved in few steps starting from readily available zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso provided zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso around the zzso double zzso A zzso zzso zzso chemistry protocol was used to convert zzso bearing a zzso zzso into the corresponding zzso These new molecules were screened for their in zzso zzso and zzso activities and those containing zzso zzso systems demonstrated the best zzso zzso zzso zzso were the most active ones among the zzso zzso The zzso displayed very strong activities against zzso zzso and zzso zzso and strong activity toward zzso zzso and the zzso pathogen zzso zzso The corresponding zzso presented a very strong zzso effect against two zzso species zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited selectively a strong activity toward zzso zzso Further acute toxicity evaluation indicated low toxic effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso or zzso zzso
