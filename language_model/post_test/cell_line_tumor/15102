zzso the integration of zzso and therapies, has become a new concept in the battles with various major diseases such as zzso Here, we report a zzso zzso which is developed by zzso zzso zzso structured zzso zzso zzso with zzso oxide zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso and then loading zzso zzso on the surface of zzso The obtained zzso zzso are not only be used as zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso of cells and zzso animals with high contrast for diagnosis, but also can generate zzso zzso oxygen under light zzso for zzso therapy zzso as well as rapidly and efficiently convert the zzso zzso laser energy into zzso energy for zzso therapy zzso A remarkably improved and synergistic therapeutic effect compared to zzso or zzso alone is zzso providing high therapeutic efficiency for cancer zzso zzso benefiting from the unique zzso hybrid zzso zzso zzso developed zzso are promising as an integrated zzso probe for potential zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso
