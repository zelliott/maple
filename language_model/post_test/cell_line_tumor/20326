The zzso approach using zzso natural products may be one of the strategies for the management of the zzso Here we report that in zzso treatment of human zzso zzso cells with zzso a naturally occurring zzso zzso decreased cell viability and induced cell death in a zzso manner, which was associated with an increase in zzso zzso Our western zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso cell cycle arrest was zzso through the increased expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso a simultaneous decrease in zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and reduced activity of the zzso zzso In additional studies, treatment of zzso cells with different zzso zzso 40, 80 zzso of zzso for 48 h resulted in a significant zzso increase in zzso compared to the zzso control, which was associated with an increased expression of zzso protein zzso and decreased expression of zzso proteins zzso and zzso Together, this study for the first time identified zzso as a zzso agent against human zzso cells zzso cells in zzso Further in zzso studies are required to determine whether zzso could be an effective zzso agent for the management of zzso
