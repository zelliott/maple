zzso growth factor zzso 1 zzso plays a critical role in zzso transformation zzso zzso is zzso in some tumors including breast, zzso zzso and zzso tumors zzso Upon binding of zzso or zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on two major zzso zzso and zzso which subsequently signal through the zzso and zzso zzso pathways zzso zzso literature has shown that when the zzso signaling zzso is blocked by zzso dominant negative zzso or zzso zzso cellular transformation and tumor formation in mice is inhibited zzso Small zzso zzso zzso represent a valid approach to inhibit activity and downstream zzso of zzso To date, few potent and selective small zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity have been zzso We expressed the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso in insect cells and subsequently zzso the partially activated zzso A compound library has been screened using a homogeneous zzso zzso zzso zzso The hits generated by zzso were then evaluated in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was approximately zzso hit zzso between the two zzso zzso One compound, zzso inhibited the zzso zzso activity with an zzso of 1 zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso This inhibitor provides a useful tool for studying zzso in zzso
