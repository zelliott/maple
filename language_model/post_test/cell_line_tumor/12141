Human mast cells have been shown to release zzso in response to the zzso zzso hormone zzso but it is unknown whether these cells express zzso zzso or zzso zzso We therefore examined highly zzso human skin mast cells and a zzso mast cell zzso zzso for their ability to express zzso and members of the zzso zzso zzso family known to process zzso Furthermore, we investigated whether these cells store and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that both skin mast cells and zzso cells express zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso gene at the zzso level in zzso cells could be confirmed by Northern zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso were zzso in zzso mast cells and zzso cells, as shown by zzso In contrast, zzso transcripts were detected only in skin mast cells, whereas transcripts for paired basic zzso acid converting zzso 4 zzso were present only in zzso zzso zzso performed on cell zzso and cell culture zzso from human zzso mast cells disclosed zzso amounts of zzso in both zzso zzso with an zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso and increased zzso levels, indicating zzso zzso of this zzso Our findings show that human mast cells are active players in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may contribute to zzso zzso as seen in patients with zzso zzso Moreover, zzso release of zzso suggests an zzso role of this zzso during inflammatory and allergic reactions of the zzso
