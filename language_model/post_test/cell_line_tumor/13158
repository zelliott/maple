zzso binding zzso protein 1, also known as zzso is a skeleton organization protein that binds to zzso gene 2 at zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the role of zzso in zzso zzso in human zzso cells, to determine the functional zzso of zzso and to zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of zzso zzso 

The human zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso with zzso to elevate the expression level of zzso zzso interference was used to reduce the expression of zzso To determine the functional zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with plasmids of zzso deletion zzso After treatment with zzso (40 zzso for 24 zzso the cell viability was assessed using the zzso zzso and the cell zzso was examined using the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso proteins were detected by Western zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso significantly enhanced zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells, whereas zzso of zzso expression inhibited the zzso of these cell zzso The zzso region of zzso alone was able to enhance the zzso zzso However, despite the existence of the zzso region, zzso of zzso with any one of three zzso zzso deleted led to a function zzso Furthermore, zzso proteins zzso and zzso and the zzso protein zzso were modulated by the expression level of zzso in combination with zzso 

The zzso zzso of zzso play a key role in zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso through regulation of zzso zzso
