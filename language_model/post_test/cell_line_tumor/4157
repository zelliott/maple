zzso zzso properties are critical in modulating zzso and zzso exchange as well as signal zzso Biological zzso are predominantly composed of zzso cholesterol and zzso and their fluidity is tightly regulated by cholesterol and zzso zzso To determine whether such membrane fluidity regulation occurred in zzso cells under pressure, we investigated the effects of pressure on membrane zzso order of mouse zzso zzso cells and zzso gene zzso zzso pressure zzso increased membrane zzso packing and simultaneously zzso zzso zzso gene zzso We also showed that cholesterol zzso and cholesterol depletion reversed those effects, suggesting that zzso gene expression was controlled by the membrane physical state zzso This study demonstrates a new effect of zzso pressure on zzso cells and may help to identify the molecular mechanisms involved in zzso pressure sensing in zzso
