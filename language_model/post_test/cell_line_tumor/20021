zzso zzso zzso are common in zzso zzso cancer zzso and can be resistant to surgical zzso or zzso zzso We examined the role of zzso growth factor zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso Clinical specimens of zzso zzso zzso zzso were surveyed in a tissue array and by western blots to examine the relationship between expression of the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was found at high levels in primary zzso with known zzso zzso but not in those zzso lacking zzso involvement zzso zzso zzso However, zzso expression was not linked to zzso disease zzso zzso zzso as it was found in virtually all zzso zzso A matching analysis in fresh zzso specimens zzso zzso zzso confirmed that zzso expression was strongly linked to zzso spread zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not found in normal zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines selectively expressing zzso or zzso were assessed for invasive potential and zzso of downstream signal zzso zzso zzso cell lines expressing zzso responded to zzso stimulation with increased invasive potential and this process can be blocked by the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell lines with only zzso or no zzso did not show significant changes in invasive zzso zzso of zzso led to downstream zzso of both the zzso and zzso pathways and disruption of either zzso is sufficient to block zzso increases in invasive zzso Thus, zzso is associated with zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso promotes increased invasive potential in zzso cell zzso zzso is a strong candidate for a diagnostic zzso to identify patients at risk of zzso zzso Our results also strengthen the rationale for selection of zzso zzso zzso zzso that target zzso in the treatment of progressive, zzso zzso
