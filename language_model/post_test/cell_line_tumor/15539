zzso growth factor zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso which can zzso zzso signals responsible for cell zzso It is frequently zzso and/or zzso activated in zzso cell lung cancer and thus is considered as a major cause of this zzso Recently, zzso has been found in the nucleus where the nuclear zzso zzso can function as a zzso factor zzso the zzso of genes such as zzso D1 gene zzso which is essential for cell zzso Nevertheless, how zzso zzso activity is regulated remains zzso zzso leukemia protein zzso is a tumor zzso which is lost in various zzso including lung zzso However, the role of zzso in the suppression of lung cancer growth is still zzso When we investigated the role of zzso in the regulation of lung cancer cell growth, we found that zzso zzso IV zzso zzso zzso the growth of lung cancer cells bearing zzso active zzso Besides, when growing in the zzso zzso conditions, the growth of zzso zzso bearing zzso cells has been zzso by zzso zzso We also found that zzso can interact physically with zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso target zzso We showed that zzso is recruited by zzso to the target promoters and reduces the promoter zzso zzso level via zzso Together, our results suggest that zzso interacts with zzso upon zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso target genes such as zzso and thus leading to zzso of the lung cancer cell zzso
