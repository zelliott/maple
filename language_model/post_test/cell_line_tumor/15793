zzso zzso zzso are widely employed as delivery platforms of zzso DNA, or of small interfering zzso zzso for the induction of zzso interference zzso Among those, zzso zzso zzso take a prominent position due to their relatively high zzso however, their zzso profiles upon systemic delivery and their toxicity pose limitations which can be addressed by the introduction of zzso zzso In this paper, we systematically zzso zzso and biological properties of DNA and zzso complexes prepared from a set of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso charge zzso of the zzso correlate with the structure and degree of zzso and the length of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso complexes and changes in the thermodynamics of DNA complex formation are observed, while the complex sizes are largely unaffected by zzso zzso and the presence of serum zzso Furthermore, although zzso zzso of zzso are not altered, complex zzso are markedly increased in zzso zzso DNA complex zzso and zzso zzso are slowed down upon zzso of the zzso which can be attributed to decreased zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso mechanisms zzso zzso are zzso Independent of the zzso architecture, DNA and zzso complexes based on zzso zzso show considerably lower zzso as compared to zzso zzso While zzso zzso generally leads to reduced in zzso zzso zzso this effect is less profound in some zzso complexes as compared to zzso zzso zzso upon their systemic application in zzso zzso complexes show marked differences in the zzso zzso profile with zzso substantially decreased zzso levels in the liver and increased zzso levels in the zzso Taken together, we demonstrate that zzso complexes show zzso zzso and biological properties and may represent promising, zzso platforms for the delivery of zzso particularly for in zzso zzso
