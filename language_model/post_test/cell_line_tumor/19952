zzso stress is closely associated with diabetes and is a major cause of insulin zzso zzso of zzso insulin action is thought to be responsible for zzso in zzso zzso zzso In this study, we found that zzso stress is involved in the zzso of gene expression of zzso zzso zzso a key zzso zzso by a mechanism independent of zzso zzso of zzso stress by injection of zzso zzso in rats increased the expression of zzso zzso zzso To examine the direct action of zzso stress on zzso zzso we treated zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso stress and the expression of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso which mediates responses to zzso stress, suppressed the induction of zzso zzso by zzso These results suggest that zzso stress zzso zzso zzso expression by an zzso zzso
