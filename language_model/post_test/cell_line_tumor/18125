Bone zzso cause severe skeletal morbidity including fractures and zzso zzso cells in bone induce zzso of zzso which mediate bone zzso and release of growth factors from bone zzso resulting in a zzso zzso of bone breakdown and tumor zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is an essential zzso of zzso formation, function, and survival, and is blocked by a soluble decoy zzso zzso zzso In human zzso that zzso to bone, zzso of the zzso zzso can increase the zzso ratio, a condition which favors excessive zzso In a mouse model of bone zzso zzso protein levels in zzso zzso zzso bones were significantly higher than zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso and zzso was zzso inhibited by zzso zzso treatment, supporting the essential role for zzso in this zzso Using zzso imaging in a mouse model of zzso we monitored the zzso efficacy of zzso zzso on zzso human breast cancer cells in a zzso zzso Treatment with zzso in zzso inhibited growth of zzso tumor cells in zzso sites when given both as a preventative zzso day zzso and as a therapeutic agent for established bone zzso zzso day zzso One mechanism by which zzso zzso reduced tumor burden appears to be indirect through zzso of the zzso zzso and involved an increase in tumor cell zzso as measured by active zzso Here, we demonstrate for the first time that zzso treatment of mice with established bone zzso resulted in an overall improvement in zzso
