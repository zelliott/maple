Our study aims to study the therapeutic effects of a novel zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso and to provide primary zzso data for future clinical trial with zzso In this study we showed that zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso cell lines and human liver cancer zzso Clinic used zzso single treatment had no zzso effects on zzso cells whereas higher doses of zzso zzso Interestingly, the combination treatment of zzso with zzso inhibitor zzso could result in significant zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso through gene zzso significantly enhanced zzso to induce zzso in zzso zzso We found that low dose of zzso single treatment resulted in zzso zzso and zzso zzso which might be involved in the resistance of zzso cells to zzso since blockade of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso combination treatment had no zzso effects on normal human zzso Taken together, these data suggest the combination treatment of zzso inhibitor and zzso zzso may have a great potential for liver cancer zzso
