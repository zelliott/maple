The zzso C virus zzso zzso protein is essential for particle zzso but its function in this process is zzso We previously identified critical genetic interactions between zzso and the viral zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Based on these data, we hypothesized that interactions between these viral proteins are essential for zzso particle zzso To identify interaction partners of zzso we developed methods to zzso zzso zzso in zzso and affinity capture zzso protein complexes from zzso cells with zzso magnetic zzso By using these methods, we confirmed that zzso physically interacts with zzso zzso and zzso but did not zzso interact with viral core or zzso zzso We further characterized these protein complexes by blue native zzso gel zzso and identified zzso zzso and zzso zzso complexes containing zzso zzso and zzso The formation of zzso protein complexes was dependent on zzso of the viral zzso protein and enhanced by zzso of viral proteins as a zzso Further characterization indicated that the zzso complex interacts with zzso via zzso and the pattern of zzso zzso on E1 and zzso suggested that these interactions occur in the early zzso zzso zzso several zzso that inhibited virus assembly were shown to inhibit zzso protein complex formation, and zzso was essential for zzso the interaction between zzso and zzso These studies demonstrate that zzso plays a central organizing role in zzso particle assembly by bringing together viral structural and zzso zzso
