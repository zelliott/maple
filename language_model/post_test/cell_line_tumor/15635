zzso zzso zzso the active zzso of vitamin zzso zzso breast cancer cell growth in zzso and in zzso To examine mechanisms of zzso induced growth arrest and zzso cell lines were established from zzso induced zzso tumors derived from vitamin zzso zzso knockout zzso and wild type zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso cell lines were selected and zzso All four cell lines express zzso indicative of an zzso origin, as well as zzso which is expressed in many transformed cell zzso The zzso of the cells was confirmed in zzso as all four cell lines form zzso responsive tumors in nude zzso Both zzso cell lines express the zzso protein and are sensitive to growth zzso by zzso at doses as low as 1 zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso zzso arrest and zzso in the zzso cell zzso In contrast, both cell lines established from tumors that developed in zzso mice lack zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso mice exhibit zzso zzso zzso activity, as measured by reporter gene zzso but cells from zzso mice do zzso zzso from zzso mice are also completely resistant to zzso zzso growth arrest and zzso over the range of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells are also resistant to the synthetic vitamin zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are more potent growth zzso than zzso in zzso zzso This data zzso demonstrate that the induction of cell cycle arrest and zzso in breast cancer cells by zzso zzso and zzso is dependent on the nuclear zzso zzso lacking zzso remain sensitive to growth arrest zzso by zzso zzso acid, a zzso for the zzso zzso zzso which can zzso with the zzso zzso to zzso induced by the DNA damaging agent zzso is not altered in zzso cells, indicating that zzso zzso does not impair zzso pathways in zzso All four cell lines display equal sensitivity to tamoxifen induced growth zzso These zzso responsive, transformed cell lines which zzso express the zzso provide a novel model system for identification of the mechanisms by which zzso regulates proliferation and zzso in breast cancer zzso
