It was found previously that zzso a small zzso zzso was zzso in a zzso zzso of the zzso human breast zzso cell zzso The objective of the current study was to determine whether the expression of zzso in primary breast zzso was associated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso of zzso was measured in human breast zzso cell lines by zzso zzso in human breast zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso of tissue zzso that contained samples from 317 patients with zzso zzso breast zzso and zzso patients with zzso zzso breast zzso 

It was found that zzso was expressed zzso in certain breast zzso cell lines, including those that were capable of zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in human tissue samples was associated strongly with zzso zzso involvement zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and, to a lesser degree, with high nuclear grade zzso zzso zzso Increased intensity of expression was correlated with shorter survival zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso expression was not independent of zzso zzso status as a predictor of zzso 

The data obtained in the current study revealed a strong association between high expression levels of zzso in primary breast zzso specimens and zzso zzso zzso Further studies will be needed to zzso zzso the role of this novel tumor marker as a clinical zzso marker in local and locally advanced breast zzso as well as its potential status as a new target for therapy in patients with breast zzso
