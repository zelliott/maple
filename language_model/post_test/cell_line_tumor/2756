This paper presents zzso transform infrared zzso zzso to zzso spectral differences that distinguish cells derived from human zzso lymphoma, zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso This methodology is based on spectral zzso of major cellular zzso constituents and zzso spectral zzso Major spectral differences were observed in the zzso zzso zzso spectral zzso zzso in the averaged zzso for each cell line were assigned to major zzso constituents zzso zzso zzso carbohydrates and zzso zzso zzso statistical analysis of the zzso was carried out to develop a zzso model to discriminate the five cell zzso The results show that zzso zzso displays high sensitivity and specificity when discriminating between zzso lymphoma, zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells based on intrinsic zzso zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso statistical analysis provides an important insight into zzso lymphoma, zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell line zzso In conclusion, this paper demonstrates a potential for this technique to be used in developing a clinical tool for the detection and identification of zzso zzso
