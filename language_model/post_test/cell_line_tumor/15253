There are reports of improved zzso outcomes due to consumption of zzso brown rice zzso Many of the functional effects of zzso can be linked to its high amounts of zzso Interestingly, dietary components with high antioxidants have shown promise in the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease zzso This effect of dietary components is mostly based on their ability to prevent zzso which is believed to link zzso damage to pathological changes in zzso In view of the rich zzso content of zzso we studied its potential to zzso processes leading up to zzso 

The total zzso content and zzso capacity of the zzso zzso extract of zzso were compared to that of brown rice zzso and the zzso of both extracts were determined on human zzso zzso cells using zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on its higher zzso zzso the effect of the zzso extract on zzso changes due to hydrogen zzso zzso zzso damage in human zzso zzso cells was examined using zzso light microscope and zzso microscope by means of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Also, evaluation of the zzso regulation of zzso and zzso genes was carried out using zzso Gene zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso extract of zzso had higher total zzso content and zzso capacity compared to zzso The zzso results showed that zzso extract did not cause any damage to the human zzso zzso cells at zzso of up to 20 zzso and the zzso analyses showed that the zzso extract (up to 10 zzso prevented zzso zzso changes in the zzso Furthermore, multiplex gene expression analyses showed that the protection of the cells by the zzso extract was linked to its ability to induce zzso changes in zzso zzso 1, zzso 2 and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes that tended towards zzso 

Taken together, the results of our study showed that the zzso zzso extract of zzso with high zzso zzso could prevent zzso zzso damage in zzso zzso The potential of zzso and its zzso mechanism in zzso zzso stress-related zzso is therefore worth exploring zzso
