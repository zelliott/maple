Human zzso zzso mainly zzso young zzso Although many infected children suffer from respiratory or zzso tract diseases, an association between zzso and these diseases is not zzso Because zzso of type I zzso is crucial for viruses to establish efficient zzso in this study, we tested whether zzso zzso type I zzso zzso We observed that a nearly full-length zzso clone significantly reduced both zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Further study showed that zzso blocked zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso acid, and zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso protein I, zzso zzso signaling zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso with zzso zzso promoter activated by zzso and a zzso active zzso of zzso zzso Although zzso suppressed the zzso pathway, it did not affect zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso zzso confirmed the interaction between zzso and zzso Additional deletion zzso and zzso zzso revealed that zzso bound to the zzso domain of zzso resulting in the interruption of an association between zzso and zzso zzso Altogether, our results indicate that zzso zzso blocks zzso production through a unique zzso To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the zzso of innate immunity by zzso Our findings suggest a potential zzso mechanism used by zzso and provide a basis for better understanding zzso zzso
