zzso interference zzso is a powerful approach for zzso zzso however, in zzso zzso delivery has remained a major challenge due to lack of safe, efficient, and sustained zzso Here, we describe a novel approach to overcome these limitations using zzso silicon particles loaded with zzso zzso zzso containing small interfering zzso zzso targeted against zzso that contributes to cancer cell zzso This delivery method resulted in sustained gene zzso for at least 3 weeks with substantial reduction of tumor growth with no overt zzso in two independent zzso mouse models of zzso cancer following a single intravenous administration of zzso silicon particles loaded with zzso zzso
