Despite the advent of new zzso drugs in recent decades, zzso zzso zzso zzso remains the leading cause of death from zzso zzso and new therapeutic targets and agents are urgently zzso zzso acid zzso is a novel synthetic zzso with zzso activity against a wide range of tumors in zzso and in zzso zzso is a zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to evaluate zzso activity in zzso cell lines in zzso 

The expression of zzso was examined by real-time quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso in eight zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2008 and zzso and the growth zzso activity of zzso was assessed using the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was expressed in all eight cell lines zzso but the expression varied widely among cell zzso In contrast, zzso showed a similar degree of activity in different zzso cell lines independent of zzso sensitivity, with 50% zzso zzso ranging from 1 to 4 zzso zzso combining zzso with zzso and zzso indicated weak zzso The zzso activity of zzso was unaffected by zzso zzso zzso 

Although differences were observed in zzso expression in zzso cell lines, zzso had similar zzso activity in all cell lines zzso indicating that the zzso activity of zzso in zzso is zzso by a mechanism independent of zzso The activity of zzso in zzso cell lines is encouraging with respect to the potential clinical use of the zzso
