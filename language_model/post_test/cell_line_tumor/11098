zzso of the study was to explore the influence of zzso on zzso resistance related genes and the potential role of zzso zzso zzso in formation of zzso resistance in zzso human zzso zzso cell zzso zzso cells were subjected to zzso in a cohort of exposed zzso A cell model zzso expressing zzso was established by zzso zzso of zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells exposed to zzso or zzso by zzso zzso was detected by zzso zzso after administration of zzso drug zzso zzso fluorescent quantitative zzso and zzso technique were used to analyze the expressions of zzso resistance related genes zzso zzso and zzso at zzso and protein level, zzso zzso Index of zzso cells exposed to zzso stepped down as exposed time extended after administration of zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso gene and protein revealed a hypoxic zzso induction and was zzso with the zzso of zzso in zzso cells exposed to zzso The expressions of these zzso resistance related genes were remarkably increased in zzso zzso zzso cells as compared to empty zzso zzso zzso zzso index of zzso zzso cells was obviously less than that of control cells when they were simultaneously exposed to zzso for zzso In conclusion, ambient zzso might be one of the causes for the formation of zzso resistance in zzso human zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso resistance related protein expression might be a zzso for resistance of zzso cells to zzso and zzso might be involved in this zzso
