zzso is a zzso zzso selective zzso zzso drug zzso which has been shown to be capable of zzso the growth of various cancer cell zzso However, studies of its effect on the growth of zzso zzso zzso cells are zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of zzso on cell growth using three zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our results showed that while all 3 cell lines expressed the zzso zzso as determined by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso western zzso analysis showed that only zzso expressed the zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso was found to inhibit growth in all 3 cell lines in a dose dependent zzso The zzso of zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso cells, zzso This growth zzso effect was found to be independent of the cell zzso zzso protein expression level of the cells zzso In zzso cells, the expression of the cell cycle regulatory zzso zzso zzso was down regulated by incubation with 80 zzso zzso for 24 zzso
