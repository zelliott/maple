Although zzso zzso zzso provide high-level zzso efficacy to many cell types, extremely high doses of Ad are required for sufficient gene zzso into several tumors, including zzso Here, we demonstrated that the expression of zzso zzso a primitive zzso was very low in zzso and human melanoma zzso We also found that zzso Ad containing the zzso zzso sequence in the fiber zzso remarkably zzso gene zzso efficacy in melanoma cells by targeting zzso In addition, zzso injection of zzso zzso Ad containing the tumor necrosis factor alpha gene zzso revealed dramatic zzso efficacy through zzso necrosis in an established zzso zzso zzso melanoma zzso zzso required one-tenth the dosage of zzso to induce an equal therapeutic zzso These results suggest that zzso Ad will be a very powerful tool for the advancement of melanoma gene zzso
