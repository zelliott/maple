zzso zzso zzso are zzso with zzso as zzso zzso zzso which are less zzso as plant or bacterial toxin components of classical zzso In this study, we show the generation and production of the first entirely human zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso The zzso construct was produced in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso cells, yielding up to 4 zzso soluble protein after zzso by protein A affinity zzso zzso exclusion zzso revealed a zzso of the predicted molecular zzso Surface zzso resonance analysis revealed an affinity to zzso of zzso of less than 1 zzso for both the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein by zzso zzso cells was demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso cell line zzso was strongly inhibited by zzso zzso protein zzso zzso The zzso is a promising candidate for the zzso of zzso zzso because of its expected low zzso good production yields, and potent zzso function upon target cell binding and zzso Its modular design is set to target other zzso tumor zzso using different zzso zzso
