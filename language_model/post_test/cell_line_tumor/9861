zzso has been widely studied in melanoma, with various degrees of zzso One of the most common approaches is the so-called zzso which is associated with increased zzso but without overall survival zzso Another conventional strategy is the use of chemotherapy as an zzso to enhance the effect of cancer vaccines or adoptive cell transfer zzso Based on this approach, recent studies using chemotherapy to prepare the host before the infusion of ex zzso melanoma zzso zzso zzso and high dose zzso resulted in an impressive response zzso However, the development of zzso for the treatment of a broad range of cancer type is still zzso In this study, we report the development of a simple yet universal approach termed zzso zzso that has potential application in the treatment of all cancer zzso This technique uses zzso activated zzso T cells as a zzso before the administration of zzso zzso enhancement of the zzso effect of zzso drugs, either active or zzso as single agents, was observed both in in zzso and in zzso human tumor zzso zzso zzso factors zzso from activated zzso T cells, likely acting on the tumor and its zzso were responsible for the observed zzso Although zzso played a major role in the therapeutic outcome, it was consistently found to be inferior to the use of activated zzso T cells in tumor zzso Our model may provide a plausible mechanism to facilitate further understanding, design and development of improved zzso in the treatment of zzso
