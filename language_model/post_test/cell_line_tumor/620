The zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies of some novel zzso zzso against zzso zzso Carcinoma zzso cells were zzso In zzso results revealed that compounds 10, 6 and 4 were the most potent zzso against zzso zzso Moreover, in zzso evaluation of compounds 6 and 10 proved their capability to zzso the blood picture in comparison to zzso a well known zzso zzso These novel zzso zzso were zzso designed with the goal of having significant potent zzso effect against zzso zzso To develop a zzso model capable of identifying the key molecular zzso associated with the biological activity of the novel zzso zzso and predicting the zzso effect for other novel zzso zzso against zzso cells, different zzso models, using different zzso and zzso molecular zzso were zzso Different molecular zzso were predicted solely from the chemical structures of 16 zzso and zzso zzso following the prediction of the equilibrium molecular geometry of each analog at the zzso level using zzso functional energy and double zzso zzso polarized zzso basis zzso It was found that zzso moment, zzso energy, the energy value of zzso zzso accessible surface area, and heat of formation were the key molecular zzso in zzso the zzso effect of those compounds against zzso
