Long zzso zzso zzso are zzso expressed and have important functions in pathological zzso The present study investigated the zzso profiles and the effects of zzso zzso on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso profiles of each cell group were described by zzso zzso Numerous zzso expressed genes were observed by zzso in three cell zzso zzso significantly reversed the zzso zzso and zzso expression signatures, shown by zzso zzso Moreover, 116 of these zzso and zzso zzso expressed zzso were zzso Six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were confirmed by zzso Furthermore, functional studies showed that zzso zzso exhibited a negative effect on zzso zzso indicating that zzso might be a direct target of zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso were reversed during zzso zzso in zzso cells, suggesting that zzso have important functions in zzso zzso Thus, zzso could serve as a good zzso
