zzso in gene expression are frequently encountered in zzso zzso and have been zzso studied as they can reflect different experimental or clinical zzso zzso of the often subtle changes in zzso zzso content is performed through comparison with the expression of zzso zzso The appropriate choice of these zzso controls zzso zzso zzso is critical for meaningful quantitative zzso zzso The most important characteristics of zzso genes are that they are present in all cells and that their expression levels remain relatively constant in different experimental zzso However, no single zzso gene always zzso stable expression levels under all experimental zzso zzso it is necessary to characterize the suitability of various zzso genes to serve as internal zzso controls under particular experimental conditions where zzso effects are being zzso 

It was the aim of this study to determine the zzso of a number of zzso genes for their use as internal standards in cancer zzso 

The expression of the zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso were compared with the expression of the more commonly used zzso zzso zzso We examined a number of cell lines and tumor versus matched normal tissue samples using real-time quantitative zzso 

Our findings suggest that in cell lines, all three of the studied zzso genes can be used as an internal zzso When comparing tumor tissue samples with matched normal tissue samples, we validated zzso zzso zzso as the best choice for a zzso zzso 

Since gene expression studies are becoming increasingly important in the clinical environment, especially in cancer diagnosis and treatment, the use of an reliable zzso gene in these studies to zzso gene expression is zzso We conclude that a bad choice of zzso gene may lead to errors when interpreting experiments involving zzso of gene zzso Our study demonstrated the usefulness of zzso as an zzso control when comparing tumor tissue samples with normal tissue zzso
