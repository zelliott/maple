zzso abundance for a number of genes is increased by zzso acid zzso From an array screening study in zzso human zzso cells, it was established that one set of genes affected by zzso acid availability is the set associated with zzso zzso The present study describes the increased expression of both zzso and protein for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in response to deprivation of zzso cells for a single essential zzso acid, zzso The increase in zzso and zzso zzso content depended on de zzso protein synthesis and involved a zzso zzso stabilization zzso For zzso increase in zzso by zzso depletion appeared to be independent of zzso zzso and the absolute level of zzso protein was unaffected by this zzso zzso limitation caused an increase in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso signal zzso zzso resulted in a reduction in the zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso target of zzso pathways also blunted the increase in zzso zzso zzso These results document the zzso zzso control of the synthesis of specific zzso regulators and help to explain the block at zzso phase after zzso acid zzso
