The zzso transition zzso contributes to the zzso progression of cancer cells including acquisition of the ability to undergo zzso However, whereas zzso zzso factors zzso are known to play an important role in the zzso progression of zzso tumors, their role in zzso tumors remains largely zzso We show that expression of the gene for zzso is zzso in human zzso and zzso zzso with zzso potential in mouse zzso zzso expression of zzso in highly zzso zzso zzso cells induced a slight zzso of cell growth in zzso but markedly suppressed tumor formation in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells with a low zzso potential promoted tumor formation in zzso suggesting that zzso functions as a tumor zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso induced expression of zzso which has been reported as a tumor zzso zzso zzso by mouse zzso cells zzso zzso inhibited expression of the zzso gene as well as invasion in mouse embryonic zzso and forced expression of zzso in zzso cells suppressed zzso gene expression in tumor zzso Data from the present study suggest that zzso zzso formation of a zzso conducive to tumor growth and thereby zzso zzso in zzso
