By zzso two-dimensional liquid zzso mass zzso zzso with zzso zzso mass tagging zzso we have greatly increased the zzso zzso and sequence coverage of zzso methods for zzso zzso The dynamic range and zzso of this zzso quantitative approach were evaluated by profiling the zzso with different ratios of zzso coli cells grown in either regular or zzso zzso A zzso high zzso MASCOT data analysis tool was developed for zzso data sorting and zzso We investigated the early stage of zzso by inducing the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso through the analyses of the relative ratios of the zzso isotope signals that were originated from the control and labeled zzso zzso In zzso zzso run, zzso proteins were zzso identified, and more than half of them were zzso A noteworthy change in the quantitative profile was that zzso and a zzso zzso protein zzso which are involved in DNA zzso break zzso repair were significantly zzso in the zzso zzso cells, suggesting the detection of zzso in the zzso zzso The quantitative profiling efficiency of this approach was compared with the zzso quantitative analysis zzso
