Previously, several important roles for zzso have been described for the biology of primary brain zzso For example, zzso has been suggested to promote zzso cell proliferation by the zzso of the zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso zzso In the present study, we determined the potential regulatory roles of the zzso zzso protein zzso in the zzso system in relation to cell death of brain tumor cells through zzso of the zzso by genetic zzso 

With zzso analysis and validation of gene expression of particular genes using real-time zzso we found effects because of small zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in human zzso zzso cells on gene expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso We also applied zzso zzso to silence zzso in rat zzso zzso cells and zzso the effects on DNA zzso indicative of zzso because of zzso zzso 

In particular, the effects of zzso zzso in human zzso cells related to zzso metabolism indicate a net effect of a reduction in zzso levels, which may potentially protect the cells in question from cell zzso The zzso zzso in zzso cells showed that zzso is required for the induction of zzso because of zzso zzso 

These findings show that interactions between the zzso and the zzso system may play a role in tumor development of zzso zzso This may also have implications for our understanding of the involvement of the zzso in secondary brain damage and neurodegenerative zzso
