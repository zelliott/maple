To investigate the possible role of zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso activity human prostate zzso cell line zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso activities of human prostate zzso cell line zzso cells were determined using a reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and transient gene expression zzso were used to study gene expression of the zzso The putative response element for gene expression was identified using reporter zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso study revealed that zzso zzso zzso treatment for 16 h inhibited the zzso activity of zzso which induced the zzso of zzso utility and cell proliferation of zzso zzso Although results from transient gene expression zzso showed that zzso treatment zzso gene translation by approximately zzso through the iron response element pathway, zzso and reporter zzso showed that zzso treatments inhibited protein and gene expression of zzso This effect was reversed by zzso with zzso ammonium zzso Additional reporter zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggested that a putative metal response element in the promoter of the zzso gene was involved in the regulation of zzso on the gene expression of zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso acts as an zzso of iron, zzso the zzso activity and gene expression of zzso and zzso metabolism in the zzso
