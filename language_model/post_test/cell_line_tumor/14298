zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso is widely used as a zzso agent in the treatment of peripheral vascular zzso In the present study, we investigated the in zzso effects of zzso on zzso melanoma cell zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso 

The toxic range of zzso was evaluated using zzso test and colony formation zzso The cell cycle study of zzso treated cells was carried out using flow zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso melanoma cells was carried out on zzso zzso zzso zzso The relative levels and activity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined by gelatin zzso and western zzso 

zzso significantly inhibited the in zzso proliferation of zzso cells in a concentration dependent manner and displayed an zzso of zzso zzso zzso concentration of 1-3 zzso of zzso for an exposure of 24 h demonstrated significant changes in cell zzso A significant zzso in zzso phase transition was observed on zzso zzso zzso zzso cells showed zzso in zzso to zzso components and markedly inhibited the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso 

The results suggest that zzso even at zzso pharmacological zzso acts as an effective zzso agent with significant zzso and zzso zzso
