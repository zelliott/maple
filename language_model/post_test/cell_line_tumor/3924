The majority of patients diagnosed with advanced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with resistant disease, and there are no zzso that possess clinical utility to identify or monitor these zzso This study aimed to identify zzso proteins zzso collected from human zzso cell lines that differ in their inherent platinum zzso 

zzso proteins collected from zzso medium from zzso cancer cell lines that vary in their sensitivity to zzso were zzso with zzso and zzso by liquid zzso mass zzso for zzso zzso 

Of the zzso proteins identified, 16 possessed significant differential zzso ( zzso between the zzso and zzso cell zzso A number of these were verified by zzso including zzso which was also found to be associated with worse zzso survival zzso zzso and overall survival zzso zzso as assessed from publicly available transcript expression data from zzso cancer zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso cells resulted in the identification of a novel candidate zzso zzso The expression level of zzso zzso to worse zzso and zzso and is predicted to reside in peripheral circulation making this an attractive candidate for validation in zzso as a zzso of zzso resistance and poor zzso
