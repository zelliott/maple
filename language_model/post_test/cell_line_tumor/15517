zzso a programmed cell death, is an important control mechanism of cell zzso zzso in zzso is one of the key features of cancer cells, allowing cells to escape from zzso zzso of zzso signaling zzso has been a target of zzso drugs in an induction of zzso zzso zzso has been reported to decrease the viability of cancer cells and zzso zzso tumor zzso However, the mechanism of the zzso effect is still zzso To evaluate whether the zzso of zzso is related to induction of zzso the effect of zzso on zzso pathways was investigated in zzso breast cancer zzso zzso cells had an zzso of zzso zzso compared to zzso Studies of intrinsic zzso zzso showed that zzso can activate the intrinsic checkpoint protein zzso enhance the level of zzso protein zzso and release zzso c from zzso to zzso however, zzso has no effect on the level of zzso protein zzso Further studies also demonstrated that zzso can activate the key zzso player, zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso or zzso inhibitor suppressed the cell death induced by zzso while zzso with zzso inhibitor completely zzso the effect of zzso on cell zzso This report provides evidence that zzso zzso zzso via zzso of both zzso and zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso
