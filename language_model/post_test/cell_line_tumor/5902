zzso are used as zzso indicators in breast zzso Following engagement with zzso zzso zzso their signaling influences numerous cellular processes including migration, zzso and zzso zzso signaling varies between cell types through differential expression of zzso zzso and changes within a given cell upon exposure to a cell zzso or through changes in its zzso These variations in signaling can profoundly affect the zzso zzso and zzso properties of cancer zzso In the present study, we investigated if there were differences in the expression of zzso zzso structures, and zzso zzso within three breast cancer cells and if these differences zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso cell growth factor zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso cancer zzso cells was measured by flow zzso Cell zzso was assessed using zzso zzso zzso and zzso coated zzso Changes in zzso levels following zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso of zzso were determined by western zzso zzso Distribution of zzso stress fibers and focal zzso was assessed by zzso 

All cells expressed zzso zzso while high zzso and zzso expression was restricted to the cancer cells and high zzso and zzso expression was restricted to zzso zzso The two zzso cells were the least zzso but all cells zzso well to most proteins in the absence of zzso All zzso cells expressed activated zzso but only zzso zzso cells expressed high zzso zzso zzso treatment resulted in zzso changes in activated zzso levels, and only zzso cells zzso expressed high levels of activated zzso zzso cells formed more stress fibers and focal zzso and only exhibited zzso zzso of zzso and zzso All cells expressed the zzso zzso but zzso cells had markedly higher zzso zzso zzso induced differential expression of zzso zzso and zzso 

This study demonstrates that breast zzso vary in their expression of zzso their capacity to form focal zzso and to signal through zzso These differences likely contribute to zzso variations between cancer lines and account for some of the zzso of breast zzso
