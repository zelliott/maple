A small subset of cells with zzso expression is thought to have increased zzso and zzso features of cancer stem cells zzso the molecular mechanisms by which these properties arise remain zzso We characterized zzso zzso cancer cells based on zzso analyses of zzso zzso Of the genes zzso in zzso cells compared with zzso cells, we noted several key factors involved in the aggressive behavior of cells, including zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses identified a zzso population zzso with zzso features in zzso cells, and they were found to be more enriched in zzso cells than zzso zzso In particular, zzso cells exhibited higher zzso and zzso activity than zzso zzso zzso invasion zzso revealed that zzso cells have enhanced invasive capacity with elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso largely abolished the invasive capacity of zzso cells, but not zzso cells due to low levels of zzso zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that increased zzso and zzso potential of zzso cells are at least partly attributed to an enriched SP fraction as well as increased zzso zzso These results will be of assistance in the establishment of molecular target therapy to zzso in zzso zzso
