Capitalizing on cellular zzso to cancer is a promising strategy for targeting zzso cells for zzso monitoring and therapeutic zzso zzso zzso neural zzso cells zzso demonstrate a zzso for cell zzso tumors, but their affinity for zzso tumors is zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso accumulate in zzso tumors at levels zzso by optical zzso Mice bearing solid tumors after transplantation with zzso leukemia cells and zzso controls received zzso fluorescent zzso zzso daily for zzso days, were zzso then zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso and flow zzso to detect tumor cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso consisted primarily of zzso cells and demonstrated mild fluorescence, corresponding to frequent clusters of zzso zzso zzso Both transplanted and control mice demonstrated the highest fluorescent signal in the zzso and other zzso of the zzso zzso zzso However, only rare zzso zzso cells were detected in the mildly zzso transplanted zzso and none in the control zzso suggesting that their high zzso signal reflects the zzso of zzso zzso The mildly zzso transplanted zzso demonstrated low fluorescent signal and rare zzso zzso cells whereas control zzso were zzso zzso indicate that zzso accumulate in zzso containing zzso tumor cells in a manner that is zzso by ex zzso optical imaging and zzso to the level of tumor zzso suggesting a capacity to home to zzso zzso As such, zzso could have significant clinical applications for the targeted diagnosis and treatment of zzso
