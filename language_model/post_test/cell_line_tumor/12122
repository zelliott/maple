zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso is a hallmark of many zzso including familial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a well-known zzso protein that has been described recently as a potential inhibitor of this signaling zzso Here, we show that zzso directly zzso zzso and zzso the zzso signaling zzso in zzso cancer cell lines bearing zzso on the zzso zzso coli zzso gene as a model of zzso zzso zzso We then explore the relationship between zzso and zzso of this zzso and show that they are not zzso These results seem to contradict a zzso study, showing that zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso cells leads to zzso To reconcile our conclusions with the literature, we further show that a truncated zzso of zzso capable of zzso the zzso signaling zzso in zzso cells is incapable of inducing zzso in these cells, confirming that zzso zzso is zzso to the zzso of the zzso signaling zzso Finally, we show that zzso directly zzso cell death on primary zzso zzso tumor cells in zzso This phenomenon is also independent of the zzso of the zzso signaling zzso Considering the current lack of effective treatment against zzso tumors, we advocate that zzso gene therapy represents an attractive new therapeutic approach for this zzso
