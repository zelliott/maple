The components of zzso zzso zzso zzso have been shown to possess zzso zzso zzso we attempted to explore the zzso effect and underlying mechanism of a low molecular weight zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso invasion zzso was applied to evaluate the effect of zzso on migration of zzso zzso cancer cells in zzso In zzso the zzso effect of zzso was investigated in mouse zzso melanoma and a zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso and protein levels of zzso zzso or zzso upon zzso treatment were detected by real-time zzso and zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced the invasion of zzso zzso In zzso zzso was revealed to decrease lung zzso zzso in mouse zzso melanoma zzso In the zzso zzso mouse tumor model, we further demonstrated that zzso treatment of zzso inhibited the growth of tumor on treated side but also suppresses the zzso of zzso tumors on the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso reduced zzso but enhanced zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso displays zzso activities, indicating the potential of its clinical application for the prevention and treatment of cancer zzso Its zzso effect may relate to the zzso on zzso and zzso
