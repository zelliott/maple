To investigate whether zzso zzso zzso generated in zzso and fused with zzso zzso tumor cells zzso zzso line) could induce a better zzso protective effect compared to similarly generated zzso zzso with zzso zzso with or without zzso of a class B zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso were zzso with zzso zzso prior to intravenous administration 14 and 7 days prior to tumor zzso Separate zzso received zzso zzso fused to zzso zzso zzso zzso were administered zzso that were zzso or fused with tumor cells on days 14 and 7 prior to tumor zzso Some zzso were zzso with zzso zzso at the time of DC zzso 

All DC vaccines significantly improved survival zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso There was no difference in the zzso protective response between mice that received zzso vs fused zzso zzso vs zzso zzso Both DC vaccines generated a fivefold increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso precursor cells and significantly zzso zzso zzso higher mean zzso of zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso improved the survival of mice receiving the fused zzso zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso Surviving mice were zzso and found to be resistant to lethal tumor zzso 

DC vaccine strategies may be effective in generating zzso zzso No advantage was observed between zzso and tumor zzso zzso zzso may provide an zzso effect depending on the type of DC vaccine zzso
