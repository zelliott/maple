Here we present the first evidence showing that zzso cells can be zzso trapped in a single focused zzso beam with an orientation that is defined by the zzso A zzso zzso cell (in zzso is trapped and is zzso in the focus of a zzso polarized zzso beam with a waist of dimension smaller than the radius of the zzso The cell reaches a position relative to the focus that is dictated by the nucleus and nuclear zzso Our studies illustrate that the force exerted by the optical tweezers at locations within the cell can be predicted zzso the data obtained in this way is consistent with the experimental zzso
