Active manipulation of cells, such as zzso zzso and isolation, is essential for various zzso zzso zzso we report a hybrid zzso technique for manipulating zzso cells in zzso zzso This technique applies a combination of negative zzso force and zzso drag force induced by zzso which is effective in zzso biological zzso With a zzso zzso the stable equilibrium positions of cells can be adjusted for separation and focusing zzso Cancer cells and white blood cells can be positioned and isolated into specific locations in the zzso under both zzso and dynamic flow zzso To investigate the sensitivity of the hybrid zzso process, zzso zzso frequency, and bias zzso of the cell zzso were studied zzso The zzso of the hybrid zzso technique for manipulating cells in zzso samples is demonstrated by continuous focusing of human breast zzso spiked in zzso zzso zzso and processed blood samples with zzso capture zzso
