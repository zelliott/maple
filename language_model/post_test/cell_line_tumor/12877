zzso is the most common zzso pediatric brain tumor and is one of the leading causes of zzso mortality in zzso Treatment failure mainly occurs in children harboring zzso tumors, which typically carry an zzso 17 or gain of zzso a common hallmark of intermediate and high-risk zzso Through zzso expression zzso we identified zzso and zzso protein 1 zzso as one of the most zzso genes on zzso zzso in tumors with zzso zzso In an independent validation cohort of 101 zzso samples, the abundance of zzso zzso was significantly associated with zzso gain, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein expression was analyzed by zzso in a large cohort of patients zzso zzso zzso and high protein expression levels were found to be strongly correlated with zzso gain, zzso zzso and inferior overall and zzso zzso In zzso experiments in zzso cell lines showed a strong reduction of cell migration, increased zzso and decreased proliferation upon zzso zzso by small interfering zzso zzso further indicating a functional role for zzso in the progression and zzso dissemination of zzso
