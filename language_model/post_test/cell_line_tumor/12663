To determine whether the combination of zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso is more effective than either individual agent and to evaluate the effect of drug sequencing in zzso cancer cell lines and in mouse zzso 

For in zzso studies, three zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso were grown with either 10 zzso zzso or zzso zzso 1, 3 or 10 zzso or vehicle zzso and subsequently treated with 10 zzso zzso or zzso zzso 1, 3, or 10 zzso or zzso zzso was zzso In the zzso treatments were given for a total of 5 weeks: vehicle control, zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso followed by zzso and simultaneous zzso and zzso zzso were survival, zzso and tumor zzso zzso expression was analyzed by Western zzso 

In two cell lines zzso zzso the sequence of zzso and zzso administration did not significantly alter the zzso percentages and the combination was not superior to individual zzso However, in one cell line zzso the most effective combination in achieving zzso was zzso followed by low dose zzso In the mouse model, both control and zzso alone treatment groups were inferior to zzso and the combination treatment groups, but no significant differences were observed between the groups receiving both zzso and zzso based on the sequence of zzso 

The efficacy of the combination and sequence of zzso and zzso administration was cell line dependent and suggests that responses vary based on tumor specific zzso
