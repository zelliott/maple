zzso of human zzso growth factor zzso type 2 zzso in zzso zzso possesses well-documented zzso and zzso zzso zzso imaging of expression can provide valuable diagnostic information, thereby influencing patient zzso Previously, we reported a zzso display selection of a small (about 7 zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso which binds zzso with zzso zzso and demonstrated the feasibility of targeting of zzso zzso using zzso zzso The goal of this study was to develop a method for zzso zzso of zzso using the zzso zzso which was incorporated into zzso using zzso zzso and evaluate the targeting properties of the zzso zzso 

zzso was assembled using zzso solid phase zzso zzso zzso zzso of the agent was performed using zzso zzso zzso studies and circular zzso A procedure for zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso was zzso zzso targeting was evaluated by zzso study and gamma camera imaging in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was compared 6 h zzso 

zzso zzso possessed an affinity of zzso zzso for zzso zzso The zzso was zzso with zzso with an efficiency of about zzso zzso zzso retained capacity to bind specifically zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso showed specific zzso targeting with a contrast similar to a zzso analogue in mice bearing zzso zzso zzso camera imaging demonstrated clear and specific zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso of a zzso zzso sequence during chemical synthesis enabled zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with preserved targeting zzso
