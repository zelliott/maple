The zzso zzso zzso zzso acid human zzso growth factor zzso binds the zzso growth factor zzso zzso is zzso and zzso to the zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between zzso zzso DNA damage, and zzso in cells exposed to zzso 

Breast cancer cell lines with a range of zzso expression levels were exposed to zzso or zzso The cell lines zzso by number of zzso per cell in zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The proportion of zzso zzso into the nucleus was measured by cell zzso DNA zzso breaks were evaluated using the zzso zzso zzso survival zzso were used to measure zzso 

All data are presented as mean zzso zzso The amount of zzso that zzso to the nucleus (in zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells incubated with zzso zzso zzso 43 zzso for 20 h was 131 zzso 6, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The number of zzso zzso per nucleus was 35 zzso 15, 19 zzso 10, and zzso zzso zzso zzso A reduction in the surviving fraction zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso cells after exposure to zzso zzso zzso 43 zzso for 20 h has been zzso The zzso of zzso cells after exposure to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for 20 h was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was the most sensitive of the cell lines to zzso with an zzso after 2 zzso of zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso The number of zzso zzso per nucleus in zzso cells correlated with the zzso specific activity, and incubation time of zzso 

DNA damage caused by zzso zzso with the zzso expression level of the exposed cells and with zzso specific activity, and incubation time of zzso The zzso zzso may be a useful zzso to predict and monitor the outcome of treatment with zzso
