zzso of zzso gene is under the control of distinct zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso 3' zzso zzso zzso The active enhancers and expression of zzso is generally considered to be restricted to B zzso However, accumulating evidence indicated that zzso cancer cells, including zzso zzso zzso cell lines, express zzso The mechanisms underlying the expression of zzso in zzso cells remain zzso On the basis of our previous finding that expression of zzso light chain in zzso cells can be zzso by zzso zzso membrane protein zzso through the zzso of zzso and zzso signaling zzso we thus use zzso cells as model to further explore the molecular mechanisms of zzso cells expressing zzso zzso 

In this study, zzso reporter zzso containing human zzso zzso zzso and its zzso plasmids containing zzso binding sites for zzso factor zzso or zzso were zzso zzso reporter zzso demonstrate zzso zzso is active in zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso expression can zzso the activity of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso or zzso site within and downstream the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso pathways by their respective chemical inhibitor zzso and zzso as well as stable or transient expression of zzso zzso of I zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso or of zzso zzso indicate that both sites are functional and zzso zzso zzso activity is partly regulated by these two zzso zzso shift zzso show that zzso promotes zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso family members zzso and zzso binding to the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso motifs in zzso zzso Both chemical zzso and dominant negative zzso targeting for zzso and zzso pathways can zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso using nuclear extracts from zzso cells reveal that zzso and zzso zzso and zzso proteins interact with each other at zzso zzso zzso zzso further demonstrate zzso and zzso binding to the zzso motif as well as zzso and zzso binding to the zzso motif of zzso zzso gene in zzso 

These results suggest that human zzso zzso is active in zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso and zzso zzso results in an zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso promotes the interactions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso factors with the human zzso zzso zzso region are important for the zzso of zzso light chain in zzso zzso zzso zzso
