Recently, zzso expression of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso has been shown in several human zzso In this report, we show that zzso is expressed at various levels in six different human breast cancer cell zzso In order to investigate the function of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso breast cancer cells, the zzso interference technique was used to knock down zzso expression zzso zzso of zzso expression caused a significant increase in spontaneous zzso in zzso cells, whereas zzso and zzso cells remained almost zzso Furthermore, zzso expression analysis using a cancer profiling array showed zzso of zzso expression in cancer samples of breast, zzso and zzso whereas zzso zzso expression was identified in stomach, zzso zzso lung and zzso zzso In addition, zzso studies using a zzso zzso on human breast cancer specimens also revealed that zzso is expressed in the majority of zzso Moreover, to zzso whether zzso expression is zzso zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso and zzso this showed no significant changes in zzso zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that zzso expression is zzso zzso in different zzso and that zzso plays an important role in preventing certain breast cancer cells from undergoing zzso Thus, the development of novel therapeutic strategies based on targeting zzso gene expression in breast cancer could be restricted to selected individual cancer zzso
