The zzso zzso factors, zzso and zzso zzso is zzso zzso are zzso and critical for the cellular differentiation of zzso or zzso zzso It has been reported previously that in zzso transgenic or knockout mice, zzso zzso levels are zzso correlated with zzso zzso Recently, we found that zzso zzso expression can suppress zzso a human zzso zzso cell line, zzso although the underlying molecular mechanisms were zzso In the present study, we show that several zzso induced by zzso zzso expression directly bind to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to destabilize these zzso finally leading to their zzso Using zzso analysis, we found that several zzso that were zzso predicted to target zzso zzso are zzso by zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso Among these zzso we identified zzso zzso and zzso as having the potential to suppress zzso through the binding of the zzso to its zzso zzso simultaneous zzso of both the zzso and zzso sites in the zzso zzso were shown to be sufficient to block zzso zzso The results of the present study suggest a unique feature of zzso in which they contribute to zzso by limiting the levels of zzso factors belonging to the same gene zzso
