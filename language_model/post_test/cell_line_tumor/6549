zzso zzso and nuclear zzso were originally identified in zzso zzso tissue zzso with zzso zzso zzso DNA amplification of zzso was also found in other solid zzso We have recently shown that nuclear zzso of zzso is a specific molecular zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Lin, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 22, zzso However, the molecular mechanism of zzso nuclear zzso remains zzso In this study, we observed that tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso a fraction of zzso nuclear zzso in human breast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso indicated that an zzso site resides in the zzso 5 zzso zzso This study also demonstrates that zzso activated by zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso and that zzso zzso subsequently complexes with zzso to enter the zzso Either zzso of zzso or depletion of zzso blocks zzso nuclear zzso In zzso these findings characterize a molecular linkage that directs zzso nuclear zzso in response to zzso zzso
