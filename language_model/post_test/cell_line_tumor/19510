zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso is known to be highly expressed in breast cancer zzso zzso zzso the specific zzso for zzso can inhibit cell proliferation and induce zzso This study was to investigate the possibility of using zzso one of zzso as the zzso of zzso in the treatment of zzso zzso zzso negative breast zzso 

zzso zzso and flow zzso were used to examine the cell proliferation and zzso in two zzso negative breast cancer cell line zzso and zzso zzso were treated with either zzso or zzso alone or zzso with zzso and zzso Western zzso analysis was used to assess the expression level of zzso The migration potential of cells with different treatments was analyzed by the wound healing zzso 

The effect of zzso on zzso cell proliferation of breast cancer cells was enhanced by zzso with zzso in the range of 4 zzso to 24 zzso The 50% zzso concentration zzso of zzso was reduced to zzso when combined with zzso compared to the treatment with zzso zzso Treatment of cells with zzso or zzso alone could not induce significant zzso However, the zzso indexes of zzso and zzso cells zzso with zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso further zzso the expression level of zzso and inhibited cell migration zzso 

zzso could not only augment the effect of zzso on zzso cell proliferation and inducing zzso but also suppress the migration of breast cancer zzso zzso may sensitize the effect of zzso on breast cancer zzso
