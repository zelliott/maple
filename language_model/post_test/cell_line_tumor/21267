zzso zzso identified a novel transcript, designated as zzso whose expression is absent in normal colon and colon zzso but that is commonly induced in zzso colon zzso These findings were validated by real-time zzso and Northern zzso analysis in an independent panel of colon cancer zzso In addition, zzso expression was found to be elevated in many other common cancer types, including breast, zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso revealed it to have a nuclear zzso In a pull-down zzso zzso DNA zzso 2 zzso an important zzso in the base zzso repair zzso pathway, was identified as a partner protein that binds to zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis confirmed the binding between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using deletion zzso we find that zzso binds to the first 25 zzso acids of the zzso zzso zzso We suggest that zzso induction in cancer may contribute to the cancer zzso by interacting with the zzso zzso
