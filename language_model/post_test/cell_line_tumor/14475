zzso zzso zzso is an inflammatory zzso which signals through a zzso coupled zzso the zzso zzso zzso We have previously shown elevated zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso a common zzso zzso in Western zzso In this study, the expression of the zzso zzso motif zzso 20 zzso was determined to be regulated by zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and cell line, and expression of zzso and its zzso zzso was elevated in zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso The induction of zzso expression by zzso zzso in an zzso zzso cell line zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be dependent on the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear factor of activated zzso zzso zzso The treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso caused a significant increase in zzso Therefore these data demonstrate a role for the zzso zzso in regulation of the zzso zzso which can mediate proliferation of zzso zzso zzso zzso
