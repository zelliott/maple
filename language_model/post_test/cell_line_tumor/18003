The aim of this study was to determine the functional significance of zzso V zzso in defense against zzso stress and changes of its expression in human lung zzso We used in zzso cell cultures and retrospective analyses of human zzso samples to perform the zzso We found that stable clones of lung zzso cell lines zzso and zzso with reduced expression of zzso were prone to zzso zzso zzso of zzso decreased induction of DNA zzso breaks and protein zzso by cigarette smoke extract and hydrogen zzso zzso with zzso zzso protected zzso zzso zzso cell sheets from zzso in barrier zzso induced by zzso zzso In human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were increased during zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is an important zzso protein of lung zzso zzso Its expression in the human lung increases in zzso
