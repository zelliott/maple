Alternative zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene expression are both modified in zzso under zzso However, it is unclear if these phenomena are functionally zzso Using a zzso spotted zzso focused on zzso zzso we tested the effects of excess 3' zzso zzso of human zzso on zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso Of the tested zzso zzso and zzso showed modified expression levels zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso the zzso zzso zzso or the synaptic zzso zzso zzso Multiple transcripts zzso zzso rich zzso and zzso zzso regulators were suppressed in cells expressing either of these zzso whereas the gene groups including zzso zzso and transcripts involved in zzso displayed zzso zzso Our findings are compatible with the assumption that both zzso zzso and alternative zzso of zzso zzso may be zzso involved in initiating global changes in zzso alternative zzso causing subsequent modifications in the expression patterns of numerous target zzso
