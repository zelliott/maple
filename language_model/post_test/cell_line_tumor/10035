zzso is an element of the zzso zzso that impacts upon numerous cellular factors linked to clinical aggressiveness in zzso One such factor, zzso a master regulator of the zzso transition zzso has been implicated in key zzso biological processes such as invasion and zzso In this study we set out to investigate regulation of zzso in zzso and the importance of Snail in cell migration and clinical outcome in breast zzso 

Four breast cancer cell lines were exposed to zzso oxygen and expression of zzso markers was zzso The migratory ability was zzso following Snail zzso and zzso Snail expression was assessed in 500 zzso samples from zzso breast cancer patients, zzso to either 2 years of tamoxifen or no zzso zzso 

Exposure to zzso oxygen resulted in elevated levels of Snail zzso along with changes in zzso and zzso zzso and in addition increased migration of zzso zzso zzso of Snail increased the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso cells, whereas zzso of the protein resulted in decreased migratory propensity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, nuclear Snail expression was associated with zzso of higher grade and proliferation rate, but not with disease zzso Interestingly, Snail zzso was associated with impaired tamoxifen response zzso 

Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso Snail expression but generally not a migratory zzso suggesting that hypoxic cells are only partially pushed towards zzso Furthermore, our study supports the link between Snail and clinically relevant features and treatment zzso
