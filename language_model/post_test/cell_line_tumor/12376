The recent finding that the zzso locus gene encodes an array of different zzso zzso with apparently distinct and sometimes opposing cellular functions, might explain the difficulty in establishing the zzso role as tumor zzso Therefore we need to investigate the roles of each of these zzso zzso in cellular functions when expressed alone or in combination with other family members, as well as the genetic background on which the proteins are zzso We investigated, in two zzso zzso cell lines, the human zzso line zzso and a zzso derived from the human colon zzso cell line zzso zzso the effects of zzso zzso on cell growth and the response to zzso zzso We generated three different clones zzso zzso under a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso reporter zzso confirmed that clones zzso and zzso and zzso did express a functional, nuclear localized zzso zzso The stable zzso of zzso protein did not zzso any cell growth zzso zzso time of clones zzso zzso were comparable to counterparts not expressing zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso activity of different DNA damaging agents, such as zzso zzso light and zzso were comparable in clones expressing zzso or zzso The overall data argue against an zzso role for this zzso These findings are independent of the zzso status since they overlap with those previously obtained by our group in zzso cell lines, wild type for zzso
