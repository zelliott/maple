zzso zzso zzso genes belong to the zzso family of zzso factors, which play an important role in zzso and cellular differentiation during embryonic zzso The aim of this study was to explore the role of zzso in the regulation of zzso in human head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso The zzso and zzso gene were identified as being zzso in zzso tissue and cell zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso increased the levels of zzso zzso and zzso A zzso reporter zzso suggested that zzso induced activity of the zzso zzso A series of zzso promoter deletion zzso were examined and the minimal zzso region was identified to be in the zzso motif zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso of zzso using zzso led to the repression of zzso expression and induced zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells increased the resistance to zzso zzso Together, our findings suggest that zzso is an important mechanism of the zzso zzso via regulation of zzso zzso
