zzso cassette zzso A1 zzso mediates the zzso of lipids from cells to zzso zzso In this article, we characterize the effect of zzso on cellular zzso zzso zzso 

zzso inhibited cholesterol zzso up to zzso in zzso zzso expressing zzso In zzso zzso cells that contain scavenger zzso class B, type I, but not functional zzso we observed no effect of zzso on cholesterol zzso zzso inhibited cholesterol zzso from normal human skin zzso but not from zzso from a zzso zzso Fluorescent zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated that in zzso cells zzso impaired the zzso of zzso from zzso compartments to the plasma zzso zzso also inhibited the formation of an zzso cholesterol zzso sensitive plasma membrane zzso zzso with the zzso effect on zzso zzso to the plasma zzso zzso reduced cell zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We conclude that zzso is an effective inhibitor of zzso cholesterol zzso without influencing scavenger zzso class B type zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso to the plasma membrane may in part explain the reported in zzso zzso zzso action of zzso
