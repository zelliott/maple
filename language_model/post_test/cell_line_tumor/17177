To investigate the role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the invasion of zzso cancer cell lines, and to assess the zzso of this zzso in primary human zzso zzso 

Human zzso cancer cells were treated with zzso specific zzso or were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso The invasion of cultured zzso cancer cells was zzso by an invasion zzso zzso cancer cells lines and primary human zzso zzso were zzso for zzso zzso by western zzso 

A specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso suppressed the invasive properties of three highly invasive zzso zzso cell zzso Restoration of the zzso gene to invasive zzso zzso zzso cells or expression of a zzso version of the zzso zzso target, zzso also zzso inhibited invasion, indicating a central role for the zzso zzso zzso in this zzso In addition, zzso of primary zzso from patients with zzso cancer had markedly high levels of zzso zzso 

zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso drastically reduced the invasive capacity of zzso cancer cell zzso over half of primary human zzso zzso had high zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso of this zzso may contribute to the invasion of a significant subset of zzso zzso
