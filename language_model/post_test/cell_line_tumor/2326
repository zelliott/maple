Because of poor prognosis and development of resistance against zzso drugs, the existing treatment zzso for gastric cancer are zzso zzso novel agents that are safe and effective are urgently zzso Whether zzso can sensitize gastric cancer to zzso in zzso and in a zzso mouse model was zzso 

The effect of zzso on proliferation of gastric cancer cell lines was examined by zzso dye zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and gene expression by Western zzso The effect of zzso on the growth and zzso was also examined in zzso implanted tumors in nude zzso 

zzso inhibited the proliferation of various gastric cancer cell lines, zzso the zzso effects of zzso inhibited the zzso zzso of zzso and suppressed the zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In a zzso model of human gastric cancer in nude mice, we found that administration of zzso alone (1 zzso body weight, zzso 3 zzso significantly suppressed the growth of the tumor and this effect was further enhanced by zzso Both the markers of proliferation index zzso and for zzso density zzso were zzso in tumor tissue by the combination of zzso and zzso As compared with vehicle control, zzso also suppressed the zzso zzso and the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso our results show that zzso can zzso the effects of zzso through suppression of zzso markers of zzso invasion, zzso and zzso
