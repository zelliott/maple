zzso dissemination is a common zzso complication of pancreatic cancer for which novel therapeutic zzso are actively investigated, as there is no current effective zzso Thus, we zzso in a mouse model of pancreatic zzso zzso the therapeutic potential of a novel zzso gene therapy approach consisting of zzso zzso zzso of a combined suicide gene zzso Human zzso pancreatic cells zzso the zzso zzso zzso tumor marker were injected into the zzso cavity of nude zzso After 8 days, zzso zzso zzso was performed using zzso zzso zzso zzso with plasmids zzso the two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso the latter being expressed from a zzso cassette also zzso zzso coli zzso zzso Administration of the zzso was followed by treatment with the corresponding zzso zzso and zzso The results presented zzso demonstrate that zzso zzso can efficiently mediate gene zzso into zzso tumor zzso Indeed, zzso zzso was detected in tumor zzso zzso by zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso In addition, green fluorescent protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso were observed in the zzso tumor zzso following zzso of the corresponding zzso and zzso reporter zzso These expression analyses also showed that zzso expression lasted for about 2 weeks and was preferential for the tumor zzso this tumor preference being in good agreement with the absence of obvious zzso zzso Most importantly, mice receiving the full treatment scheme zzso zzso suicide genes and zzso had significantly lower serum zzso levels than those of the various control groups, a finding indicating that zzso zzso progression was strongly reduced in these zzso In conclusion, our results demonstrate the therapeutic efficiency of zzso zzso zzso of a combined suicide gene system in a mouse zzso zzso model and suggest that zzso zzso gene therapy approaches may constitute a potential treatment zzso for patients with zzso zzso and minimal residual zzso
