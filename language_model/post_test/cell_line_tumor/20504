zzso is a major inflammatory zzso implicated in zzso inflammation and zzso However, the exact origin and role of zzso on zzso inflammation and zzso are still not well zzso Recently, we reported that zzso and zzso zzso interact in zzso zzso zzso In this article, we investigated whether zzso of zzso signaling by zzso in primary zzso zzso obtained from normal and cancer patients play a critical role in regulation of proliferation and zzso of human zzso zzso cancer zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso level was significantly higher in cancer associated zzso than that in normal zzso with or without stimulation of zzso a powerful zzso of zzso Using in zzso zzso for zzso zzso and invasive potential, we discovered that the proliferation and zzso of the zzso cancer cells were much greater when the cells were zzso with cancer associated zzso than with normal zzso with or without stimulation of zzso Further analysis indicated that the major zzso product, zzso zzso directly enhanced proliferation and zzso of the zzso cancer cells in the absence of zzso Moreover, a selective zzso zzso zzso blocked the zzso and invasive effect of both normal and cancer associate zzso on the zzso cancer cells, with or without stimulation of zzso Those results indicate that zzso of zzso signaling in the zzso plays a major role in promoting proliferation and zzso of the zzso cancer zzso In this process, zzso is involved in the zzso of zzso signaling induced by zzso in the zzso
