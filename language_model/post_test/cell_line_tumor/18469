Previous liver zzso studies demonstrated that the mouse zzso box zzso zzso zzso factor regulates zzso proliferation through expression of cell cycle genes that stimulate zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrated that disruption of the zzso zzso zzso site at zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced both zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso of this zzso zzso zzso zzso site was found to be essential for recruiting the zzso zzso zzso binding protein zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with these findings, dominant negative zzso protein significantly reduced zzso zzso activity and inhibited zzso recruitment of the zzso zzso zzso Likewise, zzso stimulation of zzso activity together with elevated levels of the zzso zzso protein provided a zzso synergistic increase in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso within an zzso motif zzso zzso to zzso inhibited recruitment of zzso complexes and caused significant reduction in both zzso zzso activity and in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso zzso activity requires binding of either zzso or zzso zzso complexes to mediate efficient zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is essential for recruitment of zzso zzso zzso
