zzso zzso zzso is the most common zzso cancer but despite recent advances in therapy the overall survival remains about 20 zzso Whole zzso zzso sequencing studies zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso pathways zzso for driving tumor growth in over zzso of zzso In spite of various zzso being zzso or altered in the majority of zzso clinical studies have not been able to demonstrate efficacy of molecular targeted therapies using zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso of multiple downstream signaling pathways has been implicated as a possible means by which zzso of a single zzso has been ineffective in zzso In this study, we sought a combination of approved drugs that would inhibit in zzso and in zzso growth of zzso zzso A combination consisting of zzso and zzso acted zzso in zzso growth of zzso zzso in zzso zzso was the only zzso inhibitor that could induce zzso in zzso zzso However, the in zzso efficacy testing of the zzso and zzso combination in an zzso zzso wild type zzso zzso model revealed that zzso alone could significantly improve survival in animals whereas zzso did not show any survival zzso zzso testing of the same drug combination in a different zzso zzso model that lacked zzso amplification but was more susceptible to zzso in zzso demonstrated no survival benefit when treated with zzso or zzso or the zzso and zzso zzso Although a modest survival benefit was obtained in one of two animal models with zzso amplification due to zzso alone, the addition of zzso to test our best in zzso combination therapy, did not translate to any additional in zzso zzso zzso targeted therapies, with drug properties favorable to zzso tumors, are likely required to form effective drug combinations for zzso
