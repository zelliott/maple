zzso of zzso E1 zzso is associated with poor outcome in breast, zzso and other solid zzso and is the most prominent structural zzso associated with primary treatment failure in high-grade zzso zzso cancer zzso We have previously shown that zzso tumors show zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso Here, we explore targeting zzso as a novel therapeutic strategy in zzso zzso and mechanisms of zzso 

We examined the effect of zzso suppression using zzso interference and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cancer cell zzso To identify mechanisms of resistance, we derived zzso independent resistant zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso cells were extensively characterized by gene expression and copy number analysis, zzso cell sorting profiling and conventional zzso In addition, we explored the relationship between zzso amplification and zzso using data from primary zzso 

We validate zzso as a therapeutic target in zzso cells by showing selective sensitivity to suppression, either by gene zzso or using zzso zzso In addition, we identified two resistance mechanisms, one involving zzso of zzso and another novel mechanism involving selection of zzso cells from the zzso tumor zzso Our analysis of zzso data shows that zzso is a feature of cancer zzso with zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso is an important therapeutic target in zzso but that resistance to zzso zzso may emerge due to zzso of zzso target protein and through zzso cellular zzso
