zzso zzso zzso is mainly caused by zzso to zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso Previously, we isolated an zzso zzso with zzso zzso that inhibited both a rat zzso zzso which recognizes the main zzso region on the zzso and zzso patient zzso from zzso zzso on human zzso In this study, secondary zzso and binding motif of the zzso were zzso and moreover, various zzso zzso forms were generated to figure out sequence and structure requirements of the zzso Then, we found that intrinsic structure formation and sequence composition of the selected zzso zzso specific to the zzso are required for the zzso activity to inhibit the zzso zzso destruction of cell surface zzso zzso we identified zzso minimized zzso version, which can efficiently protect cells from the effects of the zzso and could be zzso zzso for zzso zzso
