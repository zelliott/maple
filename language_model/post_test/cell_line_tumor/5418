This paper describes modifications to a zzso imaging microscope that extend its capabilities into the zzso zzso zzso The major changes include installing a zzso zzso device camera, and zzso and filters appropriate for infrared zzso zzso of the system and validation with lead zzso quantum dots of known zzso wavelength is zzso zzso from the breast zzso cell line zzso were scanned with lead zzso quantum dots that emit at zzso zzso as the background and an image which contains the integrated spectral data is zzso We also demonstrate that this instrument is capable of detecting the zzso zzso of zzso carbon zzso dispersed in zzso zzso
