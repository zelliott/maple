zzso peptides containing zzso and zzso zzso have been shown to be effective carriers for DNA and zzso We anticipate that zzso of the binding mechanism of zzso with zzso will provide greater insight into the zzso and delivery of the zzso zzso zzso bonds between zzso zzso and zzso acids may enhance the stability of zzso zzso We first compared the zzso zzso properties of a zzso zzso with those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso experiments, gel zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso maintained its integrity with prolonged incubation in serum, whereas zzso in complex with zzso was zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of various peptides binding to zzso at pH zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso with zzso was initially zzso whereas zzso zzso exhibited an zzso reaction at initial zzso The zzso interaction indicates formation of zzso bonds between zzso and zzso purely zzso interaction is zzso and zzso To investigate the type of zzso bond, we studied the zzso state of zzso rings of a selectively zzso labeled zzso zzso by zzso single quantum zzso zzso The peak of zzso zzso of zzso shifted downfield (in the direction of zzso by zzso zzso with addition of zzso providing direct evidence that zzso formed hydrogen bonds with zzso at zzso zzso These results establish that zzso peptides form hydrogen bonds with zzso thereby enhancing the stability and biological activity of the zzso in zzso and in zzso
