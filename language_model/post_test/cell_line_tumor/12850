The direct detection of native proteins in zzso solutions remains a challenging zzso Standard zzso rely on a separation step to circumvent zzso signal zzso We hypothesized that a simple and general method for the detection of native proteins in solution could be achieved through zzso zzso where the conditional signal generation afforded by zzso reporters could be married to the specificity afforded by either native receptors or specific zzso Toward this goal, we describe a solution phase zzso zzso for native protein zzso where we fused fragmented halves of zzso zzso to separate zzso fragments or zzso zzso allowing for conditional zzso zzso in the presence of several biologically significant protein zzso To demonstrate the utility of this strategy, we have developed and validated zzso platforms for the vascular zzso growth factor, the zzso coat protein from zzso and the human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso a marker for breast zzso The zzso of the recognition zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso employed in the zzso sensor allowed us to parse zzso from different zzso Our rationally designed zzso sensing platform was capable of discriminating between zzso expression levels in several tumor cell zzso In addition, zzso from zzso zzso was linear across a panel of cell lines with increasing zzso zzso We envision that the proof of principle studies presented zzso may allow for the potential detection of a broad range of biological zzso utilizing zzso zzso zzso
