zzso a zzso is the key zzso required for the zzso of zzso and small interfering zzso and is essential for both zzso development and cell zzso Recent evidence indicates that zzso may also be involved in zzso However, no studies have examined the clinical significance of zzso at both the zzso and the protein levels in breast zzso 

In this study, the biological and zzso value of zzso expression was assessed in breast cancer cell lines, breast cancer progression cellular models, and in two zzso sets of breast zzso samples obtained from patients with long-term follow-up using tissue zzso and quantitative reverse zzso 

We have found that zzso protein expression is significantly associated with hormone zzso status and cancer zzso in breast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso expression appeared to have an independent zzso impact in zzso disease zzso zzso zzso In the breast cancer cell lines, lower zzso expression was found in cells zzso a zzso zzso and in zzso bone derivatives of a breast cancer cell zzso These findings suggest that the zzso of zzso expression may be related to the zzso spread of zzso 

Assessment of zzso expression may facilitate prediction of distant zzso for patients suffering from breast zzso
