We describe the biological activity of some zzso and zzso zzso on zzso cells and healthy rat liver zzso The effects of zzso on cancer cells zzso Liver zzso zzso were assessed by measuring cell death zzso cell zzso zzso contents of zzso and zzso and the activity of zzso were used to determine the type of cell zzso Most of the zzso tested (at a concentration of 25 zzso induced zzso cell death but compound 4 had no zzso zzso The levels of both zzso and zzso were severely affected by zzso 1, 2 and 5, while no effect was observed with compound zzso These zzso properties of zzso are associated with zzso properties as shown by the zzso energies and zzso Interestingly, no zzso effects of zzso were detected when the in zzso model of zzso liver slices zzso was zzso Indeed, although zzso activity was slightly affected, zzso and zzso levels as well as protein synthesis were not modified by zzso zzso a well-known zzso reduced these parameters by more than zzso compared to control zzso Taking into account the considerable zzso of zzso induced by most current zzso drugs, the selective zzso shown by compounds 1, 2 and 5, in particular that of 1, represents a safety factor that encourages the further development of these zzso as new drugs in cancer zzso
