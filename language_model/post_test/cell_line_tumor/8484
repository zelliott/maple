The growing recognition of zzso of translation initiation as a new and promising paradigm for zzso zzso zzso is driving the development of zzso specific, and zzso zzso The zzso were recently reported as potential zzso of the zzso zzso complex assembly and zzso zzso was identified as the zzso agent of this zzso zzso we report our continuous effort to further develop this zzso by exploring the structural latitude toward different polar and zzso zzso Many of the novel compounds are more potent than the parent compound in the dual zzso zzso complex reporter zzso activate downstream zzso of reduced zzso complex zzso and inhibit cancer cell proliferation in the low zzso zzso Moreover, some of these compounds are decorated with zzso that are known to zzso favorable zzso properties and as such are good candidates for evaluation in animal models of human zzso
