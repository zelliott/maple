To construct zzso expression zzso of small interfering zzso zzso targeting zzso and investigate zzso of zzso cell line zzso zzso by the zzso zzso 

According to the sequence of the coding region of zzso zzso two strings of 19 zzso of zzso sequence zzso the loop sequence of two complementary zzso zzso were designed and zzso to form hairpin construct as the DNA templates for the target zzso The zzso templates were cloned into zzso expression zzso zzso and the resulted zzso zzso was zzso into zzso cells using zzso following the standard zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso were performed to evaluate zzso gene zzso induced by zzso zzso at the zzso and protein levels, zzso zzso zzso analysis with zzso double zzso was used to determine the cell zzso 

zzso zzso and Western zzso revealed significantly lowered zzso expression at both zzso and protein levels in zzso zzso cells, which exhibited a significantly higher zzso rate after zzso as shown by flow zzso zzso 

zzso interference zzso by the zzso expression zzso zzso can significantly reduce zzso expression and induce remarkable zzso in zzso zzso
