zzso acts via the zzso zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in human reproduction by stimulating the synthesis and zzso of zzso from zzso zzso Studies have also suggested that it has other zzso zzso To date, the zzso regulation of human zzso gene in the brain remains largely zzso Recently, the human zzso zzso cell line zzso is found to express zzso We report here for the first time that zzso is also expressed in this zzso cell zzso Treatment with zzso zzso zzso the zzso of both zzso and zzso in the zzso Moreover, transient zzso of various human zzso zzso zzso into the cells identified an upstream promoter region located between zzso and zzso Important zzso regulatory elements were found at zzso and zzso zzso as deletion of either region caused a dramatic decrease in the promoter zzso An upstream zzso promoter element was identified to be important for zzso zzso in the human zzso zzso cells, in contrast to the previous finding that a downstream promoter is responsible for the zzso zzso Furthermore, we showed that zzso zzso zzso significantly zzso the zzso promoter activity and zzso of protein zzso C zzso zzso by zzso could also zzso the promoter activity in zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso of the zzso by interacting with zzso may zzso zzso itself via the zzso zzso in human zzso zzso
