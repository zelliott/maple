This study demonstrates deregulation of zzso activity by the zzso zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso zzso is a soft tissue cancer associated with a zzso zzso zzso event that generates one of two fusion zzso zzso or zzso The role of the zzso products in this disease is poorly zzso We present evidence that the zzso fusion protein interacts with the zzso repressive complex and zzso its gene zzso zzso zzso causes zzso of the zzso zzso zzso resulting in impairment of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso target zzso zzso by zzso complexes plays a vital role in numerous zzso zzso In recent years, numerous reports have implicated gain of zzso zzso function in several zzso This study provides evidence that, in the appropriate context, expression of the zzso zzso leads to loss of zzso zzso It challenges the notion that cancer is solely associated with an increase in zzso function and suggests that any imbalance in zzso activity could drive the cell toward zzso These findings provide a mechanism by which the zzso zzso may contribute to zzso zzso zzso
