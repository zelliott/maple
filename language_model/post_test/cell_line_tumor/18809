The surface properties of the zzso zzso play vital roles in cellular behavior such as zzso zzso migration, proliferation and zzso While cell attachment and zzso onto surfaces are mainly zzso by surface molecular interaction, cell zzso and orientation are significantly affected by the topographical cues of the zzso We reported here the alignment of zzso zzso cells on polystyrene zzso zzso containing periodic zzso The zzso type structures (210 zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso were generated on polystyrene surface using zzso polarized laser radiation at zzso zzso The cultured cells were shown to align strictly along the direction of the zzso And there were distinctive features such as zzso zzso and zzso cell surface zzso revealed by zzso laser scanning zzso zzso atomic force zzso zzso and scanning electron zzso zzso The results indicated that ordered and continuous zzso on zzso can pattern cell, and guide cell alignment and oriented growth along zzso zzso The possible mechanism and significance of these observations were also zzso
