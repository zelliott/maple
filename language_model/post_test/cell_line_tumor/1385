zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are thought to play important roles in cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso Recent studies suggest that some of the known zzso map to a single zzso locale within a single zzso zzso But the roles of the cluster remain to be zzso In order to understand the role and mechanism of a cluster of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso the association of mature zzso and zzso expression with the risk for zzso cancer was evaluated in zzso patients with a zzso study, and target protein regulated by mature zzso was analyzed in zzso cell lines with zzso zzso reporter zzso The expression levels of zzso and zzso were determined in 110 pairs of zzso cancer zzso and adjacent normal zzso using real-time reverse zzso zzso The relative expression of zzso and zzso were statistically different between cancer zzso and matched zzso The combined expression of zzso and zzso was significantly associated with the risk for zzso zzso Meanwhile, the reduced expression of two zzso in tumor patient was supposed to have a trend of zzso zzso zzso The zzso pattern of zzso and zzso was analyzed with zzso zzso It showed a significant correlation between these two zzso expression both in zzso and tumor cell zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso indicated that zzso zzso 1 zzso could be zzso by zzso and zzso The protein level of zzso showed no significant linear correlation with zzso and zzso expression in zzso cell lines with Western zzso zzso In conclusion, since zzso and zzso could regulate zzso zzso and take part in the zzso of zzso the result suggested the combination variable of zzso and zzso as a potential zzso for earlier diagnosis and prognosis of zzso zzso
