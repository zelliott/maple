After arriving in a secondary site zzso cells may begin proliferating, undergo zzso or remain as solitary dormant zzso The process of zzso although dangerous, is extremely inefficient with the majority of the cells undergoing zzso and thus becoming clinically zzso Of the cells that begin proliferating, the few that make it past the zzso stage may be of immediate clinical zzso zzso cells, while not of immediate clinical concern, are believed to be at least in part responsible for cancer recurrence that can occur decades after apparently successful initial zzso zzso solitary cells are different from zzso zzso in which active proliferation is balanced by zzso The mechanisms of cell cycle regulation and the function of the molecules regulating this process are well zzso However, there is relatively little known about the mechanisms controlling cell cycle regulation and dormancy of solitary zzso zzso There are several inherent difficulties zzso the study of solitary zzso This review paper will examine the models used in the study of dormant solitary zzso cells, methods of imaging and studying these cells, the molecular mechanisms believed to be responsible for solitary cell zzso and finally the unique treatment challenges posed by these zzso
