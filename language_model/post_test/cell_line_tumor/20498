zzso is expressed highly in pancreatic cancer and implicated in tumor zzso zzso zzso can reduce tumor growth and augment zzso The precise function of zzso in tumors remains poorly zzso but it is implicated in tumor zzso evasion of zzso and induction of zzso transition zzso Current therapeutic regimens for pancreatic cancer are minimally effective, highlighting the need for novel treatment zzso Here, we report that zzso a novel zzso inhibitor in phase II clinical trials, significantly enhances the efficacy of zzso in zzso models of pancreatic zzso 

Human pancreatic cell lines were evaluated in zzso and in zzso for response to zzso zzso zzso therapy zzso + zzso zzso tissue underwent zzso analysis for cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso parameters were also zzso 

zzso zzso reduced the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in six pancreatic cancer cell lines tested in zzso Furthermore, zzso increased the zzso efficacy of standard combination therapy in several zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso combination therapy was only effective at reducing tumor growth and zzso in tumors with elevated zzso zzso In each model zzso treatment with zzso resulted in vascular zzso without a decrease in zzso density and promotion of an zzso zzso by tumor cells regardless of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso robustly reverses zzso and zzso standard therapy without reducing zzso density and warrants further clinical evaluation in patients with pancreatic zzso
