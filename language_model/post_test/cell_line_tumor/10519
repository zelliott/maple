Lung cancer is the leading cause of zzso mortality and requires more effective molecular markers of prognosis and therapeutic zzso Special zzso binding protein 1 zzso is a global zzso organizer that recruits zzso zzso proteins to zzso regulate hundreds of genes in a zzso zzso zzso studies suggest that zzso zzso is a predictor of poor prognosis in breast cancer, but the zzso significance of zzso expression has not been evaluated in lung zzso 

A cohort of zzso lung zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso of zzso was examined in cell lines by zzso zzso and zzso A treatment, and zzso zzso 

zzso loss of zzso expression was found in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso cell lung zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with matched normal zzso zzso Loss of zzso independently predicted poor zzso survival in zzso cell zzso zzso hazard zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso p zzso zzso Treatment of lung cancer cell lines with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso A resulted in zzso of zzso zzso was associated with a decrease in the active zzso mark zzso zzso zzso and an increase in the repressive zzso mark zzso zzso in a SCC cell line relative to a normal zzso zzso cell zzso 

This is the first study showing that zzso expression is lost in early zzso zzso zzso and that loss of zzso is associated with poor prognosis in lung zzso We zzso that the zzso gene is zzso silenced through zzso zzso
