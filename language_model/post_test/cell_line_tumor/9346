We recently reported that zzso is able to bind with several proteins involved in regulating zzso zzso networks, including zzso zzso beta zzso and zzso Based on these findings, we investigated how zzso regulates the zzso zzso and promotes zzso zzso This study demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso requires zzso acids zzso at the zzso zzso which is also essential for zzso binding and zzso complex zzso zzso of zzso into zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, after deletion of the zzso binding region zzso zzso failed to zzso at the membrane edge and was unable to promote zzso formation, suggesting that the zzso binding region in the zzso zzso is essential for the formation of zzso zzso networks and regulation of the zzso zzso at the leading edge of zzso
