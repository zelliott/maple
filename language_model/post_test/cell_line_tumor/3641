zzso virus zzso zzso display distinct patterns of virus zzso gene expression that reflect the complex interplay between the virus and its host zzso In the zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso membrane protein zzso is consistently expressed whereas the zzso zzso protein appears to be restricted to only a proportion of zzso In an attempt to understand the contribution of zzso to the zzso of zzso we established zzso cell lines zzso infected in zzso with either a zzso zzso zzso zzso or a zzso zzso in which zzso is deleted zzso An zzso pattern of zzso gene expression including zzso but not zzso was consistently observed in zzso cells infected with zzso However, zzso cells infected with zzso expressed high levels of zzso from the signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with this effect, zzso zzso activity was reduced in zzso zzso cells, and this repression was relieved in the absence of zzso This zzso of zzso activity correlated with the ability of zzso to inhibit the zzso zzso of zzso from zzso cell zzso zzso zzso was able to induce expression of zzso by means of zzso zzso both in zzso zzso cell lines and in the zzso zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso suppression of zzso was a consequence of zzso zzso These data reveal that zzso zzso two key zzso factor pathways in zzso cells and suggest that this finding may be important in the zzso of zzso zzso
