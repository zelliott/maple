zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso are zzso proteins involved in zzso inflammatory zzso The function of the family member zzso zzso recruitment domain containing protein 5 zzso remains a matter of debate, particularly with respect to zzso zzso type I zzso and zzso I zzso To address the role of zzso we generated zzso mice zzso In this article we show that these animals exhibit slightly decreased zzso T cell zzso a zzso compatible with zzso zzso I zzso Of interest, zzso zzso only mildly affected zzso I expression on zzso and, zzso zzso zzso efficiently primed zzso T zzso In contrast, zzso zzso dramatically impaired zzso expression of zzso I in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was sufficient to induce zzso I expression in a human zzso cell line, requiring both zzso recruitment and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso localized to the nucleus and occupied the zzso promoter region of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso I zzso the elimination of zzso zzso by zzso T cells was markedly reduced and, in addition, we observed low zzso expression in several zzso and human zzso tumor cell zzso zzso loss of zzso expression represents an advantage for evading zzso T zzso elimination by zzso of zzso I zzso mechanism that may be exploited by transformed zzso Our data show that zzso acts as a key zzso regulator of zzso I in zzso and support an essential role for zzso in directing not only innate but also zzso immune zzso
