A common feature of the zzso zzso gene family is complex zzso architecture with multiple alternate zzso zzso zzso 9 has 18 distinct transcripts zzso 15 zzso with two transcripts zzso and zzso zzso the same zzso We have previously reported that the ratio of these distinct transcripts is altered in zzso with the zzso transcript being the usual form in normal cells but zzso becoming zzso in zzso This led us to ask what the functional differences between these two transcripts might zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso have distinct zzso ends zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso and 2 zzso and a common 3' region and initiating zzso zzso within zzso zzso Here we show that the two zzso are translated with different efficiencies and that cellular stress can alter zzso A putative internal zzso entry site can be identified in the common region of the zzso and zzso zzso and translation is modulated by an upstream zzso frame in the unique region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso map to the region which is common to the two zzso These zzso dramatically enhance the zzso efficiency of the zzso zzso leading to elevated zzso protein under hypoxic zzso Our data provide a zzso insight into how the zzso zzso can alter the fine control of zzso protein and its regulation under zzso relevant conditions and are consistent with the episodic and zzso nature of the clinical features of zzso
