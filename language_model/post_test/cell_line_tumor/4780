zzso cells zzso are the most potent zzso cells zzso for the initiation of zzso zzso immune zzso In most studies, mature zzso are generated from bone zzso cells or peripheral zzso in either case, the harvested cells are then cultured in medium containing zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso days and zzso with zzso zzso However, this approach is time-consuming and zzso There is another less cost approach of using immobilized DC cell lines, which can easily grow in the zzso A disadvantage with the immobilized DC cell lines, however, is that they are immature zzso and lack expression of zzso class II and zzso zzso and zzso zzso This, therefore, limits their capacity for inducing efficient zzso zzso In the current study, we investigated the possible efficacy of various stimuli zzso zzso zzso and zzso in converting the immature zzso cell line zzso to mature zzso Our findings were quite interesting since we demonstrated for the first time that zzso was able to stimulate the maturation of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso cells have capacity to zzso zzso class II, zzso zzso and zzso and to more efficiently stimulate in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso T cell responses and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells may prove to be useful in the study of DC biology and zzso zzso
