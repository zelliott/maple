zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso is the zzso factor for zzso translation zzso which is known to regulate zzso zzso zzso and its negative impact on prognosis in human zzso cell lung cancer zzso have been reported zzso However, its potential as a therapeutic target and role in regulation of sensitivity to zzso zzso is an area of ongoing zzso In this study, we detected increased levels of zzso in 16 human zzso cell lines compared with their normal zzso zzso zzso zzso human tissue array analysis showed that zzso expression was significantly higher in human zzso zzso than normal zzso zzso of zzso using zzso zzso inhibited the growth and invasion of zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso plays a crucial role in positive regulation of the growth and invasion of zzso zzso By zzso we found that zzso levels were elevated in zzso cell lines compared with the sensitive parental cell zzso In agreement, assembly of the zzso cap complex and several zzso proteins regulated by the zzso translation zzso were also increased in zzso zzso Thus, zzso cells exhibit elevated zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso of zzso with different means zzso gene zzso zzso zzso expression and partially restored cell sensitivity to zzso suggesting that elevated zzso contributes to development of zzso resistance, likely through positive regulation of zzso zzso Taken together, we suggest that elevated zzso in zzso cells is associated with zzso invasion and acquired zzso zzso
