Three drugs were compared for their efficacy in treating zzso transitional cell zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene therapy treatments utilizing zzso zzso where the zzso zzso zzso promoter was used to drive the expression of zzso zzso forms of zzso 3 and 9, were compared with treatment zzso employing zzso zzso zzso and zzso When administered via zzso only the gene therapy regimen was found to be effective at restricting tumor progression following a zzso incubation of tumor zzso zzso was also administered via the diet to allow for systemic delivery of the zzso The most zzso zzso use tested yielded tumors with masses of zzso versus the gene delivery method, which yielded tumors with masses of zzso zzso The difference was significant zzso zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso zzso gene therapy system could efficiently bypass the zzso zzso barrier and more effectively inhibit tumor growth and development than either zzso or zzso zzso zzso data further demonstrated that the gene therapy system could effectively inhibit tumor growth and zzso life zzso
