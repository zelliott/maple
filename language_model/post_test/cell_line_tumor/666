zzso cancer remains a leading cause of death despite its relatively low zzso As in many other solid tumors, zzso is critical to the growth and zzso of this zzso Through serial in zzso passages in mice, we have developed a highly aggressive zzso of human pancreatic cancer cell line zzso which shows more rapid primary tumor growth, faster time to zzso and more rapid zzso than the parental cell zzso The zzso zzso developed a much denser tumor zzso early during growth within the zzso Interestingly, examination of the in zzso growth of this aggressive zzso yielded no significant difference from the parental cell zzso zzso zzso evaluation of genes involved in zzso revealed a zzso increase in zzso expression in cells derived from the zzso zzso when compared with the parental cell zzso These findings provide direct evidence that elevated capability for zzso zzso by specific changes in gene zzso can lead to a large increase in cancer aggressiveness and resulting zzso These findings have important implications for the treatment of zzso zzso
