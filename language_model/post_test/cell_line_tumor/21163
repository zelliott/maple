The pathways that allow zzso zzso cancer cells to survive during prolonged dormancy periods are zzso Here, we identify the zzso factor zzso as a pivotal survival factor for zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for the adaptation of dormant cells to chemotherapy, nutritional stress, and, most importantly, the in zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso and zzso contribute to regulating nuclear zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in dormant cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso survival through the zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso signaling independent of zzso zzso of zzso or zzso reverted dormant tumor cell resistance to zzso and induced pronounced killing only of dormant cancer cells in zzso zzso down zzso also prolonged the survival of nude mice bearing dormant tumor zzso zzso survival signaling by the zzso zzso in dormant tumor cells may favor the zzso of residual disease during dormancy zzso
