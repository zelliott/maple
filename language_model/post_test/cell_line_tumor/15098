zzso zzso with zzso zzso domain 2 zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso binding zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Previously, we identified zzso as being zzso in human breast tumors relative to normal zzso zzso Upon further investigation within the zzso zzso zzso subset of these breast tumor samples, we found that zzso zzso expression was elevated in those associated with poor zzso In light of this zzso we investigated the effect of elevated zzso levels on zzso zzso While zzso zzso of zzso in three zzso breast cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso did not alter cell proliferation in complete media, growth was markedly enhanced in the absence of zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso demonstrated reduced sensitivity to the growth zzso effects of the selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso zzso zzso activity was elevated in zzso cells and was further increased upon the addition of zzso Similarly, zzso and zzso expression of the zzso genes zzso factor 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso was higher in cells zzso zzso zzso with this zzso zzso analysis revealed higher zzso levels of zzso localized to the zzso and zzso promoters in cells with zzso zzso of zzso and these levels were elevated further in response to zzso zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso functions as a zzso zzso of zzso in breast cancer cells and that its increased expression in tumors may result in zzso zzso zzso thereby reducing zzso dependence and response to zzso zzso
