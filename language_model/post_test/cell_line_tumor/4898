zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a cell zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibit zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 adherence to zzso type II lung zzso zzso zzso A random zzso zzso library expressed by zzso zzso was screened with zzso Eleven of 30 zzso zzso inhibited zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso The insert zzso sequence of 9 of these zzso matched the zzso zzso zzso zzso when aligned against the human zzso A zzso zzso a putative zzso region of zzso zzso inhibited 2 genetically and zzso unrelated pairs of zzso and zzso zzso zzso strains from binding to zzso zzso Moreover, zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso and lung colonization and, zzso pneumonia development in the mouse zzso zzso model zzso These data indicate that zzso is an zzso zzso zzso and that zzso is its host zzso
