zzso zzso are molecules able to induce zzso in several cancer cell zzso However, their short zzso and the rapid zzso and zzso within bone, limit its use as zzso agent for zzso zzso Here we proposed a new delivery system to avoid zzso zzso into the bone, thus improving zzso zzso In this work, we used the zzso acid zzso a third generation zzso able to induce zzso at zzso zzso We developed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso based on zzso complexes with calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was achieved by two different zzso zzso zzso were covered with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were previously mixed with zzso zzso and then zzso by zzso method zzso zzso The zzso were fully characterized in terms of mean diameter and size distribution, zzso zzso zzso zzso effect on different cell zzso zzso zzso showed the best technological zzso with a narrow size distribution and a high zzso zzso Moreover, on different cancer cell lines, these zzso enhanced the zzso effect of zzso Finally, in an animal model of prostate cancer, a significant reduction of tumor growth was achieved with zzso zzso while the tumor was unaffected by zzso in zzso
