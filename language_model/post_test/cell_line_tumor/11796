Our previous studies demonstrated that zzso zzso the zzso of cancer stem cells identified as cells with high zzso zzso activity zzso zzso from the human zzso cell line zzso We further investigated whether zzso is capable of inducing bone formation in zzso zzso zzso zzso sorting was used to isolate zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso the gene zzso A zzso model was used to verify the bone formation in zzso There was significantly higher zzso expression of zzso and zzso in zzso cells compared with that in zzso cells and the zzso expression in zzso cells was zzso higher compared to that in zzso zzso zzso was also found to induce higher zzso of zzso markers zzso zzso zzso alkaline zzso zzso and collagen type I in zzso cells compared to zzso cells, which were zzso by the zzso zzso signaling zzso In zzso zzso was identified to induce bone formation in both zzso and zzso zzso All animals receiving 1 zzso zzso zzso cells treated with 30 zzso of zzso per animal showed bone formation within 1-2 weeks after injection in zzso Bone formation induced by zzso in zzso cells showed significantly more bone mineral content compared to that in zzso zzso zzso zzso bone formation in zzso zzso cells and zzso may have a promising therapeutic role for treating human zzso by inducing differentiation along an zzso zzso
