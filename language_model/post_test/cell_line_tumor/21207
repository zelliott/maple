One of the major challenges in zzso is to minimize incomplete zzso near the edge of the zzso In the present study, the feasibility and effectiveness of an zzso zzso zzso zzso was investigated to enhance the zzso of zzso human breast cancer cell at mild zzso conditions via zzso zzso The effects of zzso addition on the phase change characteristics of zzso zzso mixture were investigated with a differential scanning zzso and zzso The results confirmed that a zzso mixture has two distinct zzso phase change events - zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso In addition, its effects on the zzso of zzso cells were investigated by assessing the zzso cellular viability after a single zzso cycle with various zzso zzso conditions due to different zzso zzso end temperatures and hold zzso The viability of zzso cells in zzso saline supplemented with zzso or zzso zzso without zzso remained higher than zzso zzso indicating no apparent toxicity was induced by the addition of zzso With zzso zzso supplement, the viability of the cells frozen to zzso degrees C decreased from zzso to zzso on the occurrence of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso for each zzso With zzso zzso supplement, the viability of the cells frozen to zzso degrees C showed similar trends to those with zzso zzso However, as the end temperature was lowered to zzso degrees C, the viability drastically decreased from zzso to zzso zzso for each zzso The influences of zzso zzso such as nucleation temperature, hold time and method were less zzso These results imply that the zzso zzso zzso of zzso can augment the zzso of zzso cells, and the extent of the zzso zzso is zzso
