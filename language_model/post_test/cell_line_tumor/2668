zzso suppression of zzso checkpoint protein activity results in zzso cell death arising from zzso failure, including defective zzso formation, zzso zzso and premature zzso zzso The recently identified zzso protein acts as a zzso checkpoint zzso via communication with the transient zzso zzso In the present study, we found that zzso zzso led to two distinct zzso changes, cellular zzso and zzso Because of a paucity of direct molecular link of zzso checkpoint to cellular zzso however, the present report focuses on the relationship between abnormal zzso checkpoint formation and zzso zzso by using susceptible tumor cell zzso zzso zzso was accompanied by zzso catastrophe with massive nuclear and zzso zzso The progression of the zzso was completely inhibited by the depletion of zzso and partly inhibited by the depletion of the tumor zzso protein zzso zzso zzso depletion caused a dramatic zzso conversion of zzso zzso into cell death through zzso catastrophe, indicating that zzso is a major zzso of zzso cellular zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso lacking the zzso binding region did not cause zzso Moreover, depletion of zzso by small interfering zzso induced zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso tumor cell zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso disruption and that these effects are dependent on a direct interaction of zzso with zzso Our results could be used to control tumor zzso
