zzso was expressed on the surface of zzso and zzso but not zzso human colon cell lines in response to zzso zzso as detected using flow zzso Surface expression was not detected under zzso conditions nor was heat shock an zzso of surface expression in the three cell lines zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso protein sequence was most closely related to another major zzso human zzso zzso zzso appeared to be recently diverged, as zzso for zzso have not been found in zzso zzso and zzso shared zzso zzso acid sequence identity in their predicted zzso regions suggesting that they bind the same zzso zzso perhaps in zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence differences were concentrated in the lid regions and the zzso zzso raising the possibility that zzso and zzso bind different zzso or cell surface zzso
