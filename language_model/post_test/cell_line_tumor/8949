zzso zzso factor A zzso the first zzso zzso factor from zzso zzso is closely related to zzso DNA zzso maintenance and zzso Recent evidence has shown that the ratio of zzso to zzso zzso is increased in both human cells and zzso zzso after zzso radiation zzso However, the underlying mechanism has not as yet been clearly zzso In the present study, we demonstrated that in human lung zzso zzso cells, expression of zzso was zzso together with the increase of the relative zzso copy number and zzso c zzso zzso activity after zzso zzso Furthermore, short hairpin zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the enhancement of the relative zzso copy number and zzso activity caused by zzso Taken together, our data suggested that zzso plays a crucial role in regulating zzso amplification and zzso zzso under zzso zzso
