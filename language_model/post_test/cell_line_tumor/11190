zzso fibers can be zzso with second harmonic generation zzso and are associated with efficient tumor cell zzso zzso locomotion along these fibers zzso with a more aggressively zzso zzso and changes in zzso zzso properties accompany changes in zzso zzso We therefore attempted to zzso the cellular and molecular machinery that influences zzso in order to understand how the zzso of tumor collagen fibers is zzso By zzso zzso and zzso zzso from tumors grown in mice with and without zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso and in the presence or absence of zzso zzso zzso we determined that depletion of zzso alters tumor collagen zzso zzso as zzso by zzso and zzso Furthermore, we determined that zzso of zzso expression by tumor zzso cells also alters zzso zzso and that subsequent depletion of zzso has no further zzso In each case, zzso burden correlated with optical zzso of collagen zzso Our results zzso zzso and zzso zzso as regulators of breast tumor collagen zzso and suggest that this regulation plays a role in tumor zzso Furthermore, these results indicate that zzso of zzso represents a useful strategy for evaluating the cells and molecular pathways responsible for manipulating zzso collagen in breast tumor zzso
