A major impediment to the successful treatment of zzso zzso alpha zzso breast cancer is the development of zzso zzso zzso the most commonly used zzso exerts its pharmacological action by binding to zzso and blocking the zzso action of zzso zzso in breast cancer zzso zzso treatment primarily zzso zzso zzso zzso and the surviving breast cancer cells commonly acquire tamoxifen zzso Numerous zzso mechanisms of acquired zzso resistance have been identified by in zzso zzso Our recent studies zzso Cancer zzso 2008; zzso now demonstrate that zzso (also referred to as zzso is critical to the development of zzso zzso Under conditions of compromised zzso including treatments with pharmacological zzso and zzso targeting of the zzso 1 zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was significantly zzso zzso is an active zzso of tamoxifen commonly used for in zzso zzso A zzso drug selection zzso using zzso as the selecting drug, established zzso breast cancer cell zzso Analysis of a representative resistant cell line showed an increased ability of the cells to sustain high levels of zzso zzso without progression to zzso zzso blockade of zzso function in the zzso zzso cells induced a robust death zzso These data provide strong evidence that zzso is a key mechanism of cell survival during zzso challenge and progression to zzso zzso We discuss the potential benefit of blocking zzso function to significantly reduce the emergence of zzso breast cancer zzso
