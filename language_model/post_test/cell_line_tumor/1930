Clinical progression of cancer patients is often observed despite the presence of zzso T zzso zzso zzso of the B7 zzso have been zzso to play a part in this zzso zzso One of these zzso zzso zzso zzso is widely expressed on tumor cells and has been shown to mediate zzso zzso However, attempts to correlate zzso tumor expression with negative prognosis have been zzso To better understand when zzso zzso contributes to the functional impairment of zzso zzso T cells, we varied the levels of zzso density and/or zzso expression at the surface of tumor cells and exposed them to zzso T cells at different levels of functional zzso We found that the gradual reduction of zzso zzso expression by zzso tumor cells increased the zzso of partially exhausted T cells to zzso zzso in zzso as well as in zzso In conclusion, chronically zzso zzso T cells become sensitive to zzso functional zzso upon low zzso zzso a setting which is likely involved during zzso zzso
