zzso cancer is the most lethal zzso zzso with a five-year survival rate below zzso for patients with stages III and IV zzso zzso key zzso of zzso cancer invasion and zzso is critical to the development of more effective therapeutic zzso We previously identified zzso A interacting protein zzso zzso as an important zzso of cell proliferation and zzso In addition, targeted expression of zzso in tumors inhibited tumor growth in zzso In our present study, we confirmed that both zzso and protein expression of zzso were zzso in zzso cancer cells compared with normal zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso correlated with the invasive potential of zzso cancer cell lines and clinical zzso cancer zzso We also provide evidence that DNA zzso is a mechanism by which zzso is zzso in zzso zzso The zzso island in the zzso promoter was heavily zzso in zzso cancer zzso zzso status of the zzso promoter was zzso correlated with zzso expression in zzso cell lines and clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso promoter following treatment with a DNA zzso agent was associated with restoration of zzso expression in zzso cancer zzso A zzso zzso zzso element binding protein zzso was shown to bind to the zzso site in the zzso island of the zzso zzso Overall, these findings suggest that zzso of zzso associated with DNA zzso is related with the invasive zzso in zzso cancer and that zzso of zzso expression has the potential to be a target for zzso cancer zzso
