zzso one of the three members of the zzso zzso zzso family, plays a critical role in the control of the cell cycle and in the checkpoint response to DNA zzso zzso is responsible for the initial zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso thus initiating the train of events leading to entry into zzso The critical role played by zzso is illustrated by the fact that it is specifically required for checkpoint recovery and that unscheduled zzso of zzso is responsible for illegitimate entry into zzso Here, we report that in zzso colon zzso cells, a moderate increase in the zzso level is sufficient to impair the DNA damage checkpoint, to increase spontaneous zzso and to sensitize cells to zzso radiation and zzso zzso Using a zzso cell zzso zzso as an alternative to animal studies, we demonstrate that the level of zzso expression zzso growth zzso and zzso zzso Since zzso zzso has been observed in a significant number of human zzso including colon zzso and is often associated with high grade zzso and poor zzso our work suggests that the expression level of zzso might be a potential key zzso of the cellular response to cancer zzso
