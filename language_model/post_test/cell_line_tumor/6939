Crude extracts of environmental samples contain stable and zzso zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso and show huge activities in the zzso zzso and these activities are higher than the chemically calculated induction equivalent zzso It is thought that not only unidentified zzso zzso but also mixture effect among compounds might contribute to these zzso In the previous work, we have indicated that zzso compounds in household sewage sludge zzso zzso may interact zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of mixture effects in a crude extract of zzso using the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 30, zzso In this study, we focused on zzso stable compounds such as zzso aromatic zzso zzso and zzso compounds such as zzso zzso zzso in the crude extract and investigated the zzso changes of mixture effects among compounds in environmental samples using the zzso zzso and zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso We confirmed that zzso zzso and zzso could be separated by zzso on a zzso zzso zzso To determine whether the activities of zzso zzso in environmental samples (including the zzso zzso could be assessed by the zzso theory, we compared the zzso activity of the crude extract with the zzso sum of the activities of all the zzso separated by zzso We confirmed a zzso of zzso activity at zzso zzso and zzso exposure zzso In contrast, zzso activity increased zzso at 6- and zzso exposure zzso zzso activity was zzso when the zzso activity of the zzso zzso showed a remarkable reduction resulting in a change of activity zzso In contrast, zzso was observed at a zzso exposure duration when the zzso activity of the zzso zzso showed neither remarkable reduction nor a change in zzso Our results suggest that differences in the zzso decomposition of compounds affected mixture effects on zzso activity in a crude extract from zzso zzso
