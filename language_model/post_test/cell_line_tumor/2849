This study aims to establish three-dimensional zzso cell culture models of human zzso and zzso zzso and to compare biological and zzso characteristics of these models with those of two-dimensional zzso models of the same cell lines and the primary zzso 

zzso models of zzso and zzso cancer cell cultures were established using a zzso Cell Culture zzso zzso profiling and differential zzso were used to characterize biological characteristics of zzso zzso zzso formed from these zzso These were compared to characteristics of the same cells established in zzso and of the primary zzso from which the cell lines were zzso 

zzso from zzso cell cultures appeared zzso similar to the primary zzso zzso profiling of multiple zzso including zzso zzso and zzso showed that patterns of protein expression in zzso resemble those of the primary zzso zzso profiling identified several zzso expressed protein markers between zzso and zzso zzso These included zzso which was zzso in zzso cultures suggesting cells zzso less compared to zzso cultures; and zzso and zzso 4, which were zzso in zzso cultures suggesting greater levels of zzso in zzso compared to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso models of cancer cell lines is likely to be of value for studying the molecular and biological mechanisms of zzso zzso progression and for testing novel molecular targets for cancer zzso
