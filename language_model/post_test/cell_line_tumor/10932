zzso zzso is very low in zzso cells and zzso and it might have a role in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation by acting through its zzso zzso zzso has been proposed as a zzso of zzso zzso It has been demonstrated that zzso can inhibit cell growth and induce differentiation in different zzso cell zzso The onset of zzso induced by zzso was accompanied by a reduction of zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso induced the zzso of cells in the zzso phase of the cell zzso Cell cycle progression is regulated by three protein classes, the zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso decreased the expression of zzso zzso zzso and A and caused an increase of zzso (the most important zzso zzso whereas it did not affect zzso zzso Since zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused an increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso binds and zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso caused a decrease of zzso zzso as well as an increase of zzso (and zzso family zzso bound to zzso with zzso repression of the zzso
