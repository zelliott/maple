To observe the effects of three zzso on the zzso of zzso cells induced by gamma zzso and investigate the relationship between zzso and zzso zzso 

Different zzso zzso zzso and zzso fusion protein were added into the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso flow zzso and DNA fragmentation zzso were used to observe the effects of zzso on zzso The zzso activity was determined with a zzso 

zzso zzso cells showed typical zzso characteristic of zzso demonstrated by transmission electron zzso and were accumulated in zzso zzso In the groups treated with growth factors after zzso three zzso significantly increased the viability rate, distinctly decreased the zzso rate and the proportion of DNA zzso When zzso cells were zzso by gamma zzso zzso activity was increased at different time zzso In comparison with the control group in which no growth factor was added after the cells were zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso cells was significantly inhibited by addition of the above zzso zzso hours after zzso in the control group, zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and two zzso fusion protein groups, the zzso rate was 73 zzso 11 zzso 15 zzso 13 zzso 12 zzso and 13 zzso The percent of fragmented DNA was 36 zzso 19 zzso 18 zzso 14 zzso 13 zzso and 14 zzso The zzso intensity was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso fusion protein could protect zzso cells from zzso induced by gamma zzso After zzso cells were zzso the zzso activity was significantly increased but was dramatically decreased by the above zzso The remarkable zzso of zzso activity may be one of the mechanisms of these zzso growth factors exerting their zzso zzso
