zzso approaches were used to identify genetic markers zzso of patients' risk for poor response prior to zzso 

We conducted zzso association studies zzso to identify zzso zzso zzso associated with cellular sensitivity to zzso through their effects on zzso expression using International zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso them in additional zzso zzso passing both stages of the zzso study were tested for association with zzso survival zzso in zzso Phase 1 validation was based on 377 zzso cancer patients receiving at least four cycles of zzso and zzso from the Australian zzso Cancer Study zzso Positive associations were then assessed in phase 2 validation analysis of zzso patients from the zzso Cancer Association zzso and The Cancer Genome zzso 

In the initial zzso zzso zzso were associated with zzso zzso of which 18 unique zzso were retained after assessing their association with gene zzso One zzso zzso was zzso in an independent zzso set zzso adjusted P zzso zzso It was found to be significantly associated with decreased zzso in phase 1 zzso patients zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso with a stronger effect in the subset of women with zzso zzso tumors zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso was also associated with poorer overall survival in women with zzso zzso tumors zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso However, this zzso was not significant in phase 2 validation analysis with patients from numerous zzso 

This study shows the potential of zzso zzso approaches to identify zzso zzso of treatment outcome and highlights the need for extensive validation in patients to assess their clinical zzso
