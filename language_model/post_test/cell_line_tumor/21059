Current zzso zzso zzso techniques require invasive needle placement and are limited by accuracy of zzso The purpose of this study was to test a novel non invasive zzso machine that uses zzso energy to zzso destroy zzso Gold zzso were designed and produced to facilitate tissue heating by the zzso 

A solid state zzso machine consisting of a power generator and zzso zzso which transmit zzso at zzso zzso was zzso Gold zzso were produced by zzso reduction and exposed to the zzso field either in solutions testing or after incubation with zzso zzso A rat zzso model using zzso cells and Fisher rats was employed using direct injection of zzso into the tumor to focus the zzso for select zzso Temperatures were measured using a fiber-optic thermometer for real-time zzso 

Solutions containing gold zzso heated in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso liver cancer cells cultured in the presence of gold zzso achieved adequate heating to cause cell death upon exposure to the zzso field with no zzso attributable to the gold zzso zzso In zzso rat zzso at 35 W using direct gold zzso injections resulted in significant temperature increases and zzso injury at subcutaneous injection sites as compared to vehicle zzso injected zzso 

These data show that non invasive zzso zzso zzso of cancer cells is feasible when facilitated by gold zzso Future studies will focus on tumor selective targeting of zzso for in zzso tumor zzso
