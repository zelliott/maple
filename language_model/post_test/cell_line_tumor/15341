Although zzso DNA zzso has been implicated in the zzso of lung cancer, the role of zzso in zzso resistance zzso of lung cancer has remained zzso To investigate whether certain distinct DNA zzso pattern is associated with acquired zzso of lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to compare the zzso promoter zzso of the human lung zzso zzso zzso zzso cells with its zzso zzso zzso The comparison identified zzso genes with zzso zzso promoter, of which zzso were zzso and zzso were zzso Then, zzso sequencing zzso chain reaction zzso zzso and quantitative reverse zzso zzso zzso were used to validate the promoter zzso of five candidate genes and to determine whether the expression of genes was associated with the promoter zzso zzso confirmed that the promoter zzso zzso of the zzso zzso G zzso zzso 56 zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso association domain family gene 1 zzso was significantly higher in zzso cells compared with zzso cells ( zzso zzso and zzso whereas no significant difference was found in that of the other two zzso zzso and BAD zzso and zzso Additionally, zzso showed that the zzso expression of the three zzso genes was significantly lower in zzso cells compared with zzso cells (all zzso In conclusion, this study reported for the first time that a distinct promoter zzso pattern is associated with zzso of lung zzso zzso cells and suggested that zzso zzso and zzso might be the potential zzso markers associated with acquired zzso of lung zzso
