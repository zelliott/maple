The spectral changes of native zzso among normal zzso and cancer cell lines of different zzso ability are investigated by zzso zzso The normal zzso moderately zzso zzso and advanced zzso zzso cell lines were each selectively excited at 300 zzso and their zzso zzso zzso are analyzed using principal component analysis to explore the differences of the relative contents of zzso and reduced zzso zzso zzso in these cell zzso The results show that the zzso zzso featured predominantly in the zzso zzso of the advanced zzso cancer cells in comparison with the moderately zzso cancer and normal zzso
