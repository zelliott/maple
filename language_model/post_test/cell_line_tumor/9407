To develop a small interfering zzso zzso delivery system with low zzso and high zzso efficiency, zzso was zzso to zzso zzso via a zzso linkage zzso to prepare zzso complex zzso zzso by condensing with a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso exhibited enhanced resistance to degradation from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso when mixed in an zzso phase, spontaneously formed zzso zzso zzso that have an inner core of charge neutralized zzso complex surrounded by a zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso was used to demonstrate zzso zzso gene zzso in prostate zzso cells zzso zzso The extent of gene zzso was gradually increased with increasing nitrogen to zzso zzso ratio and the concentration of zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso of zzso zzso could be widely applied for zzso delivery of various therapeutic zzso
