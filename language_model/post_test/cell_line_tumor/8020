We have been exploring the zzso effects of zzso zzso systems on breast cancer zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso substitution show particularly high activity, with zzso values in the low or zzso zzso range for both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso breast cancer cell zzso We now present the zzso X-ray crystal structures and zzso studies of analogous zzso or zzso zzso compounds with R zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso hydrogen bonding groups, the compounds have low, but zzso relative binding affinity values for the zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso as well as mildly zzso zzso binding in in zzso zzso zzso zzso All compounds show zzso zzso activity on the zzso cell zzso On zzso cells, the zzso complex zzso shows a reasonable zzso effect zzso zzso 11 zzso its zzso zzso is only slightly zzso zzso zzso 60 zzso while the zzso zzso and zzso derivatives have no zzso zzso properties, while they correlate somewhat with the resonance zzso abilities of the zzso are more strongly dependent on the presence of a zzso in the functional group, supporting our prior proposition that zzso zzso forms of the compounds could be active species in the zzso A correlation of the zzso potential of the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso of the zzso was zzso
