The aim of this work is to generate zzso zzso decorated with a synthetic version of zzso zzso which are often rich in zzso with its positively charged zzso zzso A zzso zzso with zzso as functional groups was prepared using zzso zzso as a building block, resulting in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain zzso zzso was employed to generate zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the first two blocks, which were subsequently chain extended with the zzso zzso to generate zzso with zzso functional groups on the zzso To simulate the actual zzso zzso which only carries zzso charges, the zzso group of zzso was zzso to convert the zzso zzso into a zzso zzso zzso For comparison, zzso based on zzso zzso with a third block with permanently zzso charges, zzso zzso zzso ammonium zzso zzso was zzso The zzso diameters of the zzso were approximately zzso zzso based on zzso and zzso A direct correlation between surface charge zzso potential zzso and zzso was zzso The zzso based on the zzso zzso were nontoxic zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso while the zzso version zzso with a high zzso charge zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso 7) were observed to be zzso The cellular zzso of the block zzso by zzso zzso cancer cell lines was found to be relatively fast (about zzso in 3 zzso reaching an equilibrium after approximately 30 zzso Both zzso with either zzso or zzso on the surface, showed an enhanced zzso compared to zzso with zzso as shell zzso In fact, the percentage of zzso was similar, with the difference that cells incubated with zzso with zzso zzso stayed alive, while zzso zzso led to significant cell zzso
