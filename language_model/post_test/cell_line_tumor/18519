zzso cancer gene therapy depends on the development of zzso efficient, tumor zzso specific systemic gene delivery zzso Our laboratory has developed a zzso zzso zzso complex that can effectively and zzso deliver its therapeutic payload to both primary and zzso zzso To further improve the zzso efficiency of this targeting complex, a synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designed to aid in zzso escape and zzso of DNA, was included in the zzso The presence of zzso increased the in zzso zzso efficiency over that of the original zzso Moreover, no increase in zzso was observed due to the presence of the zzso zzso In a zzso human prostate cancer zzso tumor model in zzso nude mice, inclusion of the zzso zzso did not interfere with the tumor targeting specificity of the zzso administered zzso zzso Most importantly, the level of zzso expression was significantly elevated in the tumors, but not in the normal tissue in those animals receiving the complex incorporating zzso The in zzso enhancement of zzso efficiency by this modified gene delivery vehicle could lead to a reduction in the number of administrations required for zzso zzso
