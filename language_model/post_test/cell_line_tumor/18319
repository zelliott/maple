zzso protein zzso zzso plays an important role in cell proliferation and cell zzso We have previously described a novel zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and its use as a zzso The aim of this study was to examine the effect of combination of zzso and a zzso agent on growth of human prostate zzso and pancreatic tumor zzso in zzso mice zzso and Colo zzso In zzso zzso mice, administration of a combination of zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso led to enhanced tumor growth zzso as compared with single agents zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso In prostate or pancreatic zzso mice, combination of zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso 5, zzso or 10 zzso zzso led to tumor zzso or enhanced growth zzso as compared with single agents zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso Colo zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso Combination of zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso with zzso zzso 75 zzso zzso also caused a significant tumor growth zzso in the two pancreatic zzso models studied zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso Colo zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment zzso 25 zzso zzso caused zzso of zzso protein expression in these tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso treatment per zzso also led to decreased steady state level of zzso protein in zzso and zzso tumor zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso around zzso zzso Present studies demonstrate enhanced tumor growth zzso or zzso in response to a combination of a zzso drug and zzso These data provide a zzso for the clinical use of zzso in combination with chemotherapy for cancer zzso
