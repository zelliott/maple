A model zzso zzso designed upon a zzso zzso with the zzso zzso recognition sequence zzso appended to the zzso and a fluorescent model drug appended to the zzso This model recognizes and binds to zzso expressing cells and displays an enhanced rate of zzso zzso zzso model drug release in the presence of the cells compared to the rate in the absence of zzso The present work suggests that zzso zzso zzso change due to zzso binding may be a viable approach to targeted drug zzso
