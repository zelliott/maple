To investigate the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso gene zzso into pancreatic cancer cell line zzso and the mechanisms involved in this zzso 

The full-length human zzso zzso was introduced into the pancreatic cancer cell line zzso by zzso zzso zzso Positive clones were screened by zzso and stable expression of zzso was detected by zzso zzso method and zzso Fifteen zzso mice were randomly divided into 3 groups of 5 mice to be zzso with zzso cells zzso group), empty zzso control group, and control group cells zzso The weight of mice and the size of tumor were measured every zzso Eight weeks later the mice were killed and the tumors were taken zzso zzso zzso was used to determine the zzso index zzso in these zzso zzso SP method was used to determine the expressions of zzso regulating zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso density zzso Moreover, the tumor volume and weight were compared among these three zzso 

The zzso was significantly higher in the experimental group zzso zzso zzso compared with the empty zzso control group zzso zzso zzso and control group zzso zzso zzso (both P zzso zzso The significant decrease in zzso and increase in zzso protein expressions were detected in the experimental group compared with the empty zzso control group and control group (both P zzso zzso zzso was significantly lower in the experimental group zzso zzso zzso than those in the empty zzso control group zzso zzso zzso and control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the tumor volume and weight were significantly lower in the experimental group as compared with the empty zzso control group and control group zzso zzso zzso However, no significant differences in all the indicators were observed between the empty zzso control group and the control group (both P zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso the expression of which is frequently lost in human pancreatic zzso can induce zzso which may be zzso via zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso and inhibit tumor zzso in pancreatic zzso resulting in zzso of tumor zzso
