The impact of many zzso including zzso and zzso therapies, has been limited by the need for better methods of delivery into cells within zzso Here, zzso delivery of molecules and zzso with zzso DNA by zzso is presented using a novel zzso zzso array designed for the targeted treatment of skin and other tissue zzso The zzso array is molded out of zzso zzso zzso and zzso required for zzso are applied to the zzso array surface by a new zzso zzso zzso The zzso array maintains mechanical integrity after zzso into pig zzso skin and is able to zzso human prostate cancer cells in zzso zzso zzso show that increasing zzso pulse zzso increases zzso efficiency of zzso and bovine serum zzso whereas increasing pulse length has lesser effects over the range zzso zzso of molecules by up to 50% of cells and zzso of zzso of cells with a gene for green fluorescent protein is demonstrated at high cell zzso It is concluded that the zzso zzso array is able to zzso cells, resulting in zzso zzso of zzso and has potential applications to improve zzso delivery of zzso DNA, and other zzso
