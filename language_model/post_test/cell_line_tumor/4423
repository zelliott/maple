zzso of tumors associated with chronic inflammation frequently have altered patterns of DNA zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso has also been associated with zzso DNA zzso but little is known about their zzso 

zzso was used to determine the zzso status of cultured zzso zzso cells after zzso C virus zzso zzso We also studied mice with severe combined zzso carrying the zzso zzso zzso zzso controlled by an zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso combined zzso zzso in which up to zzso of zzso were replaced by human zzso zzso zzso Mice were given intravenous injections of zzso B virus zzso or zzso liver zzso were collected, and DNA zzso profiles were determined at different time points after zzso We also compared zzso patterns between paired samples of zzso zzso and adjacent zzso liver zzso from zzso 

No zzso changes in DNA zzso were observed after infection of zzso cells with zzso zzso from zzso and zzso mice had zzso zzso changes in DNA zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso combined zzso zzso There were changes in 160 zzso 63 genes in zzso and 237 zzso 110 genes in zzso zzso zzso of 149 common genes increased in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of some of these genes also increased in zzso zzso samples from patients compared with zzso zzso zzso of zzso which is expressed by natural killer cells, increased significantly in zzso zzso in zzso with induction of DNA zzso after infection with zzso or zzso zzso of zzso was reduced after administration of an inhibitor of natural killer cell function zzso zzso 

In zzso mice with humanized zzso infection with zzso and zzso appears to activate a natural kill zzso innate immune zzso This contributes to the induction and zzso of zzso DNA zzso in human zzso
