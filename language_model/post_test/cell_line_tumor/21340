zzso prostate cancer zzso is one of the leading causes of death from cancer in zzso The molecular mechanisms underlying the transition from localized tumor to zzso zzso zzso remain largely unknown, and their identification is key for predicting prognosis and targeted zzso Here we demonstrated that increased expression of a zzso zzso of the zzso factor 6 zzso tumor zzso zzso known as zzso in tumors from men after zzso predicted markedly poorer survival and disease recurrence zzso Analysis of tumor samples revealed that zzso levels were specifically zzso in zzso zzso zzso In 2 complementary mouse models of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were shown by in zzso and ex zzso zzso imaging to zzso more rapidly and to zzso to zzso zzso bone, and brain more zzso Interestingly, while zzso zzso increased zzso it did not affect localized tumor zzso zzso zzso using zzso induced spontaneous zzso in cultured zzso cell lines and suppressed tumor growth in zzso Together, these findings demonstrate that zzso expression levels in zzso tumors at the time of diagnosis can predict the zzso behavior of the zzso thus, zzso may represent a novel therapeutic zzso
