The medicinal plants zzso zzso zzso Cola zzso zzso zzso zzso leaf zzso Root bark of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are used in Nigerian traditional medicine for the treatment of cancer and cancer related zzso 

To zzso evaluate the cell zzso and zzso effects of the plants extracts using breast and zzso cell lines, and also to identify the possible components via zzso to have a kind of chemical zzso 

The zzso and zzso effects of zzso extracts (10 zzso of the five medicinal plants were subjected to in zzso evaluation using four cancer cell lines zzso and zzso zzso and zzso measured by flow zzso zzso controls zzso and primary isolated zzso zzso were chosen to eliminate negative influence on healthy zzso 

Of the five extracts zzso demonstrated a significant ( zzso zzso activity against zzso zzso positive breast cancer cell lines zzso The zzso phase was decreased by zzso zzso a significant increase in cell proliferation (about zzso was observed for zzso at a concentration of 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso and PAL did not show marked zzso of the proliferation of cell line zzso 

These results give suggestive evidence that the plant extracts exhibit some correlation between the claimed zzso uses and the cell zzso zzso zzso extract includes chemical compounds with zzso activity and zzso its potential use as zzso agent, particularly against breast zzso provided important information potentially helpful in drug designing and zzso Further studies will involve the isolation of anti zzso compounds in zzso by zzso and detailed mechanism of zzso zzso
