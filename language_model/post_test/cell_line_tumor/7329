zzso have been implicated in tumor growth, zzso zzso and the host immune response to zzso zzso zzso and zzso disorders can reduce zzso production by zzso cells and adversely affect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso name zzso also known as zzso protein 10 zzso is a potent zzso expressed predominantly by zzso and zzso cells in the zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso (a zzso zzso and acts via zzso zzso We have shown previously that zzso is zzso expressed in normal zzso cells, inhibited by human zzso zzso and induced by zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of zzso of zzso by zzso experiments in zzso cells on cell growth, zzso zzso zzso synthesis and zzso acute regulatory protein zzso zzso a key regulatory factor in zzso gene zzso We cloned the complete zzso zzso in a zzso expression zzso with the zzso promoter, zzso and confirmed its expression with rat zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed large amounts of zzso protein zzso in the medium in the zzso zzso by Western zzso The production of zzso zzso ranged from zzso more zzso in the zzso cells than the control cells, as determined by zzso and real-time zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso decreased zzso zzso synthesis from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in control cells to zzso zzso in zzso cells ( zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso D1 zzso was decreased zzso by zzso with zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso induced the expression of its zzso zzso zzso as determined by zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso also significantly decreased zzso growth zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso zzso incorporation into zzso These data suggest that zzso also zzso zzso tumor cell zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso D1 zzso decreases zzso synthesis and zzso cell zzso zzso has the potential to be used in gene therapy for prostate cancer due to its zzso effect and its zzso effect on zzso
