zzso is a recently described member of the zzso family, and, like zzso it zzso a number of zzso zzso Here we show, by zzso zzso zzso pull-down zzso and zzso that zzso zzso and zzso bind to the protein inhibitor of activated zzso zzso and that this binding zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso although not the zzso truncated zzso zzso and zzso and this requires the zzso finger domain of zzso The zzso zzso can also zzso and be zzso by, zzso zzso zzso decreases zzso zzso activity on several target zzso such as zzso zzso is zzso in the nucleus with zzso and zzso zzso is located exclusively in the nuclear zzso zzso is expressed predominantly during S phase, and zzso zzso reduces zzso zzso of zzso with a reduction of cells in zzso and cell cycle zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso interference reduces the proportion of cells in S phase and zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso acting partly through binding and zzso of zzso is an important component of the cell cycle zzso
