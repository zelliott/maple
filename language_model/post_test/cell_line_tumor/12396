zzso zzso zzso are persistent environmental zzso whose chronic exposure can affect nervous system development and zzso The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying zzso damage are not yet zzso In the present study, we investigated whether zzso oxide zzso could be involved in zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso in zzso human zzso zzso zzso exposure (24 zzso to zzso zzso zzso caused a zzso reduction of cell viability that was attenuated in the presence of a calcium entry blocker, zzso zzso at 10 zzso a concentration able to block zzso calcium zzso In addition, zzso caused an increase of zzso calcium that was dependent on zzso zzso as measured by zzso zzso zzso calcium rise may stimulate NO production through an zzso of zzso zzso zzso Indeed, the zzso addition of the selective zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and zzso prevented cell injury, suggesting that NO production plays a major role in zzso cell zzso Furthermore, the exposure zzso zzso to zzso (30 zzso produced an zzso of the expression of beta zzso of zzso This zzso was calcium dependent and was accompanied by an enhancement of NO production as demonstrated by an increase of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso cell injury was prevented when zzso zzso a selective zzso zzso was added zzso to 30 zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso cell death in zzso cells is zzso by an zzso of the zzso zzso triggered by NO zzso
