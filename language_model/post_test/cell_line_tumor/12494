The positive regulatory domain I zzso is a zzso zzso that plays an important role in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is functionally impaired and zzso in a subset of diffuse large zzso zzso with aggressive zzso To investigate the possible zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso of zzso promoter was assessed in zzso cell lines by zzso zzso and screened in tumor samples of zzso patients using zzso zzso zzso zzso expression corresponded to promoter zzso zzso zzso island of zzso promoter possessed significant zzso activity, which could be modified by zzso Loss of promoter zzso of zzso was more frequently detected in zzso samples than in zzso zzso Thus, zzso of abnormal tumor zzso gene zzso might be linked to zzso zzso
