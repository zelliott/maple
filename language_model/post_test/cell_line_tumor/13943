zzso zzso is a promising new zzso for imaging cell zzso We evaluated whether zzso PET can be used to monitor early responses to radiation zzso 

zzso mice bearing zzso zzso cell zzso were zzso to zzso with 0, 10, or 20 zzso zzso hours later, the mice were sacrificed for zzso and biological assessment such as cell cycle analysis, zzso zzso and zzso cell survival zzso PET scans were performed on other mice after injection of zzso or zzso zzso before and after radiation treatment, and tumor growth was assessed over 9 zzso 

zzso examination detected no zzso changes 24 h after radiation treatment, but cell cycle analysis showed that zzso tumors had a decreased fraction of cells in S phase and an increased fraction in zzso phase, compared with zzso zzso zzso tumors also had a higher zzso of zzso features and reduced zzso cell zzso zzso growth was significantly delayed in zzso mice ( zzso compared with control zzso PET images showed increased zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso before radiation zzso Following zzso zzso zzso differed significantly zzso from that in control zzso In contrast, zzso zzso after zzso did not differ significantly from that in control zzso 

Our finding that tumor zzso of zzso was reduced at 24 h after radiation treatment suggests that zzso PET may be a promising imaging zzso for monitoring the early effects of radiation zzso
