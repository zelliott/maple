Two different zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene associated with zzso dominant familial zzso diabetes zzso zzso predict zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso They are unique in that they change, respectively, the zzso zzso and a region of the zzso II domain not so far affected by any zzso To test whether they affect the cellular handling of the zzso zzso in a similar manner to previously investigated zzso they were examined by zzso expression in cell zzso 

Both zzso resulted in significantly reduced amounts of zzso zzso in the cell culture medium as determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso demonstrated that processing and zzso of the zzso zzso was reduced but not zzso Finally, zzso laser scanning zzso showed that normal zzso zzso and/or its processed products were localized in the tips of the cellular zzso whereas both zzso zzso were accumulated in the zzso zzso zzso and in the case of the zzso zzso also in zzso structures outside the zzso 

Both zzso result in reduced zzso zzso processing and zzso probably due to retention in the zzso This zzso at least partly, the hypothesis that the zzso lead to the production of a zzso hormone precursor that fails to fold and/or zzso properly and, as a consequence, is retained by the zzso protein quality control zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso outside the zzso indicates that additional mechanisms could be zzso
