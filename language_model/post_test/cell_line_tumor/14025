zzso interactions of the human zzso B virus zzso surface proteins with the core protein of zzso are critical for the zzso of virus zzso and zzso of this process may prevent the production of infectious zzso A modified zzso zzso zzso zzso which measured the interaction between the core protein and zzso region of the surface zzso was used to screen a chemical library for compounds that would block this zzso Few zzso compounds were identified from a chemical library consisting of zzso zzso Among them, two compounds inhibited the production of zzso particles from zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso values of these compounds for zzso of zzso production in zzso cells were in the zzso concentration zzso These results indicate that compounds that prevent the interaction between the core protein and zzso region of the surface protein may possibly be useful as zzso zzso
