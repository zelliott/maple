Previous studies have showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso might be an agent for zzso detection of breast zzso In zzso zzso breast zzso zzso was found to have higher zzso than zzso zzso zzso It is unclear whether zzso can zzso in all cell line breast cancer zzso as well as breast zzso with zzso resistance zzso The present study aimed to investigate the properties of zzso in detecting drug sensitive and drug resistant zzso breast cancer zzso in mice by using dynamic single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cells are drug sensitive breast zzso zzso zzso cells are zzso more resistant to zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso were grown in zzso mice for 10-14 days after injection of 1 zzso zzso cells into the right zzso zzso mice with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso using a high-resolution zzso system called zzso Dynamic images were acquired for 2 h after intravenous injection of zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso was demonstrated in the zzso zzso by western zzso not in the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso were zzso unequivocally within zzso zzso in zzso images and remained zzso for at least 2 h after zzso Drug resistant zzso from which zzso was rapidly zzso retained zzso as readily as did drug sensitive zzso The zzso data of zzso demonstrated significantly higher zzso zzso compared to zzso 

zzso zzso zzso can be detected by zzso zzso zzso More importantly, zzso zzso can potentially zzso drug resistant breast zzso
