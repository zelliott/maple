zzso is the major agent in the standard zzso chemotherapy for zzso However, only a small portion of patients achieve a tumor response to zzso chemotherapy and eventually develop acquired zzso The aim of this study was to identify potential zzso that could predict the efficacy of zzso 

Human lung zzso cell line zzso was exposed to zzso for development of a resistant cell line, zzso and zzso was tested through the zzso zzso The global protein profiles from zzso and zzso were compared using a zzso zzso Western zzso real-time zzso and zzso validated the expression of zzso in cell lines and tumor zzso zzso levels of zzso were measured by zzso in 105 zzso patients treated with zzso zzso 

The resistance of zzso to zzso was zzso higher than that of zzso zzso zzso approach identified eight zzso zzso expressed zzso Among them, zzso protein zzso was further investigated and it was found zzso through the method of Western zzso real-time zzso in cell lines, consistent with zzso validation in zzso Clinical research showed that baseline serum zzso level in the patients with a progression disease was significantly higher than the patients of response or stable disease zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and serum zzso levels were significantly increased after zzso zzso chemotherapy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso expression might be a potential predictor and monitor of zzso efficacy in advanced zzso zzso
