In this study, the role of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso cell proliferation and survival was investigated zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso of zzso was conducted in zzso human zzso cells, and cell proliferation and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were measured zzso An zzso zzso zzso mouse model was zzso Mouse survival times and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso were zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that the zzso of zzso significantly enhanced the proliferation of zzso cells and the zzso of zzso compared with the controls, which was eliminated by the selective zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso but not selective zzso zzso inhibitor zzso By contrast, the zzso of zzso zzso markedly decreased zzso cell proliferation and the zzso of zzso compared with the zzso zzso of zzso significantly increased zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cell zzso zzso and decreased animal zzso By contrast, zzso of zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso and increased mouse survival zzso zzso injection of zzso but not zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso and prolonged mouse survival zzso In conclusion, zzso was demonstrated to mediate the proliferation of zzso cells according to an zzso zzso Using an zzso zzso zzso mouse model, it was demonstrated zzso that zzso promotes zzso proliferation and that the selective zzso zzso effectively zzso the proliferation of zzso cells and zzso survival zzso This study provides a novel insight into the role of zzso in zzso proliferation and survival, and provides the first zzso evidence that zzso zzso are a potential therapeutic alternative for zzso
