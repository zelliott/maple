As part of a continuing search for potential zzso drug candidates from zzso peptides of marine organisms, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was evaluated in several tumor cell zzso The results indicated that zzso a synthetic zzso zzso zzso specifically inhibited human zzso cell zzso cell line) proliferation and zzso The way in which zzso inhibited zzso cell growth was then zzso zzso inhibited zzso cell growth in a zzso manner according to an zzso analysis, which was confirmed by a zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso electron zzso revealed that zzso caused lethal membrane disruption in zzso cancer cells, and a wound healing zzso supported that zzso decreased the migration of zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso expression was zzso after treatment with zzso for zzso h compared to the zzso zzso These findings suggest a mechanism of zzso action of zzso and indicate that zzso may be a promising zzso agent against human zzso zzso
