zzso zzso zzso are essential components of the zzso that play a critical role in cancer zzso This study aimed to identify novel zzso markers that might contribute to the invasion and the prognosis of zzso zzso 

The zzso sodium zzso mouse model of sporadic colon cancer represents an adequate source for the isolation of zzso and normal zzso By using the zzso technique, we zzso zzso and normal zzso from colon zzso zzso extracts and zzso were subjected to in-depth quantitative zzso analysis by tandem mass zzso Further zzso of zzso proteins in zzso were carried out by zzso zzso and zzso analyses of mouse and human zzso 

Using a zzso of zzso or more, we found 132 and 125 zzso expressed proteins in zzso extracts and zzso zzso We found zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso signature was composed of several zzso Among them, zzso and zzso caused an increase in migration and invasion of zzso cancer zzso zzso The zzso signature was composed of 30 zzso zzso In mouse and human samples, expression of zzso zzso zzso and, particularly, zzso was significantly increased in the zzso zzso without significant expression in the cancer zzso zzso The combination of zzso and zzso zzso expression showed a significant association with zzso survival and poor zzso 

We have identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso as selective zzso of cancer zzso and zzso and zzso as candidate zzso zzso of zzso significance in colon zzso
