zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso is under phase III clinical trial for cancer zzso We showed that human zzso zzso zzso has zzso activity for zzso removing zzso and other zzso zzso over zzso zzso from the 3' zzso of DNA in zzso In this study, we examined whether zzso protein plays a role in the zzso of zzso We established zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines that can be induced by zzso to zzso zzso to zzso either zzso wild type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso zzso by short hairpin zzso to zzso of the original zzso zzso results indicated that the induction of zzso or zzso but not zzso or zzso made cells approximately zzso resistant to zzso and zzso zzso whereas the zzso of zzso zzso cells by approximately zzso to zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso in cells did not change the sensitivity of these cells to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso both of which are zzso zzso zzso The DNA incorporation of zzso but not that of zzso was decreased by the induction of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso and was increased by the zzso of zzso The rate of retention of zzso was zzso correlated to the level of zzso in isolated zzso however, this was not the case for zzso In conclusion, this study supports the hypothesis that zzso plays a critical role in the actions of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso
