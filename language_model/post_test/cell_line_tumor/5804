Nuclear receptors zzso and zzso zzso were previously shown to bind in zzso to direct repeat elements in the mouse and human embryonic and fetal zzso zzso gene promoters and to play critical roles in the zzso of these zzso By zzso zzso zzso we show that, in adult zzso cells, zzso bind to the embryonic zzso zzso promoters but not to the adult zzso zzso We zzso protein complexes containing zzso zzso from adult zzso cells and identified zzso zzso and zzso zzso complexes, as well as zzso and zzso all known to zzso zzso gene zzso as potential zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso abundance proteins indicated that zzso complexes consist of at least four distinct molecular zzso In zzso zzso we found that, in zzso zzso adult zzso cells, many of these zzso associate with both the embryonic and the adult zzso zzso promoters but, upon terminal zzso they specifically zzso only from the adult zzso promoter zzso with its zzso but remain bound to the silenced embryonic zzso gene zzso These data suggest that zzso recruit an array of zzso zzso to elicit adult zzso zzso of the embryonic zzso zzso genes through coordinated zzso zzso zzso
