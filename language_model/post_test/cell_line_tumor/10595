zzso zzso devices hold great promise to help people with the restoration of lost zzso However, research is lacking in the zzso design of a stable, long-term zzso zzso zzso is initiated when a device is inserted into brain tissue and an inflammatory response zzso zzso become zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This study was designed to investigate the zzso zzso zzso zzso and gene expression to assess the zzso state of the cells on different material zzso Although platinum and silicon have been extensively characterized both in zzso and in zzso for their zzso with zzso cells, this study used the novel usage of zzso and zzso in neural zzso by comparative analysis of zzso zzso This study has shown evidence of zzso of zzso We have also confirmed the zzso of zzso with zzso Moreover, we have established sound guidelines of which neural implant materials should meet to be depicted zzso
