The association between large tumor size and zzso risk in a majority of clinical zzso has led to questions as to whether these observations are zzso related or whether one is simply a marker for the zzso This is partly due to an uncertainty about how zzso gene expression changes can arise in primary zzso We investigated this question through the analysis of a previously defined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that mediates experimental breast cancer zzso selectively to the lung and is expressed by primary human breast cancer with a high risk for developing lung zzso zzso we demonstrate that the zzso promotes primary tumor growth that zzso for zzso cells, and it allows for zzso after reaching a critical tumor zzso zzso this zzso to zzso tumors being larger at diagnosis compared with zzso tumors and to a marked rise in the zzso of zzso after zzso tumors reach 2 zzso Patients with zzso primary tumors selectively fail in the lung compared with the bone or other visceral sites and have a worse overall zzso The zzso linkage between zzso gene zzso accelerated tumor growth, and likelihood of zzso recurrence provided by the zzso may help to explain observations of zzso gene signatures in primary cancer and how tumor growth can both lead to zzso and be a marker for cells destined to zzso
