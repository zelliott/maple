zzso type 1 zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso primarily involved in the mechanical destruction of zzso zzso zzso zzso has also been shown to be zzso in several types of zzso Many coordinated functions of zzso during migration and invasion remain to be zzso In this paper, live cells from the invasive cell line zzso were zzso using an zzso zzso resonance energy zzso zzso specific for zzso a zzso specific for zzso was zzso with the zzso and zzso fluorescent proteins to form the zzso resonance energy zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso was determined with zzso zzso imaging zzso using both a polar zzso analysis and a rapid data acquisition zzso of zzso zzso imaging zzso known as phase zzso Both zzso of the zzso (with or without zzso by zzso were clearly resolvable in the same zzso Changes in the zzso of the zzso zzso were observed primarily along the edge of the cell following the removal of the zzso inhibitor zzso The zzso highlighted by phase suppression correlated well with the fractional zzso derived from the polar zzso
