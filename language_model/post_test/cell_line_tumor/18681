The failure of prostate cancer treatment is largely due to the development of zzso independence, since the zzso depletion therapy remains the front-line option for this zzso Previously, we reported that zzso of the zzso protein zzso was associated with progression of prostate cancer and zzso expression of zzso induced zzso proliferation in prostate cancer zzso In the present study, we investigated if zzso zzso expression in the zzso sensitive zzso cells had any effect on zzso cell growth and studied the molecular mechanisms zzso Using stable zzso zzso we found that expression of zzso was able to reduce zzso growth and S phase fraction of the cell cycle in zzso cells, indicating that zzso may be involved in the development of zzso independence in these zzso The zzso zzso prostate cancer cell growth was correlated with zzso of zzso zzso growth zzso and zzso zzso specific zzso zzso as confirmed by western zzso analysis and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells by its zzso zzso resulted in suppression of zzso expression at both zzso and protein zzso In addition, the results from zzso study showed that zzso expression was significantly elevated in hormone zzso prostate cancer zzso when compared with the zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso of zzso in prostate cancer cells may be one of the mechanisms responsible for developing zzso independence and this process may be regulated through induction of zzso zzso zzso of zzso may provide a potential therapeutic strategy leading to zzso of zzso prostate cancer cell zzso
