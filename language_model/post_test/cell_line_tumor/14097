Human zzso zzso zzso zzso is a heavily zzso large protein that is frequently zzso on the surface of many human zzso Studies using zzso zzso zzso identified zzso as a zzso zzso that has been intensely studied as a target for cancer zzso We previously identified a mouse zzso zzso that recognizes a zzso sugar chain, designated as zzso classified in zzso 9 zzso Using the zzso zzso we investigated zzso effects of zzso zzso on breast cancer cell lines expressing zzso zzso We showed that zzso zzso induced capping of zzso and facilitated zzso zzso interaction in the breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso which zzso in suspension culture without zzso Moreover, zzso zzso enhanced the zzso activity of zzso killer zzso These results indicate that the capping of zzso restores cell surface zzso such as zzso molecules and tumor zzso to work in zzso zzso leading to zzso of tumor proliferation due to zzso zzso and increased accessibility to zzso cells that are needed to kill tumor zzso
