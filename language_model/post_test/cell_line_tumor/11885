The novel zzso compound zzso strongly inhibited the growth of zzso cells with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso when cultured with zzso for 48 zzso zzso zzso suppressed DNA zzso with zzso zzso observed at zzso zzso of zzso zzso and protein zzso were also suppressed under the same conditions, but to a lesser zzso We then measured the cellular zzso activities of DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso cells cultured with or without zzso Of these 5 zzso the activity of zzso zzso was most strongly suppressed by zzso by zzso Although zzso did not directly inhibit the zzso of zzso zzso in a zzso system, expression of zzso of zzso zzso was suppressed by zzso in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso can suppress the expression of the gene for zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso contributes to the zzso of cell growth by zzso together with the zzso of zzso zzso
