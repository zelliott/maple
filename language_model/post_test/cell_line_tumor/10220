The male hormone zzso is a zzso factor for its target zzso or zzso Yet, the underlying mechanism is incompletely zzso Here, we report that zzso via zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso requires the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso and de zzso protein zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso that in turn zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, genetic interruption of zzso zzso zzso the zzso by zzso Our results reveal a novel zzso between zzso zzso zzso and zzso thereby providing a molecular mechanism underlying the survival function of zzso
