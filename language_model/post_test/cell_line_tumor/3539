Growth of new blood vessels zzso required for all tumor growth, is zzso by the expression of vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso is zzso in all known solid tumors but also in zzso diabetic zzso arthritis, and many other zzso Conventional zzso zzso have been universally described as zzso zzso Here, we show that an zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed as protein in normal cells and zzso and is circulating in human zzso We also present evidence for a sister family of presumably zzso zzso zzso Moreover, these zzso are zzso in prostate zzso We also show that zzso binds zzso zzso 2 with the same affinity as zzso but does not activate it or stimulate downstream signaling zzso Moreover, it prevents zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and signaling in cultured zzso Furthermore, we show, with two different in zzso zzso models, that zzso is not zzso and that it zzso zzso zzso in rabbit cornea and rat zzso Finally, we show that zzso expressing tumors grow significantly more slowly than zzso tumors, indicating that a switch in zzso from zzso to zzso can inhibit tumor zzso These results suggest that regulation of zzso zzso may be a critical switch from an zzso to a zzso zzso
