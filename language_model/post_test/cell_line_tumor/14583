zzso zzso zzso membrane component 1) is part of a zzso complex, that is highly expressed in several zzso and is involved in zzso Although zzso plays an important role in various zzso little is known about how zzso expression is zzso zzso the present study was designed to zzso the molecular mechanisms that influence zzso expression in zzso cancer zzso An in zzso approach revealed that the zzso region of zzso contains one highly and one poorly zzso binding site for the zzso zzso and one highly zzso binding site for zzso zzso zzso and real-time zzso showed that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso target zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso binding site for zzso in the zzso of zzso is not zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso resulted in a decrease in zzso zzso zzso Further, an analysis of zzso zzso levels in zzso cells revealed that zzso expression increased after stimulation with zzso zzso zzso may exert its effect on zzso expression in part by stimulation of zzso In conclusion, we propose that zzso expression is regulated by the zzso zzso which could become therapeutic targets, as zzso like many other targets of zzso seems to be involved in cancer proliferation and chemotherapy zzso
