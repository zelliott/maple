zzso is an essential component of the gamma zzso zzso zzso complex, required for its synthesis and recognition of zzso for zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate whether zzso has zzso value or potential as a therapeutic target in breast cancer zzso The suitability of zzso as a target in BC was assessed using BC tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its biological role in zzso was evaluated in BC cell lines following gene zzso zzso blocking zzso were developed and evaluated for their suitability as potential clinical zzso zzso and cell line analysis confirmed that zzso expression was zzso in BC compared to normal breast zzso In zzso patient samples, high zzso expression was observed in zzso of cases and correlated with zzso zzso patient age, and tumor zzso In zzso subset analysis, high zzso expression predicted for worse BC specific survival in the zzso zzso zzso In zzso gene zzso of zzso resulted in disruption of the zzso complex and a decrease in zzso zzso This was sufficient to increase zzso expression and its zzso with zzso zzso at zzso junctions in zzso zzso zzso zzso in invasive zzso cells resulted in loss of zzso expression and a marked reduction in both cell zzso and invasion; which was zzso with the de zzso formation of zzso junctions characterized by the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso These data indicate that zzso can function to maintain zzso to zzso transition during BC zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were able to decrease zzso and zzso expression and reduced the invasive capacity of BC cells in zzso This supports our hypothesis that a zzso blocking zzso could be used to limit zzso dissemination in invasive zzso
