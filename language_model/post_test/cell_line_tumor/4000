zzso zzso has been suggested as a zzso zzso for human zzso zzso zzso but its roles in zzso progression and drug resistance have not been zzso This study investigates the role and underlying mechanism of zzso in the zzso and progressive growth of zzso 

The change of zzso and proportion of side population in zzso cells was examined by cell growth and flow zzso analyses after zzso treatments or zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cassette (ABC) zzso in zzso cells, zzso and clinical zzso zzso was determined by Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells was evaluated in zzso after zzso zzso zzso 

Treatment of zzso cells with zzso drugs increased the production of zzso and its zzso as well as the proportion of side population zzso zzso zzso increased the SP fraction and expression of zzso zzso decreasing the drug zzso zzso of zzso gene decreased the ratio of SP cells and drug resistance zzso Both zzso and ABC zzso were highly expressed in zzso and clinical zzso zzso and zzso of zzso significantly reduced zzso size in zzso 

zzso drug-induced zzso zzso increased the expression of ABC zzso and SP cells, promoting the growth of zzso in zzso Thus zzso may be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of zzso
