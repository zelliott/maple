zzso zzso zzso is an important cell energy conversion system which is probably associated with tumor zzso zzso of its B1 zzso zzso is high in well differentiated and low in poorly differentiated tumor zzso This study was to investigate the zzso effect of zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso of cell proliferation and reversal of drug resistance in zzso and zzso zzso 

Growth of zzso and zzso cells zzso with zzso and zzso were measured by zzso zzso zzso intensity of zzso was analyzed by zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso zzso activity was measured by zzso zzso and zzso expression of zzso resistance gene zzso was detected by zzso and real-time zzso The expression of zzso zzso was analyzed by western zzso 

The sensitivity of zzso and zzso cells zzso with zzso to zzso was higher in comparing to the negative control zzso zzso with zzso zzso and the control zzso zzso with zzso and the differences between zzso and zzso groups were statistically significant at different zzso of zzso ( zzso After the B1 zzso was zzso the sensitivity of cells to zzso in the zzso group was higher than that in the zzso and zzso zzso The mean zzso intensity of zzso in the zzso group was higher than that in the zzso and zzso groups ( zzso zzso zzso activity was significantly higher in zzso group comparing to the zzso group ( zzso zzso expression of zzso gene and protein expression of zzso were not significantly different among the zzso group and two control groups zzso 

zzso zzso B1 can zzso with zzso and reverse drug resistance to zzso in the zzso cell zzso This may be related to zzso zzso activity, but not to influencing the expression of zzso zzso
