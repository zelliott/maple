To investigate the enhancement effect of the combination of zzso interfering zzso targeting zzso with zzso zzso in the treatment of lung zzso 

Twenty five zzso mice bearing zzso lung cancer were divided into 5 groups zzso control, zzso zzso treated group, zzso treated group, zzso treated zzso and treated with zzso interfering zzso targeting zzso and zzso zzso respectively or in zzso The expression of zzso in zzso detected with zzso zzso The interference effect of zzso was determined by Western zzso The tumor volume, zzso density zzso zzso index zzso and side effects were zzso 

The combination treatment of zzso interfering zzso targeting zzso with zzso zzso inhibited tumor growth obviously zzso zzso zzso The combination group revealed a decreased zzso and an increased zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The combination of zzso interfering zzso targeting zzso with zzso zzso might enhance zzso effect by increasing the zzso of the cancer zzso
