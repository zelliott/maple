The C2 domain is a targeting domain that responds to zzso zzso signals in classical protein zzso zzso and mediates the zzso of its host protein to zzso Recent studies have revealed a new motif in the C2 domain, named the zzso zzso that interacts with zzso zzso The purpose of this work was to characterize the molecular mechanism by which zzso specifically interacts with this zzso Using a combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance energy transfer and zzso zzso zzso we show here that zzso specifically binds to the zzso zzso region, zzso zzso access to the zzso zzso The magnitude of zzso binding is greater than in the case of other zzso zzso Very importantly, the zzso involved in zzso binding are essential for the plasma membrane zzso of zzso when zzso cells are zzso through their zzso zzso Additionally, zzso and zzso zzso were used as zzso to demonstrate the zzso of zzso and zzso in the plasma zzso and it was shown that although a fraction of zzso is zzso to generate zzso and zzso an important amount still remains in the membrane where it is available to activate zzso These findings entail revision of the currently accepted model of zzso recruitment to the membrane and its zzso
