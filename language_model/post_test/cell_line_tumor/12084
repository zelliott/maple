zzso zzso zzso a zzso acid zzso is a well-known immune system zzso for the treatment of various zzso In the present investigation, the effects of zzso on the proliferation and zzso of human leukemia cell lines zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The proliferation was significantly depressed after 96 h of treatment with zzso and obvious signs of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso V zzso were observed zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso zzso and decrease in zzso zzso gene expression were observed in zzso zzso The expression and the function of zzso zzso can be slightly inhibited by zzso It is noteworthy that zzso and zzso were more sensitive than zzso cells when subjected to zzso Furthermore, zzso the human zzso cell line, displayed significant less sensitivity to zzso than all the human leukemia cell zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso significantly antagonized the zzso effects induced by zzso whereas zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso did not exhibit such zzso All the results indicate that zzso was able to significantly suppress proliferation and induce zzso in human leukemia cell zzso
