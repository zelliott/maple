We evaluated the therapeutic potential of the replication competent zzso zzso which is based on the zzso zzso Forest virus zzso strain A7 zzso carrying the zzso marker gene in an zzso lung cancer tumor model in nude zzso We have previously shown that this zzso zzso destroys tumor cells efficiently in zzso and in zzso (in subcutaneous tumor zzso zzso growth in animals with zzso implanted zzso cells zzso were monitored during the study with small animal zzso We show that locally administered zzso with zzso increased survival rate in experimental lung cancer significantly zzso zzso zzso comparable to results obtained with the second generation zzso replicating zzso zzso zzso used for zzso The limited efficacy in zzso administered zzso viruses is the essential problem in zzso zzso and also in this study we were not able to elicit significant response with systemic administration zzso Despite the fact that tumor zzso in zzso lung cancer is more zzso viruses failed to home to the tumors and were unable to initiate efficient zzso zzso Clearly, the efficacy of zzso is influenced by many factors such as the route of virus administration, zzso and zzso barriers and cancer zzso features zzso
