zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in breast cancer is strongly linked to an invasive zzso The molecular basis of zzso invasion is largely zzso We show that zzso zzso B and L are elevated in zzso positive primary human breast cancer and function as zzso of zzso invasion in zzso We identify zzso protein zzso zzso zzso regulated zzso 2, zzso protein zzso 4, and protein zzso C alpha as essential zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression and breast cancer cell zzso The identified signaling network activates the zzso of zzso B gene zzso via zzso zinc zzso zzso factor that binds to an zzso zzso element in the first zzso of zzso This work provides a model system for zzso breast cancer cell zzso reveals a signaling network that is crucial for invasion in zzso and defines a specific role and targets for the identified zzso zzso
