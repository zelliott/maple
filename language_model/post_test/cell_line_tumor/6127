Many mothers use, against zzso alcohol during zzso zzso mothers are exposed to a wide range of other environmental zzso These chemicals may also harm the developing zzso because almost all toxic compounds can go through human zzso zzso effects of ethanol on the transfer of other environmental compounds through human zzso have not been studied zzso It is known that ethanol has zzso properties and increases the zzso and fluidity of cell zzso We studied the effects of ethanol on the transfer of three different environmental zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso We tested in human breast cancer zzso cell line zzso whether ethanol affects zzso which is also the major zzso in human zzso We found that the transfer of ethanol is comparable to that of zzso which points to passive diffusion as the transfer zzso zzso ethanol had no statistically significant effect on the transfer of the other studied zzso Neither did ethanol inhibit the function of zzso These experiments represent only the effects of acute exposure to ethanol and chronic exposure remains to be zzso
