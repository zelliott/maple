We recently reported that zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in zzso zzso leukemia stem cells zzso Here, we report the results of a functional analysis of zzso in zzso zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso Short hairpin zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a decrease in the level of zzso In contrast, forced expression of zzso in zzso zzso cells by zzso with zzso zzso particles resulted in an increase in the levels of zzso zzso exposure of zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso growth of these zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso by a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, forced expression of zzso resulted in increase in the levels of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results indicated that zzso binds to the promoter region of the zzso zzso while reporter gene zzso results indicated stimulation of zzso expression at the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso positively regulates the zzso signaling zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso in zzso zzso Taken together, our data suggest that the zzso signaling zzso is involved in the survival of zzso zzso cells and may thus be a promising therapeutic target for zzso of zzso zzso
