Our previous studies had shown that zzso was profoundly zzso in bone zzso zzso cells from multiple myeloma zzso In this report, we analyzed zzso changes in multiple myeloma cell lines to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso of zzso Four multiple myeloma cell lines, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The results of zzso specific zzso zzso showed that the promoter of zzso was zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso The zzso promoter region was amplified to obtain a series of different length zzso All of the amplified sequences were inserted to zzso reporter zzso The zzso were zzso into zzso cells and the zzso activities were measured to search for the core region of zzso zzso Two zzso islands were found in zzso promoter zzso The results of zzso zzso showed that zzso island 1 displayed weak zzso activity, whereas zzso island 2 exhibited strong zzso activity zzso zzso compared to the zzso The sequence that covered both zzso islands 1 and 2 showed higher activity zzso zzso compared to the control, suggesting that the two islands had synergistic effect on regulating zzso zzso We also found that zzso zzso I zzso could inhibit the zzso activity, whereas zzso using zzso treatment rescued the expression of zzso for multiple myeloma cell zzso These data revealed that zzso of zzso promoter was involved in zzso of zzso in multiple myeloma zzso
