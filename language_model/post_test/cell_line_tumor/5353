We previously demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso in the zzso signaling of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso growth factor zzso zzso Here we report for the first time that zzso activity is zzso associated with zzso resistance in zzso human breast cancer zzso zzso zzso of human zzso in zzso cells resulted in enhanced cell proliferation and resistance to zzso cell growth arrest and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells selected by prolonged exposure to zzso exhibited higher levels in zzso expression and activity, compared with the control zzso zzso of zzso activity by either specific pharmaceutical zzso or the zzso zzso zzso restored the zzso and zzso effects of tamoxifen in the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso but not zzso expression by the specific small interference zzso also restored the tamoxifen responsiveness in the zzso zzso Thus, blockade of the zzso signaling zzso may zzso cellular responsiveness to tamoxifen and abrogate zzso resistance in human breast cancer zzso
