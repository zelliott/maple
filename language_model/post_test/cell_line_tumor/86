zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed on the tumor cell surface activates zzso and zzso to exacerbate the zzso suggesting its suitability as a target zzso for diagnosis by in zzso molecular zzso Thus, we prepared zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a novel zzso probe for detecting zzso in zzso and evaluated its usefulness in breast zzso zzso zzso zzso was prepared using zzso as a zzso zzso agent and zzso was evaluated by flow zzso zzso expression in breast zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was measured by Western zzso In zzso zzso was examined for 48 h using zzso zzso followed by zzso of radiation absorbed by a standard zzso platform zzso Level Internal zzso Assessment zzso zzso zzso was obtained with zzso zzso to zzso and more than zzso zzso zzso zzso was highly expressed in all zzso zzso zzso zzso increased with time after administration and reached 3 to 5 times higher values at 24 h zzso than those at 1 zzso Other zzso including the stomach, showed decreasing values over zzso zzso to blood ratios increased with time and reached more than zzso at 48 zzso The effective dose was zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso is a promising probe for future diagnosis of breast tumors by in zzso nuclear medical zzso
