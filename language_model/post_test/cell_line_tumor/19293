Human zzso and 8 zzso have been implicated in the zzso detection of zzso zzso in immune zzso Although zzso zzso sensing of short zzso has been zzso from studies of zzso zzso this has yet to be established for zzso We found that different short zzso sequences selectively induced either zzso or zzso in human zzso The zzso zzso response to zzso observed in zzso could be zzso in activated human zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso Surprisingly, suppression of zzso expression by zzso interference in this model reduced sensing of all zzso zzso zzso zzso of the relative expression ratio of zzso to zzso in zzso cells correlated with differential sensing of zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso induction profile in human zzso was accurately modeled by a zzso zzso of zzso zzso in mouse zzso Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that zzso is involved in zzso sensing of zzso We establish a novel cell model for the prediction of zzso induction by short zzso in human zzso Our results suggest that differential zzso sensing of zzso zzso between human and mouse zzso is due to the zzso of zzso sensing by human zzso
