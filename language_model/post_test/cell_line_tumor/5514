To evaluate the zzso capacity of human peripheral blood zzso cells zzso with zzso gene zzso zzso by zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso of the breast cancer cells zzso and zzso were determined, and the zzso cells from healthy donors with matching zzso zzso were isolated by zzso density zzso zzso The isolated cells were divided into two groups with or without zzso with the zzso virus harboring zzso zzso The cells were cultured for 7 days in zzso zzso medium supplemented with zzso AB human serum, zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso The mature zzso were then harvested from the cell culture and their zzso were identified using flow zzso zzso zzso was employed to examine the specific killing activity of the T cells induced by the zzso 

The zzso zzso with the zzso zzso virus expressed zzso zzso and zzso at the rate of zzso zzso and zzso and those without the viral zzso expressed the markers at the rate zzso zzso and zzso respectively, showing no obvious differences in the zzso of the two zzso The zzso zzso however, showed markedly higher expression rates of zzso and zzso than the zzso zzso zzso vs zzso and zzso vs zzso zzso The zzso irrespective of the zzso showed comparable capacities in stimulating T cell zzso The zzso zzso exhibited the capacity of inducing the T cells to specifically kill the target tumor cells, with the highest killing rate of zzso 

The zzso capacity of human peripheral blood zzso are enhanced by zzso gene zzso zzso by zzso zzso
