In this study, we report the zzso and biological properties of a novel zzso composite scaffold made of zzso and natural derived zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which was prepared by zzso zzso The zzso properties of zzso scaffold were tested by infrared zzso zzso zzso transmission electron zzso scanning electron zzso universal material testing machine and zzso buffer solution (PBS) soaking zzso Besides, the biological properties were evaluated by zzso cells and zzso stem cells zzso culture experiment in zzso and a short period zzso study in zzso The results show that the composite scaffold is mainly formed through the zzso zzso of the two zzso between zzso and zzso and zzso is incorporated into the zzso zzso of zzso without zzso which zzso the scaffold with good zzso properties such as highly interconnected porous structure, high zzso strength and good structural stability and zzso More important, the results of cells zzso proliferated on the scaffold indicate that the scaffold is zzso and has good cell zzso and the results of zzso experiment in zzso further confirm that the scaffold has good tissue zzso All the above results suggest that the novel zzso zzso composite scaffold has a great potential to be used as bone tissue engineering zzso
