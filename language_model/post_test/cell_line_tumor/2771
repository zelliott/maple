Natural killer zzso cells show enhanced functional competence when they express zzso receptors specific for inherited major zzso complex class I zzso zzso Current models imply that zzso cell education requires an interaction of zzso receptors with zzso expressed on other zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso can also bind zzso zzso on the zzso cell itself (in zzso Here we describe a zzso zzso which can engage zzso expressed on other cells but not in zzso Even though this zzso inhibited zzso cell zzso function, it failed to educate zzso zzso The association with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and this was found to relieve zzso cells from a zzso effect of zzso zzso These data explain how zzso zzso receptors can facilitate zzso cell zzso They zzso classical zzso from educating functions of zzso and suggest that zzso interaction of zzso is necessary for zzso cell zzso
