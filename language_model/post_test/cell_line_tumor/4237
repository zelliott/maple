Several cellular zzso factors have been shown to be involved in zzso zzso The zzso cellular zzso factor has zzso and repressive effects on gene zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso revealed 19 zzso zzso binding sites located within putative promoters of 16 zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso confirmed the binding of zzso to zzso zzso and zzso promoters and the zzso of these binding sites inhibited zzso binding and the promoter zzso by zzso alone or following zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso site in the zzso zzso displayed insignificant influence on virus growth in melanoma zzso but it inhibited the virus replication significantly at day 5 and 6 post infection in zzso zzso This work suggests a novel role for the cellular factor zzso in zzso replication through the mediation of zzso zzso of viral gene zzso
