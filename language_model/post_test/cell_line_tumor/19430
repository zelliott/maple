This work proposed a method to assess the zzso zzso characteristic in zzso peripheral blood zzso based on zzso zzso of zzso genes by real-time zzso zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso samples collected before surgery zzso immediately after surgery zzso and at the third day zzso zzso from 36 zzso zzso cancer zzso patients were zzso SCC and zzso zzso showed low zzso detection rates, while the rate for zzso and zzso zzso panel was zzso zzso and zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the significant increase and slow decrease of zzso cells at stages of zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso respectively, zzso cells decreased significantly and increased quickly at the two zzso The follow-up with a period of zzso years showed that the patients with the zzso ratios of zzso zzso for zzso cells zzso zzso 10 for zzso cells exhibited significantly high possibility of developed zzso and the sensitivity to predict developed zzso increased from zzso of zzso zzso alone to zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results suggested that zzso and zzso gene panel improved the sensitivity to predict recurrence and differentiate the zzso zzso
