zzso proteins are small zzso required for zzso trafficking through the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso regulates zzso protein function and zzso by maintaining zzso proteins in the zzso zzso Two zzso of zzso are present in most zzso zzso zzso and zzso It has recently been demonstrated that a Heat shock protein 90 zzso zzso complex regulates the interactions between zzso proteins and zzso The zzso cell line is derived from rat pancreatic zzso tumor cells and develops an zzso zzso when treated with zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to examine the expression of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells in the presence or absence of zzso zzso interactions were also zzso Both zzso zzso were detected in zzso cells by zzso In zzso cells, quantitative zzso revealed that zzso expression increased by zzso although this change was not statistically zzso zzso levels were zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was membrane zzso whereas zzso was exclusively zzso zzso treatment did not affect the zzso distribution of zzso zzso zzso was present in the zzso and membrane zzso of zzso cells and zzso with zzso zzso Moreover, density zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso revealed that zzso and zzso zzso on low- and zzso membrane zzso including zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso release from these cells in a zzso zzso Our results indicate that as zzso cells differentiate into zzso cells, zzso zzso expression and zzso is not significantly zzso Moreover, our findings suggest that zzso regulates zzso zzso in zzso cells by interacting with zzso
