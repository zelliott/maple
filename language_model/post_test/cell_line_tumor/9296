Identification of zzso that are zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso breast zzso is essential in zzso the zzso basis of their increased zzso potential and resistance to several zzso zzso We here applied human zzso zzso zzso with the goal of identifying a unique zzso zzso zzso in breast zzso Human zzso zzso III zzso zzso which simultaneously detects 42 zzso and growth factors on one zzso was used to determine the profile of zzso in zzso media obtained from zzso cells, a zzso clone engineered to zzso express the full-length human zzso zzso controlled by a zzso viral promoter, and from the zzso control zzso We identified two inflammatory and zzso zzso zzso with at least a zzso increased expression in zzso zzso zzso when compared to matched control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso differential zzso of zzso and zzso was validated by zzso and further confirmed by switching off the zzso zzso Treatment with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso returned the expression levels of zzso and zzso back to the baseline observed in zzso breast cancer cells, which express zzso levels of zzso To evaluate the diagnostic utility of these findings, zzso zzso zzso were incubated with zzso zzso collected from zzso breast cancer zzso This approach revealed a high similarity between the zzso zzso observed in serum samples and that obtained in media zzso by breast zzso cell zzso Thus, zzso and zzso circulating levels were significantly higher in zzso breast cancer patients compared with zzso zzso These findings reveal for the first time that: a) zzso synthesis and zzso of members of the zzso zzso family, which have recently been linked to zzso zzso zzso zzso increased cell invasion and zzso may represent a new zzso involved in the zzso progression and zzso resistance of zzso breast zzso and b) zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso may represent novel zzso monitoring breast cancer responses to zzso treatments and/or zzso zzso
