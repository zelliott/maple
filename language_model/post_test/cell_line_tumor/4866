The potential zzso properties of the crude extract of zzso zzso were zzso Growth zzso was investigated in zzso human normal zzso cells and zzso mouse normal zzso cell line and in two human colon cancer cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso The extract was not zzso to zzso cells at zzso zzso higher than the zzso of zzso zzso The extract inhibited zzso the growth of zzso cells zzso zzso to a greater extent than zzso cells zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso cells were more sensitive than zzso zzso zzso cells to the zzso effects of the plant zzso five times lower zzso were needed to induce zzso in zzso zzso zzso induction by the extract was associated with an increase in the expression of zzso proteins such as zzso and zzso and a significant zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso decrease in zzso D1 protein and increase in zzso protein was observed in zzso zzso zzso In zzso the crude extract injected zzso reduced the number of tumors by zzso ( zzso and decreased the mean size of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso model of colon zzso These data collectively suggest that zzso zzso has potential zzso cancer zzso
