zzso zzso in zzso has evolved an zzso stress response involving zzso of the classic zzso protein and induction of sets of proteins including one named zzso This zzso stress response might be due to the unusual environmental pressures placed on zzso zzso In fact, zzso plays a role as an zzso factor in response to DNA damage induced by zzso acid stresses implicated in zzso zzso zzso zzso also has a genetic signature characteristic of an zzso and rapidly evolving zzso and this observation has been used to imply a role for zzso in zzso zzso models of zzso tissue are required to further define the regulation and function of zzso We examined whether zzso zzso zzso would be a good model to study zzso since this animal suffers from a zzso disease in zzso zzso zzso We have zzso cloned and zzso the zzso zzso locus from zzso bacterial artificial zzso zzso DNA, zzso confirmed the zzso divergent nature of the zzso portion of the zzso gene amongst zzso zzso discovered that a function of the zzso zzso domain of the gene is to maintain zzso zzso and zzso examined zzso expression in normal and diseased zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso tissue was relatively confined to gastric zzso zzso consistent with its expression in normal human zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso protein in normal and damaged zzso zzso demonstrated significant zzso of zzso protein in the injured zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso would be a robust zzso model to examine the evolution and function of the zzso stress zzso in modulating zzso responses in zzso zzso
