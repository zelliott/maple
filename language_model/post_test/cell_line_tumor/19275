It is well established that high-risk human zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso are the zzso agents of cervical zzso In contrast, the association of zzso zzso types with the development of zzso skin cancer zzso is less well zzso In this study, we have zzso the in zzso transforming potential of various zzso zzso zzso Using zzso cooperation zzso with activated zzso we have shown that diverse zzso types, including 12, 14, 15, 24, 36 and 49, have significant transforming zzso Interestingly, most of this activity appears to be zzso by the E6 gene zzso In contrast, the common zzso exhibits no significant transforming potential in these zzso This difference may be a reflection of different patterns of cellular zzso with transforming zzso being nuclear and zzso being zzso These results provide molecular support for a role of these viruses in the development of certain human zzso
