zzso zzso alpha zzso is a central zzso regulator of hypoxic zzso zzso of zzso is important for exploring zzso zzso zzso This study was carried out to analyze the zzso changes of biological characteristics in the human tongue zzso cell zzso cell line zzso and evaluate the effects of zzso on the zzso of the tongue zzso cell zzso 

zzso gene was silenced with zzso short interfering zzso acids zzso zzso expression was measured on zzso level by real-time reverse zzso zzso and protein level by Western zzso and zzso The cell cycle and zzso of zzso cells were analyzed by zzso The proliferation and zzso of zzso cells were determined by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso could survive and showed a more aggressive zzso under hypoxic zzso Exposure to zzso induced a prolonged zzso of zzso protein and zzso of zzso targeting zzso zzso reduced zzso synthesis as measured on zzso and protein zzso Under zzso or hypoxic conditions, treatment of zzso cells with zzso induced cell zzso and inhibited the growth and zzso 

zzso could zzso the tolerance against zzso in zzso cells and inhibit their aggressive zzso zzso with zzso pathways by zzso strategy may provide a therapeutic target for human tongue zzso cell zzso
