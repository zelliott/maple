zzso zzso and its zzso in zzso are derived from the repair of zzso DNA and the cleanup of zzso damaged DNA zzso zzso While the harmful effects of zzso present in DNA have been studied zzso few have reported its effects on zzso zzso Our previous study showed that the addition of zzso to culture media caused an zzso of zzso in nuclear DNA in several zzso cells including zzso which lack zzso zzso 1 zzso activity due to zzso zzso However, the mechanism underlying zzso level increases in DNA has not been zzso In this study, we zzso the zzso fate of zzso zzso and the effect of zzso zzso on DNA synthesis in zzso zzso We found that zzso was rapidly zzso to zzso rather than zzso to zzso thus indicating that zzso zzso is not used as a zzso for DNA synthesis in zzso zzso In fact, zzso zzso was incubated but zzso was not detected in nuclear DNA of zzso cells, showing that zzso is not directly incorporated into zzso Interestingly, the activity of DNA zzso zzso which zzso DNA with low zzso increased in zzso cells treated with zzso whereas the expression of DNA zzso alpha zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso in zzso DNA was completely inhibited by a specific inhibitor of DNA zzso zzso Thus, our findings address that the zzso of zzso into zzso DNA is not due to the direct incorporation of zzso zzso but rather to the inaccurate incorporation of zzso zzso by DNA zzso zzso It further suggests that zzso in the zzso may function as an active zzso itself and zzso the zzso DNA zzso
