To investigate the efficacy of zzso with a zzso zzso gene zzso in enhancing the zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were divided into 3 group and zzso with the zzso containing zzso zzso zzso group), Ad zzso zzso group), or without treatment zzso control zzso Before and after zzso of the cells with 6 zzso zzso X zzso Western zzso was performed to measure the expression level of zzso in the zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso zzso carried out to evaluate the nuclear zzso zzso zzso activity in the cell zzso with the cell zzso detected using zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso cells were determined by comparison between the 3 groups in term of the surviving cell zzso zzso after zzso X-ray exposure, and of the Do and zzso values obtained using the zzso zzso target zzso 

Before the X-ray exposure, the zzso zzso cells in zzso group and the control group showed low levels of zzso zzso in the zzso which were further decreased after the zzso The zzso activity in the zzso of the cells in the two groups was positive zzso before zzso and substantially enhanced zzso after the exposure and maintained the zzso activated zzso The zzso index of the cells in the two groups was zzso and zzso before zzso and increased to zzso and zzso after the zzso zzso The cells in the zzso group, however, exhibited high levels of zzso zzso either before or after the zzso which were approximately 3 times that of the zzso group, but the zzso activity remained negative irrespective of the zzso The zzso index of the cells in the zzso group was zzso before zzso was increased to zzso after the zzso Among the 3 groups, zzso group had the smallest zzso value of zzso but the highest sensitivity enhancement ratio zzso zzso with the lowest Do and zzso values zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso gene zzso into zzso cells zzso the zzso activity of zzso to enhance the zzso of the zzso
