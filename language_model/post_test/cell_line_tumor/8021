To investigate the effect of zzso zzso on proliferation and zzso in gastric cancer cell line zzso 

Human gastric cancer cell line zzso cells were incubated with various concentration of zzso After various periods of zzso the proliferation of zzso cells was assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso double labeled zzso method and the zzso of the cell was observed under a fluorescent zzso zzso potential was measured by flow zzso after zzso 123 zzso The expressions of zzso C and the zzso family of zzso including zzso zzso Bid and zzso were measured by Western zzso zzso 3 and 8 activities were measured by zzso zzso zzso 

Treatment with zzso induced zzso as confirmed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with zzso events including the decline of zzso potential, increased release of zzso C from the zzso decreased expression of zzso increased expression of zzso Bid and zzso and zzso of zzso 3 and zzso 

These results suggest that possibly via zzso of the zzso pathway, zzso causes zzso damage leading to the release of zzso C and by regulating the expression of the zzso family of proteins and zzso zzso which leads to results in zzso cell death in zzso zzso Our results might be helpful in zzso new therapeutic approaches using Chinese herbal zzso
