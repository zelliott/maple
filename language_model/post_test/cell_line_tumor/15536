In this study, we reported that zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation and zzso potential of human gastric cancer zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that treated cells displayed typical zzso characteristics of zzso such as zzso of zzso nuclear zzso and formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses and zzso zzso indicated that zzso induced zzso zzso which was associated with collapse of zzso membrane potential, zzso of zzso and zzso generation of zzso zzso oxygen species and zzso of zzso calcium in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso analysis revealed that zzso arrested cells in the zzso phase of the cell zzso These results provided further insights into the potential use of zzso as an zzso agent against human gastric zzso
