zzso zzso are zzso inhibitor regulators of gene expression that act by directly binding complementary zzso and are key zzso of cancer initiation and zzso In this study, we revealed a role for the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso The zzso expression level gradually decreases across normal zzso zzso zzso zzso with complex zzso zzso and zzso zzso A relatively high level of zzso in zzso zzso indicates a longer survival time in zzso zzso The expression of a cell zzso zzso zzso zzso D1 zzso was zzso correlated with zzso expression in zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso has a binding sequence of zzso within its 3' untranslated region, and was confirmed to be a direct target of zzso by the fluorescent reporter zzso zzso the zzso level in zzso cells suppressed cell zzso colon formation activity and zzso zzso and the inhibited zzso zzso induced by zzso were alleviated by zzso expression of zzso without the untranslated region zzso Furthermore, in zzso studies also suggested a zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso increased in cell zzso zzso cells, and was restored to a normal level in zzso cells after cell cycle zzso while zzso displayed the opposite expression zzso zzso this study suggested that zzso plays a zzso role by targeting zzso zzso suppression of zzso leads to an increase in the zzso level, which may promote zzso and progression of zzso
