zzso acid zzso zzso is a major biological active component of zzso zzso that is known to induce zzso However, the zzso mechanism of zzso acid using primary zzso tumor zzso human prostate cells is not zzso In the present study, zzso acid significantly inhibited the growth of zzso cells in zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid induced cell death as evidenced by an increased proportion of cells in zzso phase, the formation of zzso bodies, nuclear zzso and DNA zzso After zzso acid treatment at zzso above 40 zzso the activities of zzso zzso and -9 were significantly increased compared that of zzso zzso acid modulated the zzso of zzso zzso as well as the zzso of zzso zzso zzso acid also zzso Bid zzso which indicates that the zzso action of zzso Bid zzso leads to the zzso of zzso Thus, the zzso effect of zzso acid was involved in zzso and intrinsic signaling zzso In addition, zzso acid increased the expression of the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso in zzso zzso The present results suggest that zzso acid from zzso zzso activated zzso in zzso cells via both zzso and zzso zzso
