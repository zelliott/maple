Little is known about the genetic zzso explaining variation in sensitivity to zzso zzso We characterized the degree of zzso sensitivity, using zzso cell lines derived from 10 Centre zzso du zzso zzso zzso We estimated the zzso for zzso to zzso zzso to be approximately zzso therefore, sensitivity to the zzso effects of zzso is under appreciable genetic zzso zzso analysis was performed, and the strongest signal zzso score, zzso empirical P zzso zzso was found on zzso 1 at 44 zzso zzso to zzso zzso is likely due to multiple zzso with low zzso zzso contributing to the zzso These data show the power of using large zzso that have been extensively zzso for evaluating the genetic contribution to sensitivity to cell growth zzso by zzso zzso
