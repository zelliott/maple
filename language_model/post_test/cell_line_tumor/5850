zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso is implicated in cell growth and survival, zzso zzso tumor zzso and cell zzso Recent studies showed that the expression and activity of zzso increased significantly in many types of solid zzso However, the exact molecular mechanism of zzso zzso tumor has not been fully zzso The purpose of our study was to determine whether zzso of zzso would inhibit cell growth and induce zzso in zzso cancer cells using a zzso zzso based small interfering zzso zzso The experiments showed that zzso of zzso could remarkably inhibit cell proliferation and growth, regulate cell cycle and induce zzso of zzso cancer zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso of zzso inhibited zzso of downstream signaling targets protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and reduced expression of zzso in zzso as well as zzso cells by Western zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso also could increase expression of zzso inhibitor zzso an important zzso zzso protein with many zzso zzso nude mice injected with the zzso cells zzso zzso zzso showed a significant zzso of the tumor growth with lighter tumor weight, lower zzso density and higher zzso rate than those in the other two control zzso In conclusion, these results suggest that zzso might be involved in the development of zzso cancer, and could be served as a novel potential therapy target for human zzso zzso Our study may be of biological and clinical zzso
