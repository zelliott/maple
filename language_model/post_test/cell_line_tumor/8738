zzso and early clinical studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells are highly promising in cancer zzso We observed that targeting zzso in a zzso zzso cell line results in the emergence of zzso tumor cells that maintain the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting of these zzso zzso could therefore offset this escape zzso We studied the zzso zzso patterns of zzso zzso and zzso in primary zzso samples using zzso flow zzso and zzso and applied a zzso routine to the permutations of zzso expression and the related odds of complete tumor zzso This mathematical model demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso could zzso expand the therapeutic reach of the T cell product in all primary tumors zzso zzso a third zzso did not predict an added advantage in the tumor cohort zzso We therefore generated zzso T cell products from healthy donors and from zzso patients by pooling T cells individually expressing zzso and zzso zzso and by making individual T cells to zzso both zzso Both zzso T cell products offset zzso escape, producing enhanced zzso activity in zzso zzso (against zzso zzso cells in the case of zzso patient zzso and in an zzso zzso zzso zzso Further, T cells zzso zzso and zzso exhibited zzso yet zzso downstream signaling and a particularly enhanced zzso zzso
