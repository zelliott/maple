Many tumors have large zzso deletions of the zzso locus zzso zzso and zzso and of zzso zzso Our aim was to determine which gene is the major target in zzso zzso We used quantitative real-time zzso zzso to determine copy number of zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2 in 22 tumor cell lines and 83 zzso tumors, some of which had been assessed previously by duplex zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso deletion could be detected in the presence of up to zzso normal zzso zzso for cell lines were compatible with previous zzso zzso Ten cell lines and 32 tumors zzso had zzso deletion of at least one zzso Thirteen tumors zzso had deletion of all three zzso Two tumors had deletion of zzso zzso zzso alone and four of zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso detected more zzso deletions than duplex zzso Finally we used a multiplex zzso probe amplification kit to provide independent confirmation of zzso We conclude that with appropriate controls zzso is a sensitive and robust method to detect copy number changes in tumors even in the presence of zzso normal cell zzso
