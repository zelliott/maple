The aim of this study was to analyze the potential role of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso of cancer zzso In the highly zzso zzso cell lines A3 and zzso zzso zzso of zzso induced an zzso transition associated with decreased zzso in zzso collagen and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells as well as in zzso cells resulted in an enhanced zzso zzso associated with increased zzso and elevated zzso zzso zzso the zzso transition in zzso cells triggered by zzso zzso was associated with increased zzso zzso ability, although this was not sufficient to compensate for the decreased invasive capability caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells with zzso of zzso the ability to degrade the zzso zzso was greatly zzso Taken together, we suggest that zzso zzso of zzso leading to effective zzso zzso is a possible mechanism through which zzso could contribute to tumor cell invasion and zzso
