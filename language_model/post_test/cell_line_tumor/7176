Because zzso zzso of a gene with multiple zzso give rise to proteins with different functions, it seems plausible that changes in the expression levels of the zzso zzso could be a contributing factor to zzso In fact, recent examples in the literature clearly illustrate that altered expression levels of zzso zzso may play an important role in zzso Furthermore, these works demonstrate that changes in expression levels could potentially be used to zzso monitor disease zzso zzso diagnose disease, and/or zzso determine disease zzso In this work an immobilized form of zzso known as zzso technology, was adapted to zzso the relative expression levels of zzso zzso Specifically, the relative expression levels of the two zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined using zzso zzso
