zzso zzso cells zzso also called zzso stem cells, migrate and function as zzso cells in tumor zzso The effects of zzso on tumor growth are zzso In this study, we showed that zzso increase proliferation of tumor cells in zzso and promote tumor growth in zzso We also further analyzed the mechanisms that zzso these zzso For use in in zzso and in zzso experiments, we established a bone zzso zzso zzso cell line from cells isolated in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso on tumor cell proliferation in zzso were analyzed in a zzso model with zzso zzso Both zzso with zzso and treatment with zzso media led to enhanced growth of zzso cells, although the magnitude of growth stimulation in zzso cells was greater than that of cells treated with zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells and zzso into zzso mice led to increased tumor size compared with injection of zzso cells zzso zzso experiments using Lewis lung zzso zzso cells instead of zzso cells yielded similar zzso zzso with a role for zzso in zzso tumor growth, tumor vessel area was greater in tumors resulting from zzso of zzso cells or zzso with zzso than in tumors induced by injection of cancer cells zzso zzso zzso directly supported the tumor zzso by zzso close to vascular walls and by expressing an zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of leukemia zzso factor, zzso zzso factor, zzso inflammatory zzso and vascular zzso growth factor was increased in zzso of zzso and zzso cells compared with zzso cells zzso Together, these results indicate that zzso promote tumor growth both in zzso and in zzso and suggest that tumor promotion in zzso may be attributable in part to enhanced zzso
