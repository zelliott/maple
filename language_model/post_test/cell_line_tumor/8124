zzso zzso a zzso protein 90 zzso zzso has been zzso investigated for cancer therapy and is undergoing clinical zzso Human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso is one of the client proteins of zzso and its expression is decreased upon zzso zzso In this study, we aimed to zzso monitor the zzso response to zzso treatment in zzso zzso 

The sensitivity of human zzso cancer zzso cells to zzso in zzso was measured by zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells was determined by flow zzso zzso mice bearing zzso tumors were treated with zzso and the therapeutic efficacy was evaluated by tumor size zzso Both treated and control mice were zzso with zzso using zzso and zzso zzso studies and zzso zzso were performed to validate the zzso zzso 

zzso cells are sensitive to zzso treatment, in a zzso manner, with an zzso value of zzso zzso after 72 h zzso The tumor growth curve supported the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging showed that zzso had prominent tumor zzso in zzso zzso tumors, which was significantly reduced in zzso zzso There was no zzso difference detected by zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed the significant reduction in tumor zzso level upon zzso zzso 

The early response to zzso therapy was successfully monitored by quantitative PET using zzso This approach may be valuable in monitoring the therapeutic response in zzso cancer patients under zzso zzso
