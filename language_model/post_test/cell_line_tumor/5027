The therapeutic value of donor zzso infusions in patients who zzso with acute zzso leukemia zzso after zzso zzso stem cell transplantation zzso is limited by a low efficacy and the risk of zzso zzso We aimed at generating zzso donor T cells for patients with zzso 

zzso blood zzso cells of the donor were zzso with mature donor zzso cells, zzso with zzso patient zzso blasts zzso or directly with zzso zzso After 3 weekly zzso donor cells were tested for zzso zzso in an zzso zzso 

In 5 of 6 donors, cells with zzso against patient LB with low or absent zzso against zzso cells could be zzso T cell subset analyses in 2 donors indicated that specific zzso zzso was mainly zzso by zzso T cells, which were also the zzso cell fraction in 4 of 6 zzso One zzso donor T cell line was expanded with a recently developed zzso One week of expansion resulted in a zzso increase in zzso with sustained specificity of the resulting T cell zzso 

Our results show the feasibility of the in zzso generation of zzso donor zzso rendering this method a promising tool for zzso zzso
