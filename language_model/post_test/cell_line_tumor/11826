The presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was previously reported in benign and zzso zzso and cell lines derived from the human zzso zzso The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of zzso zzso on the survival, zzso growth rate and zzso capacity of breast cancer in an experimental zzso 

zzso zzso of the highly invasive human breast cancer cell line zzso were established in immune deficient nude zzso The following zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the experimental compound zzso zzso 

Data indicate that developed zzso were highly zzso expressed zzso and exhibited high levels of zzso content and proliferation marker zzso while displaying low zzso Mice of the zzso group displayed a median survival of 60 days and a zzso doubling time of zzso zzso zzso zzso A significant decrease in zzso growth evidenced by an augment of the zzso doubling time was observed in the zzso zzso groups zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in zzso zzso This effect was associated with a decrease in the zzso expression levels, and also reduced zzso vessels in zzso and zzso treated zzso zzso significantly increased median survival (78 zzso zzso rank zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso through the zzso exhibits a crucial role in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso offer a novel therapeutic potential as zzso for breast cancer zzso
