The zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates a multitude of cellular zzso zzso of zzso signaling is often observed in human zzso A major zzso of zzso is zzso zzso B zzso Recent studies have pointed to distinct roles of zzso zzso in cancer cell zzso Studies have shown that zzso zzso can zzso breast cancer cell zzso whereas zzso zzso enhances this zzso Here, we have evaluated the mechanism by which zzso blocks the migration of breast cancer cells through the zzso factor zzso A major zzso of zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso also a zzso zzso zzso of zzso using short hairpin zzso or a selective inhibitor zzso blocks breast cancer cell migration zzso with a reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity is due to zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso which are unresponsive to zzso reveal that zzso of cell migration by zzso is zzso by zzso These effects are zzso at the levels of zzso degradation by the zzso Our studies show that zzso of zzso leads to zzso of the zzso zzso and the outcome of this signaling event is degradation of zzso by the zzso and subsequent zzso of cell zzso
