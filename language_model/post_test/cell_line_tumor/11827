zzso disruptions that occur widely in zzso offer an attractive focus for generalized treatment zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso senses zzso status and produces an essential zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso and thereby zzso the function of its target zzso Here, we report that the zzso is activated in prostate cancer cells and that zzso is a central regulator of zzso stability in this zzso zzso genes were zzso in human prostate zzso and zzso regulated in cultured human cancer cell zzso zzso analysis of human specimens zzso zzso 1987) established that zzso is zzso at the protein level and that its expression zzso with high zzso score, zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso was sufficient to decrease prostate cancer cell zzso zzso profiling showed that the principal effects of zzso zzso in prostate cancer cells were related to zzso progression and DNA zzso In particular, zzso was identified as a candidate upstream regulator of zzso target genes and zzso zzso zzso a zzso decrease in the levels of zzso protein but not zzso zzso in cell zzso Supporting this relationship, expression of zzso and zzso was tightly correlated in human prostate cancer samples zzso zzso zzso Our findings identify zzso as a zzso of prostate cancer growth and zzso as a key target of zzso function in prostate cancer zzso
