The 3' untranslated region zzso of the dengue virus zzso zzso contain several sequences required for translation, replication and zzso zzso This region also binds cellular proteins such as zzso zzso zzso protein zzso Y zzso protein 1, zzso protein and the translation initiation factor zzso zzso zzso is a cellular protein that interacts with the regulatory sequences of zzso zzso viruses such as several zzso and zzso C zzso In the present report, it was demonstrated that zzso zzso from the nucleus to the zzso during zzso zzso At 48 h zzso zzso as well as the zzso proteins zzso and zzso were found to zzso with the zzso zzso marker zzso zzso of zzso expression inhibited virus translation and zzso whilst zzso of zzso zzso these zzso Thus, these results provide evidence that, during infection, zzso moves from the nucleus to the zzso and plays an important role in the zzso zzso zzso
