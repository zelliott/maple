Exposure to the sun's zzso radiation appears to be the most important environmental factor involved in the development of skin zzso UVA is the major portion of zzso radiation in sunlight and is considered to be a human zzso In this study, we have investigated the delayed and sustained zzso of zzso zzso by UVA zzso In zzso a delayed Ras zzso with a similar time course was observed after UVA zzso The activated Ras was found to be localized in zzso such as the zzso apparatus instead of plasma zzso zzso of dominant negative Ras zzso abolished zzso zzso by zzso The presence of zzso an zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso or Ras zzso indicating that zzso zzso activity is not involved in zzso zzso by zzso In contrast, protein zzso C zzso depletion by chronic zzso treatment nearly abolished zzso zzso and Ras zzso The presence of the zzso inhibitor zzso had a similar zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso by UVA is zzso by zzso in a zzso zzso In addition, a gradual increase in zzso calcium level after UVA exposure was detected by flow zzso The presence of the zzso inhibitor zzso or the calcium zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked both zzso and Ras zzso suggesting that both zzso and calcium are required for zzso zzso Our findings demonstrated that, different from zzso and zzso zzso delayed and sustained zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso but zzso The delayed and sustained zzso zzso provides a survival signal to human zzso zzso which may serve as an important mechanism for cell transformation and potential skin zzso in zzso caused by UVA zzso
