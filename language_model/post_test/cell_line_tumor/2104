Recent studies have shown that mast cells are involved in zzso processes of chronic zzso However, little is known about the distribution of mast cells in zzso zzso which is a chronic inflammatory disease of the upper zzso zzso specimens from patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and control patients without zzso zzso zzso zzso 8) were included in this zzso The distribution of mast cells in zzso zzso was determined by zzso Meanwhile, we detected the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cells of normal zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the expression of these zzso was investigated by western zzso in airway zzso cells line zzso zzso under inflammatory zzso zzso cells migrated toward zzso in zzso zzso and the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in the zzso cells of zzso zzso compared with normal zzso zzso The expression of zzso was also zzso in zzso cells after zzso zzso for 3 zzso and 6 zzso Our findings showed that mast cells migrate toward zzso in zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested that they might be responsible for mast cells zzso It implies that mast cell play potential roles in the development of zzso zzso
