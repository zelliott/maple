zzso zzso is common in head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso with resistance to zzso Thus, a zzso zzso small zzso that mimics the zzso domain of zzso proteins may inhibit zzso function and have therapeutic potential for zzso by overcoming zzso zzso the zzso zzso of a natural product isolated from zzso and roots, was recently discovered to bind to the zzso binding groove of zzso and zzso 

We investigated the in zzso effects of zzso on zzso cell lines as well as on zzso and zzso cultures by using zzso zzso zzso cell survival zzso and assessed the results with respect to zzso family protein zzso 

We observed zzso growth zzso of 10 zzso cell lines at biologically achievable doses zzso zzso zzso doses required to inhibit the growth of human zzso cell lines by 50% were zzso to zzso higher than for zzso cell zzso To inhibit human oral zzso growth by zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso higher than for zzso cell zzso 

There is a direct correlation between zzso ratios and sensitivity to zzso This agent induced zzso in a much higher proportion of cells with zzso zzso zzso cell lines resistant to zzso were very sensitive to zzso These results demonstrate that zzso has potent zzso activity in zzso in zzso This agent may be developed as a novel therapeutic agent for zzso either alone or in combination with existing zzso zzso
