zzso zzso 1 zzso plays a critical role in the zzso zzso of free zzso Cellular cholesterol depletion zzso the transport of zzso from the zzso recycling compartment to the plasma membrane zzso and cholesterol zzso causes the zzso of zzso together with cholesterol via zzso zzso Although zzso has been zzso the other proteins involved in cholesterol zzso and the zzso recycling of zzso are largely zzso Most of the zzso trafficking events are dependent on the zzso and motor zzso Here, we investigated the roles of the zzso and zzso triple complex composed of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the transport of zzso from the zzso recycling compartment to the zzso zzso with the dynamics of the zzso by pharmacological treatment delayed the transport of zzso to the cell zzso Meanwhile, zzso of any component of the zzso zzso triple complex inhibited the export of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso decreased the cellular cholesterol zzso by blocking the transport of zzso to the zzso These results suggest that the efficient transport of zzso to the PM is dependent on the zzso zzso zzso triple zzso
