zzso is increasingly being used in cancer biology for zzso discovery and identification of potential novel therapeutic zzso However, a systematic zzso study of multiple zzso to determine their zzso and to describe their use as tumor proxies is zzso Using a mouse zzso model of kidney cancer, characterized by zzso zzso of zzso clear cell human kidney cancer cells, we examined zzso serum, and urine all obtained simultaneously at baseline zzso and at, or close to, animal sacrifice zzso zzso and zzso Uniform zzso analysis of all three zzso was accomplished using gas zzso and liquid zzso zzso Of all the zzso identified zzso in zzso 246 in serum, and 267 in zzso 89 were detected in all 3 zzso and the majority was altered in the same zzso Heat maps of individual zzso showed that zzso in serum were more closely related to tissue than was zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and significantly (when corrected for multiple zzso altered in tissue and serum, and zzso zzso showed the highest change zzso in zzso of any zzso On the basis of these and other considerations, three pathways were chosen for zzso validation of the zzso data, resulting in potential therapeutic target zzso These data show that serum zzso analysis is a more accurate proxy for tissue changes than urine and that zzso degradation zzso zzso zzso is highly represented in zzso cell zzso and support the concept that zzso antagonism may be a potential therapeutic approach for this zzso
