zzso redesign of selected zzso zzso zzso binding compounds has previously been successful in the discovery of new zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were designed based in part on combinations of the structural and electronic components of tamoxifen and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso reaction was used as the key synthetic step in the preparation of these zzso and zzso zzso The structural assignment of zzso Z zzso was determined on the basis of zzso zzso The ability of these compounds to inhibit zzso zzso and cell growth in selected human cancer cell lines was zzso Although the compounds were found to be less potent than zzso these zzso significantly advance the known zzso relationship associated with the zzso binding site on zzso
