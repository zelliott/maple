The appearance of highly zzso avian influenza A viruses of the H5N1 zzso being able to zzso humans and the 2009 zzso pandemic reveals the urgent need for new and efficient zzso against these zzso The long-term efficacy of current zzso is often zzso because of the emergence of drug-resistant virus zzso A growing understanding of the zzso interaction raises the possibility to explore alternative targets involved in the viral zzso In the present study we show that the zzso inhibitor zzso leads to reduction of influenza virus replication in human lung zzso zzso cells zzso as demonstrated with three different influenza virus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso value of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso value of zzso zzso In in zzso experiments we could demonstrate that zzso of zzso mice with zzso zzso results in no toxic side effects, reduced progeny virus zzso in the lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and enhanced survival of mice after infection with a zzso zzso of the human influenza A virus strain zzso zzso zzso up to zzso Furthermore, treatment of mice with zzso reduced the zzso release of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced by zzso or highly pathogen avian H5N1 influenza A zzso The present data demonstrates an zzso effect of zzso in zzso and in zzso and the ability to reduce influenza virus induced zzso and zzso
