This study investigated the possibility of incorporating zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso which are being developed for bone tissue engineering zzso zzso films with 20 zzso zzso and 10 zzso vitamin E were prepared using the zzso casting zzso zzso of vitamin E significantly improved the zzso of the zzso along with increasing the total protein zzso The presence of protein zzso on the composite surface was further confirmed using X-ray zzso zzso zzso zzso cell culture studies using zzso human zzso showed that the addition of vitamin E in the zzso zzso zzso films significantly increased cell zzso The results achieved in this study confirmed the possibility of incorporating vitamin E as a suitable additive in zzso zzso to engineer the surface of the zzso by promoting higher protein zzso and increasing the zzso
