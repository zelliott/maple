There have so far been few reports describing zzso studies of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Using zzso we observed zzso liver tumors in rats and examined the effect of an zzso injection of an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso 

Male zzso rats were given 100 zzso of zzso for 6 weeks and their liver zzso were examined by zzso zzso The size of the zzso was measured and they were examined zzso The effect of zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso on the growth of rat zzso cell line zzso was tested in zzso zzso zzso was injected into the liver zzso under zzso guidance in zzso and the changes in the zzso cell nuclear zzso expression and size of the zzso were zzso 

The four distinct zzso of rat zzso were clearly observed by zzso zzso The zzso in the zzso were first detected 6 weeks after the treatment began, when they were as small as zzso zzso in zzso The zzso thereafter became more zzso zzso as they grew larger than 4 zzso zzso decreased the expression of zzso cell nuclear zzso and the growth of zzso zzso After zzso was injected in zzso the zzso cell nuclear zzso level and the growth rate of the rat liver zzso all significantly zzso 

Our results indicate that zzso is quite useful for follow-up studies of liver zzso in rats, and zzso zzso zzso might be another therapeutic target in liver zzso
