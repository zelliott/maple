zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling plays an instrumental role in zzso zzso zzso However, how zzso zzso regulates the tumor zzso to promote zzso cell invasion remains to be zzso Here, we demonstrate that the levels of zzso zzso in tumor cells correlated with the levels of zzso zzso in human zzso zzso This was supported by our observation that zzso zzso enhanced the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso treatment induced zzso of vascular cell zzso zzso zzso expression in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso interrupted the binding of zzso to zzso cells and inhibited zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso These results demonstrate an instrumental role for zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso cell interaction and tumor cell invasion and indicate that zzso is a potential molecular target for improving cancer zzso
