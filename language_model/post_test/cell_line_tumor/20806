zzso have been involved in multiple cellular processes such as growth, differentiation and zzso and more recently as regulators of cell death signaling zzso Some of these molecules can be considered as zzso zzso in particular, zzso zzso zzso zzso which are promising candidates for zzso therapy because of their low expression in normal human zzso In this study, we provided the molecular and cellular characterization of a novel cell death mechanism induced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso tumor cell line but not in mouse normal cells (B and zzso T zzso that expressed the zzso zzso of zzso synthesis in tumor cells zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso however, zzso zzso of the zzso did not restore tumor cell sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso fragments retained the zzso capacity of the whole zzso By contrary, other zzso which recognizes zzso zzso did not show any zzso zzso These zzso showed quite different capacities to bind zzso cell lines measured by binding zzso zzso Interestingly, this zzso cell death mechanism did not resemble zzso because no DNA zzso zzso zzso or zzso mediation were zzso However, zzso zzso zzso zzso cell death was accompanied by cellular zzso membrane zzso formation, and zzso zzso suggesting an zzso zzso This novel mechanism of cell death lets us to support further therapeutic approaches using zzso as a molecular target for zzso cancer zzso
