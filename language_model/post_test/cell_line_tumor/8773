zzso zzso is a cancer disease with rising zzso zzso signaling has been shown to be zzso in many zzso However, the role of this signaling zzso in the zzso of zzso is still not fully zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso zzso by zzso inhibitor IX zzso zzso in cultured human zzso cell lines and we established a transgenic mouse model with liver specific expression of the zzso domain of zzso zzso and zzso of tumor zzso zzso zzso IX treatment effectively impaired cell zzso migration, invasion, zzso to zzso transition and growth of zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso together with an zzso of zzso significantly increased tumor burden and showed zzso zzso 

Our study highlights the importance of zzso signaling in the zzso of zzso and demonstrates that additional zzso of zzso in zzso
