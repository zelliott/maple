zzso influenza viruses zzso are zzso pathogens that pose a potential threat to human zzso In this study, we analyzed the differential zzso zzso of zzso zzso human lung zzso cells using two-dimensional gel zzso zzso followed by zzso laser zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the comparative analysis, 24 altered proteins (13 zzso and 11 zzso were identified in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso these proteins were involved in zzso signaling and interaction, cellular movement, and zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso profiles of 16 genes corresponding to the identified proteins were estimated by real time zzso zzso analysis suggested that the zzso expressed proteins were clustered primarily into the zzso target of zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso In addition, zzso zzso and zzso signaling appeared to be major pathways modulated in the zzso of infected zzso We further demonstrated that zzso zzso was zzso in the zzso and zzso to zzso during virus zzso These results were verified by Western zzso analysis coupled with zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso data provide insights to further understand the underlying mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In recent years, zzso has emerged as an indispensable tool to unveil the complex molecular events in zzso we zzso perform zzso zzso profiles of human cells infected with zzso zzso zzso to understand zzso zzso and 24 zzso expressed proteins in zzso zzso were identified in zzso zzso The proteins that were identified to have differential expression were involved in zzso signaling and interaction, zzso zzso cell zzso cellular zzso cell death, and energy zzso Furthermore, Western zzso analysis and a zzso zzso further demonstrated that the cellular protein zzso partially zzso with zzso after virus zzso This is a very important discovery in the underlying replication and zzso of zzso which provides a potential target clue for the design of zzso zzso Our results will inspire basic study on zzso infection and drive the understanding for replication and zzso of zzso to control this zzso
