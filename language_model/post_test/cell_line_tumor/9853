zzso one form of physical therapy, is widely used for a large number of musculoskeletal disorders, but its exact mechanism still remains to be zzso One hypothesis is that the zzso stress caused by massage may induce zzso mast cells to release zzso thereby improving the local tissue zzso of zzso In the present work, a mast cell line zzso zzso leukemia cells, zzso was used in zzso to study cellular responses to the stimulus of zzso stress generated by a rotating zzso in a cell zzso The zzso calcium zzso was studied by zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and the released zzso was measured with a zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso An zzso of zzso occurred immediately after the zzso stress, followed by zzso zzso However, both zzso increase and zzso release disappeared when a zzso saline was used, indicating that the rise in the zzso is due to a zzso influx from the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso red, a transient zzso potential zzso zzso zzso could effectively block the zzso zzso zzso release, suggesting that zzso membrane proteins are the likely targets of the zzso zzso Because zzso is a well-known zzso of zzso tissue zzso these results may have an important impact on understanding the mechanism involved in massage zzso
