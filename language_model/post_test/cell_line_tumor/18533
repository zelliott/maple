The marine sponge constituent zzso zzso has been converted to the cancer cell growth inhibitor and zzso designated zzso 2 zzso zzso we also report results of an initial zzso evaluation of new zzso derivatives of zzso zzso Single zzso was found to occur at nitrogen zzso and led to the formation of the zzso derivatives zzso whereas double zzso gave the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso properties of these zzso derivatives are zzso The zzso ammonium zzso zzso zzso 2) and zzso exhibited significant zzso activity against the zzso zzso zzso leukemia and a zzso of human cancer cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso also had broad spectrum zzso activities and were most potent against zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was selected for further development, and results of an initial cell cycle analysis and a zzso zzso study showed effects consistent with zzso of the zzso of cell zzso
