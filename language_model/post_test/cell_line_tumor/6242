The present study aimed to study the mechanisms by which low dose zzso zzso zzso reduces zzso zzso The potential influence of zzso on zzso was examined by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso mean zzso intensity zzso of zzso zzso was examined by flow zzso The gene expression of zzso zzso was determined by zzso The change of cellular expression levels of drug zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured by zzso or zzso zzso Data showed zzso at zzso concentration zzso significantly increased the zzso of zzso on zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso significantly increased the zzso zzso than zzso alone ( zzso Following zzso of zzso cells with zzso the expression of zzso was increased while the expression of zzso and zzso was zzso No obvious zzso of expression of zzso zzso or zzso was zzso Thus, low dose zzso partially reduced drug resistance to zzso in zzso cells via multiple mechanisms, which selectively inhibited the zzso pump zzso but not zzso as well as modulated the expression of zzso proteins such as zzso and zzso in line with previous zzso In zzso The effect of zzso on reducing zzso may have wide clinical application in chemotherapy regimens for zzso
