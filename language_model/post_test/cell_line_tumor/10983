Increased expression of zzso appears to play an important role in the development of zzso zzso The level of zzso expression is regulated by various factors including zzso of members of the zzso family of zzso We previously reported that in zzso human colon cancer cells zzso the major biologically active component of green tea, zzso zzso of two members of this family, zzso and zzso and multiple downstream signaling zzso In this study we examined the effects of zzso on the zzso zzso and on zzso expression in the zzso human colon cancer cell line that expresses a high level and zzso zzso of zzso and also expresses a high level of zzso Treatment of these cells with 20 zzso of zzso (the zzso concentration for growth zzso caused, within 6 hours, a decrease in the zzso zzso zzso forms of not only zzso and zzso but also zzso At 6 to 12 hours there was a decrease in the zzso forms of the downstream signaling proteins zzso and zzso Within 6 to 12 hours there was a decrease in cellular levels of both zzso protein and zzso and within 48 hours the cells displayed zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso inhibited the zzso activities of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso also caused a decrease in production of zzso a major product of zzso With a longer incubation time, 96 hours, a very low dose zzso zzso of zzso also caused zzso of cell growth, zzso of zzso of zzso zzso and zzso a decrease in the levels of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso These results provide the first evidence that a low concentration of zzso can inhibit zzso of, at least, three members of the zzso family of zzso and also inhibit zzso expression in colon cancer zzso These findings extend our previous evidence that zzso may be useful in the zzso and/or treatment of zzso zzso
