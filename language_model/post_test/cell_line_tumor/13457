Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been widely researched as zzso for small molecular zzso zzso To combine the advantages of zzso and zzso studies on the preparation of zzso zzso and cellular evaluation were carried zzso 

First, a zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso through a zzso reaction, and then silicone oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared through the zzso zzso Physical and chemical properties such as particle size, zzso potential, and zzso were zzso and zzso X-ray scattering zzso analysis was employed to identify the zzso structures of the generated zzso Cellular zzso and zzso studies were also zzso 

zzso zzso with different amounts of zzso deposited were zzso and zzso studies showed that zzso structures existed in the zzso zzso The zzso size of zzso and zzso deposited zzso zzso were 4-5 zzso and 8-10 zzso zzso Based on transmission electron zzso images of zzso zzso dark rings around the zzso could be observed in contrast with zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso exhibited faster release behavior in zzso than zzso zzso cellular zzso research in zzso indicated that the zzso zzso were taken up by zzso cells more zzso and that zzso zzso entered the cell more easily when the amount of zzso was zzso zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso against zzso cells measured using the zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso show promise as zzso for zzso drugs such as zzso
