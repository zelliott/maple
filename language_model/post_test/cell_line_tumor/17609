zzso of the zzso zzso gene to solid tumors is a promising zzso zzso zzso are currently being developed to achieve safe and effective zzso delivery of the zzso zzso Poly zzso zzso zzso is a novel gene carrier that was recently zzso The goal of this study was to use this gene delivery system for treatment of solid zzso To determine the optimal conditions for zzso established zzso in zzso mice were treated with zzso injection of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We determined that the optimal complex composition was 50 zzso zzso and 150 zzso zzso High levels of zzso protein were expressed in tumors after a single injection of zzso zzso zzso complex, whereas serum levels of zzso in treated mice were below the limits of zzso zzso gene therapy with the zzso system significantly inhibited tumor growth in comparison with the controls ( zzso Moreover, both natural killer and zzso T zzso activities from draining zzso zzso of zzso mice were increased substantially in comparison with those of controls ( zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso gene therapy is a potential strategy for treatment of patients with solid zzso
