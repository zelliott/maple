zzso breast cancer is a deadly disease which requires new therapeutic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso functions as a zzso zzso by zzso zzso TRAIL receptors zzso and/or zzso in transformed cells, making it an attractive zzso for zzso zzso However, it is unclear whether zzso or zzso is a better therapeutic target in zzso breast zzso 

Several zzso triple zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cancer cell lines were treated with human zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso or zzso zzso The effects on cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso An zzso model of zzso breast cancer in which zzso labeled breast cancer cells zzso from the zzso zzso to zzso zzso and lung was zzso to evaluate the effects of zzso zzso or zzso on primary and zzso tumor burden in zzso 

zzso was more effective than zzso in zzso zzso inducing zzso and zzso long-term survival of zzso cancer cells, which expressed both zzso and zzso Human zzso zzso cells transformed by zzso Ras were more sensitive to zzso than zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso and lung zzso more robustly than zzso in an zzso model of zzso breast zzso both agents inhibited zzso tumor zzso In addition, zzso was more effective than zzso at suppressing zzso at doses of zzso that were associated with zzso even though zzso reduced primary tumor burden more robustly than zzso 

zzso zzso zzso may be an effective therapeutic strategy for zzso breast zzso
