We previously showed the usefulness of a fused protein of human pancreatic zzso zzso with human zzso growth factor zzso for molecular targeting of zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, the mechanisms underlying the zzso of cell growth by zzso fused proteins was zzso 

zzso zzso was genetically fused to zzso The fused proteins were expressed and isolated from zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of the fused proteins was evaluated by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was zzso into zzso zzso zzso The zzso was not observed in zzso cells zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso zzso against zzso cells was statistically significantly more pronounced than that of zzso 

zzso fused proteins are zzso through zzso and inhibit cell growth by exerting their zzso activity in the zzso
