zzso factors are direct zzso of altered signaling pathways in cancer and frequently determine clinical outcomes in cancer zzso To uncover new zzso factors that would determine clinical outcomes in breast cancer, we systematically analyzed gene expression data from breast cancer zzso Our results revealed that zzso box protein zzso zzso is the top-ranked zzso zzso factor in patients with zzso breast zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso expression led breast cancer cells to become more sensitive to zzso zzso We found that zzso resistance to zzso is zzso by regulating DNA repair zzso We further demonstrated that zzso interacts with zzso in the presence of zzso to protect breast cancer cells from DNA zzso Finally, zzso zzso expression in breast cancer cells in a mouse zzso model significantly zzso the cells to zzso Our systematic approaches identified an unexpected role of zzso in zzso resistance by regulating DNA repair zzso and our findings provide zzso insights into how zzso mediates resistance to zzso and evidence that zzso may be a promising therapeutic target for zzso breast cancer cells to zzso
