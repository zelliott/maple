The zzso the zzso factory of the cell, has emerged as a key player that regulates many aspects of cell zzso Several thousand proteins associate at least zzso with zzso thereby generating a highly dynamic compartment with a protein profile which is sensitive to changes in cell physiology and pharmacological zzso Powerful tools that reliably zzso the zzso are a prerequisite to measure their composition and zzso Previously, we developed quantitative methods to measure zzso labeled molecules in zzso While these tools identify zzso under control and mild stress conditions, the accurate detection of zzso boundaries under harsh experimental conditions is complicated by the lack of appropriate markers for the zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we have now identified new marker proteins to detect zzso upon zzso severe stress and zzso drug treatments that trigger a pronounced reorganization of zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso is an ideal marker to zzso zzso when cells are exposed to heat or zzso zzso Furthermore, we show for the first time that cellular zzso zzso protein zzso and human zzso R protein zzso are excluded from zzso and can be employed to zzso these compartments under severe conditions that zzso major zzso zzso As zzso we used these markers to zzso zzso in cells treated with pharmacological compounds that disrupt the zzso zzso Furthermore, to gain new insights into the biology of the zzso we applied our protocols and zzso zzso and drug-induced changes in zzso organization and zzso Finally, we show that zzso zzso and zzso not only identify zzso in optical zzso but are also suitable to zzso the zzso border following zzso zzso Taken together, our studies present novel marker proteins that zzso zzso with high confidence under a variety of experimental zzso
