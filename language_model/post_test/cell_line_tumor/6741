The zzso and zzso and zzso complexes containing two zzso zzso and zzso 1 and 2 for X zzso zzso and zzso and 2' for X zzso I, zzso or one zzso and one zzso zzso and zzso 3 and 4 for X zzso zzso and 3' and zzso for X zzso I, zzso have been prepared from zzso precursors by zzso with zzso Except for the zzso species, in all other cases the presence of a base was zzso A crucial role of the zzso trans to the zzso undergoing zzso with zzso has been zzso the greater the trans effect the greater the zzso In a panel of human tumor cell lines representative of zzso zzso zzso and breast zzso zzso complexes 1 and 3 are less active than zzso zzso zzso zzso 20, zzso and zzso zzso respectively), whereas trans complexes 2 and 4 are more active than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 26, and zzso zzso respectively), thus indicating that substitution of zzso for one or two zzso zzso determines zzso different effects depending upon the complex zzso
