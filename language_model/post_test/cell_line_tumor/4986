zzso zzso factor, a member of zzso family, is zzso in many tumors and widely known to play critical roles in tumor zzso via directly binding to the promoter of genes involved in tumor migration and zzso Here, we found that zzso zzso promoted breast cancer cell cycle progression and growth in zzso as well as the zzso of cell zzso protein zzso zzso And, the interference of zzso D3 expression by zzso with zzso D3 zzso inhibited the positive role of zzso in cell cycle zzso We further showed that decreasing the expression of zzso by zzso zzso reduced zzso D3 zzso and zzso and inhibited cell cycle progression that was zzso by zzso D3 zzso Taken together, zzso increases cell cycle progression via zzso of zzso D3 transcription, which elicits a new mechanism of breast cancer growth and a new mechanism of zzso D3 zzso
