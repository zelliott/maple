In this study, our aim was to test whether zzso zzso zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso cells can lead to sensitivity to zzso zzso We also investigated, in zzso mice, the efficacy of zzso zzso in red blood cells zzso a safe zzso to induce zzso zzso 

First, zzso expression was evaluated by zzso in sporadic pancreatic zzso zzso Then, 4 pancreatic zzso cell lines were examined by Western zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso and in zzso or zzso zzso Finally, mice bearing the most in zzso sensitive cell line received zzso zzso to investigate the zzso efficacy of serum zzso depletion in zzso 

zzso zzso of pancreatic zzso expressed no or low zzso The highest in zzso zzso to zzso or to reduced zzso medium was observed with zzso line when zzso expression was the zzso In zzso sensitivity was confirmed for this cell zzso 

Plasma zzso depletion by zzso zzso in selected patients having no low or no zzso may be a promising therapeutic approach for pancreatic zzso
