Despite advances, there is an urgent need for effective zzso for relapsed diffuse large zzso lymphoma, particularly in elderly patients and primary central nervous system zzso zzso zzso zzso an oral zzso agent routinely used in the therapy of zzso zzso is active in patients with primary zzso zzso but the response rates are zzso The mechanisms contributing to zzso resistance are zzso 

We undertook an unbiased and zzso approach to understand the zzso zzso and gene expression profiling differences associated with zzso resistance in diffuse large zzso zzso cell lines and identify mechanisms to overcome zzso zzso 

zzso was zzso in a subset of diffuse large zzso zzso cell lines, independent of zzso promoter zzso or protein zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we identified several compounds capable of reversing the gene expression signature associated with zzso zzso The zzso agent zzso zzso is identified by zzso as capable of zzso gene expression to overcome zzso zzso Treatment with zzso led to increased expression of zzso a zzso factor involved in zzso zzso protein zzso zzso previously shown to be zzso silenced in resistant diffuse large zzso zzso In zzso and in zzso treatment with a combination of zzso and zzso had greater zzso activity than either drug alone, with complete responses in zzso diffuse large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and gene expression analysis identified novel genes associated with zzso resistance and demonstrate potent zzso between zzso and zzso The evidence from cell line and zzso experiments supports prospective investigation of zzso in combination with zzso agents in diffuse large zzso zzso
