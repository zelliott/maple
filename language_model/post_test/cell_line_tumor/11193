This study was carried out to dissect the mechanism by which zzso zzso promote resistance to zzso For this purpose, we zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of transgenic zzso of mouse prostate zzso zzso The ability of zzso to promote resistance to radiation was also analyzed by using an zzso zzso to zzso , zzso in a zzso zzso The role of zzso zzso and of a zzso downstream target, zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso in regulating zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso was zzso We show that zzso zzso promote prostate cancer zzso progression and resistance to radiation in zzso zzso zzso zzso are shown here to suppress zzso of zzso and, consequently zzso in response to zzso zzso of zzso is necessary to preserve the effect of zzso on resistance to radiation in zzso and in zzso Finally, given the established zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso we analyzed the ability of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso We report that zzso regulates the expression of zzso zzso which in turn zzso resistance to radiation in zzso zzso In conclusion, this study demonstrates that zzso zzso mediate resistance to zzso radiation through zzso of zzso zzso
