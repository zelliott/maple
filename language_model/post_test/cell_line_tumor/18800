In this study, we screened the zzso activity of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso tumor cells, all of which were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso A zzso effect was observed in mice zzso with zzso and zzso and zzso showed considerable zzso in tumor zzso In the cured mice zzso with zzso a long-term specific immune protection against parental tumor was zzso However, we were unable to identify the zzso that had a zzso activity common to all three tumor zzso Furthermore, an experiment using zzso zzso cells was also performed on mice zzso with zzso zzso A drastic enhancement of the frequency of complete rejection was observed in mice zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Altogether, our results suggest that the zzso activity of zzso zzso is greatly influenced by the kind of tumor and the zzso state of the zzso immune zzso
