Currently, natural products have been shown to present interesting biological and pharmacological activities and are used as zzso zzso Plants have historically been used in treating cancer and are recognized for their ability to produce secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has medicinal applications to treat a wide range of diseases such as zzso 

The current study was designed to evaluate the zzso activity of total extract as well as several zzso from the leaves of zzso zzso total zzso zzso and condensed tannins content of these extracts were also determined to obtain further information on the correlation between the contents of zzso compounds and zzso effects as well as the leaf zzso zzso 

zzso activity was evaluated by zzso zzso and flow zzso methods against human oral cancer, breast zzso and colon zzso cell zzso The total zzso zzso and condensed tannins were determined by zzso aluminum zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Our present study has shown that zzso fraction has the lowest zzso values zzso zzso and also zzso cell cycle arrest zzso zzso after a 24 h zzso The zzso methods showed the highest amount of total zzso zzso and condensed tannins in the methanol fraction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of dry weight of zzso 

The results obtained zzso indicate that walnut zzso fraction may contain effective compounds which can be used as a zzso zzso
