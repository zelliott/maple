zzso zzso are useful diagnostic tools in several zzso zzso However, the routine detection of nuclear envelope zzso using zzso zzso is not always easy to perform in patients' zzso because of the presence of zzso to other nuclear and zzso components which could mask the characteristic zzso pattern of nuclear envelope zzso This is particularly common in zzso from patients with primary zzso zzso zzso which zzso have high zzso of zzso zzso zzso we have zzso a number of commercial slides and alternative fixation conditions to zzso the detection of zzso envelope zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

We have explored the presence of zzso in 33 zzso from patients with established zzso using three different zzso commercial slides and zzso slides with zzso and zzso cells fixed with zzso ethanol, zzso or zzso zzso 

We observed that the IF pattern was related to the cell type used zzso or zzso the manufacturer and the cell fixation zzso When both cell lines were fixed with zzso formaldehyde, the intensity of the zzso zzso was considerably decreased regardless to the serum sample, whereas the prevalence of zzso zzso was significantly zzso as compared to any of the zzso commercial slide and fixation zzso In addition, the prevalence of zzso was zzso increased in zzso zzso 

zzso using appropriately fixed cells represent an easy, no time-consuming and low cost technique for the routine screening of zzso for zzso zzso of zzso is shown to be more efficient using zzso cells instead of commercially available zzso zzso
