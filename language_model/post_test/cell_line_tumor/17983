zzso of proteins plays multiple roles in zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a zzso associated with zzso events and is known to be zzso in many zzso zzso By using zzso zzso a zzso that specifically removes zzso zzso we have examined the potential effects of zzso on tumor functions, focusing on tumor progression in the context of the interaction of tumor cells with the zzso zzso In this zzso we report that zzso treatment zzso in zzso zzso tumor cell zzso to a wide variety of zzso components including zzso zzso collagen I, zzso acid and the complex human zzso zzso By zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was found to decrease zzso zzso Lewis X, an zzso zzso which zzso the rolling of zzso and tumor cells on zzso was found to be diminished on human breast cancer cells after zzso zzso Using a dynamic flow chamber system, we were able to determine that zzso impaired the rolling of zzso cancer cells on human zzso vein zzso cells while significantly increasing their flow zzso Further, the rolling capability of these zzso tumor cells was also impaired on zzso E and zzso zzso Based on these data, we zzso that decreased zzso zzso the interaction between tumor cells and their external zzso which in turn, affects key cell functions modulating tumor zzso Building on our previous studies which demonstrated zzso decreased tumor cell invasion while significantly reducing zzso activity, when added to the fact that decreased zzso on zzso occurs in the presence of zzso also leads us to propose that zzso may zzso zzso and thus provides a promising additional zzso target for novel zzso
