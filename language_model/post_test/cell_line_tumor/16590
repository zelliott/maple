Although new therapies have doubled the survival of multiple myeloma patients, this remains an incurable zzso It has been zzso that the so-called myeloma cancer stem cells would be responsible for tumor initiation and zzso but their unequivocal identification remains zzso Here, we investigated in a panel of myeloma cell lines the presence of zzso cells harboring a stem-cell zzso Thus, only a small population of zzso cells zzso in the zzso cell line was zzso zzso zzso cells expressed the plasma cell markers zzso and zzso and were zzso Additionally, zzso zzso cells did not exhibit stem-cell markers as shown by gene expression profiling and the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that zzso zzso cells are not essential for zzso mice zzso and show lower zzso potential than the zzso zzso zzso These results do not support zzso expression for the identification of myeloma cancer stem zzso
