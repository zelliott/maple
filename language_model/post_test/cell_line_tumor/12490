DNA zzso repair, zzso and zzso structure are intricately associated nuclear zzso but the molecular links between these events are often zzso In this study, we have surveyed the protein complexes that bind at zzso locus control region, and zzso and characterized the function of one such zzso complex from human zzso zzso zzso We further validated the existence of this complex in human zzso zzso normal zzso zzso This complex contains zzso zzso factors, zzso zzso and proteins associated with DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso a zzso component of this complex, abrogates the recruitment of the complex to its zzso DNA sequence and zzso transcription, zzso zzso and usage of the origin of DNA replication at the zzso zzso These results imply a direct link between zzso DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by a single zzso zzso
