Our previous work showed that in zzso cells, a human zzso zzso cell line, the association of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and consequently, the capacity of zzso to activate zzso zzso is regulated by the zzso state of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso The small amount of zzso present in zzso cells is zzso is zzso from the zzso zzso and does not activate zzso zzso However, on induction of the cell to re-enter growth, zzso expression is rapidly zzso it is found zzso associated to zzso zzso and zzso zzso synthesis zzso et zzso zzso zzso using in zzso and in zzso experimental strategies, we show that the zzso zzso is capable of zzso zzso zzso of zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso them, thus enabling zzso association and zzso of zzso zzso zzso also suggest that the regulation of the zzso cycle of zzso occurs at the zzso zzso induction of cells to re-enter growth promotes the zzso of zzso from a nuclear to a zzso location zzso with its zzso zzso zzso in its turn promotes zzso of zzso zzso enabling cells to rapidly activate zzso synthesis to respond to its growth zzso
