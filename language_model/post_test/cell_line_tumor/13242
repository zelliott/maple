zzso evidence implicates zzso peptides zzso and zzso formation as crucial events in the zzso of zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso among others, has emerged as a potential therapeutic intervention for this zzso zzso we employed zzso as a key zzso in our design of zzso compounds capable of interacting with zzso via a zzso hydrogen bond pattern complementary to that of the zzso zzso of zzso The initial design of the compounds was based on connecting two zzso zzso via a zzso to identify suitable scaffold zzso Additional zzso zzso on the two zzso zzso were also explored to enhance zzso zzso interactions with zzso acids of zzso The efficacy of these compounds on zzso zzso zzso formation and toxicity in zzso was assessed using a combination of zzso techniques and viability zzso Using structure activity relationship data from the in zzso zzso we identified compounds capable of preventing pathological zzso of zzso leading to decreased cell zzso
