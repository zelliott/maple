While zzso gamma and beta zzso have gained considerable attention due to their ability to detect zzso zzso using zzso in humans zzso it is unknown whether the sensitivity of such zzso would allow the detection of remaining tumor tissue in the zzso bed after removal of zzso evident zzso 

zzso tumors (13 zzso 17 zzso zzso zzso were generated at the upper thigh of Fisher 344 zzso After approximately zzso zzso was performed to verify increased zzso tumor zzso zzso were surgically exposed and probe readings of tumor and background zzso were performed in zzso To evaluate the ability to detect tiny tumor zzso 12 tumor fragments zzso zzso were placed into the zzso bed and measured to obtain a zzso ratio zzso zzso were classified as positive if count rates were above zzso zzso of muscle zzso All tumor and muscle zzso were weighed and counted to obtain the zzso zzso background ratio zzso for zzso The presence or absence of tumor tissue was verified by zzso 

In the presence of background gamma radiation, the beta probe detected all tumor zzso with zzso greater than zzso zzso of muscle background zzso range zzso for all 41 zzso Despite suitable zzso zzso identification by the gamma probe was clearly limited by the presence of background zzso As a result, only zzso primary tumors, zzso zzso zzso and zzso tumor fragments were identified above zzso zzso of muscle background zzso range zzso for all zzso 

Under experimental conditions, the beta probe was capable to detect minute amounts of tumor tissue at the surface of zzso zzso While clinical application of the current beta probe design may depend on the particular zzso circumstances including time requirements for surface scanning of zzso beds, the data indicate clinical potential for novel designs of hand-held beta zzso
