A promising avenue in cancer therapy using zzso zzso is the combination of zzso delivery with triggered drug zzso The use of trigger mechanisms in zzso could be relevant for drugs susceptible to zzso zzso zzso Here, we propose a zzso zzso zzso system that is designed to release its content inside the zzso through a zzso structural change following zzso zzso Specifically, zzso zzso zzso were obtained by including a terminally zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and by zzso the zzso zzso zzso to target zzso zzso In zzso release of zzso fluorescent zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso of the zzso was retained in the presence of the zzso upon incubation in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that the zzso zzso were efficiently zzso by various zzso zzso cell lines while limited interaction was found for zzso decorated with an zzso control zzso Finally, the zzso zzso zzso exhibited the highest zzso against zzso cells, confirming the role of the zzso zzso in promoting the escape of intact zzso in the zzso These results suggest that this zzso zzso zzso could be beneficial in the treatment of acute zzso zzso
