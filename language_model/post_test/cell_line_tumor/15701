Cellular processes are regulated by various mechanical and physical factors in their local zzso such as geometric zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of these regulatory mechanisms is crucial for fundamental understanding of cell biology and for rational design of biomedical devices and zzso zzso Here, we report a generally zzso plasma zzso technique, which performs selective surface zzso on large zzso areas, for achieving zzso stable zzso with length scales from 100 zzso to 1 zzso toward the investigation of zzso zzso In particular, we applied plasma zzso for cellular confinement of zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso zzso cells, and examined the motion of mouse embryonic zzso in zzso environments for studying the effect of zzso on migratory zzso In conjunction with live cell imaging, the distance zzso zzso and angular motion of individual cells and collective cell migration behaviors were measured in confined environments with dimensions comparable to a zzso A critical length scale that a cell could conceivably occupy and migrate to was also identified by investigating the behaviors of cells using confined environments with zzso length zzso
