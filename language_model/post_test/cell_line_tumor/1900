zzso therapy zzso with several zzso is a promising zzso for the treatment of zzso In this study, the therapeutic effect of zzso using the synthetic zzso zzso a zzso was examined in zzso zzso oral zzso cell zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso revealed that zzso induced cell growth zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatment significantly induced zzso zzso generation, which is critical for cell death induced by zzso Cell cycle analysis showed the increased zzso proportion of cells in zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell death was confirmed by zzso zzso and the reduction of zzso membrane potential zzso on zzso zzso The changes in zzso molecules were next examined using western zzso zzso c release and zzso of zzso and zzso were observed in zzso cells, whereas zzso protein levels were zzso To determine the therapeutic effect of zzso in zzso a zzso zzso animal model was zzso Treatment of mice with zzso significantly inhibited tumor growth, especially zzso with Pa intravenous administration zzso zzso and increased zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso levels and zzso zzso cells compared to zzso zzso The data demonstrate that the in zzso effects of zzso on the zzso of tumor cell proliferation and induction of zzso correlate to the zzso activity of zzso in zzso Our findings suggest the therapeutic potential of zzso in zzso
