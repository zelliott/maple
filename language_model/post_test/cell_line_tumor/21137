zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso necrosis factor zzso that triggers zzso following zzso of the zzso zzso Despite studies strongly implicating zzso zzso as a major inhibitor of the zzso immune response, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate zzso expression in zzso In this study, we show that the zzso zzso zzso pathway, and in particular zzso zzso zzso plays a role in the zzso of zzso expression in colon zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso by zzso interference in zzso and zzso colon zzso cells reduced zzso expression at both the zzso and protein zzso zzso stimulation with zzso increased zzso expression and these cells showed increased zzso against zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso by zzso via the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso analysis using serial sections of human colon zzso revealed a strong positive correlation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Thus, these findings indicate that zzso positively regulates zzso expression in colon zzso cells, adding another zzso activity to zzso
