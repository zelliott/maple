To explore the expression and the role of zzso located at the amplified zzso region in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and real-time zzso were applied to detect the expression level of zzso in 36 zzso and 8 chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso was constructed and zzso into zzso cell line zzso The zzso effect was determined by detecting the expression level of zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso Finally, the cell biological characteristics were compared between zzso zzso and parental zzso by analyzing the cell cycle distribution and zzso status using flow zzso 

zzso and real-time zzso revealed that zzso gene was zzso in zzso zzso ( zzso zzso expression was suppressed in zzso cell line zzso by approximately zzso by zzso confirmed by zzso The depletion of zzso could effectively block the proliferation and induce the zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso the expression of zzso on zzso level changed the characterization of zzso cell line zzso by zzso suggesting that zzso identified in the amplified zzso region may be involved in the genesis and development of zzso via promoting the cell proliferation and zzso the cell zzso
