zzso cell zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso are zzso markers for diagnosing lung neuroendocrine tumors zzso However, the precise expression mechanisms have not been studied in enough zzso The purpose of the present study is to define the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso and zzso gene expressions, using cultivated lung cancer cells and focusing upon zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and known zzso factors, zzso element 1 zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso responsive zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments revealed that zzso activated zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and that zzso expression was not regulated by zzso or zzso zzso expression was restricted in zzso cell lung cancer zzso cells, and zzso of zzso could cause as much zzso expression as in zzso cells and weak zzso expression in zzso zzso However, zzso gene zzso via zzso zzso was not found in zzso zzso cells, indicating the requirement of some additional mechanism for sufficient zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso and zzso expressions are differently regulated by neuroendocrine zzso zzso factors and provide a reason why zzso and zzso are frequently expressed in zzso irrespective of zzso zzso
