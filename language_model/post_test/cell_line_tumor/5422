The zzso of zzso tumors remains controversial, with the zzso zzso proposed to be an zzso retinal zzso cell, a zzso committed cell, or a cell committed to a specific zzso Here, we examine the expression of two members of the zzso family implicated in zzso and bipolar cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2, zzso in normal human zzso zzso cell lines and zzso zzso We show that zzso and zzso have distinct expression profiles in the developing human zzso with zzso first expressed in zzso cells and cells committed to the bipolar zzso and zzso first appearing in the zzso zzso In the mature zzso zzso levels are highest in zzso cells whereas zzso is zzso found in bipolar cells and in the retinal pigmented zzso Both zzso and zzso are widely expressed in zzso cell lines and in zzso tumors, although zzso is more abundant than zzso in the differentiated elements of zzso tumors such as large zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso in zzso tumors and cell lines suggests a close link between the zzso of zzso tumors and cells expressing zzso and zzso
