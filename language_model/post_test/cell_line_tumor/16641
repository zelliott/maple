zzso uniquely express specialized genes required for zzso formation, some of which are maintained following their transformation to zzso Here we exploit this property to selectively target melanoma with an zzso drug zzso zzso specific to zzso the product of the zzso zzso zzso We describe new zzso zzso that detect the zzso zzso These zzso help define the zzso fate of zzso and demonstrate its utility as an zzso zzso Although newly zzso zzso is ultimately routed to the zzso we find substantial amounts accessible to our zzso at the cell surface that undergo zzso and zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso with zzso exhibits zzso tumor cell killing in zzso and in zzso
