Recent advances in zzso and molecular technology have prompted proposals to change zzso zzso and treatment zzso Cell surface zzso are now easy to access, and zzso origins and clinical characteristics are now readily zzso However, in diffuse large zzso zzso zzso one of the zzso forms of zzso zzso the clinical significance of zzso surface zzso has not been well zzso We zzso the zzso surface zzso of 50 zzso from newly diagnosed zzso patients by flow zzso in accordance with their clinical characteristics and followed the patients for a median zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso expression was significantly zzso associated with mortality in zzso zzso negative versus zzso relative risk zzso zzso P zzso zzso As a result of these clinical zzso we generated zzso zzso zzso cell lines after gene zzso and zzso zzso cell growth in zzso in zzso zzso Mice challenged with zzso zzso and parental cells as controls died within 50 zzso In contrast, mice injected with zzso zzso exhibited significantly reduced zzso growth and zzso survived long term zzso control zzso P zzso zzso Interestingly, all established zzso zzso (six clones from different zzso showed zzso zzso during in zzso cell culture, and zzso zzso did not block this zzso zzso of zzso is strongly associated with increased survival in zzso in zzso zzso expression may be indirectly concerned with the expression of additional cell zzso zzso
