There has been a long standing interest in the identification of medicinal plants and derived natural products for developing cancer zzso Our study focuses upon pancreatic cancer, due to its high mortality rate, that is attributed in part to the lack of an effective zzso zzso Previous reports on the use of medicinal plant extracts either alone or alongside conventional zzso agents in the treatment of this cancer have shown promising zzso This work aims to investigate the therapeutic properties of a library of medicinal plants from zzso 

56 extracts of 44 unique medicinal plants were zzso The extracts were screened for zzso against the pancreatic zzso cell line zzso using a zzso zzso zzso The top zzso extracts identified in this screen were tested on two additional pancreatic cancer cell lines zzso and zzso and a zzso cell line zzso using an zzso proliferation zzso Finally, one of the most promising extracts was studied using a zzso zzso zzso to identify induction of zzso 

Crude extracts of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed zzso to three cancer cell lines with zzso values ranging between zzso - zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso and zzso - zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso was shown to increase zzso activity, indicating that the observed zzso was zzso via zzso Only zzso zzso showed low zzso to zzso cells with an zzso value zzso 100 zzso 

Based upon the initial screening work reported here, further studies aimed at the identification of active components of these three extracts and the zzso of their mechanisms as cancer zzso are zzso
