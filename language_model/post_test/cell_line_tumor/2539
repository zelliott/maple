zzso is an zzso zzso with promising zzso activity against zzso zzso but widely ineffective against solid tumor types in clinical zzso The zzso activity of zzso can be dramatically increased by terminal zzso zzso is a zzso compound containing two terminal zzso zzso zzso To gain insights on the vulnerability of this highly active terminal zzso zzso to drug resistance mechanisms, a new cell model with acquired resistance against the lead compound zzso was zzso zzso zzso analyses zzso and zzso revealed amplification of the zzso gene on double minute zzso DNA in zzso cells as well as zzso of zzso and zzso on the protein zzso zzso was further confirmed as a zzso of zzso and zzso but not of zzso using a panel of ABC zzso cell models as well as ABC zzso zzso Moreover, zzso depletion strongly enhanced zzso activity, although no zzso zzso formation by zzso was zzso Thus, a zzso of zzso together with zzso is zzso Finally, a panel of zzso derivatives was tested on the new zzso cell zzso zzso zzso cells were not zzso against zzso lacking terminal zzso zzso zzso which are less active than zzso This suggests that terminal zzso of zzso - linked with distinctly enhanced zzso activity - leads to altered resistance profiles compared to classical zzso making this compound class of interest for further zzso zzso
