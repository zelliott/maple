zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a unique mechanism for cancer zzso It is conceived that zzso zzso may zzso with many classes of cancer therapeutic agents, such as zzso zzso and zzso drugs, to achieve a more robust tumor zzso However, these hypotheses have not been rigorously tested in tumor models in zzso The present study was carried out to evaluate the zzso efficacy of combining zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

Using a zzso tumor model that allows zzso of zzso on zzso treatment, we examined the tumor responses to zzso agents, including the zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso agents zzso and zzso in the presence or absence of an intact zzso zzso 

Surprisingly, zzso zzso in tumors treated with the zzso inhibitor zzso did not produce much added benefit compared with zzso treatment alone, suggesting that the combination of an zzso inhibitor with a zzso inhibitor may not be a robust therapeutic zzso In contrast, the zzso drug zzso when used in combination with zzso zzso exhibited a zzso and likely synergistic therapeutic effect compared with the zzso of either treatment alone in the zzso zzso zzso 

Our results show that the DNA zzso agent zzso exhibits robust zzso efficacy when used in combination with zzso zzso in zzso tumors, suggesting that the combination of zzso with zzso zzso might be an effective regimen for cancer zzso In addition, our results also show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso model can be a valuable platform for further evaluation of the combination treatment of other cancer zzso with zzso zzso
