zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the changes in zzso drug sensitivity of zzso cells zzso with zzso and zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and negative zzso expression zzso were constructed and zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction was used to detect the target gene zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein levels were measured using western blots and zzso The sensitivity of the cells to the zzso drugs zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso The zzso and zzso gene expression and corresponding protein levels in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells were reduced compared with negative zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso protein level remained zzso but the zzso level was enhanced when zzso and zzso protein levels were zzso The zzso results demonstrated that zzso and zzso zzso cells exhibited increased sensitivity to zzso or zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso cell population increased in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells when compared with negative zzso or zzso zzso The latter trend was strengthened further in the presence of zzso or zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso in combination with chemotherapy, may be a potential therapeutic strategy against human zzso
