zzso resistance in cancer may arise due to zzso in gene zzso In this study, zzso of drug-resistant multiple myeloma zzso cells, namely zzso and zzso were examined for their differential zzso gene expression levels and the relations to drug resistance were zzso Drug resistance was induced by application of the prednisone or zzso using zzso dose zzso zzso zzso zzso was used for determination of resistance zzso zzso analysis was carried out and the genes zzso or zzso more than zzso were considered as significantly zzso Different types of zzso were altered in different drug-resistant zzso and zzso multiple myeloma zzso The zzso which belong to Ras zzso especially zzso family of zzso were zzso in zzso zzso cell lines whereas they were either zzso or not changed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso are among zzso factors which were zzso in zzso zzso zzso growth factor beta zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso cell lines while it was zzso in zzso cell zzso Different types of zzso gene expressions were seen to be altered in resistant zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso genes such as zzso zzso and zzso were all zzso In conclusion, it is seen that different drugs can induce totally different pathways leading to resistance in the same cancer cell zzso Every drug resistance should be evaluated zzso These facts must be considered in cancer chemotherapy and reversal of drug zzso
