The nuclear protein zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso is considered to be a downstream zzso of zzso action in target zzso zzso of zzso expression is common in many zzso We analyzed zzso expression in normal and zzso prostate tissue and evaluated whether zzso zzso or zzso zzso treatment modulated zzso in cultured prostate zzso cells zzso Moreover, we studied the possible involvement of zzso in zzso action on the zzso prostate cell line, zzso expressing both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso found in the nucleus of normal zzso by zzso was progressively lost in cancer zzso as the zzso score increased and was only detected in the zzso zzso zzso transcript levels, as zzso by zzso zzso in primary zzso cultures, were significantly reduced in cancer cells zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso treatment significantly increased zzso transcript and protein levels zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a reduction of S phase without significant changes of zzso zzso In zzso zzso cell extracts zzso zzso with zzso and zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso is expressed in normal zzso and zzso in cancer cells, with a switch of its zzso zzso from the nucleus to the zzso upon cancer grade zzso zzso expression levels in the zzso were modulated by zzso or zzso treatment in zzso Furthermore, the zzso effects on zzso prostate cells involve zzso which confirms a possible role for zzso pathways in a zzso zzso zzso
