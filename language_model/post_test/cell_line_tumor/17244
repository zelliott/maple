The lung is a common site of zzso and primary tumor growth, and has been shown to be an zzso zzso We tested the impact of the lung environment on the development of zzso T cell responses against the zzso zzso and found a deficit in the efficacy of zzso zzso zzso T cells against tumors established in the zzso One zzso more zzso zzso T cells were required to protect against tumor development or reject established tumors in the lung than an identical tumor challenge delivered zzso in the zzso zzso zzso growing in the flank facilitated the rejection of tumors present in the zzso In the presence of flank tumors, transferred T cells were not zzso altered but were present in much greater numbers in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and lung zzso than in mice bearing lung tumors zzso We hypothesized that zzso present in the lung and skin draining zzso zzso were zzso initiating T cell zzso leading to differences in the size of the final zzso zzso A direct comparison of zzso T cell proliferation against zzso from flank or lung draining zzso zzso showed profoundly greater proliferation to flank draining zzso zzso zzso The impaired stimulation of zzso T cell proliferation by lung draining zzso provides one zzso explanation for the lower overall immune response, and inability to effectively reject tumors, in the zzso
