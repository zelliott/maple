Nuclear factor zzso is the key zzso factor involved in the inflammatory responses, and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a main cell wall component of zzso bacteria, stimulates zzso zzso zzso and activates a number of inflammatory zzso including zzso zzso have been reported to exert zzso and zzso zzso The mechanisms underlying these actions, however, are largely zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate whether cannabinoids can suppress the zzso zzso of zzso and cell growth via zzso receptors in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced the zzso of zzso and cell proliferation in a zzso zzso The main zzso zzso prevented the zzso zzso of zzso which was reversed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The synthetic zzso zzso abolished the zzso cell growth, and this effect was reversed by zzso The preferential expression of zzso rather than zzso receptors in these cells was confirmed by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction experiments and the observation that the zzso zzso changes were completely reversed by zzso but not by the zzso zzso zzso Our finding that cannabinoids suppress the zzso inflammatory zzso and cell growth via zzso in zzso cells provides evidence for the therapeutic potential of targeting zzso receptors for the treatment of zzso tumor zzso
