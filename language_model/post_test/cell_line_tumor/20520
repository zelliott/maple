zzso Regulatory Factor 5 is a zzso factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in the response to viral infection and in the stimulation of the immune zzso Moreover, multiple studies have demonstrated that it zzso regulates cell growth and zzso favoring cell differentiation and zzso zzso represents zzso of all zzso zzso and has shown a steady increase in zzso in both the USA and western European zzso 

We investigated the zzso zzso and function of zzso in zzso cancer cells and found that it is highly expressed in both primary and immortalized zzso zzso but not in normal zzso zzso levels were zzso modulated by zzso alpha but zzso only localized in the zzso zzso thus failing to induce zzso expression as previously reported in different cell zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso increased both the proliferation rate and the zzso potential of zzso zzso cells, protecting them from the zzso effects of zzso zzso These results were directly attributable to zzso as demonstrated by the reduction in zzso ability of zzso cancer cells after zzso zzso An zzso induction of zzso zzso observed in all zzso cancer cells might contribute to these unexpected zzso 

These findings suggest that, in zzso zzso zzso displays zzso rather than zzso zzso
