zzso occurring zzso deletion zzso have been identified in zzso B carriers and shown to be associated with the development of zzso zzso The zzso of these zzso deletion zzso remain zzso and they were investigated in this zzso 

The zzso deletion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso deletion spanning zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso internal deletion were constructed and analyzed by zzso into zzso zzso 

zzso analyses reveal that these zzso were divided into two groups: S promoter deletion and zzso promoter deletion zzso Compared with the zzso zzso S promoter deletion zzso led to an inverse ratio of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso of surface zzso An interesting finding is that a small amount of L proteins was detected in the medium from S promoter deletion zzso zzso zzso promoter deletion zzso zzso displayed a zzso like zzso and protein zzso The zzso of surface proteins from zzso promoter deletion zzso was inhibited less than from S promoter deletion zzso zzso analysis showed zzso surface proteins zzso with zzso and exhibited an zzso zzso zzso zzso pattern in the zzso deletion zzso and zzso zzso pattern in the zzso promoter deletion zzso 

This study shows that these zzso deletion zzso exhibit two different zzso in zzso transcription, surface protein expression and zzso This diversity seems to result from the deletion of S promoter rather than result from the deletion of zzso or zzso
