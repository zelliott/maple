zzso is the founding member of the zzso family of zzso zzso repeat zzso which also includes zzso and zzso zzso is a negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso and Met zzso and promotes zzso zzso zzso has recently emerged as both a tumor zzso and a key regulator of zzso and zzso stem cell zzso Despite this, little is known of the mechanisms by which zzso is zzso zzso was recently reported to increase zzso zzso expression suggesting that it may function in a manner opposite to zzso In this study, we explore the interaction between zzso and zzso and demonstrate that zzso and zzso functionally oppose one zzso zzso opposes zzso negative regulatory activity and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso limiting zzso positive effects on receptors and identifying zzso as a new target of zzso These studies provide new insight into the regulation of zzso and uncover a complex zzso between zzso and zzso
