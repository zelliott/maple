The liver is an attractive target for gene therapy due to its extensive capability for protein production and the numerous diseases resulting from a loss of gene function it normally zzso The Sleeping Beauty zzso zzso system is a zzso zzso capable of delivering and zzso therapeutic zzso zzso into the host zzso for long-term zzso A current challenge for this system is the low efficiency of integration of the zzso In this study we use a human zzso cell line zzso and primary human blood outgrowth zzso cells zzso to test zzso containing DNA elements to enhance zzso without zzso zzso We employed the human zzso zzso attachment region zzso and the zzso virus 40 zzso nuclear zzso signal to increase the percent of zzso cells persistently expressing a zzso reporter construct by zzso for each zzso while combining both did not show an additive zzso Interestingly, both elements together displayed an additive effect on the number of zzso sites, and in zzso the zzso alone appeared to have an zzso effect on zzso In long-term cultures the loss of zzso DNA, zzso expression and mapping of zzso sites demonstrated bona fide zzso without zzso zzso These results show that addition of the zzso zzso and potentially other elements to the backbone of zzso system can enhance zzso and expression of therapeutic zzso These findings may have a significant influence on the use of zzso zzso delivery to liver for the treatment of a wide variety of zzso
