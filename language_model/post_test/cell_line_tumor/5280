zzso cells are a novel population of efficient immune zzso cells with high zzso activity mainly due to the high proliferation of zzso cells, so may play a role in the development of new forms of adoptive cellular zzso We started a pilot clinical trial with zzso zzso cells in patients with zzso zzso and zzso solid zzso This study was aimed at determining the feasibility of generating a sufficient number of zzso cells in heavily zzso patients and at assessing treatment zzso 

zzso cells were generated from peripheral blood zzso cells zzso and incubated in the presence of zzso followed by zzso and zzso Treatment schedule consisted of three cycles of zzso cells infusions at an zzso of 3 zzso 

At present 12 patients were zzso 6 advanced zzso 5 zzso kidney zzso and 1 zzso zzso zzso The median number of transferred cells per patient was 28 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso adherence was excellent and the toxicity profile was zzso After zzso cells infusion, the absolute median count of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells significantly increased in patient's peripheral zzso Clinical outcome appeared zzso three patients had complete response zzso and two patients had stabilization of disease with a median follow-up of 33 months zzso zzso 

These preliminary data showed that adoptive zzso with zzso cells is a safe therapy with some suggestion of efficacy that significantly enhances immune functions increasing absolute numbers of zzso cells without side zzso If confirmed in larger scale studies, these promising results may have a zzso impact on conventional treatment strategy of zzso
