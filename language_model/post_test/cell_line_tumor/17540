zzso zzso or zzso cells can undergo zzso a type of zzso when they are detached from their zzso zzso zzso while most tumor cells derived from zzso or zzso zzso lose this zzso Most of the studies indicate that zzso resistance of tumor cells is closely related to abnormal signal zzso The aim of this research was to screen out the tumor cell lines that are zzso zzso then to investigate the relationship between the protein zzso zzso of signaling molecules and zzso resistance feature of tumor zzso 

zzso resistance of breast tumor cell lines zzso zzso and zzso was determined by DNA zzso zzso flow zzso analysis, and soft zzso zzso upon suspending zzso A normal zzso cell line zzso zzso canine zzso was taken as a zzso The zzso effect of zzso a general protein zzso zzso zzso on zzso resistance of tumor cells was analyzed at the same zzso The differences of total protein zzso zzso levels between suspended and attached cultural conditions of three breast cancer cell lines were examined by Western zzso zzso 

All the three tumor cell lines were distinctly zzso zzso Further study showed that these features could be suppressed by zzso The results of Western zzso analysis showed that the general level of zzso zzso in suspended zzso cells was decreased compared with that in attached cells, while zzso zzso level of some proteins increased (more than zzso zzso zzso in suspended tumor zzso 

All the three breast tumor cells in this study are zzso resistant respectively to some extent, and zzso zzso zzso of signaling proteins may play a role in the process of zzso resistance of these tumor zzso
