The regulation of gene expression zzso is essential for the generation of diverse cell types during development and for adaptation to environmental zzso zzso zzso II zzso transcribes genetic information and coordinates the recruitment of accessory proteins that are responsible for the establishment of active zzso states and transcript zzso zzso is zzso modified at active genes during zzso zzso zzso and zzso and thereby recruits specific zzso and zzso zzso zzso complexes are also located at silent genes in zzso paused zzso that provide dynamic zzso regulation downstream from zzso In embryonic stem cells, silent zzso regulator genes that are zzso by zzso are associated with a form of zzso that can zzso through coding regions but that lacks the zzso modifications that are important for zzso zzso synthesis to zzso zzso Here, we discuss the mechanisms through which the zzso of silent genes might be zzso from productive zzso and the sophisticated interplay between the zzso machinery, zzso repression and zzso zzso
