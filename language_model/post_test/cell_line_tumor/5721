Several studies have shown that zzso proteins zzso are important zzso of zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso however, the pathways that control this zzso function of zzso are currently zzso We have recently shown that zzso are targets for the zzso zzso zzso and that zzso protects zzso from zzso Here, we identify zzso as a crucial regulator of zzso zzso zzso to zzso A decrease in zzso zzso during zzso stress causes zzso of zzso from the zzso to the zzso This not only provides the signal for zzso zzso but also makes zzso susceptible to zzso Mouse double minute 2 zzso zzso zzso protects zzso from degradation and this is required for zzso stabilization during zzso zzso By controlling the correct zzso and stability of zzso zzso acts as a zzso new regulator of zzso zzso to zzso
