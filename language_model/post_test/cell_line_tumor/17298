In zzso the most frequent genetic zzso is gain of zzso arm zzso which arises from unbalanced zzso To document these genetic events more precisely, we performed an extensive study of zzso 17 zzso in 27 zzso cell lines by using a combination of zzso in zzso zzso mapping with zzso clones and zzso analysis with zzso zzso All cases exhibited one or more unbalanced zzso 17 zzso and 15 distinct zzso regions could be zzso This high zzso indicates that gene fusion or disruption events are extremely unlikely to account for the underlying zzso role of these zzso However, zzso were not randomly distributed, most of them mapping to the zzso part of zzso As a result of zzso all cell lines but one exhibited gain of the zzso zzso fragment, bordered zzso by the clone zzso The most zzso zzso flanked by the clone zzso defined the zzso zzso zzso as a region of additional zzso In addition to zzso gains, loss of zzso for the short arm of zzso 17 was observed in close to half the zzso It was either related to a zzso 17 zzso or to a zzso zzso Finally, in cases with a single normal zzso 17, we show that the parental origin of the zzso zzso 17 can be either distinct or identical to that of the normal zzso Similarly, multiple zzso within the same cell line can either involve the same or different zzso 17 zzso indicating the likely absence of parental origin bias in the generation of these zzso
