We have previously reported the synthesis and evaluation of potent zzso zzso virus compounds based on zzso zzso bearing a zzso attached at the zzso position and their zzso zzso study revealed a requirement for an zzso zzso with an optimal length of 12 zzso for a weak zzso zzso As a continuation of that work, we have now prepared the corresponding zzso derivatives as possible zzso zzso zzso chemistry gave the target zzso which were tested for zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso unfortunately, they were devoid of zzso zzso
