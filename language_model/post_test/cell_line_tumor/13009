zzso is a zzso regulating bone mass zzso differently depending on its site of zzso It decreases zzso when zzso in the gut, and increases it when zzso in the zzso The signal zzso events zzso by zzso zzso once it binds to the zzso zzso present on zzso have been identified and culminate in zzso response zzso protein zzso regulation of zzso zzso In contrast, we do not know how zzso zzso favors bone mass zzso following its binding to the zzso zzso on zzso of the zzso zzso nucleus zzso We show zzso gene expression analysis, zzso treatment of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene deletion in the zzso following its binding to the zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso uses a zzso zzso zzso signaling cascade involving zzso and zzso to decrease the sympathetic tone and increase bone mass zzso We further show that the zzso zzso of these events is zzso whose zzso on zzso 133 is increased by zzso following zzso treatment of zzso zzso A zzso experiment identified two genes necessary for optimum sympathetic activity whose expression is regulated by zzso These results provide a molecular understanding of how zzso signals in zzso zzso to regulate bone mass zzso and identify zzso as a critical zzso of this function, although through different mechanisms depending on the cell type, zzso or zzso in which it is zzso
