209 zzso new cases of zzso zzso are diagnosed each year worldwide and new therapeutic targets are urgently zzso The great majority of clear cell zzso cancer involves zzso of zzso which acts as a gatekeeper zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso However how zzso exerts its zzso zzso function remains zzso A gene expression zzso comparing zzso zzso cancer cells expressing either zzso or an empty zzso was used to identify novel zzso regulated zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is a zzso that has been implicated in energy zzso and zzso zzso Here we show for the first time that zzso zzso results in dramatic zzso of zzso expression in zzso cancer zzso The effect of zzso zzso was found to be zzso via zzso of zzso zzso Factor zzso Exposure of zzso expressing zzso cells to either zzso or zzso resulted in zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso suppression of zzso in zzso defective zzso cells via zzso of zzso zzso or expression of Type zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso expression zzso We also show that zzso cancer cells express a functional zzso zzso zzso and that zzso stimulates migration of zzso cancer zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso may act in an zzso fashion, promoting progression of kidney zzso zzso and zzso expression are frequently observed in many zzso zzso and are associated with a poor zzso Our study raises the possibility that zzso may also drive zzso expression in zzso zzso
