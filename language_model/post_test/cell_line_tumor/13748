Cancer stem cells zzso are a zzso generally thought to be responsible for cancer initiation and zzso Because zzso are often rare in the total tumor cell population and differentiate rapidly when grown in culture, it has been challenging to uncover compounds that selectively target zzso We previously described zzso cells derived from breast cancer cell lines that maintained a stable zzso zzso We zzso a zzso zzso with these cells and screened zzso compounds, identifying five that zzso inhibited zzso cell zzso Using a zzso target identification approach, we found high zzso I zzso I) expression levels in breast zzso cells and primary breast zzso zzso unrelated small molecules targeting zzso I zzso inhibited zzso zzso These results illustrate the substantial power of this zzso zzso screening platform and promote zzso I as a potential molecular therapeutic target for therapies aimed at zzso zzso
