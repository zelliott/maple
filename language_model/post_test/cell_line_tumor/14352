zzso protein zzso zzso is a key cellular sensor of reduced energy supply that is activated by increases in the cellular ratio of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are two drugs widely used to activate zzso zzso In both differentiated zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells we found that these two agents not only activated zzso but zzso greatly reduced the zzso zzso zzso of zzso This blockade of zzso activity consequently lowered the zzso zzso of its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso did not block zzso of zzso and zzso Thus, both drugs widely used to activate zzso also caused zzso of zzso and of zzso The mechanism for zzso zzso caused by zzso but not zzso was due to zzso of growth zzso signaling that leads to zzso zzso zzso of zzso receptors with zzso in zzso cells also activated zzso and zzso caused zzso of zzso These findings show that zzso zzso often occurs zzso with zzso zzso when cells are treated with zzso or zzso indicating that these drugs do not only affect zzso but also cause a coordinated inverse regulation of zzso and zzso
