zzso consumption at the targeted site has a significant effect on zzso in zzso therapy zzso However, oxygen consumption in zzso using a zzso laser as a light source has not been zzso We therefore investigated the dependence of zzso on the oxygen consumption and the zzso zzso of zzso using a zzso laser by comparing with that using a continuous wave zzso zzso Mouse zzso zzso cells zzso were incubated with a second-generation zzso zzso The cells were then zzso with either a zzso zzso zzso light from the 3rd zzso of a zzso zzso optical zzso zzso with a peak zzso rate of approximately 1 zzso at 30 zzso or a zzso CW zzso laser with a total light dose of 40 zzso Regardless of laser source, zzso effects exhibited cumulative dose responses to the zzso ranging from 12 to 96 zzso However, zzso effect of zzso using the zzso light was significantly less than that using the CW light with the zzso zzso of 24 and 48 zzso under identical zzso zzso During zzso the cells exposed to the zzso light consumed oxygen more slowly, resulting in a lower amount of oxygen consumption when compared with zzso using CW zzso In accordance with oxygen consumption, the zzso light induced significantly less zzso of the zzso than the CW light zzso These results indicate that the efficiency of zzso using zzso light is less when compared with CW light, probably being related to suppressed oxygen consumption during the zzso light zzso
