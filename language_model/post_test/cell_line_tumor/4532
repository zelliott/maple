zzso zzso are promising tools that can potentially enable high zzso zzso screening in areas such as disease diagnosis and drug zzso A critical aspect in the development of protein zzso is the zzso of the zzso surface chemistry to achieve the high sensitivity required for detection of proteins in cell zzso and other complex biological zzso In the present study, a zzso zzso array with minimal zzso cellular protein zzso was prepared using a glass surface coated with a zzso zzso terminated with zzso group zzso The zzso zzso surface has almost similar zzso cellular protein zzso when compared to an zzso zzso zzso In addition, the multiple functional sites available for reaction on the zzso surface facilitated zzso zzso of zzso and efficient capture of zzso Various molecules were tested for their ability to block or zzso the zzso zzso surface after zzso zzso to further reduce the zzso zzso A short zzso zzso zzso was found to significantly improve the zzso ratio of the zzso resulting in higher zzso The properties and functional qualities of the various surfaces were characterized by contact angle and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and protein zzso as a function of zzso generations and sensitivity of zzso capturing from a buffer (1 zzso as well as from the complex cell zzso (10 zzso system were zzso Our detailed experimental studies demonstrated a facile method of preparing surfaces with high protein loading and low zzso protein binding for the development of high sensitivity protein zzso
