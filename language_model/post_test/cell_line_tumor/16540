zzso zzso zzso are important zzso regulating the pool of zzso steroids in the zzso The current study was undertaken in order to evaluate implications of zzso in breast cancer, measuring zzso protein expression in breast zzso 

An zzso targeting the zzso zzso was generated and validated using zzso cells and a zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso from zzso zzso women diagnosed with zzso zzso breast cancer, and zzso to zzso tamoxifen or no zzso treatment, were zzso for zzso protein expression with zzso 

zzso were obtained from zzso zzso Patients with zzso positive zzso with high zzso expression had fewer local zzso when treated with tamoxifen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to patients with lower zzso zzso zzso for whom tamoxifen did not reduce the number of local zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No zzso importance of zzso was seen for zzso zzso zzso 

Using a highly specific validated zzso for zzso analysis of a large number of breast zzso we have shown that zzso expression levels of zzso can predict the outcome of zzso tamoxifen treatment in terms of local recurrence-free survival in patients with zzso zzso zzso breast zzso The results need be verified to confirm any clinical zzso
