Numerous studies have confirmed that cancer stem cells zzso are more resistant to zzso however, there is a paucity of data exploring the effect of long-term drug treatment on the zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate whether long-term zzso treatment could expand the zzso cells with zzso characteristics and zzso zzso could affect zzso gene expression during the development of drug zzso Using zzso amplified zzso and zzso amplified zzso human zzso cells, our laboratory generated zzso cell lines in parallel over 1 year; one cell line zzso treated with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and the other without exposure to zzso zzso sensitivity to zzso drugs, the ability to form zzso and capacity for in zzso invasion were zzso zzso markers and side populations zzso were analyzed using flow zzso zzso expressed zzso genes were identified through whole zzso analysis and confirmed with real-time zzso Our results indicated that zzso increased the sensitivity of only zzso cells to chemotherapy, made cells lose the ability to form zzso and reduced in zzso invasion and the SP zzso zzso was not enriched in zzso or zzso zzso zzso Nine zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells relative to zzso zzso A zzso of cells with zzso characteristics is enriched during prolonged drug selection of zzso amplified zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment affects the reversal of drug resistance in zzso cells and may be associated with zzso of zzso gene zzso This work may be valuable for clinicians to design treatment protocols specific for different zzso zzso
