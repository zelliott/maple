zzso of the breast cancer zzso gene 1 zzso a tumor zzso zzso an increased risk for breast, zzso and prostate zzso To investigate the function of the zzso zzso we performed DNA zzso and zzso reverse zzso analyses to identify zzso gene expression zzso We found that zzso zzso the expression of multiple genes involved in the zzso zzso response, including zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso with these findings, zzso zzso zzso resistance while zzso zzso zzso sensitivity to several different zzso agents zzso zzso and zzso In addition, in the setting of zzso stress zzso to hydrogen zzso zzso shifted the cellular zzso balance to a higher ratio of reduced to oxidized zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso response zzso zzso activity and enhanced the activity of the zzso response zzso factor nuclear factor zzso 2 like 2 zzso called zzso zzso The ability of zzso to stimulate zzso response zzso zzso and to protect cells against zzso stress was attenuated by zzso of nuclear factor zzso 2 like zzso These findings suggest a novel function for zzso zzso to protect cells against zzso zzso This function would be consistent with the zzso role of zzso as a caretaker gene in preserving zzso zzso
