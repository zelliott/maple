zzso zzso is found in a variety of zzso where it promotes proliferation as well as zzso In many zzso zzso enhanced zzso exerts zzso zzso Here we investigated the role of zzso in mouse and human zzso zzso The zzso zzso is extinguished in zzso zzso cells, and zzso stimuli typically inducing zzso activity fail to activate this zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in these cells, whereas zzso of zzso by an zzso zzso provides a selective advantage in zzso Furthermore, in human zzso zzso cells we find that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso cell death, which is zzso zzso and can be prevented by zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso and persistent zzso of zzso signaling is a prerequisite for zzso zzso We could also show that low zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells are reversed by zzso of zzso Our observations provide a molecular explanation for the described absence of the zzso signaling in zzso zzso and question the zzso of zzso zzso as candidates for treatment of this zzso
