The purpose of the present study was to transfer zzso zzso zzso into dry zzso zzso suitable for delivery of zzso zzso freshly prepared zzso were zzso with zzso as zzso zzso the required zzso concentration for sufficient zzso of unloaded carriers was determined via dynamic light zzso zzso of fresh and zzso carriers was zzso by zzso scanning electron zzso zzso the feasibility of zzso loading before and after zzso was zzso For both strategies complex diameter and in zzso zzso efficiency were determined and correlated to freshly prepared zzso zzso diameter zzso zzso zzso zzso and size distribution zzso zzso zzso of unloaded zzso were restored after zzso by addition of zzso zzso of zzso before zzso Moreover, after loading of zzso carriers with zzso no significant difference in complex size was observed as compared to freshly prepared zzso zzso of zzso zzso complexes during zzso is feasible at elevated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso above zzso As determined via zzso zzso samples were as active as freshly prepared ones regarding zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso is an effective technique to produce physically stable zzso zzso These general findings may be zzso to further particulate gene delivery systems to shelf zzso zzso
