The common inhalation zzso zzso has previously been reported to enhance the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso beta protein zzso the principal zzso component of cerebral zzso zzso 

zzso human zzso cells zzso zzso to express human full-length zzso zzso precursor protein zzso were exposed to zzso zzso for 6 zzso The cells and zzso media were harvested at the end of the zzso zzso zzso processing of zzso cell zzso and zzso levels were measured with quantitative Western zzso cell viability zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The control condition consisted of zzso CO2 plus zzso zzso and balanced zzso which did not affect zzso zzso cell zzso zzso processing, or zzso zzso 

Two percent zzso caused zzso altered processing of zzso and increased production of zzso in zzso human zzso cell zzso zzso zzso was independent of changes in zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso was zzso by increased levels of zzso zzso zzso 

A clinically relevant concentration of zzso zzso zzso alters zzso processing, and increases zzso production in a human zzso cell zzso Because altered processing of zzso leading to zzso of zzso is a key event in the zzso of zzso disease, these findings may have implications for use of this zzso agent in individuals with excessive levels of cerebral zzso and elderly patients at increased risk for zzso cognitive zzso
