Alzheimer's disease zzso may result from the zzso of zzso zzso peptides in the zzso The zzso zzso zzso B zzso is associated with zzso plaques in zzso brains and has been suspected to increase zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso actually reduces levels of zzso zzso especially the zzso species zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in mice with zzso expression of familial zzso human zzso precursor protein zzso increased the relative abundance of zzso worsening plaque deposition and other zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in aged zzso mice reduced zzso zzso deposits, even zzso zzso zzso Under zzso conditions, zzso effectively zzso zzso generating zzso truncated zzso peptides that are less zzso Thus, zzso likely fulfills zzso and zzso zzso Insufficient zzso activity might promote zzso increasing zzso activity could counteract the zzso of this zzso
