The zzso of zzso leads to zzso zzso zzso zzso stress in myeloma cells, which activates the unfolded protein response zzso The zzso promotes protein folding by zzso and increases zzso degradation of zzso zzso zzso zzso stress zzso zzso and represents a molecular basis for the zzso sensitivity of zzso Most solid zzso such as zzso by contrast, are poorly zzso sensitive and display low levels of zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso induction of zzso stress might sensitize zzso to zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso stress in zzso zzso zzso zzso triggered the zzso decreased the degradation of newly zzso zzso but did not directly inhibit zzso active sites in the therapeutic dose range in contrast to zzso Whereas neither zzso nor zzso zzso translated into significant zzso at therapeutic drug levels, the combination strongly increased the level of zzso stress and activated zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso and zzso and resulted in zzso zzso In zzso zzso increases the level of zzso stress induced by zzso which zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso may therefore be tested clinically to improve the sensitivity of solid zzso toward zzso zzso
