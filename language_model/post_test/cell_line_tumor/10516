The investigation of new food constituents for purposes of disease prevention or health promotion is an area of increasing interest in food zzso This paper proposes a new system that allows for simultaneous zzso of the multiple zzso effects of food constituents using zzso The model zzso expression data of zzso marker proteins as zzso that reply to stimulation of a zzso To estimate three zzso effects, zzso cancer cell growth suppression activity, zzso activity, and zzso stress activity, each model was constructed using expression data of marker proteins as input data and zzso effects as the output zzso When prediction performances of three types of mathematical models constructed by simple, multiple zzso or artificial neural network zzso were zzso the most adequate model was the one constructed using an zzso There were no statistically significant differences between the actual data and estimated values calculated by the ANN zzso This system was able to simultaneously estimate zzso effects with reasonable precision from the same expression data of marker zzso This novel system should prove to be an interesting platform for evaluation of the zzso effects of zzso
