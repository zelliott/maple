zzso receptors zzso are present in different types of tumors, where they inhibit key cellular processes such as proliferation and zzso Although zzso are densely expressed in breast cancer, especially zzso their role and therapeutic potential remain zzso Recently, we identified a new truncated zzso zzso zzso which is related to the abnormal response of certain zzso tumors to treatment with zzso zzso Here, we investigated the possible role of zzso in breast zzso This study revealed that zzso is absent in normal zzso zzso but is abundant in a subset of poorly differentiated human breast tumors, where its expression correlated to that of zzso Moreover, in the zzso breast cancer model cell, zzso expression increased zzso features such as invasion and proliferation abilities (both in cell cultures and nude zzso This was likely zzso by zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 and zzso levels, and zzso D3 and zzso complex zzso which also led to zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso interacts physically with zzso and thereby alters its zzso enabling disruption of zzso zzso feedback and providing a plausible basis for our zzso These results suggest that zzso could be involved in the zzso of certain types of breast zzso
