zzso zzso zzso zzso is a leading cause of cancer zzso zzso diabetes, and zzso are risk zzso It has been shown that the growth of zzso and pancreatic duct zzso cells is regulated by zzso zzso The activity of zzso in the central nervous system is zzso by zzso acid zzso via zzso B zzso zzso of zzso zzso The aim of the study was to investigate if zzso B R zzso zzso signaling in zzso and pancreatic duct zzso cells, thus blocking driving forces of cancer zzso such as cell proliferation and cell zzso 

zzso zzso was measured by zzso DNA synthesis by zzso incorporation zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso and Western blots and zzso potential by cell migration zzso in the human zzso cell lines zzso and zzso and immortalized human pancreatic duct zzso cells zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso was assessed by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso B R by zzso or zzso inhibited zzso zzso signaling below base zzso zzso activity in response to zzso was blocked by zzso an effect enhanced by transient zzso of the zzso B R and abolished by zzso B R zzso DNA synthesis and cell migration were zzso by zzso responses blocked by zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso while zzso was zzso in human zzso tissue zzso 

The data suggest the stimulation of zzso B R signaling as a novel target for the treatment and prevention of pancreatic zzso
