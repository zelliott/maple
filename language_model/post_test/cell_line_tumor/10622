In tumor cells, zzso zzso deregulation of signaling zzso zzso zzso of cellular zzso and promotes the acquisition of zzso zzso Here, we identified a set of 21 zzso including zzso as zzso of tumor cell zzso by an zzso interference zzso screen in zzso colon cancer zzso Using a panel of small molecular zzso we subsequently established zzso effects, downstream signaling zzso and associated gene expression signatures of zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso of zzso signals zzso zzso cell zzso and loss of zzso in colon cancer zzso These effects are zzso via the zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In agreement with these findings, zzso of the zzso or zzso zzso but not of the zzso signaling axis also induced zzso cell zzso Finally, we found that expression of zzso was strong in a subset of advanced colon zzso and zzso zzso correlated with patients' zzso Our functional and expression analyses suggest that zzso zzso signals can contribute to colon cancer zzso
