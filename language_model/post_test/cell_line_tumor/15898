zzso steroid hormones play important roles in many zzso processes such as responses to stress, behavioral zzso and zzso One mechanism by which zzso exert functions in the brain is via the zzso of zzso zzso zzso are capable of inducing the activities of zzso zzso zzso which degrade zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, the molecular mechanisms for such induction are not yet fully zzso Here, we report that zzso a synthetic zzso hormone, stimulates zzso B (an zzso of zzso promoter and zzso activities via both the fourth zzso response element zzso and zzso virus 40 promoter factor 1 zzso binding sites in zzso B zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso zzso binds to the fourth zzso in zzso and in zzso Using zzso motifs as bait in a zzso zzso system, we identified two novel zzso zzso of zzso B, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that zzso zzso B via zzso B core promoter, which contains zzso zzso zzso suggested that zzso and zzso zzso with zzso for binding to the zzso site in zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso of zzso B zzso In response to zzso lower occupancy by zzso and zzso and higher occupancy by zzso were shown at the natural zzso B core zzso Together, this study zzso for the first time the molecular mechanisms for zzso zzso of zzso B gene and provides new insights into the hormonal regulation of zzso
