It is known that two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are required for efficient zzso The relative importance of these two components in the cellular zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was investigated in this study by applying zzso zzso agent, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso D, in a cell zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso efficiency of zzso was found to be a zzso phenomenon, zzso the level of gene expression was inhibited at early stage, presumably to the disruption of a transport of zzso along zzso by zzso As time zzso the level of gene expression was significantly enhanced relative to the control, possibly due to the failure in transport of zzso from zzso to late zzso or due to the breakdown of nuclear membrane when zzso was arrested at zzso by zzso On the other hand, zzso efficiency was significantly reduced at all time points by zzso D, which is considered to primarily affects zzso of zzso at the early stage of zzso by zzso zzso zzso Further investigation to identify the zzso route of zzso zzso was conducted applying zzso and zzso pathways zzso in cell zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso were zzso primarily through zzso pathway, with a minor fraction possibly entering cells via a zzso zzso
