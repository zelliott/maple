There is overwhelming evidence that breast cancer may be driven by a small subset of breast cancer stem cells zzso that display zzso cell zzso In the present study, we identified the rare population of zzso the so-called side population zzso cells, using flow zzso Then, we used zzso analysis to study the differential gene expression profiles between SP and zzso zzso zzso probe sets showed a more than fourfold zzso Next, we compared the levels of proteins with zzso zzso using 154 zzso focusing on the proteins and zzso sites that differed among SP cells, zzso zzso cells, and breast cancer zzso Our results revealed that 40 proteins and zzso sites were more than zzso different in SP cells than in zzso zzso By comparing SP cells, zzso cells, and zzso zzso cells, we found 12 proteins that were significantly zzso in SP zzso these zzso element binding protein zzso zzso zzso zzso factor 1, zzso zzso zzso factor 1, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso cell division cycle 42, and zzso more likely to play important roles in the signaling regulation of zzso Further, 16 proteins and zzso showed differential expression in SP cells and tumor zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in both SP cells and breast zzso Finally, we filtered the differential expression zzso summarized the zzso interactions of these zzso and rebuilt zzso in order to determine molecular mechanisms and core zzso This process will allow us to identify signature patterns and mechanisms of signaling networks in zzso
