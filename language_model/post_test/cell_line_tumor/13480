In zzso many aspects of behavior and physiology such as zzso cycles and liver metabolism are regulated by zzso zzso clocks zzso The zzso zzso system is a zzso zzso network, with the central clock located in the zzso nucleus zzso zzso and zzso zzso and peripheral clocks zzso Individual cells are the functional units for generation and maintenance of zzso zzso and these zzso of different tissue types in the zzso share a remarkably similar zzso negative feedback zzso However, due to interactions at the zzso network level in the zzso and through rhythmic, systemic cues at the zzso level, zzso rhythms at the zzso level are not necessarily zzso Compared to traditional studies of locomotor activity in zzso and zzso zzso ex zzso zzso in zzso zzso allow for discovery of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso models are more zzso zzso for zzso characterization and rapid discovery of basic clock zzso Because zzso rhythms are zzso zzso zzso with high zzso resolution are needed to assess clock zzso In recent years, real-time zzso recording using zzso zzso as a reporter has become a common technique for studying zzso rhythms in zzso as it allows for examination of the persistence and dynamics of molecular zzso To monitor zzso zzso rhythms of gene zzso zzso reporters can be introduced into cells via transient zzso or stable zzso Here we describe a stable zzso protocol using zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso system is superior to traditional methods such as transient zzso and zzso transmission because of its efficiency and zzso it permits efficient delivery and stable integration into the host zzso of both dividing and zzso zzso Once a reporter cell line is established, the dynamics of clock function can be examined through zzso zzso We first describe the generation of zzso reporter lines, and then present data from this and other zzso zzso In these zzso zzso mouse zzso and zzso human zzso cells are used as cellular zzso We also discuss various ways of using these clock models in zzso zzso zzso described here can be applied to a great variety of cell types to study the cellular and molecular basis of zzso zzso and may prove useful in tackling problems in other biological zzso
