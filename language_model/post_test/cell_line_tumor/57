zzso zzso break zzso repair leads to zzso instability, which is a hallmark of zzso zzso zzso breaks are repaired by two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso DNA end joining zzso It is not known whether these repair pathways are affected in sporadic breast zzso Here, we examined the efficiency of zzso and zzso repair in a panel of sporadic breast cancer cell lines and tested whether the efficiency of zzso or zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso in breast cancer cells were analyzed using in zzso fluorescent zzso zzso our analysis revealed that the efficiency of zzso is significantly elevated in breast cancer cells compared with normal zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the efficiency of zzso in breast cancer cells is not different from normal zzso Overall, breast cancer cells were more sensitive to radiation than normal cells, but the levels of resistance did not correlate with either zzso or zzso zzso Thus, we demonstrate that sporadic breast zzso are not associated with a zzso in zzso repair, but rather with zzso of the zzso zzso Our finding of elevated zzso in sporadic breast cancer cell lines suggests that therapies directed against the components of zzso will be highly zzso
