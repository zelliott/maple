zzso has been widely used in cancer zzso However, the prognosis of the cancer patients following chemotherapy has not been substantially improved and several different mechanisms could be zzso zzso alternative strategies such as zzso and their combinations with chemotherapy have being zzso Cancer zzso and immune escape are major obstacles in zzso However, the effects of zzso on the immune responses of cancer cells are not zzso In the present studies, we investigate the expression of zzso zzso zzso (the negative regulator programmed zzso 1) on zzso zzso zzso cells, which can interact with zzso on T cells to mediate cancer zzso zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso in zzso or in zzso to analysis the expression of zzso by flow zzso zzso zzso zzso expressions were examined by western zzso We demonstrated that zzso was able to induce zzso cell zzso and when the concentration less than zzso zzso could zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso The optimal concentration of zzso for the highest expression of zzso was zzso zzso in zzso Meanwhile, zzso could induce the zzso of zzso lack of effect during treatment with a specific zzso zzso inhibitor zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso expression is dependent of zzso zzso Our studies reveal a potential link between chemotherapy and cancer zzso zzso and its signaling zzso appear to be a potential therapeutic target for the zzso treatment of zzso
