zzso zzso zzso is a climbing perennial herb with zzso roots which is widely used in traditional medicine in Algeria for the treatment of zzso it belongs to the zzso zzso zzso 

To investigate the zzso and zzso activities, the zzso composition and acute toxicity of the zzso extract of zzso zzso roots growing in zzso 

zzso roots of zzso zzso were extracted with water zzso The zzso effects of the zzso extract in the zzso zzso zzso cell lines were evaluated by flow zzso zzso induction was assessed by two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of cell DNA and flow zzso light scatter zzso The zzso membrane potential was investigated using a fluorescent dye zzso The expression of zzso zzso -9 and zzso was assessed by Western zzso The zzso screening of the roots of zzso zzso was performed using qualitative zzso standard zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso extract induced cell death in a zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso extract was estimated to be approximately 15, zzso This was accompanied by induction of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and loss of zzso membrane zzso Furthermore, the zzso screening of roots of zzso zzso showed the presence of various zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso carbohydrates and zzso 

The zzso extract of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso cell lines via the zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso detected could be responsible for the zzso and zzso activities of the zzso extract of zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso could be considered as a promising source for developing novel zzso against zzso zzso
