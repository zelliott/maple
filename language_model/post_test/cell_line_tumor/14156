zzso cells produce vascular zzso growth factor zzso to induce zzso and thereby supply the zzso tissue with oxygen and zzso However, little is known about the direct effects of zzso on tumor zzso In this study, we investigate the ability of zzso to promote proliferation and invasion of human zzso cells zzso Since the zzso and its zzso zzso promote zzso cell proliferation and are zzso in human zzso we also tested the effects of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso Using cell culture, the effect of zzso on proliferation of zzso cells was measured using zzso to detect incorporated zzso as a marker of DNA zzso The effects of zzso and zzso on zzso cell invasion and proliferation were measured using zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression in zzso and zzso cells were measured using quantitative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also used to zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso significantly increased zzso cell proliferation and invasion in a zzso zzso These effects were blocked by the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso increased invasion, but not zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso when zzso and zzso cells were treated with zzso Eight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso zzso has a direct effect on zzso zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and contributes to zzso cell zzso
