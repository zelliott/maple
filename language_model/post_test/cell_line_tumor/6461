DNA zzso breaks zzso are deleterious zzso that can lead to zzso anomalies, zzso instability and zzso The zzso protein zzso has an important role in the DNA damage response zzso and the presence of zzso zzso nuclear zzso is the hallmark of zzso We zzso that ongoing DNA damage provides a mechanism by which zzso abnormalities and zzso zzso are acquired in zzso plasma cells zzso in patients with multiple myeloma zzso zzso we assessed PCs from patients with the zzso condition, zzso zzso of zzso significance zzso and zzso as well as human zzso cell lines zzso for evidence of zzso zzso zzso were detected in zzso zzso samples, zzso zzso samples and zzso zzso zzso the zzso response protein zzso zzso with zzso in both zzso patient samples and zzso Treatment with zzso decreased zzso of zzso and suggests zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso family members zzso the presence of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Taken together, these data imply that ongoing DNA damage zzso across the disease spectrum of zzso to zzso and may provide a mechanism zzso zzso evolution occurs in the zzso zzso
