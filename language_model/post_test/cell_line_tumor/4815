zzso cell zzso zzso a mature zzso zzso is genetically characterized by the zzso zzso However, secondary zzso are required for zzso zzso The identification of zzso tumor zzso genes contributing to the development of zzso may lead to further zzso of the biology of this disease and help to identify novel targets for zzso 

Whole zzso zzso gene expression profiling on treated versus zzso zzso cell lines was used to identify genes induced by zzso The degree of promoter zzso and zzso zzso of selected genes was then proven in zzso cell lines and primary cases by zzso zzso chain reaction zzso techniques, real-time zzso and gene expression zzso 

After zzso treatment, we identified more than 1000 zzso zzso 16 of which were zzso zzso or zzso Most of them were not known to be silenced by zzso in zzso A low expression of zzso zzso and zzso was observed in three of the five the zzso cell zzso In addition, the expression of zzso which is located in the frequently deleted region zzso was substantially reduced and displayed at least partial promoter zzso in all investigated zzso cell lines as well as in 31 primary zzso zzso 

In zzso we identified interesting novel candidate genes that probably contribute to the progression of zzso and suggest that zzso is a strong candidate tumor zzso gene in zzso
