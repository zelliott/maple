Previously, we isolated two zzso zzso and zzso from grape cell culture that were potent zzso zzso in a human DNA zzso II zzso for cancer zzso The objectives of this study were to further assess zzso of these zzso on zzso and zzso cells, and to zzso and characterize the composition of zzso a fraction that was selectively zzso to zzso cell zzso Both zzso and zzso provided significant zzso to zzso mouse leukemia zzso Only zzso a zzso zzso significantly reduced viability in zzso human liver cancer cells, yet unlike zzso caused no zzso to zzso zzso pig kidney zzso After further zzso of zzso zzso toxicity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso on zzso cells was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso toxicity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in descending zzso zzso data suggested that zzso of these zzso zzso to zzso cells was zzso to the degree of zzso Because zzso and its zzso were selectively zzso to zzso cell lines tested, they warrant further investigation as potential natural zzso zzso
