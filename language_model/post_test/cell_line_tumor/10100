zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso and zzso zzso and is involved in zzso checkpoint zzso Because zzso is a key regulator in the zzso checkpoint, zzso tumors rely only on the zzso checkpoint after DNA zzso zzso such tumors are selectively zzso to zzso agents by zzso zzso Here, we report the discovery of a potent and selective zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso This compound zzso zzso of zzso at zzso zzso a direct zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso abrogates zzso DNA damage checkpoint, leading to zzso in combination with zzso zzso agents such as zzso zzso and zzso selectively in zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso tumor growth zzso by these agents, and zzso does not significantly increase zzso The enhancement of zzso effect by zzso was well correlated with zzso of zzso zzso in tumor tissue and skin hair zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso provides a new approach for treatment of multiple human zzso
