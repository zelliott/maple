zzso is an zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso a potent zzso found in tobacco smoke, zzso lung tumors in zzso zzso zzso zzso cellular transformation resulting in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso may be a target for cancer zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of zzso on zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso A total of 180 zzso female zzso mice were randomly divided into six groups: group 1 zzso treated with zzso zzso group 2, treated with 5 zzso zzso zzso group 3, treated with 50 zzso zzso zzso (to test the zzso of zzso group 4 zzso for zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso group 5, treated with 5 zzso zzso zzso and group 6, treated with 50 zzso zzso zzso and injected with zzso once at 8 weeks of age to test the zzso activity of zzso zzso was given once a day, 5 days a week by zzso beginning at 4 weeks of age and continuing for 26 zzso All mice were sacrificed at 30 weeks of zzso The zzso of the zzso lung tumors were significantly suppressed in a zzso zzso zzso had no effect on body weight at a low zzso The administration of zzso alone for 26 weeks did not induce zzso instead, it significantly suppressed the zzso of spontaneous tumors in the mice, in contrast with other zzso zzso zzso did not induce lung zzso when compared with control mice by zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso has a weak but significant zzso effect with no zzso or pulmonary toxicity in zzso zzso
