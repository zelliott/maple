Since human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso is known to participate with the zzso growth factor zzso zzso in zzso zzso we zzso that zzso zzso might indicate responsiveness to zzso targeted zzso zzso breast cancer cells zzso with the zzso gene were zzso to establish a set of genetically related cell lines expressing graded levels of zzso by zzso zzso The zzso cell lines and parental zzso cells were zzso by their growth zzso and cell by cell patterns of zzso zzso and zzso expression as well as levels of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso by laser scanning zzso zzso Growth zzso zzso were used to zzso response to zzso targeted therapy, and to determine the relationship between therapeutic response and levels of zzso zzso zzso The levels of growth zzso of zzso and of the zzso combinations were correlated with levels of zzso expression among the different cell zzso Among zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was the best single zzso marker, but combinations of two markers provided additional zzso zzso
