zzso zzso genes zzso a broad class of molecules whose zzso zzso contributes to zzso zzso In the zzso situation, the zzso zzso is completely zzso through a two-hit process involving a point zzso in one zzso and zzso deletion of the zzso Here, to identify zzso zzso genes in lymphoma, we screen a short hairpin zzso library targeting genes deleted in human zzso We functionally identify those genes whose suppression promotes zzso in a mouse zzso zzso Of the nine zzso zzso we identified, eight zzso to genes occurring in three physically linked zzso suggesting that the common occurrence of large zzso deletions in human zzso reflects selective pressure to zzso multiple zzso Among the new zzso zzso are zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso two genes associated with zzso a unique zzso acid produced as a product of zzso metabolism through a highly zzso zzso Through a secondary screen surveying the impact of all zzso zzso on zzso we establish the zzso axis as a new zzso zzso network regulating zzso zzso zzso deletions encompassing zzso and zzso often occur together in human zzso and zzso of both genes promotes zzso in zzso Thus, some zzso zzso functions can be disabled through a zzso process targeting different genes acting in the same zzso
