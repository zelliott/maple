The significance of zzso zzso in breast cancer cell metabolism was investigated under stress conditions caused by serum zzso zzso deficient zzso cells adapt to stress conditions by increasing synthesis and content of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso from zzso and zzso was regulated at the level of formation of zzso the zzso step zzso by zzso The zzso activity of zzso was elevated zzso yet the zzso remained zzso in zzso zzso Contributions to the elevated zzso activity included zzso and zzso zzso The zzso levels of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso higher in deficient zzso The total amounts of zzso and zzso proteins were similarly elevated zzso In zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso was additionally regulated by zzso Under zzso zzso conditions, both zzso and zzso zzso were increasingly zzso at zzso zzso The results established that elevated zzso formation and the increased activity of the zzso zzso zzso were critical zzso of the zzso Kennedy pathway, and total zzso content in serum deprived breast cancer zzso zzso as an essential gene sensitive to nutritional zzso zzso could represent a legitimate target in novel zzso strategies for zzso
