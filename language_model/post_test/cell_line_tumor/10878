zzso zzso expression is the hallmark of melanoma and may serve as a potential therapeutic zzso While zzso zzso zzso expression seems to be zzso in melanoma, zzso expression of zzso zzso is dependent on zzso zzso zzso melanoma is a suitable model for studies on zzso zzso treatment strategies since zzso zzso is not expressed in this cell zzso Here we have used a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to test the biological consequences of zzso zzso zzso in melanoma zzso We have previously reported that in zzso cells zzso is zzso active and zzso Upon zzso binding to the surface zzso zzso which is in the active zzso zzso became zzso through a process of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso binding to zzso cells induced a significant decrease in zzso melanoma cells within 30 zzso Treatment of zzso cells in zzso with zzso significantly inhibited proliferation by decreasing the zzso index but not affecting zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso decreased their lung colonization potential, suggesting a profound zzso in their biological behavior under the effect of this zzso These zzso data suggest that the zzso expression of zzso zzso in melanoma cells can be exploited as a novel target of zzso therapy of zzso
