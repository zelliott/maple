To investigate the effect of zzso zzso against vascular zzso growth factor 165 zzso on human esophagus zzso cell zzso cell line zzso 

zzso expression zzso for zzso zzso zzso was constructed and zzso zzso zzso was zzso into zzso cells and the zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso to nude zzso The biological characteristics and zzso of zzso zzso cells were observed by in zzso zzso laser zzso zzso transmission electron zzso and flow zzso 

The zzso expression zzso zzso was successfully constructed and expressed in zzso zzso zzso The rate of zzso expression dropped by zzso in zzso zzso The zzso and cell cycle of zzso zzso cells were not affected by the zzso zzso but the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso cells were greatly reduced in nude zzso The volume of tumors in zzso zzso group, empty zzso zzso group and control group were zzso zzso (7 zzso zzso zzso and (7 zzso zzso zzso The zzso density of the three groups were zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso of human zzso zzso cell zzso were effectively inhibited by zzso zzso zzso which may be applied to treat solid tumor in the zzso
