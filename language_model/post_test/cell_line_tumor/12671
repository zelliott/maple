In this study, solid zzso zzso zzso loaded with zzso zzso were prepared, characterized and evaluated for zzso against zzso human zzso cancer zzso Two types of zzso ammonium zzso zzso stabilized zzso with or without zzso zzso were prepared by mixed zzso zzso zzso were characterized for size, zzso and stability in zzso media and against zzso zzso zzso and release studies were further confirmed by gel zzso zzso of the zzso against zzso cells was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso with zzso VI had lower particle size zzso zzso with improved stability in zzso media when compared to reference zzso without zzso VI zzso zzso Both zzso however had similar zzso profile with an optimum binding at zzso to zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso and free zzso in the presence and absence of free zzso had insignificant effect on the viability of zzso zzso However, when cells were zzso treated with zzso loaded zzso and free zzso cell viability significantly decreased to approximately zzso These results suggested that zzso enhanced zzso and zzso of zzso zzso which led to the zzso of zzso and subsequently reversing the resistance of the cells to zzso
