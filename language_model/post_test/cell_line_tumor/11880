To study the function of zzso of liver zzso zzso as a regulatory factor that specifically stimulates zzso cell zzso we constructed zzso expressive zzso of zzso and expressed it in zzso zzso 

Total zzso was extracted from zzso cells, and reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was performed to amplify the coding region of zzso The products were cloned into zzso zzso and zzso then cloned into zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was transformed into zzso zzso The zzso protein was extracted and analyzed by zzso gel zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso 

DNA sequencing results confirmed that the coding region of zzso was correctly inserted into the zzso expression zzso and Western zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso was successfully expressed in zzso Its molecular weight was identical to the theoretical value of 15 zzso zzso the protein was found inside the zzso zzso 

The successful expression of zzso in zzso cells makes it possible to study further on its biological zzso
