To study the effect of zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor related zzso inducing zzso zzso and zzso or zzso induced zzso in human zzso cell line zzso and its possible molecular zzso 

The expressions of zzso 8 zzso and protein were detected with zzso and Western zzso zzso The effects of zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso + zzso 8 inhibitor + zzso zzso + zzso + zzso and zzso + zzso + TRAIL on the growth and zzso of zzso cells were detected with the methods of zzso and flow zzso The relative zzso 8 activity was measured with zzso zzso 

zzso 8 was zzso in zzso cells but an increased expression of zzso 8 zzso and protein was found after treatment with zzso zzso cells themselves were not sensitive to zzso but those expressing zzso 8 after treatment with zzso zzso The killing effect of TRAIL on zzso cells expressing zzso 8 was depressed by zzso 8 zzso zzso and zzso could enhance the sensitivity of TRAIL on zzso zzso The relative zzso 8 activity of zzso cells in zzso + TRAIL group was significantly higher than those of control group, zzso group, TRAIL group, and inhibitor group zzso zzso zzso There was no significant difference among zzso + TRAIL group, zzso + zzso + TRAIL group, and zzso + zzso + TRAIL zzso 

zzso could sensitize zzso cells to zzso zzso and this may be realized by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso could enhance the killing effect of TRAIL on zzso zzso
