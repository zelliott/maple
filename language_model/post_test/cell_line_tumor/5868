The zzso E virus zzso is a small zzso virus and the cause of acute viral zzso zzso The open reading frame 3 protein zzso of zzso appears to be a zzso regulatory protein that helps in the establishment, propagation and progression of viral zzso However, the global cellular effects of this protein remain to be zzso In the absence of traditional in zzso viral infection systems or efficient zzso systems, we made an zzso based zzso protein expression system to study its effects on host cell gene zzso We infected zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso expressing zzso and performed zzso gene expression zzso Several genes down regulated in zzso cells were found to be under regulation of the zzso zzso nuclear factor 4 zzso which regulates zzso gene zzso While zzso zzso to the nucleus, its zzso results in impaired nuclear zzso of zzso Here we report that zzso increases zzso zzso through the zzso and zzso zzso which results in impaired nuclear zzso of zzso and subsequently the down zzso of zzso genes in zzso zzso We propose that zzso of several zzso specific genes by zzso will create an environment favorable for viral replication and zzso
