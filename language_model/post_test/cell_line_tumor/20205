The molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are still insufficiently zzso but there is evidence that zzso is a zzso regulator that is recruited by specialized zzso zzso Here we analyzed the binding sites of zzso and the zzso status of zzso genes that had been identified by global expression profiling upon depletion of zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso and autonomously binds to zzso DNA around zzso start sites zzso of many genes characterized by active zzso marks zzso and frequently associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regions overlap predominantly with zzso islands and are enriched in zzso that are prone to form zzso zzso In line, zzso binds and zzso a zzso zzso structure in zzso zzso we assume that binding of zzso to zzso DNA regions associated with a large set of zzso genes is an initial step in their regulation by zzso Using zzso and zzso as model zzso we show that zzso affects several parameters of active zzso Finally, we discuss a dual mode model of zzso zzso which includes both zzso and deterministic zzso
