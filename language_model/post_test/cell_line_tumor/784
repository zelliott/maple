zzso zzso zzso zzso recently classified as zzso zzso gene symbol zzso is thought to be a tumor zzso gene based on the loss of its expression in many different types of zzso Gene therapy by zzso zzso zzso gene transfer has been shown to inhibit the growth of several different tumor cell lines, in zzso and in zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso lung cancer zzso cell lines by enhancing an zzso zzso through the zzso of zzso and zzso In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of zzso administration of zzso combined with zzso radiation for treating zzso zzso tumors in nude zzso zzso and long-lasting zzso of tumor growth was evident following the combined zzso zzso examination revealed marked reduction of zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso density and enhanced zzso in the tumors treated with the combination therapy compared to those treated with zzso alone or radiation zzso To confirm the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso we performed zzso survival zzso using human zzso vein zzso cells zzso zzso cells, and normal human lung zzso zzso cells, zzso with the zzso medium from zzso cells that had been zzso zzso with zzso or a control zzso The results showed that zzso protein zzso zzso to zzso radiation but not zzso cells or zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso in combination with radiation enhances zzso in the tumors and that zzso zzso protein zzso zzso by zzso zzso cells to zzso radiation without affecting other normal zzso We conclude that the combination of zzso gene therapy and zzso may be a feasible and effective strategy for treatment of zzso
