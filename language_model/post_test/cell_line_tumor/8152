zzso with zzso zzso zzso is the strongest risk factor for the development of gastric zzso The zzso gene product zzso which is delivered into gastric zzso cells, specifically binds to and zzso activates zzso zzso zzso also interacts with and zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso which zzso zzso proteins to destabilize zzso and thereby causes zzso polarity zzso In light of the notion that zzso are not only required for polarity regulation but also essential for the formation of zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso zzso zzso also influences zzso Here, we investigated the effect of zzso on the progression of zzso In the presence of zzso cells displayed a delay in the transition from zzso to zzso Furthermore, a fraction of the zzso cells showed zzso zzso at the onset of zzso followed by zzso segregation with abnormal division zzso The effect of zzso on zzso was abolished by elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso delay similar to that induced by zzso Thus, zzso zzso of zzso which zzso zzso stability and thereby causes zzso zzso dysfunction, is involved in the zzso delay and subsequent zzso zzso zzso chronic exposure of cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso Our findings reveal a zzso role of zzso as an zzso zzso elicits uncontrolled cell proliferation by zzso zzso zzso and at the same time zzso zzso instability by zzso the zzso zzso zzso The dual function of zzso may zzso contribute to the progression of zzso gastric zzso
