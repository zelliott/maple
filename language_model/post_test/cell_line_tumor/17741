The zzso of small cell lung cancer zzso and zzso cell lung cancer zzso can pose diagnostic problems due to zzso zzso and other limitations of zzso There is an interest in developing zzso models of lung zzso based on the analysis of zzso molecular data with statistical methods and/or neural zzso DNA zzso levels at 20 zzso were measured in 41 zzso and 46 zzso cell lines with the quantitative real-time zzso method zzso The data were analyzed with artificial neural networks zzso and linear zzso analysis zzso to zzso the cell lines into zzso or into zzso Models used either data from all 20 zzso or from five significant DNA zzso zzso that were selected by a zzso zzso procedure zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The data were sorted randomly by cell line into 10 different data sets, each with training and testing zzso composed of 71 and 16 of the cases, zzso Ten ANN models were trained using the 10 data zzso five using 20 zzso and five using the five variables selected by zzso zzso The ANN models with 20 input variables correctly classified zzso of the cell lines, while the models with only five variables correctly classified 87 to zzso of zzso For comparison, 10 different zzso models were trained and tested using the same data sets with either the original data or with zzso transformed zzso Again, half of the models used all 20 variables while the others used only the five significant zzso zzso models provided correct zzso in zzso to zzso of zzso The zzso provided by all of the different models were compared with zzso statistics, yielding zzso values ranging from zzso to zzso We conclude that ANN models based on DNA zzso profiles can zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells lines with substantial to perfect zzso while zzso models based on DNA zzso profiles provide poor to substantial zzso Our work supports the promise of ANN analysis of DNA zzso data as a powerful approach for the development of automated methods for lung cancer zzso
