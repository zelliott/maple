zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been regarded as a crucial zzso for tumor zzso invasion, and zzso by its capability to degrade the basement membrane zzso and its zzso process is critical for tumor zzso Recently, zzso which is a member of zzso zzso has been reported to be highly expressed in tumor cells and induce production of zzso from zzso adjacent to the tumor zzso In this study, we demonstrated that production of zzso and active forms of zzso by human zzso zzso was enhanced by the direct zzso contact with zzso zzso cells derived from a human zzso zzso zzso The results from zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction zzso analysis indicated that zzso cells express a higher level of zzso but only a low level of zzso and membrane type zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso express a higher level of zzso and zzso and a low level of zzso In a mixed zzso with direct zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso the zzso and active zzso production from zzso but not in a separated zzso through zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso was induced by the addition of membrane zzso prepared from zzso cells to the zzso culture, and the induction was suppressed by the zzso depletion after zzso signifying the participation of zzso for the induction and zzso of zzso Our results suggest an importance of the direct zzso interaction involving zzso rather than zzso factors such as zzso for zzso production and zzso followed by tumor zzso invasion, and zzso in zzso zzso
