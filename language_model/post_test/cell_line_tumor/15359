Resistance to chemotherapy is a major obstacle for the effective treatment of advanced zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso is still poorly zzso Recently, more and more evidence showed zzso zzso modulated many key molecules and pathways involved in zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in many zzso but its role in zzso cancer and drug resistance still remains zzso This study was to investigate whether zzso zzso resistance of the zzso cancer cell line zzso to the zzso agent zzso zzso The different levels of zzso in zzso cells and their resistant zzso zzso cells were identified by using real-time zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso were used to analyze the effect of zzso on zzso resistance of these paired zzso zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso reporter zzso were applied to explore whether zzso was a target of zzso As compared to zzso cells, the expression of zzso was zzso in the zzso resistant cell line zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso dramatically decreased zzso effects and zzso induced by zzso in zzso cells, while zzso of zzso significantly increased zzso effects and zzso induced by zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited cell survival and zzso resistance through zzso the expression of zzso zzso was a direct target of zzso These results suggest that zzso may provide a novel mechanism for understanding zzso resistance in zzso cancer by modulating zzso
