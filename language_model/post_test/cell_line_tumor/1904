Breast cancer is the most aggressive form of all zzso with high zzso and mortality zzso The purpose of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso breast cancer growth in mice zzso zzso is an organic zzso natural compound without any zzso In this study, we demonstrated that zzso substantially decreased the viability of human breast cancer cells in a zzso zzso zzso also suppressed the zzso of zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and inhibited zzso zzso expression in zzso cell zzso Moreover, zzso decreased the zzso activities of zzso and zzso to the target gene promoters in zzso 231 or zzso zzso zzso We confirmed that zzso significantly decreased the relative zzso activities indicating zzso between zzso zzso and zzso To confirm these findings in zzso zzso were established in zzso zzso nude mice with zzso 231 cells and zzso was administered for 30 zzso zzso to our in zzso analysis, these zzso showed decreased expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Through in zzso and in zzso analysis, we confirmed that zzso can effectively regulate multiple targets including zzso and zzso These are the major molecules involved in tumor development, zzso and zzso Thus, we strongly recommend the use of zzso as a trial drug for treating all types of breast zzso including zzso zzso
