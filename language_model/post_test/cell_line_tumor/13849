Several members of the zzso growth factor zzso family have an important role in the development of skeletal zzso zzso is widely expressed in the developing zzso but its function there has remained zzso We asked in this study whether zzso could have a role in the differentiation of zzso stem cells to an zzso zzso zzso of zzso to mouse bone zzso cultures effectively increased initial cell proliferation as well as subsequent zzso alkaline zzso production, bone zzso formation, and calcium zzso if it was added to the cultures at an early stage of zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso the proliferation of zzso zzso cells, which was blocked by a zzso zzso to zzso In addition, the zzso growth factor fraction of zzso 115 zzso mouse breast cancer cells, which express and zzso zzso at a very high level, had an effect in bone zzso cultures similar to that of zzso zzso Interestingly, experimental nude mouse tumors of zzso cells present zzso bone and cartilage formation as demonstrated by typical zzso and expression of markers specific for cartilage zzso II and IX zzso and bone zzso These results demonstrate that zzso effectively zzso bone zzso cells to differentiate to zzso and increases bone formation in zzso It is possible that zzso also stimulates bone formation in zzso The results suggest that zzso which is expressed by a great proportion of zzso breast and prostate tumors, may, among other factors, also be involved in the formation of zzso bone zzso
