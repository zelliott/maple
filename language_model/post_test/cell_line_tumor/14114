zzso P zzso is a highly zzso zzso plasma zzso Aside from its role as zzso carrier zzso an zzso function of zzso has been zzso zzso which zzso zzso oxygen species in the brain, were described as potential target cells of zzso We investigated the expression of zzso in human zzso and its involvement in the protection of these cells against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that primary human zzso and the human zzso cell line zzso express zzso as an zzso zzso which is not zzso zzso expression in zzso is zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso the protective effect of zzso zzso such as sodium zzso or zzso against zzso damage, shielding zzso from zzso zzso zzso supplementation of zzso zzso zzso stress via an increase in expression and activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, specific zzso of zzso expression by small interfering zzso decreases cell viability of human zzso and makes them more susceptible to zzso zzso Our results zzso an zzso activity of zzso expressed zzso in zzso zzso while during adequate zzso supply the enhanced protection against zzso stress is exerted by zzso
