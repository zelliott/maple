This study tested the hypothesis that the number of CA single sequence repeat zzso in the zzso 1 of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso which affects zzso efficiency of the zzso is associated with the response to zzso zzso To this end, we determined the number of CA zzso in the zzso 1 of the zzso gene in a panel of 12 head and neck cancer cell lines that lack zzso gene amplification and measured the expression of zzso zzso and zzso as well as response to zzso zzso zzso with lower number of CA zzso in the zzso had higher expression of the zzso gene and protein and were more sensitive to the zzso effects of zzso a small zzso inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso modification by zzso zzso zzso expression in a susceptible cell line induced resistance to the zzso The number of CA zzso was equivalent in zzso and tumor DNA obtained from 30 patients with head and neck zzso In a clinical study in zzso cancer, subjects with lower number of CA zzso frequently developed skin zzso a feature that is related to the zzso activity of this class of zzso These results suggest that zzso variations in the zzso 1 of the zzso gene is associated with response to zzso zzso and may provide an explanation as to why the development of skin toxicity is associated with a favorable outcome in patients treated with these zzso
