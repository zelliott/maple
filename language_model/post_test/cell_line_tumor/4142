zzso is a zzso mechanism in disease zzso The vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso is a major zzso of zzso and a comprehensive zzso of the functional variation in this zzso is essential to understand the genetic basis of zzso zzso We assessed the zzso zzso of gene zzso population specificity of zzso expression quantitative trait zzso zzso and zzso function in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso people of zzso Nigeria zzso zzso zzso cell lines in 23 zzso zzso Among zzso zzso 155 and 174 were unique to zzso and zzso respectively, and 27 were shared between zzso and zzso Two zzso provided zzso evidence for two zzso association study zzso Five zzso were tested for function in zzso zzso and the effect of two zzso zzso was zzso with the zzso zzso Two zzso found in each of zzso zzso and zzso could predict zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso in gene zzso zzso This is the first analysis focusing on the pattern of functional genetic variation of the zzso zzso genes in zzso and zzso populations and providing zzso evidence for genetic association studies of diseases for which zzso plays a zzso zzso
