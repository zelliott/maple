One of the hallmarks of cancer is zzso zzso Many tumors display increased zzso zzso and breakdown through the process of zzso zzso also known as the Warburg zzso Less studied in cancer development and progression is the importance of the zzso zzso pathway, which provides cells with a variety of essential products to sustain cell zzso such as zzso and zzso for zzso To this end zzso dependency was assessed in a panel of zzso cell lung cancer lines zzso zzso was found to be essential for the growth of cells with high rates of zzso and after exploring multiple genes in the zzso pathway, zzso was found to be the key zzso associated with this zzso This dependence was confirmed by observing the rescue of decreased growth by zzso addition of downstream zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be decreased in tumors compared with normal lung zzso zzso knock down of zzso zzso zzso indicated that loss of zzso had the most zzso effect on cancer cell zzso In conclusion, zzso cell lines depend on zzso for zzso to a varying degree, in which the zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an essential role and is a potential target for cancer zzso zzso
