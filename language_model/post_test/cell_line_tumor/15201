zzso deposition of zzso is the zzso hallmark of Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso protein zzso the major component of zzso is generated from sequential zzso of zzso precursor protein zzso by zzso and zzso zzso Patients with diabetes zzso zzso characterized by chronic zzso increased risk of zzso zzso the role of high blood zzso in zzso processing and zzso generation remains zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of high zzso on zzso metabolism and zzso generation in cultured human zzso We found that high zzso treatment significantly increased zzso protein level in both zzso and zzso cells, and promoted zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that high zzso increase of zzso level was not due to enhancement of zzso gene zzso but resulted from zzso of zzso protein zzso Taken together, our data indicated that zzso could promote zzso zzso by zzso zzso degradation and enhancing zzso zzso More importantly, the zzso of zzso level and zzso generation by high zzso was caused by reduction of zzso turnover zzso study provides a molecular mechanism of increased risk of developing zzso in patients zzso suggests zzso control might be potentially beneficial for reducing the zzso of zzso in diabetic patients and delaying the zzso zzso
