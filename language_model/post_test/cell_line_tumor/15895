zzso zzso are currently treated with zzso zzso but often exhibit resistance to this zzso zzso cancer stem cells, a population believed to contribute to the zzso zzso bear the zzso of zzso and Sonic zzso zzso zzso In this study, we examined whether zzso of both pathways enhances the efficacy of zzso zzso in the context of zzso stem zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso pathways in zzso zzso cell populations showed the activity of these zzso zzso cells were less susceptible to zzso treatment than the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso cells was further enhanced by zzso exposure, which led to zzso 1, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The therapeutic effect of zzso was enhanced by zzso and zzso zzso pharmacological antagonism with zzso and zzso More importantly, simultaneous treatment involving zzso with both of these compounds led to a significant increase in zzso zzso zzso than treatment with any of these agents alone zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso cells zzso genes involved in zzso and zzso zzso These pathways contribute to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells, as their antagonism leads to an additive effect when used in combination with zzso
