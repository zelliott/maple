zzso Ras proteins interact with a broad range of zzso proteins to induce a diverse series of biological zzso Although typically associated with enhanced growth and zzso activated Ras may also induce growth zzso effects such as zzso or zzso It is now apparent that some of the zzso properties of Ras are zzso via the zzso family of Ras zzso zzso To date, four members of this family have been identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso We now identify a fifth member of this group, zzso zzso zzso shows approximately zzso identity with zzso and zzso identity with zzso zzso binds directly to activated zzso in a zzso manner via the zzso domain, thus exhibiting the basic properties of a Ras zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells and zzso the growth of human tumor cell zzso Although broadly expressed in normal zzso zzso is frequently zzso by promoter zzso in human tumor zzso Thus, zzso appears to be a new member of the zzso family of potential Ras zzso zzso
