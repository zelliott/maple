zzso zzso when injected zzso into the calf, is incorporated into the zzso nerve and causes an initial paralysis of the zzso limb in transgenic mice carrying the human zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrated by using an zzso microscope that zzso particles exist on zzso structures in nerve terminals of zzso zzso We also demonstrated in zzso zzso pull-down experiments that the zzso light chain, zzso interacts directly with the zzso domain of zzso In the zzso of differentiated rat zzso cells zzso with expression zzso for zzso zzso composed of zzso and zzso zzso as well as a zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso that had a reduced ability to bind zzso zzso with zzso However, zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso alpha had only retrograde motion, while those containing zzso zzso and zzso alpha had zzso or retrograde zzso zzso application of the zzso agent zzso to the zzso nerve reduced the amount of virus transported from the calf to the spinal zzso These results suggest that direct efficient interaction between the zzso domain and zzso is essential for the efficient retrograde transport of zzso zzso along zzso in zzso
