zzso overdose causes severe zzso zzso Although the mechanisms of zzso zzso have been well investigated, little is known about the involvement of the zzso in zzso transport and zzso zzso is a membrane zzso zzso playing a significant role in regulating zzso zzso and tissue distribution of many zzso To evaluate the contribution of zzso zzso in the course of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells with different zzso expression and activity, were treated by zzso zzso zzso for different time zzso with or without the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso activity was determined by zzso 123 zzso zzso and western zzso zzso To assess the zzso toxicity and effect of zzso we investigated cellular zzso status, zzso zzso nuclear fragmentation and zzso zzso zzso markedly enhanced zzso zzso damage and cell zzso Moreover, zzso revealed zzso toxicity even at zzso zzso High zzso zzso increased zzso activity and content in both zzso and zzso zzso These observations suggest the involvement of zzso in zzso zzso Notwithstanding the differences of the investigated zzso cell lines in zzso function, zzso toxicity was similar, possibly due to different functions of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is a zzso zzso and zzso is involved in zzso transport and toxicity in zzso and zzso zzso This study establishes the fact that zzso can zzso zzso in zzso cells, suggesting that its routine use in cancer patients in combination with zzso drugs, may influence the result of zzso
