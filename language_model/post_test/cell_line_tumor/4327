zzso zzso cancer zzso is a highly lethal zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso agent used to treat zzso but resistance to zzso leads to chemotherapy zzso zzso are a novel class of regulators that function by controlling gene expression at the zzso zzso Several recent reports have identified some zzso that are related to chemotherapy zzso In this study, we found two zzso zzso and zzso that were significantly zzso in the zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso compared with their sensitive parent line zzso and zzso zzso zzso the roles of zzso and zzso were evaluated in zzso and in zzso The zzso of zzso or zzso increased zzso sensitivity of zzso and zzso cells by zzso proliferation and promoting zzso then we further confirmed that these zzso functioned through suppressing DNA zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso nude mice that were injected zzso with zzso cells zzso with zzso mimics exhibited zzso zzso sensitivity in zzso Interestingly, we found that there were no significant changes in the expression of these two zzso after treatment with zzso zzso a traditional zzso therapeutic agent, suggesting these zzso represented two new regulators independent of zzso Finally, the survival zzso in zzso and zzso cells revealed that the two zzso involved in zzso sensitivity were related to cell zzso Our results indicated that zzso and zzso were involved in zzso cancer zzso resistance in zzso and in zzso by targeting zzso zzso These molecules may serve as potential zzso therapeutic targets in other zzso
