zzso has long been associated with surface zzso zzso and zzso The surface topography eventually affects the nature and the intensity of the interactions that occur at zzso interface zzso zzso mobility, zzso and zzso zzso it is necessary to produce and work with controlled zzso surfaces that present zzso zzso of a dimension similar to that of the biological elements of interest (in this case, zzso There are a number of zzso that already have been studied in terms of surface zzso however, few studies are related to zzso zzso zzso As it is well established, zzso is a well-known ceramic that is extremely used in medical applications, namely implants and zzso In this work, the surface topography of dense zzso zzso was altered by using zzso zzso zzso The surface was characterized by atomic force zzso and contact angle zzso while the cell distribution and zzso was assessed by scanning electron zzso and zzso laser scanning zzso zzso revealed that the surface is characterized by a homogeneous zzso structure with high specific zzso Moreover, cells were able to attach and spread on the surface of the samples, and gradually grow into nearly zzso zzso
