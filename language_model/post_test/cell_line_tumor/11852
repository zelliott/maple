zzso drugs can enhance an immune response of the host against the tumor in addition to killing cancer cells by direct zzso zzso the combination of chemotherapy and zzso is a promising approach for eliminating tumors, particularly in advanced zzso A strategic medication is to use a zzso zzso format that is capable of recruiting zzso T cells around zzso tumor zzso Recently, we have constructed a zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso In this study, we measured B7 family members zzso zzso and zzso zzso expressed on a zzso human leukemia cell line, zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso We found that a low concentration of zzso could zzso zzso expressed on zzso zzso zzso The zzso of T zzso against zzso cells in zzso and in zzso zzso by the zzso zzso with or without a low dose of zzso was zzso The combination of the zzso zzso and zzso showed the greatest effectiveness in enhancing the zzso of T cells against the tumor cells in zzso and in zzso zzso T cells expressed higher levels of zzso and zzso and released more zzso zzso Both zzso B system and zzso zzso were involved in the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the activated T cells could zzso zzso expression on zzso cells, and zzso of zzso interaction impaired zzso of T zzso It was noted that zzso could zzso zzso expressed on two of five specimens of acute B zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso of T cells against these two zzso cells was enhanced in the presence of the zzso zzso These findings indicate that treatment strategy using both zzso zzso zzso and chemotherapy may have synergistic zzso
