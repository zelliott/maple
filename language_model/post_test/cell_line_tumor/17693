zzso zzso have the potential to become pharmaceuticals by virtue of their target specificity toward clinically relevant sugar zzso Their application can also provide fundamental insights into the impact of two spatial factors on zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso mode, cluster zzso and zzso recognition zzso in zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso substitution of zzso from zzso zzso by the unprotected sodium zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The produced zzso were first tested as competitive zzso in zzso zzso A plant toxin from zzso and an zzso G fraction from human serum were markedly zzso A nearly zzso increase in zzso potency of each zzso zzso in the zzso form relative to free zzso zzso relative to free zzso was zzso Thus, these zzso can efficiently zzso for example, with zzso zzso zzso Among the tested zzso selected from this family of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso acted as sensors to delineate zzso differences between the two zzso zzso zzso The relatively strong zzso with zzso zzso a zzso of tumor zzso disclosed selectivity for zzso binding among zzso Equally important, the geometry of zzso display zzso zzso or zzso zzso made its mark on the zzso zzso To further determine the sensitivity of a distinct zzso presented on the cell surface and not in solution, we established a zzso zzso tumor cell zzso We detected a significant response to presence of the zzso zzso This type of chemical scaffold with favorable zzso properties might thus be exploited for the design of zzso and zzso zzso
