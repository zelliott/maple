zzso in the tumor zzso are a key zzso in cancer progression and may be a promising target for cancer zzso zzso growth factor binding protein 7 zzso is known as a tumor zzso in zzso cancer zzso The present study investigated the zzso mechanism of zzso expression in zzso by zzso from the zzso cell line, zzso The results showed that the expression of zzso was zzso in the zzso when treated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso induced by zzso zzso or zzso was partially inhibited by the zzso specific zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the proteins zzso were all zzso in zzso expressing high levels of zzso and the zzso could be inhibited both by the zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso and by the zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso cells promote the high expression of zzso in zzso most likely through the zzso of zzso and zzso signaling in a zzso dependent zzso Taken together, these data suggest that the zzso could be a novel therapeutic target in tumor zzso
