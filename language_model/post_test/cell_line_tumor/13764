We show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso zzso prostate cancer and that its expression in tumor cells is induced by zzso loss as a consequence of zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso growth zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso and the mechanism involves zzso zzso repression of the zzso This mechanism has significant functional and therapeutic implications that were zzso zzso expression positively zzso with zzso and zzso zzso with zzso in prostate zzso zzso is a robust zzso for predicting response to zzso therapy because prostate zzso that express zzso exhibit low levels of zzso zzso targeting zzso is only modestly effective because zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso however, completely blocks tumor growth in zzso
