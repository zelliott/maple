zzso of the melanoma differentiation associated zzso zzso in zzso generally results in the growth suppression and induction of zzso of diverse human tumor zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso of the zzso gene in human zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso of zzso facilitated the zzso zzso and zzso arrest in zzso cells, but not in the normal liver cell line zzso and the effect was independent of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was correlated with decreasing expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso regulated by zzso in zzso zzso We also showed that zzso combined with zzso zzso had significantly enhanced zzso and zzso effects in zzso accompanied by the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso genes and the zzso of zzso zzso These data suggested that zzso zzso its selective zzso properties in zzso cells by promoting zzso independent of zzso status, zzso subcutaneous tumor growth and zzso and increasing the effect of zzso zzso zzso represents a new class of cancer zzso genes that may be useful in the targeted therapy of zzso
