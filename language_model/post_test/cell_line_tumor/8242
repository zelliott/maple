To investigate effect of temperature on zzso acid zzso induced zzso reaction in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Human zzso zzso zzso cells of the line zzso cells were zzso with 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso or without zzso zzso zzso at the zzso temperature 19 - 46 degrees zzso Three hours later cellular zzso IX zzso level was determined by high performance liquid zzso with fluorescent zzso zzso scanning zzso zzso was used to observe the fluorescent strength in the zzso zzso The ratio of cell death (including necrosis and zzso was detected with flow zzso before and after zzso zzso 

In Group A the zzso level at the temperature of 19 degrees C was zzso zzso zzso zzso and raised to zzso zzso zzso zzso at 46 degrees zzso There was no cellular zzso detected in Group B at any zzso Before laser radiation the cell death ratios of both groups were the same at the temperature 19 - 37 degrees C, and at the temperature 37 - 46 degrees zzso After laser radiation the cell death ratio of Group A raised from zzso to zzso as the temperature went up zzso but the results of Group B showed the same curve as before laser zzso At any same temperatures the cell death ratios of Group A were all significantly higher than those of Group B (all P zzso zzso and as the temperature was elevated the difference between the 2 groups raised from zzso to zzso 

zzso higher temperature enhances the zzso production and zzso reaction in human zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso in zzso
