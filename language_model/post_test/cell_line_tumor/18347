The majority of patients cannot benefit from the conventional zzso treatments that are currently used for zzso zzso zzso which remains a world health zzso zzso zzso is one of the most potent zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to examine the zzso effect and toxicity of zzso delivery of zzso using an ex zzso gene therapy approach in a zzso model of zzso 

zzso zzso or zzso zzso tumor cells were genetically modified in zzso to express zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coding for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was generated using direct zzso zzso of the tumor cell line into the left liver lobe of zzso zzso 

zzso liver expression of zzso by the injected genetically modified tumor cells induced a marked zzso of tumor zzso This effect was associated with an early zzso of zzso and zzso forming numerous zzso zzso There was no significant liver zzso as shown by normal zzso liver zzso At a later time, the zzso zzso were rare and consisted mainly of zzso T cells, while zzso T cells were present in the zzso zzso expression of zzso did not modify circulating or zzso B zzso or natural killer zzso zzso The zzso of tumor growth was maintained in nude mice even when depleted in zzso zzso zzso in a second model, treatment of established day 7 liver tumors in zzso mice using direct zzso injection of zzso zzso that were genetically modified to express zzso significantly reduced tumor zzso 

In conclusion, these data provide evidence that experimental zzso can be efficiently and safely treated using ex zzso zzso gene therapy, which seems promising for future clinical zzso
