zzso brain tumors present significant challenges for surgical zzso because of their location and the frequent occurrence of zzso projections extending beyond the primary zzso zzso of the tumor margins during surgery is critical for a favorable zzso We report the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso as a targeted imaging agent for brain tumors in a spontaneous mouse model of zzso zzso zzso and functionality of the targeted agent were confirmed in zzso zzso zzso were detected by magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso zzso administered to individual animals for optical imaging at zzso zzso The integrity of the zzso barrier zzso was measured by Evan's Blue zzso prior to zzso zzso show that zzso zzso zzso specifically targeted tumor zzso The zzso of Evan's Blue was observed in all tumors, suggesting that the presence of the tumors can introduce zzso in the zzso of the zzso Because increased vascular zzso was observed early in the disease model, larger zzso imaging agents that exceed current zzso size restrictions may warrant renewed consideration as candidates for tumor detection and surgical zzso Our study provides data characterizing in zzso and in zzso use of zzso zzso zzso as a broadly zzso tumor imaging zzso
