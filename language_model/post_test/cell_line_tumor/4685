The natural zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to exhibit a variety of zzso effects including zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we investigated the zzso effect with an in zzso zzso model using zzso immortalized zzso zzso zzso cells, a newly established cell line originating from the zzso duct of a transgenic rat expressing the zzso zzso large zzso zzso but not zzso exhibited a zzso zzso of the formation of zzso tubes by zzso cells without affecting cell viability and zzso to zzso To address the molecular mechanisms involved, we performed experiments with specific zzso against putative targets of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso While the zzso inhibitor VI and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had no effect, both the zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso shortened the tubes by approximately zzso Western zzso analysis and gelatin zzso revealed that zzso but not zzso has an zzso effect on the zzso of zzso and zzso activity of zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso exerts its zzso effect on zzso partly through zzso and zzso
