To investigate the effect of zzso zzso zzso gamma on cell cycle and zzso in zzso and in zzso In zzso we first constructed zzso zzso of zzso and then zzso zzso into zzso cell zzso We confirmed the zzso efficiency by Western zzso zzso we observed cell growth, cycle and colony zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso and zzso related signal zzso zzso was zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso we successfully established transplantation tumor nude mice zzso We determined zzso zzso level in the transplantation tumor zzso Then, zzso was used to determine cell cycle, zzso and zzso Finally, we employed zzso to determine zzso positive zzso However, the cells zzso with zzso grew more rapidly compared with zzso zzso Increased cells were observed in zzso phase and S phase in the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression level in the zzso cells was higher than that in zzso zzso In zzso we observed the similar phenomenon including more rapid tumor growth, higher zzso zzso zzso decreased cells number in zzso phase and zzso phase, increased cells in S phase and decreased zzso in the zzso zzso In the study of related zzso we also found related molecules zzso and zzso positive expression rate were obviously lower than zzso zzso In present study, we found zzso of zzso cell zzso with zzso was zzso which might be realized via zzso promoting cell growth, zzso cell zzso degrading zzso and suppressing zzso of zzso suggesting zzso promoting tumor growth is a process involving multiple factor zzso
