zzso zzso or zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso gene that is essential for normal zzso development and immune responses in zzso During zzso zzso zzso protein levels dramatically increase independently of zzso levels, suggesting that the stability of zzso is zzso We used a fluorescent zzso reporter system to analyze protein stability in response to genetic and zzso zzso and show that, while zzso degradation is zzso zzso it does not require zzso of zzso Furthermore, degradation of zzso in B cells appears to be largely independent of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose a novel mechanism of zzso turnover in B cells, zzso an zzso region in the C zzso of zzso regulates the activity of zzso signals elsewhere in the zzso Changes that make the C zzso more zzso including zzso zzso zzso stabilize the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that B cells may regulate zzso stability and activity via signaling zzso Finally, we show that expressing a stable zzso zzso in B cells suppresses cell proliferation and zzso changes in surface marker expression commonly seen during zzso zzso
