Growing evidence shows an association between chronic liver inflammation and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is associated with inflammation and cellular zzso is zzso activated in human zzso zzso but not in normal human liver zzso Although zzso zzso is elevated in the serum of patients with zzso it is not fully understood whether zzso zzso zzso is positively correlated with zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso Here, we reported that in zzso cells, the elevated levels of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso not zzso alone, correlated with zzso zzso We also explored whether the zzso effects of zzso an zzso drug, may be due to the zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso decreased zzso zzso by reducing zzso zzso zzso zzso and caused zzso in zzso zzso zzso could also block zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso Moreover, we observed more significant zzso of cell viability when zzso was combined with zzso or zzso We conclude that the elevated levels of zzso may be correlated with zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso may be a candidate for zzso therapy through blocking zzso zzso and can be combined with other zzso drugs to reduce drug resistance caused by zzso zzso
