Although there is effective chemotherapy for many patients with zzso zzso of children and up to zzso of adults zzso Novel therapies are needed to treat these zzso zzso cells are very sensitive to the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso which enhances the in zzso zzso effects of zzso and zzso in multiple zzso To determine if zzso enhances the zzso of agents used in zzso we employed an in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to evaluate the zzso effects of zzso alone and in combination with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A, and the zzso inhibitor zzso We demonstrated that primary leukemia zzso and leukemia cell lines are sensitive to zzso with an average zzso of 12 zzso zzso and quantitative zzso interactions were evaluated using the universal response surface approach zzso zzso was synergistic with zzso in zzso leukemia cells, and additive with zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso activity of zzso was also additive with zzso and zzso and additive or synergistic with zzso zzso These results were compared to analysis using the zzso effect method, which generated complex drug interactions due to differences in zzso curve zzso These data suggest zzso could zzso the zzso effects of combination chemotherapy in patients with zzso
