Mechanical stresses release zzso from a variety of cells by a poorly defined zzso Using zzso zzso chambers, we investigated the zzso of cell zzso zzso zzso cell volume and zzso calcium changes in zzso zzso and zzso cells, and zzso zzso Fifty per cent zzso shock triggered transient zzso release from cell zzso zzso which consistently peaked at around 1 zzso 45 s for zzso and zzso and at 3 zzso for zzso cells, then declined to baseline within the next 15 zzso Whereas the release time course had a similar pattern for the three cell types, the peak rates differed significantly zzso zzso 67, 70 zzso 22 and 17 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso volume changes of zzso cells were zzso by a zzso cell shape reconstruction method based on images acquired from two perpendicular zzso The three cell types swelled at a similar rate, reaching zzso expansion in 1 zzso 45 zzso but differed in the duration of the volume plateau and regulatory volume decrease zzso These experiments revealed that zzso release does not correlate with either cell volume expansion and the expected zzso of zzso channels, or with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channels during zzso By contrast, zzso release was tightly zzso in all three cell types, with zzso calcium zzso Furthermore, loading zzso cells with the calcium zzso zzso significantly diminished zzso release zzso zzso of the peak zzso while the calcium zzso zzso triggered zzso release in the absence of cell zzso zzso the temperature to 10 degrees C almost completely abolished zzso cell zzso zzso release zzso zzso of the peak zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso zzso plays a major role in zzso zzso zzso
