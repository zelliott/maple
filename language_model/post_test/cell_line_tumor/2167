To better understand the response of zzso to zzso zzso we analyzed factors connected to the resistance of zzso cells against zzso Sensitive zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso but lacked zzso zzso in zzso Interestingly, expression of zzso was restricted to resistant cell lines, whereas zzso and zzso showed no association with zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso expression in zzso cells decreased zzso sensitivity, increased zzso zzso and reduced the expression of inflammatory zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso cells increased zzso These findings suggest zzso as a novel player in resistance against zzso zzso
