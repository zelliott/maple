zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso a member of the zzso family, has been implicated in zzso of various human zzso Although decreased expression of the zzso zzso zzso a close zzso relative, is associated with prostate cancer zzso zzso expression has not been analyzed in this zzso 

zzso expression in human zzso zzso was analyzed by zzso on 167 primary tumors and 88 zzso zzso or bone zzso zzso zzso was zzso from two human prostate cancer cell lines, zzso zzso high-grade zzso zzso zzso zzso and normal zzso zzso 

Although zzso was detected in the zzso of normal zzso zzso reduced or loss of zzso expression within zzso cells was observed in zzso of 107 clinically localized primary zzso zzso of 60 clinically advanced primary zzso zzso of 65 zzso zzso zzso and zzso of 23 bone zzso zzso in zzso expression between clinically localized and advanced diseases was highly significant zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso Whereas there was no zzso of zzso zzso in normal zzso all zzso cell lines, one zzso and four zzso zzso zzso deletions in their zzso zzso zzso zzso point zzso were also found in zzso cells, one zzso and seven zzso zzso 

zzso expression is significantly reduced and even lost during prostate cancer zzso Moreover, deletions and zzso of the zzso zzso may be associated with loss of protein expression observed in tumor zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso may play an important role in prostate cancer zzso
