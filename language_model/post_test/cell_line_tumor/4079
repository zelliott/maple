To investigate the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso cell cycle, migration and invasion of zzso breast cancer zzso 

zzso expression zzso zzso and empty zzso zzso were respectively zzso into zzso zzso The expression of zzso gene was tested by real-time quantitative zzso zzso and Western zzso After stained respectively by zzso zzso and zzso the zzso and cell cycle in the zzso cells zzso zzso were detected by flow zzso The abilities of invasion and migration in the zzso cells with zzso zzso were respectively determined by zzso and scratch wound healing zzso 

In zzso and protein levels, the expression of zzso was higher in zzso zzso group than in negative control group and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso cells enhanced cell zzso reduced the cell number of zzso phase and increased the cell number of S zzso The abilities of invasion and migration in the zzso cells were inhibited zzso 

zzso of zzso in the zzso cells promotes zzso regulates zzso checkpoint and zzso the abilities of invasion and zzso
