zzso stress is generated by zzso oxygen species zzso including hydrogen zzso zzso zzso radical zzso ) and zzso zzso zzso which are produced as zzso of cellular zzso An imbalance in cellular zzso status is a potent zzso factor that contributes to various chronic inflammatory zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso protein A, B and zzso zzso level, and increases zzso zzso level in human pulmonary lung zzso zzso The decreased zzso level of zzso and zzso were significant with a maximum zzso of 79 and zzso respectively by 150 zzso zzso zzso 24 zzso of zzso In addition, zzso zzso level was decreased with a maximum zzso of zzso by 150 zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso of zzso In contrast, 150 zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso level to increase to zzso of control after 8 zzso of zzso The zzso gene repression or zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was blocked by zzso with the antioxidants zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso and zzso was associated with reduced zzso zzso factor zzso zzso DNA binding activity, and this reduced zzso binding activity may be due to decreased zzso protein expression zzso The analyses of signal zzso pathways that may play a role in the regulation of gene expression by zzso zzso several specific zzso showed that zzso an inhibitor of zzso upstream zzso zzso blocked both zzso zzso of zzso and zzso gene zzso whereas zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso partially blocked zzso zzso of zzso gene expression but not zzso zzso In contrast, zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso pathway, blocked zzso zzso of zzso gene expression but not zzso zzso zzso analyses using specific zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso by zzso stress suggesting that zzso zzso of zzso and zzso gene expression is associated with zzso and zzso signaling zzso These data, therefore, suggest that zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene regulation by reducing zzso DNA binding activity via zzso or zzso signaling zzso
