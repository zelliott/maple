zzso zzso zzso is a zzso agent of acute zzso syndrome in horses, commonly known as Potomac horse zzso Korean isolate of zzso zzso zzso was cultivated in mouse zzso cell line zzso A complete zzso of zzso zzso protein gene was amplified and cloned into zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso clones were named as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was expressed in zzso coli zzso and zzso cell line zzso The zzso protein showed zzso with zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso mice were zzso with zzso zzso DNA zzso The serum samples collected from these zzso mice showed zzso zzso zzso of zzso In a Western zzso zzso these serum samples showed a strong zzso to zzso expressed in zzso cell line zzso with zzso The results of this preliminary indicate that zzso zzso zzso protein is an zzso zzso and may be a good target for the development of zzso or a molecular diagnostic test and possibly an improved zzso DNA based vaccine against Potomac horse zzso
