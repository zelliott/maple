zzso of an zzso zzso can knock out a targeted gene by producing DNA strand breaks within its zzso For delivery of zzso zzso to zzso targets we used zzso zzso zzso that bind specifically to their target sequences by forming hydrogen bonds within the major groove of the target zzso We named this approach zzso zzso In our previous studies, we demonstrated that zzso zzso targeted against the human zzso gene produced zzso double strand breaks zzso within this gene in live cultured zzso We also found that zzso of zzso with nuclear zzso signal zzso significantly increased the efficiency of zzso To screen the wide variety of possible zzso modifications a sensitive and robust zzso of DNA damage produced by such zzso would be highly zzso Recently we showed a direct correspondence between the number of zzso of zzso incorporated into DNA as zzso and the number of zzso zzso zzso per cell revealed by zzso with zzso zzso The technique is zzso more sensitive than other zzso methods, thus it is possible to detect as few as an average of zzso zzso per cell in a population of cultured zzso Here we applied this method to evaluate the zzso DNA damage produced by two zzso the first targeted to the zzso zzso gene zzso and second to a zzso repeated sequence zzso that occurs almost zzso times in the human zzso zzso DNA damage produced by zzso was assessed by zzso the cells with zzso zzso followed by either direct counting zzso zzso or by measuring the zzso signal using flow zzso Both methods produced zzso close results; zzso with multiple nuclear targets produced on average zzso times more zzso zzso per cell and generated zzso times increase in zzso zzso zzso signal than zzso with a single zzso The zzso zzso requires considerably less time and effort than the direct measurement of zzso by Southern zzso applied zzso zzso we believe that zzso measurement of DNA damage could be useful for evaluation and cellular DNA accessibility by zzso DNA targeting zzso
