zzso is an zzso zzso which is zzso in most human tumors and involved in zzso checkpoint zzso Recent evidence points to an essential role for heat shock protein 90 zzso in zzso function zzso Although the zzso association may promote tumor cell zzso it may also suggest new opportunities for the design of novel zzso zzso We evaluated the effect of small interfering zzso zzso zzso of zzso on the zzso potential of prostate cancer cells and their sensitivity to the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso Human zzso prostate cancer cell lines zzso and zzso were zzso with four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against different portions of zzso zzso After zzso cells were collected and analyzed for zzso zzso and protein zzso cell proliferation rate, ability to undergo zzso and sensitivity to zzso zzso of prostate cancer cells with zzso induced a variable extent of zzso of zzso zzso expression zzso compared with zzso which was paralleled by a 38% to zzso reduction in zzso protein zzso The three zzso able to induce the greatest zzso of zzso expression also significantly reduced cell proliferation and enhanced the rate of zzso with a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso treatment with zzso and zzso induced zzso zzso effects in all cell lines, with an enhanced zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that combined strategies aimed at interfering with the zzso connection may provide novel approaches for treatment of zzso prostate zzso
