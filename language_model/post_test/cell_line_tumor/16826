To study zzso zzso cell lung cancer cell line zzso zzso and the molecular mechanism for zzso its cycle arrest zzso zzso 

zzso zzso showed that zzso had obvious zzso effect on zzso and indicated the half zzso ratio zzso Cell cycle and zzso were detected by zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso double zzso and flow zzso Western zzso zzso revealed changes in cycle and zzso proteins induced by zzso zzso molecular mechanism was suggested by Western zzso and zzso 

zzso had an obvious growth zzso effect on zzso cells, with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso at 48 zzso zzso zzso showed zzso cells mainly arrested in zzso stage after being treated by zzso with low expressions in zzso A, zzso and zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso and zzso zzso double zzso showed that the zzso treatment group showed a significant zzso rate than the zzso zzso Western zzso found zzso can increase zzso of zzso and decrease that of zzso zzso zzso results revealed zzso can inhibit zzso zzso from nuclear zzso as a zzso factor and thus promoting cell zzso 

zzso can obviously induce zzso of human zzso cell lung cancer cell zzso possibly by increasing zzso of zzso to activate zzso zzso pathway, while zzso zzso from nuclear zzso as a zzso zzso
