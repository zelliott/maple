The stress protein zzso is a highly zzso multifunctional, zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso known to intervene in the dosage compensation complex zzso In this work, we show that both zzso and zzso proteins were recruited and formed a complex into the nucleus in response to zzso which was essential for cell survival in reply to zzso zzso We studied the interaction of zzso and zzso and their binding affinities to DNA by zzso and zzso zzso The zzso bound to zzso with a moderate affinity zzso zzso in an zzso zzso zzso did not bind to zzso DNA, but it bound to zzso with a moderate affinity zzso zzso also in an zzso zzso The zzso protein bound to zzso with a slightly larger affinity zzso zzso but in an zzso zzso zzso showed different interacting regions in the formed complexes with zzso or zzso however, they were always zzso zzso as shown by zzso These results underline a zzso description of the functionality of the zzso and its other interacting zzso
