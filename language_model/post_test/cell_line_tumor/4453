zzso zzso have been identified as tumor zzso or zzso a distinction that appears to be dependent on the type and stage of zzso However, the role of zzso in melanoma zzso and their status during cancer onset and progression remain controversial and zzso Here, we show that the aggressive zzso mouse melanoma cell line expresses low zzso levels of zzso and zzso rendering them gap zzso zzso zzso as zzso by zzso Western zzso and dye transfer zzso Following zzso expression of green fluorescent zzso zzso and zzso in these zzso zzso zzso gap zzso plaques were evident at sites of zzso zzso and the zzso of dye transfer was significantly increased similar to zzso zzso We found that the expression of zzso but not zzso significantly reduced cellular proliferation and zzso growth from control zzso whereas migration was zzso Additionally, zzso expressing zzso displayed significantly reduced growth within the in zzso zzso of zzso despite a lack of zzso gap zzso zzso communication between the two cell zzso Furthermore, when grown in zzso in the chicken zzso zzso primary tumors derived from zzso zzso were significantly smaller than controls, whereas zzso zzso produced tumors similar to zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso and not zzso can act as a tumor zzso during melanoma zzso
