The zzso zzso protein of 70 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso play critical roles in regulating zzso signal zzso They not only share some overlapped functions but also may play unique roles in regulating the function and development of T zzso However, it is not known whether they have different effects on the zzso and zzso cell death of T zzso To address this question, we generated zzso zzso zzso molecules that a zzso zzso zzso was directly linked to truncated zzso zzso or zzso zzso molecules lacking the two zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso of these molecules into zzso cells restored their zzso zzso In addition, zzso and zzso zzso but not control cells demonstrated zzso activities in zzso an zzso zzso specific for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso activated through zzso underwent a faster time course of zzso and had a greater percentage of zzso cells than that of zzso and control zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression 3- and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso interaction could inhibit the zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, although activated zzso zzso could increase zzso zzso their zzso expression actually decreased and the percentage of zzso cells did not zzso Further studies of the mechanisms revealed that zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso resulted in rapid zzso of zzso and zzso that could also be inhibited by blocking zzso zzso These results demonstrated that zzso and zzso play distinct roles in T cell zzso and zzso cell zzso
