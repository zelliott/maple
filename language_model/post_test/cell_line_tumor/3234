To study the expression and significance of zzso zzso factor zzso receptors in human prostate zzso 

SP zzso method was employed to investigate the expression of alpha zzso of zzso receptors in 48 cases of primary prostate cancer, 20 benign prostate zzso samples and four kinds of cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

The total positive percentage of zzso expression in prostate cancer was zzso The positive percentages in the groups with zzso score zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso The four kinds of cancer cell lines had prominent zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso 

It suggests that both zzso and zzso prostate zzso are responsive to zzso and the extensive expression of zzso receptors is an important characteristic of prostate zzso
