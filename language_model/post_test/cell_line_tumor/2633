Human zzso zzso and zzso cells are widely used to detect zzso in zzso zzso cells have zzso zzso zzso while zzso cells have one zzso of zzso zzso Both cells were treated with zzso zzso and gene zzso zzso and zzso zzso were performed to clarify the differential response related to the zzso gene zzso The effects of zzso on gene expression were assessed by zzso and quantitative zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso increased the frequency of cells with zzso and zzso In zzso cells, frequency of cells with zzso was increased but the zzso frequency was zzso The zzso induced by zzso was more prominent in zzso cells than in zzso zzso Analysis of gene expression showed that the genes involved in the zzso zzso were zzso in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso The differential responses to zzso between these cell lines appeared to be due to the difference in the zzso gene status, thus providing a molecular basis for the zzso using these cell lines in the zzso zzso Our results indicate that the clinical efficacy of zzso chemotherapy may depend on the zzso zzso
