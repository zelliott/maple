A growing body of zzso data on human zzso poses the critical question of how zzso variations translate to cancer zzso We used standardized shotgun zzso and targeted protein zzso platforms to analyze a panel of 10 colon cancer cell lines differing by zzso in DNA mismatch repair zzso zzso In addition, we performed zzso sequencing zzso to enable detection of protein sequence zzso from the zzso zzso zzso replicate cultures yielded highly consistent zzso inventories with a cumulative total of zzso protein groups with a protein false discovery rate of zzso across all cell zzso Networks of zzso proteins with differential expression based on zzso status revealed impact on protein zzso turnover and zzso on cellular metabolism and on DNA and zzso synthesis and zzso Analysis of zzso zzso acid sequences suggested higher stability of proteins affected by naturally occurring zzso zzso than of proteins affected by zzso protein sequence zzso The data provide evidence for zzso adaptation to zzso zzso with a stress response that targets zzso proteins for degradation through the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested zzso transition in zzso cells, as evidenced by increased mobility and invasion properties compared with zzso The observed zzso profiles demonstrate previously unknown consequences of altered DNA repair and provide an expanded basis for zzso interpretation of zzso zzso
