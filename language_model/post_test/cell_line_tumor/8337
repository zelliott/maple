Suicide gene therapy with zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is notable for producing zzso zzso in a unique pattern of delayed zzso in zzso As zzso a zzso zzso inhibitor that activates mismatch repair, can increase sensitivity to zzso we evaluated the role of zzso an essential mismatch repair zzso in zzso zzso Using zzso zzso colon zzso cells that express or lack zzso zzso studies demonstrated greater zzso sensitivity in the zzso cells, primarily at high zzso This could not be explained by differences in zzso zzso as the less sensitive zzso cells accumulated more zzso zzso and incorporated more of the analog into zzso zzso suppression of zzso in zzso zzso or zzso colon zzso cells also enhanced sensitivity to high zzso of zzso Studies in a zzso zzso of zzso deletion zzso confirmed the results with zzso and further suggested a role for zzso zzso repair and several zzso checkpoint proteins in zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso can prevent zzso with zzso zzso mismatch zzso tumors may increase efficacy of this suicide gene therapy approach to cancer zzso
