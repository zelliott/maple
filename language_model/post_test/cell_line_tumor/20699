To compare the expression of nuclear zzso proteins zzso in benign zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso versus those in zzso human prostate cancer cell line zzso and zzso prostate cancer cell line zzso 

We isolated zzso from the zzso zzso and zzso cell lines by zzso zzso zzso analyzed the zzso expressed proteins by zzso laser zzso zzso zzso time of flight mass zzso zzso and identified them by zzso mass fingerprint and database zzso 

We successfully obtained zzso zzso zzso patterns of zzso in human prostate cancer cell lines, identified 12 zzso expressed zzso including zzso regulatory zzso zzso protein and various other factors, 3 zzso and 9 zzso in prostate cancer cell zzso 

There are obvious differences in the expressions of zzso between human prostate cancer cell lines and benign zzso zzso zzso cell zzso
