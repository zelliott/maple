zzso zzso zzso is one of the major zzso worldwide and is associated with poor prognosis due to the high zzso of zzso and tumor zzso Our previous study showed that zzso of zzso protein zzso 1 zzso is frequently observed in zzso and is associated with a more aggressive tumor behavior, suggesting that zzso is a potential therapeutic target in zzso In the current study, an zzso small zzso zzso zzso zzso was evaluated for the potential in suppressing zzso zzso with other reports, zzso of zzso activity was observed in several human zzso cell lines treated with various zzso of zzso Using cell zzso colony formation and zzso incorporation zzso we demonstrated that zzso treatment significantly inhibited the growth of zzso zzso The mechanisms through which zzso treatment suppresses zzso cell growth are enhancement of zzso and zzso of zzso of zzso Furthermore, our data suggested that zzso not only zzso the zzso cell growth, but also suppresses the zzso potential of zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso treatment significantly reduced the tumor growth rate and decreased tumor volume, indicating that zzso can suppress the in zzso tumor growth of zzso zzso Taken together, our demonstration of the potential zzso efficacy of zzso in zzso provides the rationale for cancer zzso
