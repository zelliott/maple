zzso data indicates increased risk of infant acute leukemia involving zzso gene aberrations with use of oral zzso To determine whether zzso might be zzso we examined the effect of zzso zzso or zzso in an in zzso model of zzso zzso zzso DNA from the zzso human zzso cell line was screened by zzso zzso zzso and inverse zzso at a zzso hot spot within the zzso zzso cluster region to detect DNA zzso An increase in DNA double strand breaks was observed within this region after exposure to either zzso or zzso An increase in the frequency of zzso zzso was only found after exposure to zzso zzso of zzso due to increased zzso of zzso zzso was excluded by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso of zzso and zzso that may occur during pregnancy, or during use of oral zzso can cause aberrations of the zzso gene and could thus be a factor in the early events of zzso occurring in zzso
