zzso disease zzso is zzso characterized by the formation of senile plaques from zzso zzso and zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso Although there is growing evidence for the zzso role of soluble zzso species in zzso the major question of how zzso zzso zzso of zzso remains zzso To address this question, we here developed a novel cell zzso system to assess the effect of zzso zzso at zzso relevant levels naturally zzso from donor cells on the zzso of zzso in recipient zzso Using this zzso we demonstrated that zzso relevant levels of zzso zzso are sufficient to cause zzso of zzso in recipient zzso cells expressing human zzso and in primary culture zzso This zzso of zzso is inhibited by blocking zzso production in donor zzso The expression of familial zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that induce the production of zzso zzso in donor cells results in a similar zzso of zzso in recipient zzso The mechanism underlying the zzso zzso zzso is zzso by the impaired insulin signal zzso because we demonstrated that the zzso of zzso and zzso upon insulin stimulation is less activated under this zzso Treating cells with the zzso drug zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso These findings suggest that the disturbed insulin signaling cascade may be implicated in the pathways through which soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso and further support the notion that correcting insulin signal zzso in zzso may offer a potential therapeutic zzso
