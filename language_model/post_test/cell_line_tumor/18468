How nuclear receptors zzso coordinate the zzso zzso recruitment of multiple zzso complexes zzso zzso complexes and zzso that share similar zzso binding zzso is zzso We show that although the zzso binding zzso of these complexes zzso zzso and zzso zzso share overlapping binding sites on zzso zzso alpha zzso information contained in the zzso interface allows the zzso to distinguish between zzso In support of this conclusion, we have identified an zzso zzso point zzso zzso that selectively binds and recruits zzso but not zzso both in zzso and in zzso In cells expressing this zzso the recruitment of zzso to the zzso promoter is delayed, and the expression of the vast majority of zzso target genes is impaired, suggesting a nearly global functional zzso of these zzso zzso our results suggest that zzso zzso rather than competition, drives the sequential recruitment of zzso complexes and zzso by zzso
