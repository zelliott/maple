In this study, the total toxic effects of river water samples were assessed using a series of cell culture zzso which zzso different mechanisms, based on specific modes of zzso River water samples were collected from three tributaries of the zzso River in the western portion of zzso We confirmed that zzso River water was zzso with a complex mixture of zzso and zzso zzso The total toxic effects of the downstream water samples were found to be higher than that of the upstream water zzso In the upstream water samples, total zzso activity was measured to be between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and no zzso activity was zzso In the downstream water samples, however, total zzso activity was measured to be between zzso zzso and zzso zzso and total zzso activity was between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso When assessed according to a zzso curve, downstream water sample extracts exerted dual actions on zzso zzso depending on the concentration volume of the zzso The concentration volume range zzso to the original water sample exhibited zzso activity, whereas zzso activity was observed at high concentration volumes (more than 5 times zzso in the zzso This study involved a combination of in zzso zzso designed to zzso different zzso The zzso used included the zzso zzso binding affinity test, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These tests provided a great deal of useful information regarding the potency and action modes of zzso and zzso inherent in the sampled river zzso Although further study is necessary to determine the relationship between toxic responses in in zzso zzso systems and chronic toxicity in aquatic organisms, our approach is expected to be fairly accurate with regard to the detection of zzso effects in an aquatic zzso
