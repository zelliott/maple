The advent of zzso laser sources has enabled the zzso of compact and zzso zzso zzso depletion zzso zzso for imaging far below the zzso zzso Here we report on an enhanced version of this approach displaying an zzso based resolution down to (19 zzso 3) zzso in the focal zzso zzso this single objective lens system can be configured for zzso imaging with resolution down to 45 zzso 45 zzso 108 zzso in a zzso The obtained results can be further improved by mathematical restoration zzso The zzso optical zzso resolution is attained in a variety of biological samples featuring strong variations in the local density of zzso
