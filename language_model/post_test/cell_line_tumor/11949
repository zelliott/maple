Technologies that mediate targeted delivery of small interfering zzso zzso are needed to improve their therapeutic efficacy and zzso zzso we have developed zzso zzso zzso capable of cell zzso binding and delivery of functional zzso into zzso The zzso portion of the zzso mediates binding to zzso a zzso zzso zzso in prostate cancer cells and tumor vascular zzso whereas the zzso portion targets the expression of survival zzso When applied to cells expressing zzso these zzso are zzso and processed by zzso resulting in depletion of the zzso target proteins and cell zzso In contrast, the zzso do not bind to or function in cells that do not express zzso These zzso also specifically inhibit tumor growth and mediate tumor zzso in a zzso model of prostate zzso These studies demonstrate an approach for targeted delivery of zzso with numerous potential applications, including cancer zzso
