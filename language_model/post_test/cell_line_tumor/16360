zzso oral zzso cell zzso is considered a highly invasive cancer that carries a high level of zzso Despite aggressive surgery, patients often succumb to disease, the zzso having inherent zzso to radiation and zzso In this study we sought to identify cells within the zzso zzso line that have stem cell properties, including inherent resistance zzso When zzso cells were subjected to harsh growth conditions, they formed sphere colonies consistent with a stem cell zzso zzso zzso we were able to identify a small fraction of cells within the population that had enhanced zzso ability, reduced sensitivity to radiation and conventional chemotherapy and demonstrated resistance to the zzso drug, zzso In addition, long-term culture of zzso zzso cells in zzso caused a change in cell zzso and gene expression reminiscent of an zzso to zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso SCC may be driven by small subset of cancer stem zzso
