zzso an zzso zzso zzso has been proposed as a novel zzso that plays protective roles in the zzso in several models of cellular zzso However, the mechanisms involved in these protective effects in neurodegenerative diseases are poorly zzso The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of zzso on cell injury induced by zzso commonly used in establishing in zzso and in zzso models of Parkinson's disease, in zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso We report that zzso zzso suppressed zzso cellular injury through a reduction of zzso zzso Similar effects were obtained by zzso suggesting a scavenging effect for these zzso However, unlike zzso zzso also prevented zzso nuclear zzso nuclear zzso and zzso membrane potential zzso Furthermore, zzso increase in zzso zzso such as zzso 3 activity, zzso expression and zzso c release, was significantly attenuated with zzso zzso These findings demonstrate zzso preservation with zzso in a zzso model of zzso cell death, and that the zzso action of zzso appears because of suppressing zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of Parkinson's disease by protecting zzso zzso
