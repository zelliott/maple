zzso cancer is the fourth most common cancer zzso Several signaling pathways are involved in gastric cancer development and zzso zzso was recently found to be involved in zzso however, its expression pattern in gastric cancer has not been discovered zzso In the present study, we investigated the expression of zzso in human gastric cancer and its correlation with the expression and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso was highly expressed in human gastric cancer zzso while it was low or zzso expressed in normal gastric zzso The differences in zzso features between different groups were determined using zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels were positively correlated with zzso level in gastric cancer zzso and cell zzso High levels of zzso were correlated with the membrane zzso of zzso and low levels of zzso were correlated with nuclear zzso of zzso in both gastric cancer zzso and cell lines zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso was highly expressed in gastric cancer patients with less advanced zzso zzso zzso levels were correlated with zzso level and zzso zzso
