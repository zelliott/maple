zzso are a zzso mix of cells, some of which exhibit cancer stem zzso characteristics including zzso drug zzso and elevated zzso zzso To determine whether zzso zzso cell zzso zzso contain a zzso of cancer stem zzso cells, we performed zzso dye zzso zzso using four independent cell zzso zzso revealed the presence of a rare, drug zzso stem zzso side population zzso of cells within all cell lines tested zzso zzso These cells resembled previously zzso zzso stem cells, and zzso cell abundance was positively correlated with overall cellular density and individual cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased their relative abundance within the total cell zzso zzso zzso cells also exhibited increased zzso potential in secondary cultures and enhanced zzso in zzso Despite this, zzso cells remained zzso sensitive upon zzso zzso zzso Overall, these findings suggest that the existence of zzso zzso cancer zzso cells may be relatively common, particularly within established zzso Future zzso strategies should therefore consider zzso identification and targeting of this potential stem zzso population with standard treatment zzso
