The present investigations correlate the zzso of the zzso oxygen species zzso generation and the zzso of zzso zzso fibers zzso zzso and zzso with their surface iron, under in zzso controlled conditions, using zzso cells zzso lung zzso cell zzso The zzso surface iron was measured by Atomic zzso zzso the production of zzso was investigated using 2, 7 zzso zzso zzso for zzso assessment, the zzso zzso specific damages were measured, using zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso salt zzso zzso and, the zzso potential of zzso fibers was determined by zzso block zzso zzso zzso In the study, highest amount of zzso was generated by zzso followed by zzso and minimum with zzso In zzso zzso the zzso and zzso decrease in percent cell viability was recorded with all the three zzso zzso zzso being most zzso followed by zzso and then zzso In zzso zzso an increase in the frequency of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells was observed, where zzso was most zzso followed by zzso and zzso the zzso comparison of results depicts a clear trend of zzso potential zzso the zzso generation, suggesting a zzso role of zzso stress in zzso zzso However, zzso contains maximum surface iron zzso followed by zzso zzso and zzso carrying least (as zzso or no iron, the zzso surface iron is maximum in zzso followed by zzso and is minimum in zzso The zzso iron somewhat zzso with the zzso generation capacity of these zzso This shows that the surface iron could be mainly responsible for zzso zzso zzso zzso though it may not be the only factor responsible, other factors like shape and size zzso also play role in zzso zzso zzso
