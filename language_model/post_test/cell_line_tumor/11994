In principle, the technique of gene delivery involves taking complete or parts of genes that can code specific message and delivering them to selected cells in the zzso Such a transfer of zzso DNA into zzso cells has posed major challenges for gene zzso This study shows the zzso of a zzso DNA in zzso zzso zzso zzso of size less than 100 zzso This kind of zzso provides complete protection to the zzso DNA from external zzso environment and generates the hope that the resulting zzso can be developed into a potential zzso for effective gene zzso In order to check this zzso the reporter gene zzso was zzso and in zzso zzso efficiency of this system was found to be nearly zzso compared to the commercially available zzso zzso zzso Further, in zzso zzso studies indicated that this system could be used safely for effective gene zzso
