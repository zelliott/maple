We previously established that exposure of the zzso zzso zzso alpha positive zzso human breast cancer cell line to zzso zzso results in the zzso development of multilayered cellular zzso zzso which is consistent with the in zzso cancer zzso of uncontrolled cellular zzso In this investigation, the interaction between the zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso systems in regard to zzso focus development was zzso We demonstrated that focus development requires the presence of zzso and zzso growth factor I zzso or zzso growth factor II zzso as well as intact zzso and zzso Focus development in zzso cultures, which occurs only after formation of a zzso zzso zzso with zzso regulation of key members of the zzso system such as zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso growth factor binding protein 3 zzso as demonstrated by real-time zzso chain reaction zzso To establish the zzso of an intact zzso system for zzso formation, we generated stable clones from zzso with zzso suppressed by zzso zzso from these studies zzso signaling through the zzso to be an integral requirement for zzso zzso proliferation and focus zzso In zzso these studies establish the interactive roles of zzso and zzso in the zzso development of zzso and will allow subsequent identification of targets for therapeutic intervention in the control and treatment of zzso breast zzso
