zzso zzso a compound isolated from the traditional zzso medicinal herb zzso zzso is an zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso and it zzso zzso in some lines of human tumor zzso We investigated the effect of zzso on three zzso cancer cell lines, two zzso cancer cell lines, and normal human zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso cancer cells were treated with various zzso of zzso and its effect on cell growth, cell cycle, zzso and related zzso was zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso showed that all zzso and zzso cancer cell lines were sensitive to the zzso effect of zzso although normal zzso zzso cells were viable after treatment with the same doses of zzso that induced growth zzso in zzso and zzso cancer zzso zzso analysis indicated that their exposure to zzso decreased the proportion of cells in the S phase and increased the proportion in the zzso zzso of the cell zzso zzso of zzso was confirmed by zzso V zzso of zzso zzso and loss of the zzso potential of zzso This induction occurred in concert with altered expression of genes related to cell growth, zzso zzso and zzso 

These results suggest that the zzso activity of zzso may occur with higher sensitivity of cancer cells compared with normal healthy cells, when using low zzso rising hopes that zzso may become a useful zzso therapy for zzso and zzso zzso
