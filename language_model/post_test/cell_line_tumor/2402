The efficacy of diagnostic ultrasound is explored for the release of zzso agents loaded inside zzso zzso ultrasound energy levels employed in the study were at a frequency of zzso zzso and the highest power intensity which is a function of the pulse repetition zzso Design of zzso was used to formulate the zzso sensitive zzso zzso by varying the zzso ratios and the intensity settings of ultrasound zzso zzso was loaded into the zzso and the release was compared to conventional zzso zzso The zzso released increasing amounts of drug in response to increasing zzso times while the drug release was not significant when the zzso zzso zzso were exposed to ultrasound energy zzso In zzso studies to test the zzso of the zzso showed that the zzso significantly inhibited cell survival of zzso zzso oral cancer cells, as compared to the zzso We zzso that the drug is released due to increased membrane zzso during exposure to ultrasound energy levels, where the zzso composition and energy levels play a key role in determining the efficacy of diagnostic ultrasound energy as a tool for drug zzso
