zzso viruses are being tested as tumor therapy zzso The fundamental premise of this therapy is the selective infection of the tumor cell population with the amplification of the zzso zzso of the virus in the tumor ultimately should lead to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is unlike any other form of cancer therapy as the outcome depends on the dynamics that emerge from the interaction between the virus and tumor cell populations both of which change in zzso We explore these interactions using a model that captures the salient biological features of this system in combination with in zzso zzso Our results show that various therapeutic outcomes are possible ranging from tumor zzso to zzso zzso Data from in zzso studies support these conclusions and validate our modeling zzso Such realistic models can be used to understand experimental zzso explore alternative therapeutic scenarios and develop techniques to zzso zzso
