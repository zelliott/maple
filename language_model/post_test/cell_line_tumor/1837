zzso factor 4 zzso is a zzso protein that plays an important role in the progression of gastric zzso The abnormal zzso of zzso frequently occurs in gastric cancer and has been associated with the promotion of tumor growth, invasion and zzso However, the potential interaction between zzso and zzso during gastric cancer development is zzso In this study, a zzso zzso expression zzso was constructed and zzso to zzso the human gastric cancer cell lines, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso expression levels were measured by quantitative real-time zzso and western zzso zzso Cell zzso colony formation and invasive potential were determined in the zzso gastric cancer zzso The expression of zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso was determined by western zzso zzso The zzso of zzso significantly inhibited the expression of zzso in the zzso gastric cancer zzso The restored expression of zzso suppressed zzso colony formation and inhibited the invasion and zzso properties of zzso gastric cancer zzso Furthermore, the forced expression of zzso in gastric tumor cell lines restored zzso expression and inhibited zzso zzso zzso with the in zzso findings, the enforced expression of the zzso gene in zzso gastric zzso cells by zzso zzso gene transfer effectively suppressed tumor growth in zzso Our results show that zzso zzso zzso expression and regulates the zzso biological behaviors of gastric cancer zzso The zzso of zzso expression may represent a novel therapeutic approach for zzso zzso
