zzso zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso however, biological applications of zzso are limited by its poor zzso and zzso zzso This study aimed at developing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to improve the therapeutic efficacy of zzso 

Cellular viability was measured by zzso zzso The zzso distribution of zzso was studied using an zzso zzso and zzso zzso The expression of zzso proteins was determined using Western zzso and the in zzso activity of zzso zzso was tested in a zzso animal zzso 

zzso zzso enhanced the zzso level of zzso induced sustained suppression of zzso and induced marked cancer cell zzso In addition, zzso zzso tended to accumulate in the zzso zzso zzso and induce pronounced zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso exhibited a prominent zzso effect in zzso 

The zzso zzso of zzso is critical to the promising zzso activity of zzso zzso
