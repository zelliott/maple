zzso is a potent zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The present study aimed at determining whether zzso exerted zzso activity in zzso and in zzso zzso treatment of subcutaneous zzso melanoma with zzso incorporated in a cream base significantly delayed tumor zzso A direct zzso of zzso in zzso melanoma zzso cells and several human tumor cell lineages was observed in zzso with zzso values below 5 zzso The zzso structure of zzso with zzso bridges seemed essential for optimal zzso zzso was equally zzso A zzso activity was suggested, as zzso bound to the cell membrane and zzso zzso zzso was detected zzso At doses causing partial growth of tumor cells, zzso allowed zzso of zzso zzso which increased the zzso zzso The in zzso zzso effect of zzso might also involve a zzso effect on zzso cells because cultured human zzso cells were killed in zzso at a similar concentration zzso This effect represents a novel and potential use for zzso as a topical agent against unsuccessfully treated zzso and zzso skin zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report on the successful topical use of zzso in cancer zzso
