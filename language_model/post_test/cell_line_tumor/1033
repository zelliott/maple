The mechanism and machinery of zzso C virus zzso zzso replication are still poorly zzso Our previous study has shown that zzso zzso synthesis occurs on a zzso raft membrane structure zzso zzso 77 zzso 77 zzso In this study, we further characterized these replication complexes zzso in zzso cells that support active zzso replication of a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that these membrane structures were resistant to zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso at 4 degrees C while zzso by zzso at 4 degrees C or zzso zzso at 37 degrees C, characteristic of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso further demonstrated the association between zzso zzso zzso proteins and zzso zzso zzso The zzso contained both zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso being approximately zzso more abundant than the zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso and zzso proteins were resistant to zzso and zzso zzso respectively, but became sensitive after treatment with the zzso zzso These results suggested that the zzso zzso are protected within zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso containing zzso proteins and viral zzso were capable of zzso zzso synthesis using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins were distributed in both the zzso and the zzso but the majority of the active zzso were detected in the zzso zzso zzso of cellular cholesterol selectively reduced zzso zzso zzso These findings provide further insights into the mechanism of zzso replication in zzso
