In this study we evaluated the rat zzso cell zzso cell line zzso and the human zzso cell line zzso for their suitability as in zzso screening tools for potential interference of zzso with zzso zzso A zzso exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso resulted in complete zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso In zzso cells, PRO and zzso were zzso zzso with apparent zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso and apparent zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso EPO was a competitive inhibitor with an apparent zzso value of zzso In zzso all three compounds showed mixed type zzso zzso with apparent zzso values zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and apparent zzso values zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Exposure for zzso of zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso or zzso induction of zzso activity, respectively, as well as in an increase of several human zzso transcripts with zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso cells, only zzso slightly induced zzso zzso A zzso exposure of zzso cells to zzso zzso resulted in a zzso induction of zzso activity and a slight increase in zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, zzso did not induce zzso activity in zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso cell line contains zzso promoter regions, which are responsive to the respective zzso They play a role in zzso regulation in various zzso such as brain, zzso healthy and diseased zzso and breast tissue and therefore, they may play an important role in tumor zzso development, behavior and zzso The zzso cell line may therefore be a relevant and useful tool in risk assessment of zzso The zzso cell line, although not suitable for studying zzso appears to be a more sensitive cell line for studying zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso
