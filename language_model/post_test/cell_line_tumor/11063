zzso zzso zzso the major zzso used for oral zzso and hormone replacement therapy, has been implicated in increased breast cancer zzso Is this risk due to its zzso or zzso properties? To address this, we assessed the zzso effects of zzso as compared with those of zzso and zzso zzso in human breast cancer zzso 

A new zzso zzso zzso zzso human breast cancer cell line, designated zzso was engineered and zzso zzso zzso using a synthetic zzso zzso as well as zzso gene expression profiling comparing zzso zzso and zzso were performed in cells either lacking or containing zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso cells, zzso was found to be an effective zzso through both zzso zzso zzso in transient zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso signaled through zzso zzso type zzso zzso profiling of zzso zzso zzso genes comparing zzso and zzso suggested that although zzso may be a somewhat more potent zzso than zzso it is zzso similar to zzso To address effects of zzso through zzso zzso expression profiling was performed comparing zzso zzso and zzso using zzso zzso These studies showed extensive gene regulatory overlap between zzso and zzso through zzso zzso and none with zzso Interestingly, there was no difference between pharmacological zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that high-dose therapeutic zzso may be zzso 

Our comparison of the gene regulatory profiles of zzso and zzso suggests that, for zzso hormone replacement therapy, the actions of zzso do not mimic those of zzso zzso zzso zzso the complex pharmacology of zzso not only influences its zzso zzso but it is also possible that the increased breast cancer risk and/or the therapeutic efficacy of zzso in cancer treatment is in part zzso by zzso zzso
