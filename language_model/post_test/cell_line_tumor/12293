To study the effect of zzso I, III and IV on the growth of zzso and zzso the ratio of zzso and zzso image in zzso treated by different dose of zzso I, III and IV was detected by zzso the content change of DNA and the cell cycle in zzso treated by different dose of zzso I, III and IV was detected by flow zzso zzso showed the ratio of zzso in control group was zzso zzso zzso after treated by zzso I , III and IV the zzso intensity of DNA was stronger than zzso and the low dose group was very marked compared with control group zzso zzso zzso the ratio was zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso image showed that the DNA zzso mostly assembles on zzso which was denser and stronger than zzso Sudan I, III and IV accelerated the cell cycle from zzso phase to S and zzso phase, the average content of DNA in zzso phase decreased and in S and zzso phase increased, the index of zzso and SPF zzso Sudan I, III and IV could affect cell cycle and advanced its differentiation and zzso
