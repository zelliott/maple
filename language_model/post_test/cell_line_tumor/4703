The most abundant and biologically active green tea zzso zzso or zzso has been shown to act as a zzso inhibitor and tumor cell death zzso However, zzso is unstable under zzso conditions and has poor zzso Previously, in an attempt to increase the stability of zzso we introduced zzso protections to its zzso zzso groups and showed that this zzso zzso zzso zzso formerly named compound zzso could be converted into zzso under zzso zzso In the current study, we provide evidence that when cultured human breast cancer zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso zzso was not only converted but also zzso accompanied by enhanced levels of zzso zzso growth suppression, and zzso zzso compared with cells treated with natural zzso To investigate the potential use of zzso zzso as a novel zzso that converts to a cellular zzso inhibitor and zzso agent in zzso zzso tumors were induced in nude mice, followed by treatment with zzso zzso or zzso for 31 zzso zzso of this in zzso study showed a significant zzso of breast tumor growth by zzso zzso compared with zzso associated with increased zzso zzso and zzso induction in tumor zzso In conclusion, we have shown that zzso zzso increases the zzso stability, and zzso and zzso activities of zzso in human breast cancer cells and tumors, suggesting its potential use for cancer prevention and zzso
