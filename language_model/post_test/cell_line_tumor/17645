The lack of functionally zzso zzso of zzso in sporadic breast zzso has suggested that other mechanisms, including zzso of gene zzso might be important in zzso zzso We have zzso the control of expression of zzso zzso and the adjacent zzso zzso which lie head-to-head and are separated by less than 300 zzso Our results show that the expression of these two genes is under complex regulation, through a zzso zzso zzso expression is driven by this single promoter, whereas zzso expression is driven by this and one additional promoter, which generate two distinct zzso differing by the alternate use of the first zzso By comparison of zzso zzso in adult zzso zzso and also in the zzso zzso during pregnancy and zzso we show that zzso and zzso expression is zzso regulated in a spatial and zzso manner to produce quite different patterns of zzso even from the same zzso The analysis of the zzso and human zzso region and its control has important implications for the regulation of human and zzso zzso expression and the interpretation of animal models of zzso
