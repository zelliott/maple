Higher soy food intake has been hypothesized to be a major factor explaining the decreased breast cancer risk in Asian countries, compared to those regions of the world consuming predominantly Western-style zzso zzso of soy zzso particularly zzso has received considerable attention as the soy component largely responsible for the protective effects hypothesized to result from soy food zzso However, the impact of adult consumption of soy foods on breast cancer risk in zzso and zzso women is not zzso There are recent zzso reports that consumption of soy foods can most effectively reduce breast cancer risk when consumed early in life during the zzso or adolescent zzso The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso achievable in the plasma following soy food consumption, on proliferation and expression of select genes in the human breast zzso cell zzso Treatment of the zzso immortalized human breast zzso zzso cells with these low zzso of zzso was associated with decreased cell zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the breast tumor zzso gene zzso and zzso of the zzso response genes zzso and zzso In addition, zzso treatment was associated with a significant increase in zzso binding to the zzso factor zzso Taken together, these zzso changes in gene expressions provide insights into potential mechanisms by which this zzso may protect human breast cells against zzso zzso
