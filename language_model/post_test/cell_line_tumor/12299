To design and zzso a novel class of protein zzso zzso zzso featuring the zzso zzso 

First, compounds 1 and 2 were identified using the virtual screening approach in conjunction with binding zzso based on surface zzso zzso zzso 3 regions of compounds 1 and 2 were selected for chemical zzso All compounds were characterized potent zzso activities toward the human lung zzso cell line zzso 

Forty new compounds zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso Six compounds zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to show promising zzso activity against the zzso tumor cell zzso The zzso activity of compound zzso increases approximately 10 times more than that of the original compound zzso 

This study provides a promising new template with potential zzso zzso
