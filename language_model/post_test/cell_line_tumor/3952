zzso is an inhibitor of zzso a family of zzso factors that zzso genes related to zzso Upon inflammatory zzso zzso is rapidly zzso via the zzso zzso While it is very clear that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso upon zzso little is known about the zzso events of zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso a zzso protein (also called zzso plays an essential role in the zzso regulation of zzso turnover after tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso or zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso is essential for its role in zzso zzso Moreover, we found that zzso and zzso two zzso of zzso assist zzso to control the zzso regulation of zzso The zzso protein complex specifically associates with zzso zzso via the interactions between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and between the zzso binding domain of zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, we observed that the zzso regulation of zzso by the zzso complex is important for zzso zzso under zzso
