We identified a novel mechanism of zzso signaling in the zzso proliferation and migration of human urinary zzso cancer zzso zzso treatment showed a significant growth zzso followed by zzso zzso of zzso expression and suppression of zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso Also, zzso treatment induced the zzso of zzso zzso which was inhibited by treatment with zzso a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso function reversed the zzso zzso of cell zzso the increased zzso zzso zzso and the reduction of zzso zzso Moreover, treatment with zzso blocked migration and invasion of zzso zzso This zzso was attributed to decreased expression of zzso which was zzso by zzso of zzso and zzso binding zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment abolished the decreased cell migration and invasion and the zzso of zzso expression via the suppression of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Similar results were observed in another zzso cancer zzso cells treated with zzso Finally, zzso of the zzso gene inhibited the zzso migration and invasion of zzso cancer zzso These data suggest that the zzso of zzso signaling is involved in growth zzso and suppression of the migration and invasion of zzso cancer cells treated with zzso
