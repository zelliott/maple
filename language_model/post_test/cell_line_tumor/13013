The copper zzso for zzso zzso zzso binds to both the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and to the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso processing to produce the zzso zzso zzso deposited in the brains of Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso also interacts directly with zzso to inhibit zzso zzso However, whether zzso affects zzso processing and zzso production is not zzso Here we show that loss of zzso increases zzso production in both zzso knockout zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells and that this involves increased zzso processing at the zzso zzso
