Silver zzso zzso have been used as an zzso and zzso zzso However, there is limited information about zzso zzso zzso this study focused on determining zzso effects of zzso on zzso breast cancer cells and its mechanism of cell zzso zzso we developed a green method for synthesis of zzso using culture zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were characterized by various zzso techniques such as zzso zzso particle size zzso and transmission electron zzso zzso The toxicity was evaluated using cell zzso zzso activity, and zzso zzso zzso breast cancer cells were treated with various zzso of zzso (5 to 25 zzso for 24 zzso We found that zzso inhibited the growth in a zzso manner using zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso against zzso cells through zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso oxygen species zzso generation, eventually leading to induction of zzso which was further confirmed through resulting nuclear zzso The present results showed that zzso might be a potential alternative agent for human breast cancer zzso
