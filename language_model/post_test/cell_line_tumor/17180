We zzso the regulation of human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso focusing on the zzso zzso a promoter region that controls major zzso complex zzso class II expression and zzso in the expression of classical zzso class I zzso It comprises the zzso zzso and Y boxes, bound by zzso zzso and zzso factors, zzso The complex recruits the master control factor zzso The zzso module is zzso in zzso and zzso gene zzso whereas in the zzso promoter, the only zzso boxes are S and zzso zzso zzso zzso performed on zzso positive and negative cell lines, demonstrated the in zzso binding of zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso but not to zzso zzso In B cells from bare zzso syndrome patients lacking zzso or zzso we observed lower zzso levels of zzso and zzso transcripts but did not find any significant decrease in the zzso expression of zzso zzso class zzso In zzso zzso the zzso expression of zzso molecules was zzso zzso and zzso are thus not involved in zzso expression and their importance for the surface expression of zzso zzso class I molecules may vary depending on the cell zzso
