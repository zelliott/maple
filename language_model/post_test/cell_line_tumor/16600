zzso zzso and zzso are critical zzso of the zzso DNA damage response zzso at nuclear zzso Here we show by quantitative imaging zzso that zzso and zzso are similar in total copy number zzso copies per zzso but differ substantially in dynamics at both zzso nuclear bodies in normal cells and DNA repair zzso in zzso radiation zzso zzso The majority of zzso zzso is extremely mobile and under continuous exchange, with only a small fraction zzso remaining immobile at zzso irrespective of zzso zzso By contrast, zzso has a smaller mobile fraction zzso and a larger immobile fraction zzso at nuclear bodies, and becomes more dynamic zzso increase in mobile zzso upon zzso DNA zzso More specifically, the dynamics of zzso is dependent on a minimal zzso region zzso and zzso regulated by its zzso zzso and zzso zzso domain zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso or disruption of zzso interaction, reduced the number of zzso molecules at zzso by zzso but only modestly affected zzso zzso This novel in zzso evidence reveals distinct dynamics of zzso and zzso at different types of nuclear structures, and shows that zzso directly recruits and retains a subset of zzso for DNA zzso
