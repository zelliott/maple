Currently available treatments for patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso with residual or zzso disease after primary surgery have low efficacy zzso In view of the possible role of zzso in the development of zzso zzso we explored whether proliferation of the human zzso zzso cell line, might be curbed by zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells was more abundant than zzso with a ratio of zzso zzso zzso increased DNA synthesis in a dose dependent zzso zzso incorporation was also zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso cell growth as assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso and microscopic analysis of culture zzso zzso zzso specific activity, a marker of the zzso effects of zzso on cell energy zzso was likewise zzso The zzso effect of zzso on zzso incorporation could be blocked by the zzso zzso zzso but not by the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso effect of zzso on these cells is zzso through zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso increased zzso and cell zzso zzso with the zzso agent zzso reversed the growth zzso effect zzso by zzso These results support the hypothesis that zzso are involved in the proliferation of zzso The potent zzso effects zzso by zzso derivatives in the human zzso cell line zzso suggest and that this property may be zzso to design effective zzso zzso
