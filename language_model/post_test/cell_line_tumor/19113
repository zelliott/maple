zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso of various types of human zzso Thus, zzso has been recognized as an important target for the zzso of several human zzso including breast zzso zzso expression is known to be regulated by the zzso zzso factor zzso In an attempt to link the zzso zzso and zzso induction during zzso zzso we have examined the effects of zzso zzso a zzso tumor promoter and a zzso on zzso zzso and zzso expression in the immortalized human breast zzso cell line zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso resulted in transient induction of zzso DNA binding with zzso zzso observed at 30 zzso Increased DNA binding of zzso was accompanied by enhancement of its zzso activity as determined by the zzso reporter gene zzso Under the same experimental conditions, expression of zzso zzso and its protein product peaked at zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatment caused an increase in the production of zzso zzso Treatment of cells with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso resulted in significant suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso expression induced by zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso induction as well as zzso zzso was blocked in zzso cells zzso with dominant negative zzso zzso or zzso zzso These results suggest that both zzso and zzso zzso activates zzso zzso which in turn zzso zzso expression in zzso human zzso zzso zzso
