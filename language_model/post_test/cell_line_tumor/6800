An interesting property of certain peptides presented by major zzso complex zzso molecules is their acquisition of a dual binding mode within the zzso binding zzso Using zzso zzso at zzso A resolution, we show here that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is presented by the zzso human zzso class I zzso zzso in a dual zzso as well, with the middle of the zzso bent toward the floor of the zzso binding groove of the zzso in both binding zzso The zzso of zzso are compared here with those of another zzso zzso zzso that is also displayed in two binding modes by zzso zzso and with that of the viral zzso zzso zzso zzso structural features suggest that the zzso halves of the peptides are crucial in allowing zzso T zzso zzso zzso In addition, an analysis of T cell receptors zzso from zzso or zzso zzso zzso clones demonstrates that zzso from distinct clones but with comparable zzso may share zzso but not zzso zzso zzso the zzso of these zzso depends on zzso is modulated by zzso zzso and is ultimately a consequence of the zzso zzso that characterizes binding of the zzso to zzso These results lend support to the concept that zzso zzso of zzso class zzso peptides might be connected with the occurrence of zzso zzso
