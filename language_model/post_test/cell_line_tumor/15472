To investigate the effects of zzso inhibitor zzso a zzso zzso zzso on the proliferation of multiple myeloma cells in zzso and its molecular mechanism of zzso 

zzso zzso cells were treated with increasing zzso of zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso was measured using a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed on zzso zzso cells treated with zzso zzso zzso for 48 h using flow zzso zzso of zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was determined using Western zzso in zzso zzso cells treated with various zzso of zzso for various time zzso 

zzso inhibited proliferation of zzso zzso cells in a zzso and zzso manner by inducing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso effects were associated with significant reductions in the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso may be a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of multiple zzso
