Although abnormal zzso of zzso zzso is involved in several neurodegenerative diseases, its biological functions remain poorly zzso which limits our understanding of its zzso zzso zzso exhibits zzso activity and promotes the assembly of zzso Since zzso play a pivotal role in zzso cell division, it is possible that zzso affects cell proliferation by zzso zzso zzso The role of zzso in promoting cell proliferation was reported previously in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso Here, we extended this study aiming at finding the association between the cell proliferation effect of zzso and its zzso assembly activity, and identifying the potential active domain for the effect of zzso on cell zzso By exploiting the property that the zzso repeats of zzso molecules are able to mediate a rapid zzso zzso of these proteins across the plasma membrane without being zzso by the cellular zzso system, we added zzso full-length zzso zzso type and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso to the culture medium of zzso zzso cells, and observed their zzso zzso zzso distribution and effects on cell zzso We found that all the zzso molecules could enter the cells where they were localized in both the zzso and zzso However, only the zzso zzso which had been shown to have zzso assembly activity, was able to promote proliferation of the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso which had been proved not to possess zzso assembly activity, did not exhibit any effect on cell zzso Since the zzso activity in zzso assembly was shown to be related to its specific functional domain, we then generated different functional fragments zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and tested their activities in cell zzso We showed that all the zzso fragments could enter the cells, but with different zzso zzso The zzso and zzso fragments were localized in the zzso and the zzso zzso mainly in the zzso In accordance with the activity for the zzso part of zzso in zzso zzso only the zzso and zzso fragments exhibited the activity in cell zzso The zzso zzso without zzso assembly activity did not promote cell zzso The above results suggest that the zzso function in promoting cell proliferation is associated with its zzso assembly activity with the functional domain localized in its zzso zzso
