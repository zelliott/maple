DNA damage zzso the zzso zzso zzso including zzso of zzso zzso resulting in arrest of cell cycle zzso This can protect cells from subsequent zzso zzso Some zzso zzso cancer cells such as zzso and zzso exhibit attenuated zzso zzso induction upon DNA damage due to zzso zzso and are incapable of maintaining arrest upon zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether this attenuated zzso zzso induction also occurred with the zzso damaging agent zzso which zzso zzso by zzso binding to its negative regulator zzso We find that zzso zzso the attenuated induction of zzso zzso protein by increasing its zzso which led to G 1 and G 2 arrest in both cell zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso protein zzso remained short on zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso these cells achieve high zzso zzso levels through zzso zzso zzso all three zzso zzso cells but not zzso zzso zzso cancer cells were protected from subsequent incubation with a combination of DNA damage plus a checkpoint zzso
