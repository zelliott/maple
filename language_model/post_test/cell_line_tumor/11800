zzso is the most common zzso soft tissue tumor in zzso It has been demonstrated that zzso as an activated protein zzso is zzso in zzso cells, which may be correlated with zzso The aim of the present study was to explore the possibility of zzso gene as a therapeutic target for the treatment of zzso and the use of zzso interference in a temporally and zzso restricted manner to study the function of the target gene would be highly zzso To address this problem, a conditional zzso short hairpin zzso targeting human zzso gene was constructed and employed to reduce zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso cell line in zzso The expression of zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso with this zzso zzso could be tracked with the expression of red fluorescent protein by the administration of zzso A stable transgenic zzso line was generated by zzso zzso lines with the packaging viral zzso zzso zzso and western zzso analysis indicated that the zzso and protein levels of zzso in the transgenic zzso cells were significantly lower compared to those in the zzso In addition, the increasing zzso of zzso cells induced by zzso of the zzso gene was also zzso Overall, the results demonstrated that this zzso zzso zzso expression system is an efficient approach to zzso zzso gene expression in the zzso zzso cell line, which could, zzso provide both a protocol to study the role of zzso gene in tumor cells and a safer gene therapy in the zzso
