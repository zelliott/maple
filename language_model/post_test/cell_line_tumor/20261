zzso acid, a zzso zzso zzso increases the expression of cell surface zzso class zzso chain molecules zzso A and B zzso and zzso in zzso cells and decreases their zzso of soluble zzso and zzso which are produced by the zzso zzso of cell surface zzso zzso cells have been reported to produce high levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso In this study, we investigated the involvement of zzso and -9 in the zzso action of zzso acid zzso on the zzso zzso of cell surface zzso using the zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso zzso caused a marked decrease in the expression of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso cells and in the expression of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso cells, but only a slight decrease in the expression of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso of small interfering zzso zzso for zzso decreased the zzso of soluble zzso and zzso by both zzso zzso and zzso cells, but that of zzso for zzso did zzso The present study therefore demonstrates that the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso plays a role in the zzso action of zzso on the zzso of soluble zzso and zzso in zzso zzso
