zzso profiling analyses were used to zzso the functional relevance of zzso proteins in zzso the effect of zzso on the zzso zzso of the pancreatic cancer cell line zzso Despite the presence of one zzso zzso zzso in parental zzso pancreatic cancer cells, zzso signal zzso remained susceptible to stimulation by zzso and zzso To analyze the impact of zzso proteins on the zzso zzso zzso we used zzso cells zzso zzso with a dominant negative zzso zzso or with a zzso active zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso cells led to an expression profile suggestive of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso clone demonstrated that induction of zzso zzso activity by zzso is required for the development of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The expression of the zzso zzso by itself zzso zzso of markers of zzso differentiation and induced zzso of several zzso zzso zzso This effect was not enhanced further by zzso zzso In contrast, transcript levels of genes associated with proliferation and cell cycle progression did not appear to be the primary targets of the zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso The introduction of the dominant negative and the zzso active zzso zzso induced partly overlapping and partly inverse effects on the zzso expression profile of zzso zzso Additional mechanisms such as the induction of zzso zzso and the use of different zzso zzso or zzso zzso signaling pathways may be involved in the interaction between the zzso and the zzso signaling zzso
