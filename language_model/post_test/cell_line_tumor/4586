zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso zzso cells in the first steps of zzso carriage and colonization through bacterial zzso The zzso surface zzso A zzso has previously been reported to play a significant role in zzso adherence and zzso Identification of a zzso for zzso on human zzso will aid in understanding the zzso of this zzso Using zzso zzso zzso bound to fluorescent spheres zzso we show zzso binds to zzso cells through interaction with the human cellular zzso zzso zzso silver stain analysis demonstrates binding of zzso to zzso zzso human zzso binds to and blocks zzso zzso and whole transparent bacteria from adhering to zzso cells, but does not block a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso did not bind to or block zzso zzso adherence to zzso zzso Likewise, if zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso there was a significant decrease zzso zzso in zzso zzso adherence to the zzso Additionally, when using zzso zzso cells, we observed zzso zzso bind more efficiently to cells which express zzso This work identifies zzso as a zzso on human zzso cells for the zzso surface zzso zzso
