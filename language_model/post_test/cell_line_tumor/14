zzso zzso was first described in 2002 as an zzso zzso of unknown zzso We have previously shown the zzso of zzso as a key event in a familial cancer syndrome of the upper zzso zzso 

zzso expression and promoter zzso were investigated in sporadic head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso using a zzso of clinical zzso Additionally, the putative mechanisms of zzso expression in cancer were explored by subjecting zzso cell lines to hypoxic culture conditions and zzso zzso 

In clinically derived zzso samples, zzso zzso expression showed a striking correlation with zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso expression zzso and consistent associations with zzso measures of zzso zzso zzso expression also showed a marked negative correlation with promoter zzso zzso In the zzso cell lines cultured under hypoxic conditions, a trend of increasing expression of both zzso and zzso with progressive zzso was zzso Treatment with zzso dramatically increased zzso expression in those cell lines with greater baseline promoter zzso 

We conclude that the zzso gene is regulated by both promoter zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and that increased expression of this gene zzso with zzso measures of a zzso biological zzso
