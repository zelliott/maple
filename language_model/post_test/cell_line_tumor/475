Recently, zzso has been reported to play an important role in the proliferation of adult zzso zzso zzso cells and might be a target of novel therapy for zzso To develop a novel zzso for ATL, we verified the feasibility of cellular zzso targeting zzso We established an zzso and zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso study using this zzso clone clearly showed that zzso is certainly an zzso protein recognizable by human zzso however, zzso zzso could not lyse ATL zzso Failure of zzso zzso to recognize human zzso leukemia virus type 1 zzso cells might be due to a low level of zzso protein expression in ATL cells and resistance of zzso cells to zzso zzso Although zzso plays an important role in the proliferation of zzso cells, it may also provide a novel mechanism that allows them to evade immune zzso
