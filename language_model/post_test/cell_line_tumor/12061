zzso zzso zzso is a major constituent of zzso Previously, we found that zzso both inhibited proliferation in human gastric cancer cells in zzso and in zzso and induced zzso zzso In this study, we investigated whether this differentiation effect was induced by zzso in human gastric cancer zzso cells, and whether it was related to an zzso in zzso zzso The results showed that the growth of zzso cells was inhibited by zzso zzso treated with zzso displayed a lower zzso ratio and tended to form zzso and zzso conjunction zzso The zzso cell zzso ratio and zzso zzso specific activity zzso In zzso cells, dye transfer was limited to a few cells zzso the zzso cell and to a depth of 1-2 layers beneath the scrape zzso However, after treatment with zzso the zzso zzso zzso was transferred to several cells immediately zzso the zzso cell and to a depth of 2-4 cell layers from the scrape zzso This indicated that zzso induced differentiation in zzso zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that although zzso did not influence the quantity of zzso protein zzso it did decrease its zzso in a zzso manner, compared with the zzso At 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso These results suggested that the zzso differentiation of zzso cells involved an zzso of the zzso signaling zzso
