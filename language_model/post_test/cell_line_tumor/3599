Many studies showed that high expression of zzso E promotes cell zzso but contrary data was also reported that cell proliferation didn't decrease with low expression of zzso zzso In addition, we observed that many tumor cells have strong capability of proliferation with low expression of zzso including zzso zzso This study was to analyze effect of reduced zzso E threshold on proliferation of acute zzso leukemia cell line zzso to explain the above zzso 

We have established the model of decreased zzso E threshold in zzso cells by treating cells with low concentration (5 zzso of caffeine for 2, and 4 zzso The positive rates of proliferation cell nuclear zzso zzso zzso and DNA strand break induction by zzso zzso were analyzed by flow zzso 

zzso cells presented sharply decrease of zzso E zzso and increase of positive rates of zzso zzso and zzso after treated with caffeine, especially at zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso E threshold was accompanied by increase of cell zzso zzso cells may remain high proliferation capability with low level of zzso zzso
