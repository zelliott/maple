zzso zzso and zzso zzso are primary zzso in damp dwellings, and they produce zzso zzso and zzso B1 zzso zzso These zzso and zzso zzso and their precursors and zzso possess a zzso ring, which has proven responsible for their zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the zzso and zzso of zzso A zzso zzso and zzso B zzso B), as the zzso precursors of zzso and zzso and of zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso in human zzso lung cells zzso The zzso values of the tested compounds were obtained by the cell proliferation zzso test as zzso 109 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso and 181 zzso zzso zzso zzso The comet zzso and zzso test were used to assess their zzso potential after 24 h of treatment with zzso corresponding to zzso and zzso zzso in comparison with zzso and zzso applied in zzso corresponding to zzso zzso as previously determined in zzso zzso DNA damage parameters assessed by the comet zzso were tail zzso tail intensity and tail moment, while the level of DNA damage in the zzso test was evaluated by the number of formed zzso zzso nuclear buds zzso and zzso bridges zzso in 1,000 zzso zzso Considering the three comet zzso all applied toxins exerted significant DNA damage compared to the control, while ST and zzso B produced the highest DNA zzso All toxins provoked a statistically significant increase in zzso and a slightly decreased formation of zzso and zzso zzso ST and 20 zzso zzso A showed a statistically significant increase in all three zzso parameters compared to the control, and the highest increase in the number of MN occurred in cells treated with 50 zzso zzso zzso The differences between results obtained by the zzso test and comet zzso could be explained by the fact that the zzso detects irreversible DNA damage, which is usually correlated with the previously determined zzso potential of the zzso zzso
