Studies suggest that consumption of berry zzso including strawberries ( zzso zzso zzso zzso may have beneficial effects against zzso stress zzso diseases such as zzso zzso contain multiple zzso compounds, which are thought to contribute to their biological zzso Comprehensive profiling of zzso from strawberries was previously reported using zzso liquid zzso with mass zzso zzso zzso The current study reports the isolation and structural characterization of 10 zzso compounds from zzso extracts using a combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso The zzso were zzso ( 1), zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso of ( zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso crude extracts and zzso compounds zzso 10 were evaluated for zzso and human cancer cell zzso activities by the zzso equivalent zzso capacity zzso and zzso zzso cell viability zzso zzso Among the pure compounds, the zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso and 4 zzso zzso zzso were the most potent zzso Crude extracts zzso zzso and pure compounds zzso zzso inhibited the growth of human oral zzso zzso colon zzso zzso and prostate zzso zzso cancer cells with different sensitivities observed between cell zzso This study adds to the growing body of data supporting the zzso of berry fruit zzso and their potential impact on human zzso
