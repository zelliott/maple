zzso zzso zzso are of particular interest in biomedical research, and have been exploited for molecular zzso zzso delivery, magnetic resonance imaging, and zzso cancer zzso In the case of cultured cells, magnetic manipulation of zzso provides the means for studying processes induced by zzso or by local zzso of targeted zzso zzso cell surface zzso The latter are normally activated by binding of their natural zzso zzso key signaling pathways such as those associated with the zzso growth factor zzso However, it has been reported that zzso may be zzso and activated even in the absence of zzso The present study assessed whether zzso zzso induced by physical means alone zzso for zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

The zzso on zzso cells was specifically targeted by zzso iron oxide zzso zzso carrying either a zzso zzso zzso zzso or a zzso zzso for targeting a zzso zzso incorporating a zzso zzso zzso carrier zzso zzso Application of a magnetic field led to zzso zzso and zzso resulting in zzso of the zzso a process zzso by auto and zzso and downstream zzso The zzso early signaling events were similar to those inherent to the zzso dependent zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that the zzso exerted magnetic zzso forces in the zzso range with zzso dependent on zzso motion of the zzso complex and magnetic field zzso 

We demonstrate that zzso on the cell surface that have their zzso zzso blocked by an zzso are still capable of zzso and initiation of signaling zzso if they are clustered by zzso either attached locally or targeted to another site of the zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso of growth factor receptors may be triggered by zzso molecular crowding resulting from zzso and/or zzso in membrane zzso
