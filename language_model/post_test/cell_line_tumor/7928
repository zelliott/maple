zzso objects made of various materials are gaining increasing attention as promising vehicles for the delivery of therapeutic and diagnostic agents for zzso zzso therapy zzso appears to offer a very attractive opportunity to implement drug delivery systems since no release of the zzso is needed to obtain the therapeutic effect and the design of the zzso should be much zzso The aim of our study was to investigate the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso for the delivery of the second-generation zzso zzso zzso to cancer cells in zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso 33 zzso zzso in a zzso form which produced zzso oxygen with a high zzso In zzso media with high salt zzso the zzso underwent zzso and zzso but their stability could be preserved in the presence of zzso bovine zzso The cellular zzso zzso and zzso activity of zzso was determined comparatively in human zzso cancer cells after its delivery by the zzso and the standard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso The zzso zzso reduced the cellular zzso of zzso by about 50% in comparison to standard zzso while it did not affect the zzso zzso activity of zzso and its zzso zzso Fluorescence resonance energy transfer zzso using zzso with zzso physically zzso and a zzso zzso linked, and zzso experiments indicated that zzso is transferred from zzso to serum proteins when present in the zzso However, the coating of the zzso surface with zzso zzso largely prevented the transfer to zzso In conclusion, zzso is rapidly transferred from the zzso zzso to the serum proteins and then zzso by the cells as a protein complex, irrespective of its zzso of zzso
