To investigate the effect of zzso zzso on zzso cell cycle and zzso of human gastric cells line zzso 

zzso zzso flow zzso and zzso zzso flow zzso zzso were used to evaluate the effect of zzso on zzso cell cycle and zzso of zzso cells zzso zzso microscope and transmission electron zzso were used to observe the cell zzso zzso 

A zzso and zzso zzso zzso effect of zzso was demonstrated in zzso zzso zzso concentration lower than zzso zzso possessed weak zzso zzso concentration between zzso zzso possessed higher zzso zzso The concentration higher than zzso zzso had no significant increase of zzso zzso zzso of zzso at 24, 48 and 72 h was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Compared with the negative control group, the number of zzso phase cells increased significantly ( zzso while the number of S and zzso phase cells decreased after incubation with zzso for 48 zzso and the zzso was in a zzso zzso zzso arrested zzso cells at the zzso phase of the cell zzso After incubation with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for 24 zzso the early zzso rates of zzso cells were zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and the late zzso rates were zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both the early zzso rates and the late zzso rates increased significantly compared to the control group (all zzso the zzso was in a zzso zzso 

zzso can inhibit zzso cells zzso arrest zzso cells in zzso phase and induce zzso and may be a potential traditional Chinese medicine with zzso zzso
