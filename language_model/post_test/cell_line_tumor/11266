Recently, we have indicated that zzso a zzso toxin produced in zzso lakes or zzso can increase invasive ability of melanoma zzso zzso however, the zzso effect needs identification by in zzso experiment and the related molecular mechanism is poorly zzso In this study, in zzso and in zzso experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of zzso on invasion and zzso of human melanoma cells, and the underlying molecular mechanism was also zzso zzso zzso model zzso showed that oral administration of nude mice with zzso at zzso zzso posed no significant effect on tumor zzso zzso examination demonstrated that zzso could promote lung zzso which is confirmed by zzso chamber zzso suggesting that zzso treatment at 25 zzso can increase the zzso of zzso zzso In zzso and in zzso experiments consistently showed that zzso exposure increased zzso and protein levels of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso treatment at low doses zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso enhancement and zzso zzso were reversed by the zzso chemical inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso indicating that zzso promotes invasion and zzso of zzso cells via the zzso zzso
