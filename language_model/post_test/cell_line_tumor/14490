The aim of this study was to investigate zzso function of bone zzso zzso zzso immobilized on the zzso zzso zzso zzso surfaces were first modified by zzso zzso followed by zzso of zzso zzso was then immobilized on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso surfaces were characterized by X-ray zzso zzso zzso measurement of water contact angles, and protein zzso The biological activity of zzso cells on pristine and zzso zzso surfaces was investigated by cell proliferation zzso measurement of alkaline zzso zzso activity, and determination of calcium zzso zzso effects were assessed by zzso to measure the transcript levels of zzso and zzso zzso revealed that zzso and zzso were successfully grafted and immobilized on the zzso surfaces, zzso In addition, zzso surfaces with zzso immobilized were more zzso than pristine zzso Furthermore, zzso immobilized zzso promoted significantly higher zzso activity and calcium deposition by zzso cells than pristine zzso The inflammatory response was also decreased when cells were grown on zzso zzso zzso zzso The results of this study suggest that by zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso surfaces, inflammation can be inhibited and zzso function zzso
