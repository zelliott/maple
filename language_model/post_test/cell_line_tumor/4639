zzso was originally recognized for its role in the regulation of cell survival and zzso however, it was recently found to be a potent zzso zzso In order to characterize the role of zzso in melanoma cell zzso we studied expression of zzso in melanoma cell lines and zzso its zzso distribution and function during zzso using various expression and zzso interference zzso We found that zzso was zzso expressed in both cultured melanoma cells and melanoma zzso zzso expression was significantly decreased in advanced zzso comparing to benign zzso zzso of wild type zzso or zzso zzso lacking the DNA binding domain resulted in massive zzso in melanoma cells, whereas stable zzso of zzso using zzso interference resulted in melanoma cell resistance to zzso induced by zzso agents zzso and zzso We further demonstrated that zzso in melanoma cells was zzso at least zzso through zzso zzso zzso but not zzso in zzso expression zzso Our results suggest that zzso is an important zzso inducing factor in melanoma zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso melanoma cells may contribute to their reduced zzso potential and increased resistance to zzso
