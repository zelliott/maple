The tumor host zzso is increasingly viewed as an important contributor to tumor growth and zzso Cellular zzso stress resulting from high levels of zzso oxygen species zzso contributes to various processes involved in the development and progress of zzso tumors including zzso zzso growth, zzso and zzso In this regard, the zzso zzso zzso stress in adjacent tumor cells, and this in turn causes several changes in tumor cells including zzso of the zzso status, zzso of cell zzso and induction of zzso or zzso cell zzso Because the levels of zzso are determined by a balance between zzso generation and zzso detoxification, disruption of this system will result in increased or decreased zzso zzso Recently, we demonstrated that the control of zzso zzso balance and cellular defense against zzso damage is one of the primary functions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that supplies zzso for zzso zzso To explore the interactions between tumor cells and the host, we evaluated zzso between zzso zzso and zzso mice in which zzso melanoma cells had been zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso was zzso observed in the zzso mice along with significant zzso of zzso stress in both the tumor and the zzso In addition, the expression of zzso markers was significantly zzso in both the tumor and the zzso of the zzso zzso These results support the hypothesis that zzso zzso changes in the host environment of zzso mice may contribute to cancer zzso
