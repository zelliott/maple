We examined the effects of suppressing zzso zzso protein 1 zzso gene expression in a human zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso designed to cleave zzso zzso zzso were zzso into the zzso zzso The zzso cells were significantly sensitive to zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared with the zzso cells ( zzso and zzso respectively, zzso zzso There was no significant difference in the expression of other human genes between the zzso and controls by zzso zzso The zzso zzso specific suppression of zzso was sufficient to reverse the resistance of zzso and zzso in the human zzso cell zzso
