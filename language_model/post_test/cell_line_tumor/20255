zzso the most common primary tumor of the bones, causes many deaths due to its rapid proliferation and drug zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso D1 plays a key regulatory role during cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso act as crucial zzso of zzso D1 zzso The aim of the current study was to determine the role of zzso in controlling zzso expression and inducing cell zzso zzso has been found to be a target of zzso and zzso through analysis of complementary sequences between zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso in the cell line zzso zzso zzso and cell cycle zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso and zzso show slower proliferation zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso is suppressed by zzso and zzso via direct binding to the zzso zzso region zzso The data presented here demonstrate that the zzso contributes to zzso cell zzso suggesting that repression of zzso by zzso and zzso could be used for zzso zzso
