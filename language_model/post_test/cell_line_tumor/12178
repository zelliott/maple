The zzso are a class of zzso agents that bind in the DNA minor zzso These compounds also exhibit a propensity for zzso which can potentially impact their cellular zzso and zzso We have explored this possibility by using a broad range of zzso and zzso techniques to characterize the zzso and cellular zzso properties of two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso dynamic light zzso and transmission electron zzso studies reveal that zzso and zzso exhibit differing zzso zzso In this connection, zzso exhibits an enhanced propensity for zzso and forms larger and more stable zzso than zzso In addition, the net zzso of zzso into human zzso cells is diminished relative to that of zzso These observations suggest that the zzso properties of zzso zzso the cellular zzso of the compounds, with enhanced zzso propensity and zzso size leading to reduced cellular zzso
