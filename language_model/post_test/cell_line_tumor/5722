zzso of growth 2 zzso is a candidate zzso zzso gene the expression of which is frequently lost in zzso Here, we identified a new function for zzso in the control of DNA replication and in the maintenance of zzso zzso Global replication rate was markedly reduced during normal zzso in small interfering zzso zzso zzso cells, as seen in a DNA zzso spreading zzso zzso we found that zzso interacts with zzso cell nuclear zzso and regulates its amount to the zzso zzso allowing normal replication progression and normal cell zzso zzso of DNA replication has been previously associated with zzso zzso zzso a high proportion of zzso zzso cells presented zzso of their zzso as well as an increased frequency of sister zzso zzso Thus, we propose for the first time that zzso might function as a zzso zzso gene by directly maintaining DNA zzso
