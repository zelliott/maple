zzso is a family of zzso protein receptors whose zzso requires zzso zzso by zzso Since zzso zzso signaling can induce zzso zzso in transgenic mice and high expression levels of zzso receptors and zzso zzso with overall poor clinical zzso zzso zzso with small molecules may be a promising approach for breast cancer zzso zzso with this hypothesis, two recent papers reported that zzso inhibitor I zzso zzso zzso is toxic to breast cancer cells both in zzso and in zzso In this study, we compared the activity and zzso of zzso to that of two highly specific zzso zzso and zzso and three structurally unrelated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in order to study the mechanism underlying the zzso of zzso in breast cancer zzso 

Three zzso zzso zzso positive cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso and three zzso negative cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso were used in this zzso Both zzso and zzso cells also zzso zzso zzso was measured by using an zzso cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity was measured by both zzso and zzso zzso in order to detect active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined by using a zzso zzso activity zzso zzso by zzso to detect zzso of zzso zzso and by zzso zzso to detect zzso of cellular zzso 

We found that blocking zzso activity by zzso and zzso had no effect on the survival and proliferation of a panel of six breast cancer cell lines while zzso could cause cell death even at zzso that inhibited zzso activity less zzso Furthermore, we observed that zzso could inhibit zzso activity and the relative cellular sensitivity of these six breast cancer cell lines to zzso was the same as observed for three zzso zzso Finally, we found that the cell killing effect of zzso could be reversed by a chemical that restored the zzso zzso 

We conclude that the zzso of zzso in breast cancer cells is zzso by zzso zzso not by zzso zzso
