zzso zzso complexes were formed using linear zzso zzso zzso 25 k zzso to cholesterol in a zzso geometry zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These complexes were subsequently injected weekly into zzso mice zzso and locally for the treatment of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso induced pulmonary zzso and subcutaneous zzso zzso tumors, zzso At the zzso of the pulmonary zzso study, the number of pulmonary zzso was significantly less zzso zzso zzso with systemic injections of zzso zzso than with zzso alone or zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso or an zzso zzso In addition, zzso studies showed increased pulmonary levels of both the zzso carrier and zzso zzso up to 3 zzso after systemic injection of the zzso complexes into mice carrying pulmonary zzso Furthermore, mice zzso treated with zzso showed a near linear profile in weight gain in the course of the pulmonary zzso study that suggests increased zzso Finally, due to favorable characteristics in zzso zzso was also used for local zzso injection of SC zzso zzso zzso stasis and slight tumor zzso were seen only with the zzso treated mice compared to zzso zzso and naked zzso zzso Thus, it was concluded that zzso is an effective carrier for passive targeting of the pulmonary zzso treatment of zzso pulmonary zzso and local administration of zzso cell SC zzso
