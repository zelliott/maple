zzso gene regulation is important in human zzso Both functional and zzso data zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA promoter zzso and zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso We sought to explore the role of zzso DNA zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso expression in human zzso From human zzso databases we calculated that 13 and zzso of human zzso genes are located within 3 and 10 zzso of a zzso island, zzso To identify zzso that are regulated by zzso mechanisms in cancer, we performed expression profiling prior to and following treatment of cell lines with zzso We used zzso zzso to determine zzso zzso For zzso whose expression changed following zzso treatment, we zzso the adjacent zzso island and promoter using zzso zzso Here, we describe these methods to enable other researchers to use this zzso
