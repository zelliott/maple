Enteric zzso including zzso and zzso encounter a vast microbial community in the zzso gastrointestinal zzso which has been shown to promote virus replication and zzso zzso the underlying mechanisms, we find that zzso binds bacterial surface zzso which enhances zzso stability and cell attachment by increasing binding to the viral zzso Additionally, we identified a zzso zzso zzso with reduced zzso zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso zzso cell attachment, zzso and zzso in mice are zzso zzso zzso was unstable in feces following zzso zzso of zzso zzso the ratio of zzso virus in feces is reduced following additional cycles of infection in zzso Thus, the zzso virus zzso a fitness cost when environmental stability is a zzso These data suggest that zzso binds bacterial surface zzso enhancing cell attachment and environmental stability, potentially promoting transmission to a new zzso
