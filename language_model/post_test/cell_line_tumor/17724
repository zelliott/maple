The precursor for zzso zzso is a nuclear and zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study we have found that zzso is absent or zzso in four T zzso leukemia cell lines zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso cells blocks cell cycle progression from zzso to S phase associated with elevated levels of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso decreases zzso degradation by reducing zzso and subsequent expression of zzso a key component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these findings identify zzso as a novel regulator of zzso expression and zzso levels and zzso a role for zzso in T cell zzso
