zzso zzso the major zzso of green tea, has cancer zzso and zzso zzso zzso selectively zzso cell growth and zzso zzso in cancer cells without adversely affecting normal zzso however, the underlying molecular mechanism in zzso is zzso In the present study, we show that zzso zzso activity is attributed to a zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that is significantly elevated in zzso (multiple zzso cells relative to normal peripheral blood zzso cells, and that zzso zzso zzso is critical for the zzso zzso and the zzso cell death induced by zzso We also found that zzso zzso zzso zzso to the plasma membrane and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso which was necessary for zzso zzso via zzso Additionally, orally administered zzso activated zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso These results zzso a novel zzso zzso triggered by zzso for the specific killing of zzso zzso
