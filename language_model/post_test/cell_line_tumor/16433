Recent interest in zzso zzso zzso for the delivery of zzso has propelled considerable interest in fabrication of zzso It is important that the fabrication process is feasible for drug zzso and compatible with the stability of the drug in zzso Moreover, drug zzso may offer the advantage of higher drug loading compared with other technologies, such as drug zzso 

In this study, we zzso a model protein drug, zzso bovine serum zzso in zzso zzso by zzso Drug distribution within the zzso array was found to be zzso The zzso protein retained its primary, secondary, and zzso structural zzso In zzso release of the zzso protein showed that almost all of the drug was released into zzso zzso saline within 6 zzso The in zzso zzso profile of zzso bovine serum zzso through rat skin was also tested and shown to resemble the in zzso release profile, with an initial release burst followed by a slow release zzso The zzso of the zzso without bovine serum zzso was tested in three different cell zzso High cell zzso were observed, demonstrating the innocuous nature of the zzso 

The zzso array can potentially serve as a useful drug carrier for zzso zzso and zzso
