The application of new zzso and zzso technologies support a view in which few drugs act solely by zzso a single cellular zzso Indeed, drug activity is modulated by complex, often incompletely understood cellular zzso zzso efforts to decipher mode of action through genetic zzso such as zzso typically yields zzso that fall into several zzso Of particular interest to the present study, we aimed to characterize secondary activities of drugs on zzso zzso a known target can result in clinically relevant synthetic zzso In one scenario, drug zzso could, for example, improperly activate a protein that normally zzso a particular zzso In other cases, zzso lower affinity targets can be inhibited as in the example of zzso of zzso observed in zzso cells treated with zzso Drug transport and metabolism also play an important role in the way any chemicals act within the zzso Finally, zzso per zzso can also affect cell fitness by more general zzso effects, zzso via the zzso of zzso or DNA damage zzso Regardless of the root cause of these unwanted effects, understanding the scope of a drug's activity and zzso is essential for better understanding its zzso of action, and such information can guide development of improved zzso We describe a zzso cost-effective approach to characterize primary and secondary effects of zzso by using small-scale libraries of zzso integrated short hairpin zzso We demonstrate this principle using a zzso composed of zzso that target the genes zzso the reported protein targets of approved zzso Among the 28 known reported zzso pairs, we successfully identify zzso of the targets described in the literature and uncover several unanticipated zzso interactions based on drug-induced synthetic zzso We provide a detailed protocol for performing such screens and for analyzing the zzso This cost-effective approach to zzso zzso screens, combined with the increasing maturation of zzso technology will expand the accessibility of similar approaches in academic zzso
