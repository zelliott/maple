The zzso proteins are a family of zzso factors characterized by an zzso zzso DNA binding domain that controls key cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso a member of the zzso family, is reported to be present in zzso with high zzso content, notably breast and zzso However, the role of zzso in cancer development is not fully zzso To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms associated with prostate cancer zzso we employed zzso labeling followed by mass zzso zzso analysis to identify candidate proteins that are zzso expressed in prostate cancer cells with or without zzso To this end, we zzso zzso in zzso human prostate cells using a zzso zzso system zzso Many zzso expressed proteins which play important roles in various cellular and biological processes were zzso Among them, zzso zzso which is a zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso in multiple zzso We demonstrated that zzso of zzso reversed the zzso properties of zzso in zzso zzso zzso Using in zzso functional zzso we showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso effects against cell zzso colony formation and tumor zzso Similar results were further confirmed with the prostate cancer cell line zzso In conclusion, many zzso expressed proteins were identified and zzso was found to be zzso by zzso These results suggest that zzso may inhibit prostate cancer progression by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso the association among zzso expressed proteins may provide a basis to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the process of cancer progression and development and further aid in designing zzso in the zzso
