A new zzso zzso probe that combines both imaging and targeting abilities was developed for application in medical zzso The zzso fluorescent zzso zzso green zzso and the zzso zzso zzso for zzso growth factor zzso zzso were attached to zzso by passive zzso It was found that zzso molecules zzso to the zzso are more fluorescent than free zzso and have a larger quantum zzso zzso fluorescent zzso preserved zzso recognition, as is evident from zzso and selective binding to zzso colon zzso cells zzso zzso The binding of zzso fluorescent zzso to zzso compared with zzso cells zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso was greater by a factor of zzso ensuring imaging abilities with available fluorescent zzso Due to relatively high quantum yield and specific tumor zzso ability, this technology deserves further in zzso evaluation for imaging and diagnostic zzso 

A new zzso zzso probe combining both imaging and targeting abilities is zzso Due to relatively high quantum yield and zzso tumor cell zzso this technology deserves further in zzso evaluation for imaging and diagnostic zzso
