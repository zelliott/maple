The zzso zzso is zzso frequently in prostate tumors following zzso zzso therapy, and zzso zzso may contribute to the zzso zzso of the zzso However, the molecular mechanism underlying zzso regulation of zzso in prostate cancer cells is understood zzso In this study, we demonstrated that no zzso response element zzso was identified in the zzso region of the zzso promoter of zzso zzso zzso we provided evidence that the zzso effect is zzso by zzso protein through a putative zzso site in the zzso We further demonstrated that zzso zzso protein plays a critical role in zzso regulation of zzso The zzso levels of RB at zzso zzso zzso and zzso were decreased in zzso cells treated with zzso zzso expression of a zzso active form of RB inhibited expression of zzso zzso of zzso RB protein by an zzso small zzso zzso zzso induced an increase in zzso zzso Most importantly, the effect of zzso on zzso was abolished completely by specific zzso of RB function with a zzso zzso Finally, zzso treatment of zzso cells zzso specifically levels of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso and/or zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso protein with a pool of zzso diminished zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso our data indicate that zzso suppress zzso expression through zzso modulating activities of the zzso site in the zzso promoter by zzso the zzso zzso
