zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a variety of solid zzso Several mouse zzso zzso zzso have been developed that recognize the zzso part of zzso of them two zzso were humanized and employed for targeted zzso In this study we aimed to produce zzso zzso that specifically recognize the zzso domain of human zzso zzso mice were first primed with zzso zzso cells and then zzso with zzso zzso part of zzso zzso from zzso mice were fused with myeloma cells and growing zzso were selected and screened for zzso zzso by an indirect zzso zzso zzso were selected, cloned by limiting dilution zzso and further characterized by Western zzso and flow zzso zzso All clones showed positive zzso to zzso with binding zzso ranging from zzso to zzso and stained zzso cells and zzso cells zzso zzso None of the zzso inhibited the binding of zzso zzso to zzso indicating recognition of distinct zzso by these zzso Based on these findings, our zzso could be potentially used for selective targeting of zzso zzso
