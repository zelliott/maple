Triple negative breast cancer zzso represents approximately zzso of the newly diagnosed zzso worldwide and is characterized by tissue lacking in estrogen, zzso and human zzso growth factor zzso zzso disproportionately affects younger women and women of zzso and new treatments are zzso The zzso growth factor zzso - zzso growth factor zzso zzso axis is a zzso of cell proliferation in zzso and zzso is an zzso produced zzso that zzso cell replication by interacting with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways thus reducing DNA zzso In these studies we investigated the presence and function of the zzso axis in two human zzso cell lines, as well as in breast cancer cell lines containing hormonal zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso as well as human breast cancer cells zzso and zzso were examined for the presence of zzso and zzso as well as their response to zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso and molecular studies to zzso classical zzso zzso The requirement for protein zzso and translation and zzso zzso were zzso Growth of zzso cells in the presence of zzso and standard of care zzso agent zzso was evaluated to determine both efficacy and protective effects against zzso zzso treatment inhibited zzso cells in a dosage zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was the specific zzso zzso to inhibit cell zzso and this was zzso by zzso zzso dependent zzso zzso zzso and required protein and zzso zzso zzso was the specific zzso zzso both zzso and zzso were detected in all four cell zzso zzso treatment inhibited growth of all cancer cell lines zzso and reduced cell death in cultures exposed to zzso The zzso axis is present and functioning in zzso cell lines, and provides a novel biological zzso as potential zzso
