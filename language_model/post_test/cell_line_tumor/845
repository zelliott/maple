zzso regulates the function, growth, and proliferation of zzso in the zzso We report here that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression and LDL zzso are strongly zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of LDL was significantly inhibited by the zzso drug, zzso A, indicating that LDL zzso is dependent on the integrity of the cortical zzso zzso in zzso zzso We examined whether the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with the zzso The zzso zzso with zzso and zzso labeled LDL bound to regions of the cell membrane that zzso with the active, zzso form of zzso zzso Evidence for a functional interaction between zzso and the zzso was obtained by transient zzso experiments using zzso fluorescent protein zzso expression zzso We observed that transient zzso of zzso cells with an zzso N zzso zzso construct prevented the zzso of LDL zzso whereas expression of zzso alone or an zzso C zzso construct had no effect on LDL zzso zzso with the zzso N zzso zzso negative construct had no effect on the zzso of zzso Thus, zzso stimulates the expression of zzso and the zzso in zzso cells, which interact physically and functionally to facilitate the zzso of zzso We propose that the zzso and interaction of zzso and the zzso serves to augment the delivery of cholesterol and other lipids in support of the zzso and zzso response of cells to zzso
