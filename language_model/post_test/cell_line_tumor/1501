Clinical application of adoptive T cell therapy has been hindered by an inability to generate adequate numbers of zzso functionally active, zzso T cells, which can persist in zzso In order to address this, we evaluated the impact of zzso zzso signaling during zzso zzso T cell zzso in terms of persistence and zzso efficacy using an established zzso melanoma tumor adoptive therapy zzso 

B6 mice were injected zzso with zzso melanoma tumor zzso On day 12 of tumor growth, mice were zzso with zzso zzso dose, zzso and 1 day later were treated by adoptive transfer of zzso zzso zzso T cells primed ex zzso 3 days earlier with both zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso were measured zzso and infused donor T cells were analyzed for zzso zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso transfer of zzso zzso T cells primed with zzso was significantly more effective in reducing tumor burden in mice zzso with zzso compared with transfer of T cells primed without zzso This enhanced zzso response was associated with increased zzso of infused T cells in the periphery and tumor as well as elevated expression of zzso molecules including zzso B and zzso zzso 

Our findings demonstrate that ex zzso zzso of zzso zzso T cells with zzso dramatically improves their in zzso persistence and therapeutic ability on transfer to zzso zzso These findings can be directly applied as novel clinical trial zzso
