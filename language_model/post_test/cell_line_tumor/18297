A series of structurally related zzso zzso zzso compounds, zzso where zzso is zzso or a zzso zzso have recently been shown to exhibit appreciable stability under zzso conditions and to manifest important zzso effects toward selected human tumor cell lines zzso zzso zzso 2006, 49, zzso The crystal structures of four members of this series, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been solved here and the respective structural parameters comparatively zzso zzso all of the compounds contain a common structural motif consisting of a zzso zzso zzso linked to two zzso zzso in a roughly zzso zzso Interestingly, introduction of different kinds of zzso or zzso zzso on the 6 (and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso leads to small structural changes that nonetheless greatly affect the zzso of the metal zzso The chemical behavior of these compounds in solution has been studied in detail, focusing in particular on the zzso zzso Some initial correlations among the structural zzso the chemical behavior in solution, and the known zzso effects of these compounds are zzso zzso we have found that the zzso zzso which showed the largest structural zzso with respect to the model compound zzso also had the highest zzso power, the least zzso stability, and the greatest zzso zzso The positive correlation that exists between the zzso power and the zzso effects seems to be of particular zzso Moreover, the electronic structures of these compounds were extensively analyzed using zzso methods, and the effects of the various zzso on zzso were zzso overall, very good agreement between theoretical expectations and experimental data was zzso In turn, theoretical predictions offer interesting hints for the design of new, more active zzso zzso zzso
