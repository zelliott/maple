zzso zzso is an aggressive zzso zzso of children and young adults, with no effective systemic zzso Its specific zzso zzso zzso drives zzso initiation and zzso The exact mechanism of zzso zzso function remains zzso In an zzso transgenic model, we show that a zzso zzso signal is zzso activated by zzso and zzso of zzso signaling through the genetic loss of zzso blocks zzso zzso tumor zzso In a combination of zzso and zzso zzso tumor zzso models, we show that zzso of the zzso cascade through zzso blockade and the use of zzso zzso zzso arrests zzso zzso tumor zzso We find that zzso of the zzso cascade by zzso zzso with its nuclear zzso zzso These studies reveal the central role of zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso and open new venues for the development of effective zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is an aggressive zzso cancer that zzso children and young adults, and for which there is no effective zzso The current studies provide critical insight into our understanding of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and pave the way for the development of effective therapeutic agents for the treatment of the disease in zzso
