To explore the effect of suppressing zzso expression using zzso interference zzso technique in zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso cell lines zzso expressing zzso targeted zzso and zzso gene were established and gene expression zzso was assessed by Western zzso zzso The effect of suppressing zzso by zzso on cell growth was zzso the zzso induction and the zzso of zzso cells to zzso were zzso by zzso zzso and flow zzso The results showed that: stable zzso of zzso cells with zzso expressing zzso against zzso decreased the expression of zzso zzso suppression of zzso expression did not affect cell proliferation but could increase the zzso to zzso in zzso zzso This will help physicians to make some clinical trials of gene therapy on zzso zzso by zzso
