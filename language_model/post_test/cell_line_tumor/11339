Although zzso dysfunction has been observed in various types of human cancer cells, the molecular mechanism underlying zzso dysfunction zzso zzso remains largely zzso To further explore the function of zzso and their involvement in the zzso mechanisms of cancer development, zzso dysfunction clones of breast cancer cells were generated by zzso treatment, a specific inhibitor of zzso electron transport complex zzso These clones were verified by zzso respiratory zzso zzso Moreover, those clones exhibited increased zzso oxygen species zzso and showed higher migration and invasive behaviors compared with their parental zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso effectively inhibited cell migration and invasion in these zzso zzso zzso regulated zzso cellular behavior was in part zzso through zzso of zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth zzso Our results suggest that zzso dysfunction promotes cancer cell zzso partly through zzso zzso zzso via increased production of zzso oxygen zzso
