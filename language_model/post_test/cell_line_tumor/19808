zzso zzso factor zzso is a zzso cell surface protein expressed by zzso of group A zzso zzso strains comprised of a zzso domain that binds zzso and an zzso domain that mediates zzso of zzso zzso The zzso gene was recently discovered to be zzso in a zzso zzso with a gene zzso another zzso zzso zzso We compared the ability of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain and zzso zzso lacking zzso or zzso to invade cultured zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso led to a significant decrease in zzso zzso invasion while loss of zzso had minimal zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso could be restored upon zzso with the zzso gene on a zzso zzso and zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso marked increases in zzso cell zzso Studies using a zzso zzso gene lacking the zzso domain indicated that the zzso zzso domain of zzso contributes to zzso invasion independent of the zzso zzso binding domain, findings zzso by observations that a zzso zzso zzso zzso could promote latex zzso adherence to zzso cells and inhibit zzso invasion of zzso cells in a zzso zzso Finally, the first in zzso studies to employ a single gene zzso replacement zzso of zzso demonstrate that this protein contributes to zzso zzso in a zzso model of zzso skin zzso
