The product of zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to cause cell death at high zzso while at lower zzso it can influence cell proliferation and zzso In our experiments we used human zzso cells zzso to test the influence of zzso on cell zzso differentiation and induction of zzso zzso induction was estimated by zzso zzso zzso The cells were in parallel counted and the zzso zzso method was used to distinguish between zzso and zzso cells as well as to define the proportion of cells in zzso To test the influence of zzso on zzso cell zzso cells were treated every second day with zzso After 10 days, the cells were stained for alkaline zzso a marker for zzso zzso Cell growth zzso was caused by zzso zzso of 10 or 100 zzso zzso while zzso was induced with zzso as well as by the zzso amount of the zzso (1 zzso zzso appeared when cells were treated with 10 or 100 zzso but not with 1 zzso zzso The proportion of cells in zzso gradually declined with increased zzso zzso Multiple zzso of zzso cells to 10 zzso zzso prevented zzso cell zzso These results indicated that zzso zzso proliferation and differentiation of zzso cells in the same concentration dependent manner as it causes zzso We thus assume that zzso might be one of the important signaling molecules regulating the growth of the human zzso zzso
