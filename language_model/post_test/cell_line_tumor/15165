Identification of zzso T zzso zzso zzso from additional tumor zzso is essential for the development of specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso a recently discovered zzso zzso in zzso is considered to be a promising target for biological zzso In the present study, we predicted and identified zzso zzso zzso from zzso by using the following zzso zzso zzso computer-based zzso prediction from the zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso to determine the affinity of the predicted zzso with zzso zzso zzso stimulation of primary T cell response against the predicted peptides in zzso and zzso testing of the induced zzso toward target cells expressing zzso and zzso The results demonstrated that zzso induced by peptides of zzso containing zzso 13-21, zzso and 4-12 could zzso zzso and lyse target zzso Our results indicate that these peptides are new zzso zzso zzso and may serve as valuable tools for zzso zzso
