zzso zzso 1 zzso is a member of cell division control protein 2 zzso zzso protein zzso family, and it is likely to occur in zzso tumors, plays an important impact on the zzso This study aimed to evaluate the expression of zzso in breast cancer and regulation in cancer cell zzso In the work, the zzso zzso level in fresh biopsy zzso from 186 breast cancer patients, with 98 benign zzso as negative control, and zzso protein in 30 zzso zzso from primary breast cancer patients were detected by the real-time reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The roles of zzso in cell growth were analyzed with zzso short hairpin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in breast cancer patients and had a positive detection efficiency of zzso zzso which showed statistically significant difference compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso ( zzso zzso zzso function with zzso zzso cells exhibited obvious zzso at the zzso phase and increased sensitivity to cell cycle zzso zzso The results suggested that the zzso gene could be a potential tumor marker for diagnosis and a gene target for zzso
