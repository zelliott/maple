zzso zzso chemotherapy zzso has shown promise in treatment of zzso zzso Despite its efficiency for the treatment of zzso zzso from zzso tract zzso it has failed to demonstrate significant benefit in zzso zzso It is therefore essential to understand the mechanism underlying resistance to zzso in zzso zzso zzso stem cells zzso play an important role in the development of zzso cancer zzso and resistance to zzso A recent study suggests that zzso may be zzso for cancer cells upon heat zzso In contrast, we describe the protective role of zzso against zzso Using zzso zzso we determined that the tumor associated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We studied the effect of zzso in zzso setting of zzso or zzso associated with zzso cancer cell lines zzso and zzso with zzso flow zzso We demonstrate that zzso does not challenge survival of zzso or bone zzso derived zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso displayed strong protective effect inducing zzso in zzso cancer cells zzso zzso experiments demonstrated the role of zzso zzso We showed that zzso was inducing zzso and that zzso of zzso interaction restored zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso to the previous published study we demonstrated that zzso and zzso zzso with zzso induced zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso the interaction between zzso and cancer cells through zzso zzso might restore zzso sensitivity in zzso zzso and thus improve zzso zzso
