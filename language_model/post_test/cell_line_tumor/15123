zzso cell zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso protein zzso zzso High levels of zzso are associated with drug resistance in chronic zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso activity has been connected with zzso zzso zzso drug design efforts were aimed at identifying novel zzso zzso First, an in-house library of zzso zzso which were previously shown to be dual zzso and zzso zzso was analyzed by zzso studies within the zzso binding site of zzso to select the best candidates to be tested in a zzso zzso Next, the same zzso protocol was applied to screen a database of commercially available zzso As a result, most of the selected compounds were found active against zzso with Ki values ranging from zzso to zzso confirming the suitability of the zzso approach zzso Furthermore, selected compounds showed an interesting zzso activity profile against the human leukemia cell line zzso and one compound was found to block zzso replication at zzso zzso
