This study investigated the functional and clinical significance of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells of zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso samples of zzso and zzso with associated invasion zzso zzso zzso were analyzed for expression of zzso by zzso and ability to predict recurrence and progression assessed in an independent, unique cohort of zzso cases with long-term zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso cell lines, with and without zzso zzso were used to measure the effect of zzso on growth and invasion of tumor cell lines in zzso and in a zzso mouse zzso zzso of zzso signaling was established using mink lung zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso and expression and zzso of zzso zzso zzso established by Real zzso and zzso 

zzso of zzso is significantly associated with progression to invasive cancer zzso zzso zzso and with recurrence over a median follow-up of 114 months in a series of matched zzso cases treated with local zzso We show that expression of zzso drives zzso cells to promote tumor cell invasion in zzso and enhances zzso tumor growth in zzso The zzso effect of zzso zzso cells is dependent on zzso zzso of zzso and can be zzso by zzso this zzso 

These findings indicate that altered zzso cells in zzso predict disease progression and recurrence and show that zzso of zzso on zzso cells generates a tumor promoter function through zzso zzso of zzso These data suggest that expression of zzso may be used to zzso patients with zzso
