zzso cells develop zzso characteristic zzso zzso that are bordered by tight zzso the zzso zzso zzso and its zzso complex zzso protein zzso c zzso regulate multiple steps during zzso zzso but the mechanisms that mediate zzso zzso of zzso to drive zzso zzso and activate the transition from junction formation to zzso differentiation are poorly zzso Using a small interfering zzso screen, we identify zzso as a zzso zzso exchange factor that is recruited by zzso to the zzso zzso that is enriched at a marginal zone zzso to tight zzso and that drives zzso restricted zzso zzso promoting zzso zzso zzso depletion did not affect junction formation but did affect zzso zzso and brush border zzso zzso expression of active zzso drove zzso zzso of the zzso pathway, stimulating the transition from junction formation to zzso differentiation and domain expansion, as well as the positioning of tight zzso Thus, zzso drives zzso signaling at the zzso margin to regulate zzso zzso border zzso and zzso zzso
