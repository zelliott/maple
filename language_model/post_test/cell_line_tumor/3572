zzso acid (and related zzso zzso across the human small zzso wall is an essential zzso zzso Despite the revelation of a number of zzso zzso the molecular identity of the classic zzso zzso acid zzso zzso functionally in the zzso remains zzso The aims of this study were to determine whether the recently isolated complementary DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso 1), or zzso carrier zzso represents the zzso acid zzso the zzso zzso zzso acid transport function measured at the zzso membrane of intact zzso zzso results from a close functional relationship between human zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso 

zzso function was measured in isolation ( zzso zzso zzso and in intact zzso zzso cell zzso and rat small zzso by measurement of zzso acid and/or zzso zzso zzso and membrane expression of zzso were determined by zzso zzso chain reaction and zzso 

zzso zzso was localized exclusively to the zzso membrane of zzso cells and human and rat small zzso The zzso specificity of zzso is identical to that of the zzso acid zzso In intact zzso zzso zzso acid influx is reduced under conditions in which zzso is zzso 

The identification in intact zzso of a cooperative functional relationship between zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso explains the apparent Na + dependence of the zzso acid carrier in studies with zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso acid carrier localized at the small zzso zzso membrane that zzso nutrients zzso zzso and orally active zzso agents zzso to treat affective zzso
