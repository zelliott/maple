zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression is crucial in the function of zzso zzso Because zzso of zzso expression may contribute to the development of different disorders, it is important to zzso the mechanisms regulating zzso gene zzso We report the characterization of two putative nuclear zzso zzso zzso referred to as zzso sites, in the human zzso promoter, and demonstrate that they bind zzso zzso and stimulate zzso promoter zzso zzso sites show different degrees of conservation and zzso when compared with zzso zzso zzso The zzso site (from zzso to zzso is highly zzso and binds zzso and zzso complexes, whereas zzso (from zzso to zzso is more zzso and only binds zzso zzso zzso of zzso sites in zzso cells expressing a zzso reporter zzso containing the zzso promoter resulted in increased zzso zzso zzso zzso of each zzso site zzso modified zzso promoter zzso In particular, zzso of the zzso motif did not affect zzso promoter response to zzso complexes, whereas zzso of the zzso site decreased zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso sites attenuated the zzso promoter zzso efficiency induced by zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso by zzso is supported mainly by the zzso site, whereas both sites are necessary to support the full zzso activity zzso by zzso zzso A correlation was found between zzso activity and zzso expression in the zzso and zzso cells but not in the zzso suggesting that zzso regulation of zzso expression could be a zzso zzso
