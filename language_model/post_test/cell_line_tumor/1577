zzso zzso exhibits zzso effect in a variety of cancer cell zzso The objective of this study was to obtain additional insights into the mechanisms involved in zzso induced cell death in human prostate cancer zzso 

Two human prostate cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso were treated with zzso and subsequently evaluated for their viability and cell cycle zzso zzso caused cell cycle arrest and cell death in both cell zzso The zzso phase arrest was correlated with increase levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and decrease of the checkpoint zzso To determine the mechanisms of zzso growth arrest and cell death in prostate cancer cell lines, we performed a zzso study to identify zzso in gene expression induced by zzso in the zzso zzso Several zzso zzso including the zzso an zzso zzso stress zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso stress was evidenced by increased expression of the downstream molecules zzso zzso and zzso in both cell zzso zzso of zzso or zzso expression by zzso significantly reduced zzso cell death in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso signaling by zzso zzso resulted in decreased expression of zzso and zzso zzso implicating that zzso zzso stress may be zzso via zzso signaling in prostate cancer zzso zzso also suppressed zzso zzso tumor growth in zzso zzso It caused zzso reduction in tumor volume after 18 days of zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso can cause zzso phase arrest in prostate cancer cells and its zzso is zzso by zzso stress zzso Thus, zzso may serve as an zzso agent by inducing zzso stress in prostate zzso
