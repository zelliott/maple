The tumor zzso zzso protein is expressed at low levels under normal zzso The zzso zzso and functional zzso of zzso are influenced by diverse stress zzso zzso in zzso exerts intrinsic zzso zzso activity with various zzso and DNA zzso zzso containing an zzso and zzso zzso element are zzso targets for zzso zzso The analysis of the zzso activity in zzso with activated zzso induced by various drug treatments or following zzso revealed that the expression of zzso zzso activity in response to stress signals is zzso Various zzso and zzso agents zzso zzso yet have different effects on expression of zzso activity with ARE zzso but not with DNA zzso zzso activity is enhanced in zzso extracts of zzso zzso cells exposed to zzso or treated by the zzso drug zzso but decreased following treatment by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso agents, thus indicating that zzso zzso activity is dependent on the specific stress and nature of the zzso Apparently, the disparity in expression of zzso zzso activity after each treatment is attributable to the different zzso response and to two zzso events: the interaction of zzso zzso protein with ARE zzso protects the zzso from degradation by zzso and/or decrease in zzso ARE zzso binding capacity due to zzso at zzso leads to reduction in zzso zzso zzso Our results provide new insights into zzso zzso function and into the mechanisms behind the regulation zzso degradation by zzso under different cellular zzso
