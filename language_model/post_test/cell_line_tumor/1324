A recently discovered zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso cells and also in many kinds of tumors and in zzso zzso By zzso zzso zzso causes local depletion of this essential zzso acid and excess of zzso and suppresses in zzso proliferation and functioning of T zzso Thus, immune resistance of tumors can be overcome by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso mice zzso with zzso zzso tumor were used to study the effect of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso under systemic or local (at site of tumor cells zzso administration, on the occurrence and rate of rejection of the second transplants of this zzso 

Both systemic and local administration of zzso zzso increases the zzso of and substantially zzso tumor zzso as compared with zzso 

zzso zzso zzso immune resistance of tumors may appear useful in leveraging the efficacy of zzso zzso
