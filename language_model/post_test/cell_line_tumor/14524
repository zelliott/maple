zzso zzso offer powerful tools for zzso and drug discovery, and are widely zzso for most cell zzso However, it is challenging to apply zzso zzso for in zzso diagnosis due to limited amount of patient zzso Here, we zzso and demonstrated zzso image zzso zzso capable of zzso zzso profiling of multiple signaling molecules using only zzso cells from clinical brain tumor specimens for in zzso molecular zzso First, we characterized the zzso pathway, which is often zzso in the brain tumors, in zzso brain tumor cell lines by measuring zzso zzso zzso and zzso with a zzso platform, and applied this measurement to clinical brain tumor zzso In conjunction with statistical analysis, we were able to characterize extensive zzso and zzso molecular zzso
