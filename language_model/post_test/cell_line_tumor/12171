The zzso expressed and zzso zzso growth factor zzso 3 zzso results from a zzso zzso zzso that occurs in approximately zzso of multiple myeloma zzso patients and zzso a particularly poor zzso This study zzso the zzso activity of zzso a zzso inhibitor of multiple zzso zzso zzso that is currently in phase I trials, in a newly developed zzso zzso zzso animal zzso 

We developed an zzso zzso model in mice using a zzso human zzso line that expresses zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso was evaluated at doses that inhibited zzso signaling in zzso in this zzso animal zzso 

zzso zzso imaging detected zzso zzso in nearly all mice injected with zzso cells, which were mainly localized in the spine, skull, and zzso resulting in frequent development of zzso Daily oral administration of zzso at doses that inhibited zzso signaling in zzso tumors in zzso resulted in a significant zzso of zzso tumor growth, which translated into a significant improvement in animal zzso 

Our data provide a relevant zzso basis for clinical trials of zzso in zzso zzso zzso
