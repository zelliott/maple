zzso of the zzso constituents of zzso zzso was zzso 

zzso zzso gel column zzso and zzso TLC were used for the chemical investigation of the zzso zzso extract of zzso zzso zzso All zzso were evaluated for their in zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso and zzso human cancer cell zzso 

Nine known compounds were zzso including four zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso together with five zzso zzso acid B zzso zzso H zzso zzso acid zzso zzso B zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso 2-6 and 8 showed moderate to marginal zzso with zzso values of zzso 

The isolation of zzso from zzso zzso and the zzso of 3-6 are first zzso zzso 2-6 and 8 could be the active principles responsible for the zzso effects of zzso zzso
