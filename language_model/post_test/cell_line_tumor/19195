Novel zzso are urgently needed to increase the sensitivity of zzso for the early detection of zzso zzso Indeed, it has been shown that as much as zzso of zzso patients do not express significant levels of this zzso zzso the possibility of using zzso directed against zzso zzso as putative cancer markers is being more zzso Indeed, many zzso have recently been shown to correlate with cancer patient prognosis or to be suitable for detection of the zzso 

In this study, we have used a new approach involving the use of zzso zzso and zzso methods to identify relevant zzso in the plasma of zzso cancer zzso To do so, we developed an innovative technique called two-dimensional differential gel zzso analysis of zzso tumor zzso 

This strategy allowed us to successfully identify novel circulating zzso directed against the zzso protein in the plasma of zzso cancer zzso Further real-time reverse zzso and zzso studies confirmed that the zzso zzso and protein were highly expressed in zzso tumors but absent in normal and benign zzso Moreover, a preliminary study involving 138 patients confirmed that the plasma levels of zzso zzso are significantly elevated in zzso and late-stage zzso cancer patients compared with healthy controls and with patients with benign zzso zzso 

This shows that our approach is a valuable tool to successfully identify zzso and zzso zzso in cancer patients and that future research assessing their putative clinical usefulness would be zzso
