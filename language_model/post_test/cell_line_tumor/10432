It is well known that zzso possesses protective activity on neurodegenerative zzso However, the exact path way involved in the protective effect of zzso on zzso zzso cell death is zzso In this study, we focused on zzso zzso zzso in the zzso process of zzso zzso zzso cells and detected the protection of zzso As evidenced by zzso blue zzso the cell viability was significantly decreased by 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso but reversed by different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso zzso cells zzso and arrested the cells in zzso phase, where as zzso zzso concentration zzso reversed the zzso zzso In addition to the zzso ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso even altered the zzso zzso zzso phase zzso zzso zzso suggested that zzso significantly opened zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso attenuated the deterioration of the zzso Both zzso and Western zzso showed that zzso prevented the release of zzso c from the zzso interior to the zzso zzso by zzso DNA zzso showed that typical DNA zzso was present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso enhanced zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, while not zzso zzso enhancement was concentration zzso blocked by zzso zzso Taken together, zzso can zzso zzso membrane potential and inhibit the zzso c zzso cascade to zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso
