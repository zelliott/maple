To establish a lung cancer zzso cell line stable zzso human zzso linked zzso zzso and study the effect of zzso of zzso on biological activity of zzso zzso 

Human zzso gene was amplified by zzso then cloned into zzso zzso to construct zzso After confirmed by restriction analysis and sequencing, the zzso zzso was zzso into zzso cells zzso with zzso then zzso clones of zzso cells zzso as experimental group were zzso and paralleled with the zzso control zzso and zzso cell zzso The expression and zzso of zzso fusion protein in zzso cells was observed by zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso were performed to detect the level of zzso zzso and zzso protein of each group cells zzso The cell proliferation was tested by zzso zzso zzso zzso and the cell zzso was measured by flow zzso and the zzso changes of cells were observed by HE zzso 

Both restriction analysis and sequencing proved that the zzso zzso was constructed zzso The distribution of zzso of stable zzso zzso cells indicated that the product of zzso gene was mainly located in zzso Compared with zzso group and zzso group, the level of zzso zzso and zzso protein of zzso cells were significantly increased, which zzso ratio was zzso and zzso respectively ( zzso The proliferation ability of the zzso cells zzso zzso was increased significantly ( zzso However, the zzso of zzso cell was inhibited significantly by zzso of zzso ( zzso After HE zzso the increased zzso were observed only in zzso group zzso 

The lung cancer cell line stable zzso zzso protein was constructed zzso and zzso zzso could promote cell zzso inhibit cell zzso and increase zzso
