Although the role of zzso in tumor progression has been studied zzso its impact on drug delivery in tumors remains far from zzso In this study, we examined the effect of zzso blockade on the delivery and efficacy of conventional zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso We used both genetic zzso of zzso a soluble zzso type II zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso approaches to block zzso zzso In two zzso zzso zzso models zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso zzso blockade significantly decreased tumor growth and zzso zzso blockade also increased the recruitment and incorporation of zzso cells into tumor blood vessels and increased the fraction of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso blockade zzso the tumor zzso zzso by decreasing collagen I zzso As a result of this vessel and zzso zzso zzso zzso blockade improved the zzso penetration of both a zzso conventional zzso drug and a zzso agent, leading to better control of tumor zzso
