zzso zzso the most abundant human adrenal zzso improves insulin sensitivity and obesity in human and model zzso In a previous study, we reported that orally administered zzso suppresses the elevated activities of zzso zzso zzso like zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms by which zzso ameliorates insulin resistance are not clearly zzso In the present study, we cultured the human zzso cell line zzso with zzso and measured the zzso activity and protein expression of zzso to investigate the direct effect of zzso on zzso metabolism in zzso zzso significantly suppressed both the activity and protein expression of zzso Moreover, zzso decreased the gene expression of zzso and zzso zzso both of which were zzso at 1 zzso zzso whereas the zzso level of zzso zzso was zzso Furthermore, zzso enhanced zzso zzso although its effect was much smaller than that of zzso These results suggest that zzso may act at multiple steps in the regulation of zzso metabolism in the zzso
