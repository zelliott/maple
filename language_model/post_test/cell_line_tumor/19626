The aim of this study was to investigate the cellular effects of zzso on the growth and zzso of human zzso zzso zzso cells and to provide the molecular mechanism for potential application of a zzso zzso carrying the zzso gene zzso in the treatment of liver zzso 

Human zzso cells zzso were infected with zzso at different zzso In zzso cell growth was determined by zzso zzso Cellular zzso was evaluated zzso and zzso by zzso zzso transmission electron zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso 

zzso infection had an zzso effect on the proliferation of zzso zzso The zzso changes of zzso were confirmed by zzso and DNA zzso The zzso characteristics of zzso cells, such as zzso zzso and nuclear zzso were also observed by electron zzso in the zzso zzso zzso infection markedly induced cellular zzso and zzso expression on zzso cells infected by zzso was zzso 

The fact that zzso can induce zzso of the zzso cell line zzso leads us to consider zzso delivery of zzso as a promising approach for the treatment of zzso However, the underlying mechanism needs to be further zzso
