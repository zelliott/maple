Because zzso interference zzso can be applied to any zzso this technique has been widely used for studying gene zzso In addition, many researchers are attempting to use zzso technology in zzso zzso However, several challenging and controversial issues have arisen during the widespread application of zzso including target gene zzso target cell zzso and zzso control of gene zzso To address these issues, several groups have zzso zzso to control the zzso release, both zzso and zzso In this Account, we focus on recent studies using zzso protecting groups, zzso Hand gold zzso for zzso zzso In 2005 the first report of zzso zzso used a zzso short interfering zzso zzso an zzso carrying a zzso protecting zzso zzso groups block the zzso of target zzso but allow for complete recovery of these functions via zzso However, some zzso activity can occur in these zzso zzso so it will be necessary to decrease this zzso and raise the zzso activity restored after zzso This technique also uses zzso light around 350 zzso which is zzso but in the near future we expect that it will be possible to use visible and zzso light We also examine the application of zzso zzso zzso to zzso technology, which involves a combination of zzso and zzso Instead of inducing zzso using light, the strategy behind this method was to enhance zzso using zzso zzso Many zzso zzso carriers deliver zzso into cells by zzso The zzso are trapped in zzso zzso and have to be released into the zzso in order to express their zzso To achieve the zzso escape of zzso zzso technology employed zzso to generate zzso zzso oxygen species zzso that disrupted the zzso zzso In most studies, zzso zzso of the target gene was detected even without zzso Recently, a zzso capable of zzso the zzso in zzso zzso controlled zzso almost entirely by zzso zzso uses zzso carrier proteins that can be activated over a wide range of visible light zzso With this method zzso zzso complexes are completely trapped within zzso and zzso is controlled strictly by zzso Such precise, zzso control will open up new possibilities for cellular and molecular biology and zzso Most recently, gold zzso zzso zzso to zzso have provided zzso and spatial control of zzso The zzso melting of zzso accompanied by a shape transformation zzso the release of zzso zzso from zzso In this method, the unique optical properties of the zzso enable deep penetration of the zzso light into zzso at zzso zzso The development of zzso zzso technology will lead to novel insights into gene functions and selective drug delivery, and many other scientific fields will continue to influence its zzso
