zzso zzso tumors zzso can be successfully treated with zzso zzso zzso however, complete zzso are rare and patients frequently achieve disease stabilization in the presence of residual tumor zzso The clinical observation that zzso of treatment can lead to tumor progression suggests that residual tumor cells are, in fact, zzso and, therefore, able to re-enter the zzso zzso In line with this notion, we have previously shown that zzso zzso zzso cell zzso in zzso through the zzso signaling zzso Here, we provide evidence that zzso zzso zzso cell zzso in zzso and that this process also involves the DREAM complex, a zzso complex that has recently been identified as an additional key regulator of zzso zzso zzso of DREAM complex formation by depletion of the DREAM regulatory zzso zzso or its target zzso was found to enhance zzso cell zzso Our results show that zzso zzso zzso in a fraction of zzso cells while, at the same time, a subset of cells zzso zzso involving the DREAM zzso zzso of this process enhances zzso zzso which opens the opportunity for future therapeutic interventions to target the DREAM complex for more efficient zzso zzso
