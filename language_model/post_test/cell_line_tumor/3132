The present study investigated the biological zzso of zzso activity in the zzso of a wastewater treatment plant zzso and in the recipient river in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and those of river water upstream and downstream the zzso were taken from September 2006 to May zzso The zzso was evaluated in the presence and absence of zzso The zzso zzso with human zzso zzso zzso zzso breast cancer cells, was performed on samples after zzso extraction to determine the total zzso activity by measuring the zzso equivalent quantity zzso In order to study the correlation between zzso and zzso zzso samples were also zzso with the acute toxicity test zzso Furthermore, to determine the efficiency of the zzso process, all the samples were zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The mean zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso upstream of the plant, zzso zzso zzso zzso downstream from the plant and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The difference between upstream and downstream of the treatment plant was not zzso zzso water samples had lower zzso activity and zzso coli zzso but had greater toxicity and higher zzso zzso zzso activity was not correlated with zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso had little impact on the zzso activity of the recipient zzso
