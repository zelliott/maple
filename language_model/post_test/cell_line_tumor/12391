zzso is a zzso zzso from its zzso domain zzso zzso which contains the zzso sequence enabling cell penetration on its zzso terminal zzso We have found that this zzso zzso zzso but not zzso of a variety of human tumor cell lines, including several with zzso deletion of zzso and a zzso rat zzso pancreatic zzso cell line, zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso has no effect on zzso cells, such as rat pancreatic zzso cells, zzso and human breast zzso cells and no effect on the differentiation of human stem zzso In this study, we now test zzso in zzso for its ability to block the growth of zzso zzso zzso When administered over a zzso period in the zzso cavities of nude mice containing simultaneously transplanted tumors, zzso causes complete destruction of these zzso When delivered zzso with tumor zzso at a remote site, zzso causes a complete blockade of any tumor growth during its zzso period of administration and 2 weeks zzso followed by weak tumor growth that zzso at low tumor sizes compared with tumor growth in the presence of a control zzso When administered after tumor growth has occurred at a site remote from the zzso zzso causes a decrease in tumor size followed by a slow increase in tumor growth that is significantly slower than growth in the presence of control zzso These results suggest that zzso may be effective in treating zzso especially if delivered directly to the zzso
