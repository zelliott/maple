zzso manipulation of zzso zzso producer zzso species is a rational approach to understand zzso processes and create new zzso In this study, the zzso gene zzso was zzso by zzso of an zzso gene zzso zzso into the zzso of the zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produced by this zzso strain were isolated and zzso such as new compound zzso This compound could be converted to compound zzso another new zzso zzso by a strain of zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso was zzso These new compounds exhibited reductions of zzso against zzso cancer cells, but increases of zzso zzso These results suggest that a new zzso zzso modification was involved in this process to produce new zzso zzso
