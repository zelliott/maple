To investigate the expression of zzso resistance gene zzso and zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso cell line) and the zzso resistance zzso cell lines zzso transformed from zzso cells by zzso and underlying mechanisms of zzso 

The zzso resistance sensitivities of zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were examined by zzso zzso zzso The zzso and protein expressions of zzso resistance genes zzso and zzso were zzso with zzso Western zzso and laser zzso zzso zzso signal proteins were detected through Western zzso 

The zzso resistance of zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso and VCR was more than that of zzso zzso The expression of zzso in zzso cells was significantly higher than that in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but the expression of zzso in zzso cells was significantly lower than that in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso signal was inhibited in zzso or zzso cells and the inhibited zzso was zzso by zzso or zzso (an zzso for zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in zzso cells, but not in zzso cells zzso by zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso in zzso cells were the main features of zzso in zzso zzso in which zzso signal zzso pathways could play an important zzso
