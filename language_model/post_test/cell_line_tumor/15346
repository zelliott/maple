Loss of primary zzso is frequently observed in zzso cells, including zzso cells, and proposed to benefit zzso growth, but a zzso link has not been zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso cell zzso inhibit zzso zzso of zzso leads to zzso of zzso at zzso tips, altered zzso transport and zzso of cell cycle re-entry in zzso zzso In zzso cells with zzso high levels of zzso its depletion restores zzso through zzso and an zzso zzso zzso thereby zzso zzso cell zzso These results indicate that zzso of zzso might be a mechanism used by cancer cells to provide a growth zzso
