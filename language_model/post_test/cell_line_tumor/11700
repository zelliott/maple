zzso zzso has previously been isolated from the zzso fungus zzso zzso Although the zzso activities of zzso have been reported, little is known concerning the molecular mechanism of its zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the effect of zzso on the growth of several types of cancer cell lines and investigated the mechanism of its zzso zzso zzso caused the growth zzso of human cancer lines zzso zzso and zzso but had little zzso effect on zzso normal lung zzso zzso also significantly caused cell cycle arrest in the zzso phase and zzso the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso protein in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to induce marked nuclear zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso induced zzso and loss of zzso membrane potential zzso in the zzso zzso Although the activated forms of zzso and zzso in zzso cells were zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso failed to zzso zzso cell zzso In addition, protein levels of the zzso family members, zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso significantly increased the zzso expression of zzso zzso family genes zzso zzso zzso Bad and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso In conclusion, zzso demonstrates potential for use in the treatment of cervical zzso
