zzso linkage of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso results in zzso zzso of zzso by zzso cells zzso In this study, we analyzed the thesis that zzso complexes may be zzso by B cells to route zzso zzso into the class I zzso presentation zzso First, we describe that zzso of zzso to zzso enhances up to zzso zzso of zzso by B cells, which in turn generate the zzso T cell zzso zzso zzso to zzso class I, albeit less efficiently than zzso Furthermore, upon zzso zzso zzso to zzso stimulates B cells to zzso zzso molecules and zzso including zzso zzso transfer of zzso zzso zzso B cells zzso zzso zzso T cells both in zzso mice and in zzso zzso Overall, these findings disclose attributes of B cells, including zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso T cells that zzso have been considered as hallmarks restricted to zzso
