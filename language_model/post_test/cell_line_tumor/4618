Although zzso tumors reside in an zzso environment, T cells can circumvent immune privilege and mediate tumor rejection without inducing damage to normal zzso zzso In this study, we used a zzso zzso zzso zzso type 5 early region 1), to analyze the role of zzso T cells in the pristine rejection of zzso zzso It has been previously documented that zzso tumor rejection can occur in the absence of zzso T zzso However, here we find that zzso T cells infiltrated zzso zzso tumors in zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso T cells from zzso mice could mediate zzso tumor rejection following adoptive transfer to zzso zzso In determining the mechanisms behind zzso T zzso tumor zzso we discovered that zzso zzso activity was neither observed nor necessary for rejection of the zzso zzso zzso T cells from zzso mice did not produce zzso in response to zzso tumor zzso or use zzso to mediate zzso tumor zzso Also, zzso T cells did not use zzso or zzso as zzso T cells from zzso knockout zzso and TRAIL zzso mice zzso protection to zzso recipient mice following adoptive zzso We discovered that zzso T cells used zzso to mediate tumor zzso because zzso tumor cells were highly sensitive to zzso zzso and zzso T cells from zzso zzso mice did not protect zzso mice from progressive zzso tumor zzso The results indicate that zzso T cells circumvent immune privilege and mediate zzso tumor rejection by a zzso manner while leaving the eye intact and vision zzso
