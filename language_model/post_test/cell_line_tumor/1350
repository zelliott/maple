To investigate the impact of zzso combined with zzso on the zzso zzso invasion, and zzso of gastrointestinal zzso zzso cells in zzso 

zzso zzso was used to investigate the effect of the two agents on proliferation of zzso Plate colony forming zzso was used to determine the number of zzso zzso and invasion abilities were tested to evaluate the zzso effect of each zzso zzso zzso was used to observe zzso and cell zzso 

zzso or zzso effectively inhibited the growth of zzso cells in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso rate of combined treatment using zzso and zzso was significantly higher than that of zzso or zzso zzso zzso After treatment for 48 zzso the zzso rates of zzso group zzso zzso and zzso group zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso Compared with the control group zzso the difference was statistically zzso Furthermore, the difference in zzso rate was significant between combined treatment group zzso and single drug treatment zzso zzso group, zzso zzso zzso group, zzso zzso raised zzso ratio and reduced S ratio of zzso zzso and combined group had no apparent influence on the cell cycle of zzso zzso 

zzso may be a potential agent of zzso treatment in the near zzso
