The present study identified a novel mechanism of induction of zzso in zzso cells by zzso - a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso cell viability by increasing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso induced zzso of both zzso and zzso it was the zzso of zzso that attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso also increased the expression of zzso zzso and zzso involved in zzso regulation and zzso zzso associated with DNA damage response in a zzso zzso Treatment with zzso increased Ras activity in zzso cells, and zzso of cells with zzso active zzso further zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso activity independent of zzso Taken together, our findings indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso and reduces zzso cell proliferation by zzso zzso zzso and zzso also decreases zzso activity in a zzso zzso
