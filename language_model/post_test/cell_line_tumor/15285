The in zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso is one of the most widely practiced zzso in genetic zzso zzso detects forward zzso at the zzso zzso zzso locus of the zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line derived from a mouse zzso zzso This zzso is capable of detecting a wide range of genetic events including point zzso deletions zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso There are two equally accepted versions of the zzso one using soft zzso cloning and the second method using liquid media cloning in zzso zzso There are two zzso distinct types of zzso colonies recovered in the zzso small- and zzso zzso The induction of zzso zzso is associated with chemicals inducing gross zzso aberrations whereas the induction of large zzso colonies is generally associated with chemicals inducing point zzso The source and zzso of the cell line as well as the culture conditions are important variables that could influence the zzso zzso The zzso when performed according to the standards recommended by the International zzso on zzso Testing is capable of providing valuable zzso hazard information as part of the overall safety assessment process of various classes of test zzso
