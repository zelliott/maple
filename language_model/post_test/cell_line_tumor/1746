Our recent studies have revealed that among the 10 different commonly used zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso human liver cancer cells extremely efficiently because these cells express high levels of human zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as a cellular zzso for viral zzso In this report, we provide further evidence that both zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso of zzso are involved in zzso zzso entry and zzso zzso zzso We also document that zzso zzso are targeted for degradation by the host cell zzso machinery, and that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso significantly improves the zzso efficiency of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso efficiency of the zzso zzso zzso is significantly higher than each of the single zzso in liver cancer cells in zzso In zzso mouse zzso models, direct zzso injection of zzso zzso also led to zzso zzso of human liver tumor cells in zzso We also document here that the zzso zzso zzso zzso lead to increased zzso efficiency following both zzso and zzso injections in zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso genes should prove useful for the potential gene therapy of human liver zzso
