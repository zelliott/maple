To examine whether zzso zzso could prevent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso expression of zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso was induced in rats and mice by clamping the left branches of the portal vein and the zzso zzso Cancer cells were injected zzso The number of zzso zzso was counted on day 7 after zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso serum zzso degradation products and zzso tissue levels of zzso a stable zzso of zzso were zzso 

AT inhibited increases in zzso zzso of tumor cells and zzso tissue zzso levels of zzso and zzso in animals subjected to zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso did not suppress any of these zzso Both AT and zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso increases of zzso tissue levels of zzso were significantly enhanced by zzso zzso with zzso completely reversed the effects of zzso Administration of zzso a stable zzso zzso showed effects similar to those of AT in this zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso mice subjected to zzso zzso was significantly increased compared to that observed in zzso zzso Administration of AT significantly reduced the number of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

AT might reduce zzso zzso zzso of colon cancer cells by zzso zzso expression of zzso through an increase in the zzso production of zzso These findings also raise the possibility that AT might prevent zzso zzso of tumor cells if administered during the zzso of liver zzso
