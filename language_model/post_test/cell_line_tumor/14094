The zzso zzso zzso of human breast cancer zzso zzso 1 shares zzso identity to the human zzso zzso zzso in zzso acid zzso We tested zzso for suppression of zzso of mouse zzso zzso cell line zzso in zzso zzso mice, using zzso zzso fat zzso injection as well as intravenous zzso As observed for zzso zzso with zzso did not inhibit zzso primary tumor formation, but significantly suppressed lung zzso We also show that zzso protein interacts with zzso zzso indicating involvement of zzso in zzso zzso complex, like its human zzso Thus, because of similarities with its human zzso the results suggest that zzso will be useful as a model for studying mechanism of action of zzso
