Acute zzso leukemia zzso remains a major therapeutic challenge in pediatric zzso even with intensified zzso zzso zzso zzso new therapies are urgently needed to improve treatment outcome of this deadly zzso In this study, we evaluated zzso interactions between zzso (a second-generation zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso a zzso agent for treating zzso in both children and adult and a zzso zzso zzso in pediatric zzso 

In zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the pediatric zzso cell lines and diagnostic blasts were measured by using zzso zzso The effects of zzso and zzso on zzso and DNA double strand breaks zzso were determined by flow zzso analysis and Western zzso zzso Active form of zzso was measured by Western zzso zzso 

We demonstrated synergistic zzso activities between zzso and zzso in both pediatric zzso cell lines and diagnostic blasts sensitive to zzso In contrast, antagonism between the two agents could be detected in zzso cells resistant to zzso zzso and zzso cooperate in inducing DNA zzso accompanied by zzso zzso and zzso in pediatric zzso zzso 

Our results document synergistic zzso activities of combined zzso and zzso in pediatric zzso and suggest that this combination could be an alternative treatment option for the zzso
