Adult zzso leukemia zzso is an aggressive type of zzso originating from zzso infected with human zzso leukemia virus type zzso zzso evidence suggests the zzso zzso of zzso to be a zzso factor zzso the abnormal proliferation of zzso cells, thus resulting in the development of zzso A rearranged zzso zzso gene was isolated from an zzso cell line, which was generated by a zzso zzso The isolated zzso B2 zzso is fused with the with no zzso deficient protein zzso 1 zzso coding for a 58 zzso protein that retains the DNA binding zzso zzso domain, but it lacks the entire zzso repeat zzso domain, thus suggesting its zzso zzso This rearranged zzso B2 gene product zzso was localized in the nucleus, and formed a complex with zzso zzso or zzso Moreover, a zzso line expressing zzso increased the amount of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso These results suggest that such zzso B2 gene zzso may therefore be a factor in the zzso zzso of zzso in ATL, and thereby playing a role in the ATL zzso
