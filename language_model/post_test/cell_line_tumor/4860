zzso zzso zzso is a DNA repair zzso whose expression is controlled by its promoter zzso A cell that expresses a low amount of zzso is known to be more sensitive to the zzso effects of zzso zzso We have previously shown that the zzso cancer patients treated with zzso zzso as zzso chemotherapy had a better prognosis when the tumor revealed zzso in its zzso zzso zzso we sought to investigate the relationship between the expression levels of zzso and the zzso effect of zzso in zzso by using two colon zzso and four oral cancer cell lines with a variety of zzso zzso We also investigated the effects of zzso depletion by zzso zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso The zzso treatment zzso depleted protein and zzso expression of zzso in all cell lines zzso Cell lines expressing low levels of zzso were sensitive to zzso On the other hand, cells expressing high levels of zzso were less sensitive to zzso The zzso treatment exhibited a better zzso effect on the cells expressing high levels of zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso by zzso enhanced the zzso effect of zzso Assessment of the levels of zzso expression in cancer cells and the control of its expression could contribute to the effective chemotherapy by zzso especially in patients who previously were considered as zzso individuals whose tumors have high levels of zzso
