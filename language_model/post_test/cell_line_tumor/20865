zzso zzso zzso is a key regulator of the cellular responses to DNA zzso However, zzso functions of zzso zzso are poorly zzso We have recently shown that soluble zzso can trigger zzso but the mechanisms leading to zzso zzso are zzso Here, we tested whether zzso of DNA zzso a common event in cancer cells and the underlying mechanism of various zzso agents, can trigger increased soluble zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso was found to lead to a zzso fraction of soluble zzso and was associated with increased zzso This effect was enhanced by the induction of DNA replication stress using the DNA zzso alpha inhibitor zzso zzso manipulated to zzso express zzso did not contain soluble zzso however, short-term treatment with zzso (1 zzso resulted in zzso amounts of zzso in the soluble nuclear fraction and enhanced zzso Similarly, soluble zzso zzso was detected under these zzso We found that excessive soluble zzso causes zzso zzso and zzso of ongoing gene zzso as evidenced by the zzso and/or loss of active zzso zzso II as well as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

Taken together, these results show that DNA replication stress rapidly leads to increased soluble zzso and that zzso zzso can sensitize cells to undergo zzso Our findings encourage further studies to explore zzso and the cellular pathways that control its expression as zzso drug zzso
