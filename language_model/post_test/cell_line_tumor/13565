zzso are major players in zzso gene zzso Even small changes in zzso levels may have profound consequences for the expression levels of target zzso zzso zzso themselves need to be zzso albeit zzso zzso Here, we investigated the dynamic behavior of zzso over a wide time range following stimulation of melanoma cells with zzso zzso which activates the zzso factor zzso By applying several zzso and statistical software tools for zzso and identification of zzso expressed zzso derived from zzso zzso experiments, zzso of zzso zzso appeared to be directly or indirectly regulated by zzso Focusing on distinct dynamic expression patterns, we found that the majority of robust zzso expression changes occurred in the intermediate time range zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso had a delayed regulation occurring at 72 h while none showed significant expression changes at early time points between 30 zzso and 6 zzso zzso patterns of individual zzso were altered gradually over time or abruptly increased or decreased between two time zzso Furthermore, we observed coordinated dynamic zzso of most zzso clusters while few were found to be regulated independently of their genetic zzso Most interestingly, several zzso or passenger strand sequences were specifically regulated over time while their zzso strands were zzso
