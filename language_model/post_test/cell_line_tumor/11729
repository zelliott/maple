In the present study, we investigated the effects of zzso zzso on the growth of A3 and its zzso zzso cell line, zzso both of which are zzso of a zzso zzso zzso cell line that lacks the classic zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the cell growth of both cell lines in a zzso and zzso manner to a similar extent, regardless of the status of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso was observed in both cell lines following treatment with 50 zzso zzso for 24 zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso was observed in A3 zzso The addition of the zzso inhibitor zzso significantly suppressed zzso zzso effects in both types of zzso Moreover, exposure to 50 zzso zzso for 48 and 72 h resulted in zzso zzso leakage characteristic of the disruption of cellular membrane zzso The function of membrane zzso zzso zzso coupled directly with the zzso protein was revealed based on the restoration of zzso loss of zzso membrane potential in the presence of zzso zzso an inhibitor specific for zzso zzso These results suggest that growth suppression accompanied with induction of zzso by zzso in both zzso clone cells was zzso through zzso membrane disruption followed by the zzso of the zzso zzso as a result of the zzso of zzso zzso The results of the present study provide novel insight into zzso actions toward its use for clinical application in patients with zzso T cell zzso
