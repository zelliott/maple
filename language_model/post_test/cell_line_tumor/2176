zzso zzso is an opportunistic pathogen in AIDS zzso It is an zzso but zzso zzso residing in a host zzso zzso zzso It is still poorly understood how this zzso interacts with host zzso We observed that expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene in host cells was significantly zzso upon zzso zzso infection, and a higher level of zzso protein was present in the zzso infection zzso The infection could be reduced by the treatment of zzso against zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as by type I collagen (an zzso zzso zzso We also generated stable zzso of zzso gene expression in zzso cells and observed consistent reduction of zzso infection in these zzso zzso zzso our evidence indicates that host cell zzso might be involved in interacting with zzso during infection, probably acting as part of the regulatory elements upstream of the reported recruiting and reorganization of F zzso at the infection zzso
