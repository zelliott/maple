The zzso growth factor zzso zzso is a promising target for cancer zzso The presence of certain zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso domain of the zzso gene is associated with clinical response to zzso zzso zzso in patients with lung zzso In this study we evaluated the status of zzso zzso in the entire zzso domain of the zzso gene by direct sequencing using early passage zzso zzso cells, established cell lines as well as 33 zzso zzso tumor zzso No novel zzso were found in the cell zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso domain revealed the presence of a silent zzso zzso zzso A, zzso at zzso 20 of both zzso zzso cell lines as well as tumor zzso The frequency of zzso AA and zzso was zzso and zzso in the cell lines and zzso and zzso in tumor zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed an zzso in the range of zzso zzso in five out of the seven cell lines with a zzso zzso while all five cell lines with the AA zzso had an zzso zzso zzso Of the 33 zzso zzso tumor samples analyzed none had an zzso zzso zzso zzso and only one zzso showed an earlier reported zzso zzso at zzso zzso in zzso 21 of the zzso zzso Our data show that patients with zzso zzso do not harbor zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain that would make them sensitive to zzso zzso
