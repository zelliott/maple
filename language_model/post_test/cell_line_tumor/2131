We previously developed a series of zzso agents based on zzso zzso inhibitor zzso as a lead zzso However, the molecular targets of these agents still remain zzso In this study, we zzso a zzso probe based on a representative zzso of the compound library and performed protein pull-down zzso to purify the zzso targets of the zzso Via zzso approaches, the major proteins bound to the probe were identified to be zzso and heat shock protein 27 zzso and the compound inhibited zzso zzso by binding at the zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso effect of the compound activated the zzso zzso and possibly overrode the direct zzso zzso effects, which made it difficult to solely validate the zzso zzso Taken together, the compound was a dual zzso of zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso and had the potential to be a class of new zzso zzso
