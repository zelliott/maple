zzso migration zzso factor zzso a zzso zzso is implicated in many aspects of tumor zzso including cell zzso invasion, and zzso We asked if zzso expression predicts survival and if it is associated with zzso and cell invasion in zzso We performed zzso for zzso expression in zzso biopsy specimens of 58 patients with zzso To investigate the role of zzso in zzso zzso density was measured and compared with zzso zzso We also treated zzso cell lines zzso and zzso with zzso and measured vascular zzso growth factor, a potent zzso factor, by zzso zzso zzso To study the role of zzso in cell invasion, zzso chamber zzso was performed after zzso of zzso by short interfering zzso zzso independently predicted overall survival and zzso zzso zzso expression correlated with zzso density and induced a zzso increase in vascular zzso growth zzso zzso of zzso by short interfering zzso resulted in decreased cell zzso These results suggest zzso could serve as a zzso marker and a potential therapeutic target for zzso
