zzso of the transforming growth zzso zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso cancer has been reported, but the precise mechanism underlying disrupted zzso signaling in the disease remains zzso We performed zzso zzso followed by sequencing zzso to investigate zzso screening of zzso zzso binding in zzso zzso zzso Following zzso stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso cancer cell line, we identified zzso zzso binding zzso and zzso zzso expressed zzso target zzso Comprehensive examination of zzso zzso revealed four distinct binding zzso 1) zzso 2) zzso 3) zzso zzso 4) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were primarily classified as either zzso only zzso or Shift zzso indicating that zzso alters zzso binding patterns in zzso zzso cancer zzso Furthermore, based on gene regulatory network analysis, we determined that the zzso zzso regulatory network was zzso different in zzso cancer compared to normal zzso zzso the zzso target genes identified in the zzso zzso zzso cancer cell line were zzso of patient survival, based on in zzso mining of zzso available patient data zzso In conclusion, our data highlight the utility of next generation sequencing technology to identify zzso zzso target genes in zzso zzso cancer and link zzso zzso signaling to zzso zzso Furthermore, the identified zzso binding zzso combined with gene expression profiling and in zzso data mining of patient zzso may provide a powerful approach to determine potential gene signatures with biological and future zzso research in zzso and other zzso
