During human pregnancy, zzso zzso and zzso activities are zzso The aim of the current study was to determine if this phenomenon can be zzso in the zzso and to evaluate the mechanisms that contribute to the changes in zzso and zzso activity during zzso The intrinsic clearance of zzso zzso a measure of zzso activity, was decreased zzso at both days 9 and 19 of gestation when compared to zzso zzso The decreased intrinsic clearance was a result of both decreased zzso and increased zzso at both days of zzso zzso zzso revealed that transcripts of zzso and zzso were significantly decreased at day 19 of pregnancy ( zzso when compared to day 9 and zzso zzso The decrease in zzso zzso levels correlated with a decrease in several nuclear zzso zzso levels zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not with the zzso levels of nuclear receptors usually associated with regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso zzso and protein expression were not significantly altered during rat pregnancy although the intrinsic clearance of zzso zzso zzso zzso was increased zzso on day 19 of gestation when compared to zzso zzso The increase in intrinsic clearance was due to a decrease in the zzso for zzso zzso These data show that pregnancy significantly alters the expression and activity of drug zzso zzso in an zzso and zzso stage specific zzso These changes are likely to have zzso and therapeutic zzso
