The differential recruitment of zzso proteins to the zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso gene zzso We previously isolated and identified zzso proteins 46 zzso and 48 zzso which are associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso repression, as proteins associated with the zzso zzso We now demonstrate that zzso and zzso interact with zzso zzso and in zzso associate with zzso at zzso zzso zzso and alter expression of zzso zzso and zzso genes in zzso breast cancer zzso Our findings reveal that zzso limits expression of zzso genes and that zzso zzso zzso responsiveness in a zzso zzso The ability of zzso and zzso to interact with zzso and influence its activity reveals yet another role for these zzso proteins in regulating gene zzso
