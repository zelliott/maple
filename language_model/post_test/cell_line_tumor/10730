The present study evaluated the efficacy of fennel seed zzso extract zzso for its zzso zzso and zzso activities and for its capacity to serve as a nontoxic zzso in Swiss zzso zzso We also assessed the natural zzso compounds of zzso for use in industrial zzso zzso activity of zzso was evaluated in a mouse model of zzso zzso zzso zzso and on different types of human cell lines in zzso The safety and optimum dose of zzso were zzso zzso 100 zzso was injected zzso into mice bearing zzso before the mice were exposed to three zzso doses of gamma zzso After 30 days, mice were zzso for 18 hours and then sacrificed to observe the lifespan of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso content, and total protein in serum, liver zzso and zzso fluid were zzso zzso total zzso capacity, zzso and zzso were also evaluated in zzso The data showed the presence of different types of compounds in zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was the zzso alcohol, zzso acid was the zzso compound zzso and zzso was the most prevalent zzso hydrocarbon zzso The zzso zzso 50% zzso zzso were zzso zzso for the zzso breast cancer cell line and zzso zzso for the zzso liver cancer cell zzso The significant increase in zzso levels and the significant decrease in zzso activity and zzso content in liver and tumor tissue in mice bearing zzso were ameliorated after zzso zzso In contrast, total protein content was increased in zzso zzso zzso iron was zzso zzso to the levels of zzso and zzso and total zzso zzso Administration of zzso before zzso exerted a zzso effect against gamma zzso as zzso by a restoration of the zzso level, zzso activity, and zzso content to zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso may have remarkable zzso potential against a breast cancer cell line zzso and liver cancer cell line zzso It also showed strong free zzso activity zzso Thus, zzso may reduce zzso stress and protect mouse cells from damage caused by zzso oxygen zzso In addition, it could be used as a safe, effective, and easily accessible source of natural antioxidants to improve the zzso stability of fatty foods during zzso zzso also exhibited an zzso effect by modulating zzso zzso and zzso the zzso defense system in zzso mice with or without exposure to zzso
