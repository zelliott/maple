The high mobility group zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso have been identified to play important roles in inflammation and cancer zzso but the relationships between the two and cancer remain zzso The current study investigated the relationship between zzso and the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was found unable to activate the zzso zzso and failed to induce the release of the zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso was also found significantly enhanced the activity of zzso to induce zzso and zzso by the induction of increased expression of zzso and zzso This process was dependent on zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso These results demonstrate that zzso promotes the synthesis of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso through zzso zzso likely plays an important role in the first step of the release of the zzso and zzso preparing for other zzso to induce excessive release of zzso and zzso which promote inflammation and cancer zzso
