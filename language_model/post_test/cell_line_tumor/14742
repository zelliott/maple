The main objective of this study was to prepare two types of zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso was zzso either on zzso zzso or as zzso complex onto the surface of zzso zzso Both types of zzso were prepared by the double emulsion zzso The zzso were characterized by their size, zzso potential and zzso or zzso complex zzso The zzso complex zzso was confirmed with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso onto zzso zzso zzso was studied by zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso efficiency of both types of zzso and zzso complexes zzso were studied in head and neck zzso zzso cell line zzso To improve zzso release, zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso potential increased when the zzso complex zzso onto zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso efficiency was achieved for zzso zzso In zzso zzso and cells viability on zzso cells with or without zzso were found to be variable depending on the type and concentration of zzso The results showed that zzso efficiency for zzso or zzso zzso ranged between 2 and zzso zzso zzso was found to slightly improve the zzso efficiency for all zzso
