zzso cancer is one of the most aggressive human tumors due to its high potential of local invasion and zzso The aim of this study was to characterize the membrane zzso of pancreatic zzso zzso zzso cells of primary and zzso origins, and to identify potential target proteins related to zzso of pancreatic zzso 

zzso proteins were isolated from zzso and zzso cells and identified with a zzso approach based on zzso zzso zzso zzso and liquid zzso with tandem mass zzso zzso zzso zzso was used for database searching against the zzso human protein zzso 

We identified 221 & 208 proteins from zzso and zzso cells, respectively, most of which are membrane or zzso zzso A hundred and nine proteins were found in both cell lines while the others were present in either zzso or zzso zzso zzso expressed proteins between two cell lines include zzso of cell zzso cell zzso or tumor invasion as well as zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso acid cycle, or zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells are remarkably zzso The zzso expressed membrane proteins may serve as potential targets for diagnostic and therapeutic zzso
