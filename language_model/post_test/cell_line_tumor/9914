The aim of the present study was to evaluate the in zzso effect of zzso zzso factor zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso implanted in zzso mice as experimental zzso We showed that the zzso administration of 100 zzso of zzso diminished tumor zzso while no zzso effect on zzso cell proliferation was observed in zzso zzso examination of zzso tumors revealed zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells were identified by zzso zzso Western zzso analysis of tumor zzso showed that zzso treatment increased the amount of zzso TRAIL and zzso zzso whereas decreased the expression of zzso 3 and zzso In addition, zzso zzso showed an zzso in the amount of zzso zzso and zzso Our results suggest that the presence of zzso within tumor zzso would induce an immune response which eliminates tumor cells by zzso Both death zzso and zzso pathways would be involved in zzso tumor cell zzso We believe that the final local zzso concentration at the tumor site and each particular type of tumor should be carefully taken into account in order to evaluate the effect of the zzso on tumor zzso
