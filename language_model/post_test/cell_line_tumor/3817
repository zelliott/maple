zzso zzso is the most common soft tissue zzso found in children and young zzso It is characterized by the expression of a number of skeletal zzso zzso including zzso and muscle zzso However, unlike normal zzso zzso cells differentiate poorly both in zzso and in zzso As zzso are known to regulate zzso intensive efforts have been made to identify zzso that are involved in zzso zzso In this work, we found that zzso was frequently zzso by promoter zzso in both zzso cell lines and zzso zzso and could be zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells inhibited their migration and proliferation and promoted terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso exerts its zzso effect by directly targeting zzso and leukemia zzso factor zzso in zzso cells, which promotes zzso differentiation by zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Our work reveals that zzso functions as a tumor zzso in zzso zzso
