zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso serves as a zzso zzso factor, turning on zzso of zzso genes in target zzso Numerous regulatory proteins interact with the zzso to influence zzso zzso zzso In this study, we have identified zzso which interacts with the DNA binding domain of zzso alpha when the zzso is free, but not when it is bound to an zzso response zzso zzso experiments demonstrate that zzso expressed zzso and zzso alpha from zzso breast cancer cells zzso Although zzso substantially enhances the association of the zzso with zzso response zzso DNA, zzso of zzso in zzso cells decreases zzso of an zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso alpha and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso of zzso alpha in zzso zzso Also binds to other nuclear receptors and zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our studies provide evidence that zzso plays a role in regulating zzso of zzso genes by modulating zzso of zzso and zzso alpha and also influences zzso of other zzso genes as zzso
