Heat is of fundamental importance in many cellular processes such as cell zzso cell division and gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso monitoring of temperature changes in individual cells could thus help clarify intricate cellular processes and develop new applications in biology and zzso Here we report the use of green fluorescent proteins zzso as zzso zzso suited for zzso temperature zzso zzso probing is achieved by monitoring the zzso polarization zzso of zzso The method is tested on zzso zzso and zzso zzso cancer cell lines where we monitored the heat delivery by zzso heating of gold zzso surrounding the zzso A spatial resolution of 300 zzso and a temperature accuracy of about zzso zzso are zzso zzso from its full zzso with widely used zzso cells, this approach provides a zzso tool for fundamental and applied research in areas ranging from molecular biology to therapeutic and diagnostic zzso
