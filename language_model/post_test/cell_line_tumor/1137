zzso of zzso zzso is commonly observed in human zzso In a zzso model of zzso breast cancer, we observed that zzso expression and zzso activity were associated with enhanced zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to the high zzso expression in zzso tumors, transplantation of poorly zzso tumor cell lines to zzso mice results in less zzso expression and less zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso island zzso and subsequent zzso of the zzso promoter, has been observed in human cancer cell lines and in some human tumors of the gastrointestinal zzso 

Using zzso modification and a zzso zzso we examined the zzso status of the zzso promoter in a series of four zzso zzso zzso tumors differing in zzso expression and zzso zzso 

We showed that line zzso which does not express zzso in zzso exhibited evidence of promoter zzso Interestingly, the zzso counterpart of this cell zzso zzso displayed only the zzso zzso promoter, as did two additional cell lines zzso zzso and zzso The zzso patterns observed in zzso were maintained when these zzso zzso tumor lines were transplanted to zzso zzso Treatment with the DNA zzso agent zzso increased zzso zzso increased protein and increased zzso activity zzso zzso 

These results indicate that zzso promoter zzso may be one mechanism by which tumor cells regulate zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression in closely related zzso zzso versus zzso zzso may represent a shift towards the zzso zzso
