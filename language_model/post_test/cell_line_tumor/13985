The zzso zzso of zzso is very important for their biological functions such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso cellular zzso zzso To increase the biological activity of a novel human zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso we tried to genetically convert its zzso from zzso to zzso 

zzso and zzso genes were cloned from the parental zzso zzso zzso and inserted into the zzso expression zzso which contained the constant region gene of human zzso The zzso gene was zzso into zzso insect cells to produce zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso designated zzso zzso in the culture medium was zzso by affinity zzso and characterized for its zzso binding activity and biological zzso 

The converted zzso zzso retained the original zzso activity and showed significantly higher zzso and zzso activities against zzso tumor cells than did the original zzso zzso 

zzso zzso may be useful for zzso zzso of human zzso zzso
