We decided to study the effect of zzso deprivation on collagen metabolism in zzso zzso The incorporation of zzso into zzso and zzso proteins was used as an index of collagen zzso whereas zzso technique was employed to evaluate the degradation of newly zzso zzso The zzso cells incubated in high zzso medium zzso zzso amounts of zzso zzso Most of them were found in the cell zzso The shortage of zzso resulted in about zzso reduction in collagen zzso The zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso less collagen was zzso in cultures incubated in zzso than in zzso zzso
