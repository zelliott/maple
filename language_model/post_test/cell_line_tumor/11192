zzso zzso relies upon a fine tuning of zzso zzso bone zzso and zzso zzso bone zzso This balance is zzso by multiple myeloma zzso cells, which impair zzso function and stimulate zzso to generate zzso zzso Emerging experimental evidence is disclosing a key regulatory role of zzso zzso in the regulation of bone zzso suggesting the zzso network as potential novel target for the treatment of zzso bone disease zzso Here, we report that zzso expression decreases progressively during human zzso differentiation in zzso We found that zzso zzso of zzso into zzso even in the presence of zzso cells, significantly zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso generation, and collagen degradation, which are relevant hallmarks of zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso K and zzso 9 zzso as well as zzso ring zzso were impaired in the presence of zzso Moreover, we found that zzso targets zzso and zzso 2 are suppressed by zzso zzso expression which also zzso the master zzso zzso factor, zzso Overall, these data indicate that enforced expression of zzso zzso zzso differentiation and overcomes zzso zzso triggered by zzso cells, providing a rationale for zzso treatment of zzso zzso
