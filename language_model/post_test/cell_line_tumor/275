zzso zzso zzso zzso is recognized as an important factor involved in the tumor zzso zzso Our previous study has indicated that the zzso cell line with zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso cell line with zzso of zzso zzso are accompanied with high zzso and low zzso zzso of zzso In the current study, 62 and 54 protein spots were observed zzso and zzso in zzso cell relative to the zzso cell line with zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso 113 unique proteins were identified by zzso zzso zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein 29 were validated by Western zzso zzso The zzso regulated proteins were zzso and zzso by protein analysis through evolutionary relationships analysis with the aid of the database for zzso zzso and integrated discovery zzso zzso gene candidates zzso expressed both at zzso and protein zzso By making a challenge, we detected expression levels of zzso A7 in primary gastric cancer zzso and primary zzso cancer zzso with zzso by zzso Higher ratio of positive and strong expressions zzso A7 in zzso might correlate with the tumor zzso The repression of zzso A7 zzso the mobility and invasion abilities of zzso cell, increases the zzso rate of zzso zzso Current study zzso and provides certain specific protein candidates potentially playing important roles in zzso zzso
