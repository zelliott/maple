zzso tail zzso modification results in changes in cellular zzso either by generating or blocking zzso sites for zzso code readers or by altering the higher order zzso zzso zzso is known to mark the promoter regions of active zzso zzso bind zzso in a zzso manner and aid in the recruitment of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso harbor zzso zzso binding zzso including plant zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the plant zzso present in zzso zzso as well as the zzso repeats of zzso reveals critical contacts between zzso in these zzso and zzso The intimate contact between zzso and these domain types leads to the hypothesis that zzso of this zzso zzso zzso the binding of zzso proteins to the zzso tail of zzso Here we show that zzso tail binding zzso proteins are indeed sensitive to zzso zzso and that zzso not zzso is the primary zzso acting on this zzso We have tested the expression of a select group of zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso cells and found that their levels are zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso and is a negative regulator of zzso zzso tail zzso
