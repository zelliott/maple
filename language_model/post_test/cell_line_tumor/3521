zzso are zzso zzso that inhibit cell growth by zzso existing zzso and zzso zzso zzso Since zzso are poor zzso for zzso they are attractive candidates for cancer therapy and have been undergoing clinical zzso The basis of resistance to a synthetic analogue of zzso zzso zzso was examined in cell populations derived from zzso zzso zzso cells selected in zzso zzso cells zzso series) were zzso resistant to zzso zzso zzso was observed to other zzso zzso drugs, with collateral sensitivity zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso of the percentage of zzso and soluble zzso in zzso parental and zzso cells zzso the zzso zzso zzso At 22 degrees C or 37 degrees C, in the absence of any drug, the percentage of zzso zzso for each of the zzso populations was greater than that in the zzso parental cells, consistent with more stable zzso Furthermore, zzso in the zzso populations were also more resistant to zzso at 4 degrees C and had more zzso and zzso zzso zzso all characteristic of more stable zzso The zzso cell populations exhibited either a single zzso change in the zzso zzso zzso zzso or in two cell populations where no zzso zzso was zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in one resistant cell population and zzso in zzso Unlike reports of zzso resulting in reduced drug zzso the experimental data and location of zzso are consistent with resistance to zzso zzso by zzso zzso in zzso or zzso
