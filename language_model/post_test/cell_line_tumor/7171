The human zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso mainly zzso by the liver, that displays protective properties toward cardiovascular disease and zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso found in grapes and wine and is thought to display zzso zzso It is able to interact with zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso alpha zzso We investigated the effect of zzso on the zzso gene zzso 

zzso activity zzso Northern zzso and zzso experiments showed that zzso increased the zzso gene expression in human zzso primary cultures and in the zzso zzso cell line involving a zzso zzso The zzso effect was not zzso and was surprisingly zzso by the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso and an unconventional zzso responsive element in the zzso gene zzso This zzso effect of zzso was specific for this DNA motif and was not observed on classical zzso responsive zzso 

These observations suggest that the zzso gene induction may be involved in the zzso properties of zzso They also highlight a zzso differential zzso of zzso zzso
