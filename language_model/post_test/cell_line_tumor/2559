Recent research has suggested that the zzso zzso 155 zzso is zzso in zzso zzso zzso In this study, the authors investigated the zzso mechanism of this zzso in the development of zzso 

zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso was conducted to analyze the expressions of zzso and its potential target genes in paired tumor zzso and adjacent zzso zzso and in zzso liver tissue zzso The in zzso predicted target genes of zzso were assessed by zzso reporting zzso real-time zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso promoters that drive zzso precursor zzso and zzso tough decoy zzso zzso were used to study its affects on cell proliferation in zzso and on tumor formation in nude zzso 

zzso zzso demonstrated a gradual ascension of zzso expression in zzso liver zzso and in zzso tumor zzso compared with low expression levels in normal liver zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells enhanced its zzso whereas depletion of the zzso zzso reversed these zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso region Y box 6 zzso was able to reverse the zzso property of zzso zzso the results demonstrated for the first time that zzso is a direct target of zzso Further analysis revealed that zzso reduced cell growth by zzso zzso expression in a zzso zzso In addition, a decline in zzso expression caused by zzso could be reversed by zzso zzso 

The current data indicated that zzso is a novel target of zzso and that zzso enhances liver cell zzso at least in part through the novel zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso may be a potential target for zzso zzso
