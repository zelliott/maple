zzso are novel small zzso zzso molecules that regulate gene expression at the zzso zzso zzso evidence reveals that there is a zzso link between zzso deregulation and cancer development and zzso The present study aims to explore the function of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and invasion of zzso cell lung zzso Using real-time zzso we detected the zzso expression of normal lung zzso tumor zzso human normal zzso zzso cell line, and six lung cancer cell lines zzso Then, we evaluated the role of zzso in cell zzso zzso and invasion using Cell Counting zzso zzso zzso zzso wound healing, and zzso zzso in zzso As a result, zzso expression level was lower in high zzso tumors and zzso than low zzso tumors and normal lung zzso as well as other zzso After zzso was zzso in zzso cell proliferation was notably attenuated and zzso was significantly zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso inhibited migration and invasion of lung cancer zzso In conclusion, our data suggest that expression level of zzso was zzso correlated with zzso potential of lung zzso
