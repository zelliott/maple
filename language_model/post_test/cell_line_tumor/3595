zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso family, zzso the expression of zzso zzso in adrenal zzso zzso In addition, zzso and its zzso have been detected in human zzso zzso and cell lines, though it is not yet known whether zzso enhances the expression of genes zzso zzso zzso To address this question, we analyzed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

The levels of zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as their receptors and the zzso for zzso were measured by zzso or real-time zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was detected in all of 16 zzso and 3 cell lines that were zzso while zzso zzso was detected in 5 of 16 zzso tissue and 2 of 3 cell zzso zzso zzso was detected in 6 out of 16 zzso zzso and none of 3 cell zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso were detected in many zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, neither in zzso nor cell lines did zzso zzso expression correlate with zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso is not involved in the regulation of expression of zzso in zzso
