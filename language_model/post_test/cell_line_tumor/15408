The characterization of zzso heavy chain zzso zzso provides information on the diagnosis and guides therapeutic decisions in mature zzso zzso while enhancing our understanding of normal and zzso zzso zzso However, existing zzso for the detection of zzso zzso are labor zzso often require viable cells, and are biased toward known zzso zzso To overcome these limitations, we developed a capture sequencing strategy for the identification of zzso zzso at zzso level resolution and tested its capabilities as a diagnostic and discovery tool in 78 primary diffuse large zzso zzso zzso We readily identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and discovered zzso zzso and zzso zzso as novel zzso partners in these zzso zzso and zzso expression was significantly higher in zzso with zzso zzso targeting these zzso Modeling the deregulation of zzso and zzso in zzso defined a zzso profile characterized by zzso of AID and/or zzso zzso of zzso and resistance to zzso Using a capture sequencing strategy, we discovered the zzso relevant genes zzso zzso and zzso as novel targets for zzso zzso This methodology is poised to change how zzso zzso are identified in clinical settings while remaining a powerful tool to uncover the zzso of zzso zzso
