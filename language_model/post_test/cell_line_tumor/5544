We zzso the expression of zzso and zzso in primary zzso zzso tumors and zzso model zzso In tumors, zzso of zzso correlated closely with its zzso zzso zzso of both transcripts was zzso associated with poor prognosis and with the expression of the zzso factor zzso In cell culture, we identified zzso as a direct zzso target of zzso zzso primarily when zzso and zzso two other zzso targets, are strongly zzso zzso zzso indirectly zzso zzso through suppression of zzso and induction of zzso which in turn favors the degradation of zzso In addition, increased zzso protein stability via zzso is zzso by expression of zzso targets such as zzso In line with this, selective knock down of zzso inhibited zzso abundance and suppressed its zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is induced via a functional cooperation between zzso and zzso
