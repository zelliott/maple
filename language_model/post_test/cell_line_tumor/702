The identification of target genes is a key step for assessing the role of zzso expressed zzso zzso in human cancer and for the further development of zzso gene zzso zzso is a zzso zzso accounting for zzso of the total zzso zzso Its zzso is a common feature of both human and mouse zzso zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso can regulate the expression of zzso zzso whose high levels have been reported in several human zzso We evaluated the role of zzso and zzso zzso expression in zzso and in response to treatment with zzso and their relevance on survival and time to recurrence zzso of zzso zzso We proved that, by modulating zzso zzso zzso influences zzso protein stability and zzso activity and reduces invasion capability of zzso cell zzso In addition, in a therapeutic perspective, we zzso the effects of a restored zzso expression in triggering zzso zzso and we proved that zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso increases sensitivity to zzso zzso In patients zzso for zzso lower zzso levels were associated with a shorter zzso whereas higher zzso zzso expression was related to a lower survival, suggesting that zzso might represent an effective molecular target for zzso Our findings establish a basis toward the development of combined zzso and zzso therapy for zzso zzso
