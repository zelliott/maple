zzso transfer of proteins across the zzso zzso is emerging as a common outcome of immune zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso class I protein transfers onto natural killer zzso cells expressing zzso killer zzso receptors zzso We now show that, for both zzso and human cells, target cells expressing zzso zzso class I zzso acquire zzso zzso zzso zzso Other zzso zzso but not a zzso zzso also transferred from human zzso cells to target cells across an zzso zzso zzso The number of zzso acquired from zzso cells correlated with the level of expression of zzso zzso class I protein on target zzso Treatment with zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso influences zzso transfer of proteins in both zzso In contrast to zzso expressed zzso a fraction of acquired zzso could be removed by mild acid zzso demonstrating a difference between some of the acquired zzso and zzso expressed zzso An zzso of zzso at the location of the transferred zzso implies a signaling capacity for zzso cell proteins transferred to target zzso Thus, zzso protein transfer between immune cells is zzso and could facilitate new aspects of immune cell zzso
