A new human zzso zzso family zzso was recently identified from the human zzso zzso The zzso was zzso zzso in length with typical zzso structure zzso We investigated pol fragments of zzso family in various human zzso and cancer zzso The pol gene was expressed in only brain and zzso among human zzso zzso zzso zzso heart, zzso liver, zzso zzso skeletal muscle, zzso zzso zzso whereas the pol gene was detected in various cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso except for zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso and sequencing data of the 33 clones imply that the pol gene of zzso family is more active in cancer cells than in human zzso which may have zzso potential role related to various human zzso zzso analysis of zzso pol family zzso divided into three groups zzso I, II, and zzso through evolutionary divergence in zzso zzso zzso divergence of the zzso family by zzso amplification and sequence analysis indicated that they were integrated into the zzso zzso approximately 43 zzso ago and have been evolved rate of zzso zzso differences per zzso during zzso zzso
