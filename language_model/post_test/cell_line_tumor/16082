zzso of zzso is commonly decreased in sporadic breast tumors, and this zzso with poor prognosis of breast cancer zzso Here we show that zzso transcripts are selectively enriched in the zzso complex and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhances zzso protein levels and protects them from zzso cell death, while zzso zzso reduces zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso repair, and render cells hypersensitive to zzso The impaired DNA repair zzso induced by zzso zzso can be fully rescued by zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso breast tumor cells are hypersensitive zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso enhances zzso levels and zzso resistance to zzso zzso Finally, a zzso zzso inhibitor impacts outgrowth of zzso tumors in animal zzso Together these results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA repair and may impact breast cancer zzso
