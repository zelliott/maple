Standard treatment of poisoning by zzso zzso nerve agents with zzso and zzso lacks efficacy with different nerve zzso A direct zzso intervention at the zzso zzso zzso zzso was proposed as an alternative therapeutic approach and promising in zzso and in zzso results were obtained with the zzso compound zzso In addition, a number of zzso zzso improved zzso transmission of zzso zzso in zzso We investigated the interaction of six of these zzso zzso with the zzso binding site of the human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso using radioactive zzso The determined affinity zzso indicate a weak interaction of three test compounds zzso in the zzso zzso with both zzso but no interaction could be recorded with the other three test zzso The six zzso zzso showed a low intrinsic zzso potency with human zzso zzso zzso 400 zzso In conclusion, the results of the present study do not indicate a correlation between the affinity to the zzso binding site and the functional improvement of zzso transmission and it is assumed that other mechanisms contribute to the therapeutic effect of the tested zzso
