The zzso zzso zzso was zzso at the zzso zzso in normal human blood cells, while it was not zzso in tumor zzso We identified protein zzso 2A zzso as a zzso zzso that is responsible for zzso of zzso in tumor cell zzso Treatment of the tumor cells with a zzso inhibitor resulted in the appearance of zzso zzso at zzso This observation suggests that zzso is zzso zzso but is immediately zzso by zzso in zzso zzso of zzso protein at the zzso zzso resulted in a reduction in zzso function in human tumor cell zzso Thus, not only the expression level, but also the zzso status may have important implications for the zzso activity of zzso
