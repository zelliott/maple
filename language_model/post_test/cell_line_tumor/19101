zzso growth factors zzso and their zzso receptors contribute to the zzso growth stimulation in several human zzso Here, we describe that zzso expression is zzso in zzso zzso zzso and is progressively enhanced during colon zzso reaching very high levels in zzso Moreover, our data suggest that zzso affects both zzso cells and zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso to the culture media of slowly growing zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso regulated zzso 1/2 and zzso was increased already 5 zzso after growth factor zzso zzso cells, zzso producing large amounts of zzso were not affected in this setting, but zzso zzso supported zzso cell survival under conditions of serum zzso zzso of zzso zzso production by small interference zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso of zzso cells and restored sensitivity to zzso zzso With respect to the zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso growth of zzso zzso at zzso zzso and migration at 10 zzso In addition, zzso zzso (10 zzso induced tube formation in human zzso vein zzso zzso zzso knock down demonstrated that zzso activity of colon cancer cell zzso depended to a large part on zzso zzso zzso In zzso this study demonstrates that zzso is almost generally zzso in colon cancer and exerts zzso effects both in the zzso and the zzso compartments by stimulating growth and survival of zzso cells, migration of zzso and zzso Together, these data strongly support an zzso role of zzso in zzso zzso
