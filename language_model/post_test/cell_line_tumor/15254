There is growing evidence supporting a role for zzso zzso as targets in zzso mechanisms of DNA zzso zzso zzso of tumor zzso zzso including zzso which has recently been reported to be zzso by zzso in several zzso may play important roles in pediatric acute zzso leukemia zzso However, expression of zzso and its promoter zzso remain status unclear in childhood zzso 

zzso zzso status of zzso was investigated by zzso specific zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequencing zzso zzso expression of zzso was evaluated by zzso and real-time zzso and the relationship between expression of zzso and promoter zzso was confirmed using zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was zzso zzso in zzso zzso leukemia cell zzso zzso showed that the promoter was significantly zzso in three zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso was significantly higher in Chinese pediatric zzso patients zzso zzso compared to normal bone zzso zzso control samples zzso zzso These results were confirmed by both zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso transcript expression was significantly lower in zzso patients, both with and without zzso zzso compared to zzso however, there were no significant differences in clinical features or zzso zzso zzso between patients with and without zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso was significantly lower in pediatric zzso cells compared to zzso zzso zzso a high frequency of zzso promoter zzso was observed in both zzso cell lines and pediatric zzso zzso zzso of zzso by promoter zzso could be affected by zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso of the zzso promoter may be an early event in the development of pediatric zzso
