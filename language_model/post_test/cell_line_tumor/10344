A novel zzso zzso complex with the zzso product of zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso was zzso and characterized by zzso analysis, zzso zzso and zzso and X-ray crystal zzso The complex showed a moderate activity towards zzso zzso The highest zzso potential of the complex was observed on the zzso breast cancer zzso cell zzso The investigated complex induced zzso the early zzso cells zzso zzso compared to zzso of control cells in the same zzso The interaction of the complex with calf zzso DNA zzso was monitored by blue shift and zzso in the zzso zzso The observed intrinsic binding constant zzso together with structural analysis of the complex indicate the groove zzso
