zzso evidence suggests that zzso between zzso and zzso signaling zzso are involved in tumor development and zzso However, the exact mechanism in zzso is not well zzso Using zzso we found that the expression levels of zzso in zzso cells significantly correlated with the zzso activity of zzso Similar observations were made when we subjected zzso cells to treatment with zzso zzso Moreover, both aspirin and zzso zzso can suppress the proliferation and induce zzso of zzso In addition, our analysis of the gene promoter of zzso revealed multiple putative zzso binding zzso In support of the concept that zzso is a zzso regulator for zzso results from our zzso zzso studies and zzso zzso showed that zzso binds to the potential binding sites in the gene promoter of zzso Furthermore, using zzso we found that zzso protein expression increased significantly in high-grade zzso in comparison to zzso zzso and correlated with zzso zzso In conclusion, our results support the concept that zzso directly regulates zzso in zzso and these two proteins may cooperate with each other in exerting their zzso effects in zzso
