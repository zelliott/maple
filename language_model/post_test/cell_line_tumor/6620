To evaluate the effects of zzso zzso factor zzso on the in zzso sensitivity of acute zzso leukemia zzso cell lines and primary zzso blast cells to zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cell lines and primary blasts from 10 patients with zzso were first incubated for 72 hours in the presence of zzso (5 or 100 zzso and then exposed to increasing zzso of GO zzso zzso for an additional 72 zzso 

zzso with zzso translated into significant enhancement of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the response of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells was unaffected by in zzso zzso with zzso In zzso exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso in 7 of 10 primary zzso samples and rendered blast cells from three zzso patients sensitive to killing effect of zzso The zzso increase of the zzso activity of GO was independent of effects on the cell cycle and on the expression levels of zzso zzso Of potential interest, zzso induced zzso zzso of zzso zzso function in the zzso zzso and zzso cells and in blasts from three patients with zzso that we zzso 

zzso our findings point to zzso as a potential zzso agent that can be exploited zzso to improve the clinical efficacy of zzso
