This study was aimed to develop a zzso zzso to be used as a carrier for zzso drug zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso using zzso as a zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso confirmed the purity was zzso zzso was labeled with sodium zzso zzso zzso for in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso was zzso to support the binding site of zzso zzso at the zzso positions zzso In zzso cellular zzso of zzso zzso was performed in breast cancer zzso zzso had zzso whereas nucleus had zzso zzso of zzso zzso When cancer cells were incubated with zzso or zzso followed by zzso zzso there was decreased zzso in cells treated with zzso but not zzso The findings indicated that cellular zzso of zzso zzso was via zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso was able to measure zzso differences after cells treated with zzso zzso and zzso imaging were conducted in breast zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso showed increased zzso ratios as a function of zzso zzso images confirmed that zzso zzso could assess tumor zzso changes after zzso zzso In zzso and in zzso studies indicated that zzso could target tumor cells, thus, zzso may be a useful carrier for zzso drug zzso
