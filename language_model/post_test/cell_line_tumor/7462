Few options are available for treating patients with advanced prostate cancer zzso As PC is a slow growing disease and accessible by zzso gene therapy could provide a viable option for this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represent potentially useful zzso for treating zzso We previously constructed a zzso cancer zzso virus zzso which showed efficacy both in zzso and in zzso for zzso The zzso was generated on a zzso zzso zzso with zzso depending on zzso zzso zzso zzso are frequently reduced in many tumor types, including PCs thereby limiting effective zzso zzso Using zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso was created by replacing the zzso fiber zzso with the zzso fiber zzso thereby zzso infection in a zzso zzso We evaluated zzso in comparison with zzso in low zzso human PC cells, demonstrating higher efficiency in zzso cell viability in zzso Moreover, zzso zzso suppressed in zzso tumor growth in a nude mouse zzso model and in a spontaneously induced PC that develops in zzso transgenic zzso Considering the significant responses in a Phase I clinical trial of a zzso zzso in advanced zzso zzso may exert improved therapeutic benefit in a clinical zzso
