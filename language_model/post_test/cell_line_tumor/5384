Increased expression and activity of proteins driving cell cycle progression as well as zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso enhance the zzso potential of zzso zzso of cells during zzso transformation from the proper cell cycle control rendering them independent from growth factors provides rationale for therapeutic targeting of zzso Exposure of rapidly growing human zzso breast cancer and zzso zzso cancer cells to zzso zzso a selective inhibitor of zzso zzso their proliferation by induction of cell cycle arrest and/or zzso The outcome strongly depends on the intrinsic traits of the tumor cells, on their cell cycle status prior to the onset of treatment and also on zzso zzso At lower dose zzso primarily zzso the cell zzso zzso resulting in a strong cell cycle zzso Interestingly, zzso arrests zzso growing cells at the zzso transition irrespective of the status of their restriction zzso However, the exposure of cancer cells synchronized after serum zzso in the late zzso phase results in a transient zzso arrest only in cells displaying the intact zzso zzso At higher dosage zzso triggers zzso In zzso cells zzso of the activity of zzso and, in consequence, that of zzso zzso II is a major event that zzso the initiation of zzso zzso In contrast, in the zzso zzso breast cancer cells zzso zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso factor by zzso at zzso results in zzso of zzso zzso This protein after de zzso synthesis and zzso into the zzso promotes zzso of the zzso zzso
