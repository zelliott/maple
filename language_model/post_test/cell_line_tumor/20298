The zzso ethanol extract of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was prepared and found to significantly inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso production from rat zzso leukemia zzso cells and zzso release by zzso zzso zzso It also attenuated zzso hypersensitivity zzso reaction in zzso Among the three major zzso constituents isolated zzso zzso B, zzso B zzso zzso C zzso as active principles, zzso B and its zzso strongly and significantly inhibited zzso production and zzso release between zzso On the other hand, all these zzso derivatives significantly and strongly inhibited zzso response after oral zzso In addition, zzso zzso was for the first time found to considerably alleviate zzso zzso symptoms in zzso mice, an animal model of zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso derivatives possess zzso activities on zzso as well as zzso hypersensitivity reactions and may contribute to the zzso action of zzso
