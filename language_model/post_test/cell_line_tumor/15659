This research investigated the level of zzso metabolism in zzso blasts as a zzso marker in zzso Using an in zzso zzso zzso we determined the level of zzso metabolism in 26 zzso samples taken from 23 adult patients with newly diagnosed zzso or relapsed zzso zzso and zzso blasts zzso into two distinct zzso of moderate zzso or high zzso levels of zzso zzso All samples taken at zzso were moderately zzso However, nine of the 19 samples taken at diagnosis were highly zzso and 10 were moderately zzso Three patients had paired samples taken at diagnosis and zzso and the zzso metabolism of these samples did not alter between the two zzso The level of zzso metabolism did not correlate with the percentage of zzso zzso patient age, or zzso risk zzso zzso zzso zzso blasts were more resistant to zzso induced by zzso and/or zzso in zzso suggesting potential resistance to induction chemotherapy, as has been observed in solid zzso Despite this, high levels of zzso metabolism at diagnosis were zzso of a significantly improved duration of zzso and zzso following zzso zzso induction zzso In conclusion, we found that the extent of zzso zzso may be an effective and easily applied method to determine the zzso prognosis of zzso
