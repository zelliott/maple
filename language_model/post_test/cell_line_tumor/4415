zzso is an important feature in tumor growth and zzso and combining chemotherapy and zzso drugs have shown clinical zzso However, as zzso resistance often develops, our goal was to identify pathways indicating response and/or evolving resistance to treatment and inhibit these pathways to zzso the treatment zzso 

To identify markers of response and/or resistance, zzso protein array zzso was used to characterize zzso changes in a zzso and a zzso human breast cancer zzso zzso were combined with zzso modeling to predict zzso targets for zzso of the zzso 

zzso analysis showed that both tumor models responded to zzso with an early zzso 3) zzso of growth factor receptors and downstream signaling zzso with persistent zzso signaling until the end of the in zzso zzso Adding zzso to zzso showed significant and superior growth zzso of zzso tumors, whereas no additive effect was seen in the zzso zzso The combination treatment corresponded to a continuous late zzso of zzso signaling in the zzso model, whereas the zzso was temporary in the zzso zzso zzso the zzso dynamic changes in protein levels with zzso modeling predicted zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso to increase the efficacy of zzso zzso In zzso experiments combining zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso confirmed their significant and additive zzso effect in the zzso zzso 

Treatment with zzso caused zzso zzso of several signaling zzso zzso such pathways increased the efficacy of zzso zzso
