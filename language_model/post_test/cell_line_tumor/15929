zzso a type II zzso zzso highly expressed in zzso zzso including multiple myeloma zzso represents a promising target for zzso zzso In this study, we describe the zzso mechanisms of action of zzso a novel, zzso therapeutic human zzso against a unique zzso zzso zzso induced potent zzso cellular zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cell lines as well as in patient zzso cells, both with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso stood out from other zzso zzso in its strong ability to induce zzso zzso in patient zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cellular zzso and zzso zzso were not affected by the presence of bone zzso zzso cells, indicating that zzso can effectively kill zzso tumor cells in a zzso bone zzso zzso In zzso zzso was highly active and interrupted zzso tumor growth at low zzso zzso our results show the versatility of zzso to effectively kill zzso tumor cells, including patient zzso cells, via diverse zzso zzso These findings support clinical development of zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso
