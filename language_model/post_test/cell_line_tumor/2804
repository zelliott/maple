The zzso of zzso zzso by zzso cassette protein zzso zzso membrane pump allows zzso identification of a zzso of cells by flow zzso analysis termed the zzso zzso zzso The SP identified by zzso zzso zzso contains the zzso cell population from bone zzso and many solid zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso is a cell membrane zzso fluorescent vital dye that zzso into DNA and is a zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso was evaluated in this study as a tool for identification of the SP from prostate cancer cell lines and from freshly harvested human prostate zzso zzso that demonstrated zzso zzso of zzso were identified in the human prostate cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso but not in the zzso zzso or zzso cell zzso Additionally, a SP was identified in zzso zzso prostate tumors from zzso zzso of Mouse zzso zzso human benign prostate tissue and human prostate cancer zzso The zzso role of zzso zzso of zzso in the identification of the SP was confirmed by loss of the SP by incubation with the specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the SP cells was confirmed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso represents an important new tool for isolation of viable candidate stem zzso stem cells as a SP from cultured prostate cell lines, and prostate tissue zzso without the requirement for zzso with zzso zzso capability and minimizing the risk of damage to DNA in the sorted zzso
