An zzso virus zzso zzso in zzso zzso cell line zzso was cloned into a bacterial artificial zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso designated zzso was rapidly and precisely modified by means of efficient zzso zzso in zzso zzso This system was used to produce zzso zzso with zzso An expression cassette of green fluorescent protein zzso was inserted into zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso into zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso plasmids efficiently formed zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso viruses were then produced and used to zzso zzso zzso zzso We obtained cell clones that zzso only zzso but no zzso zzso These cell clones produced infectious viruses after stimulating virus production, and the zzso viruses of zzso efficiently immortalized primary B zzso We further revised the method so that any kind of zzso could be rapidly inserted into the unique zzso site that had been artificially introduced into zzso The zzso system will have a broad range of applications, such as genetic analyses of various viral gene products and development of viral zzso for human gene zzso
