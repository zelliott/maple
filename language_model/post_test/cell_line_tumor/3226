Survival factors play critical roles in regulating cell growth in normal and cancer zzso We designed a genetic screen to identify survival factors which protect tumor cells from zzso A zzso expression library of random zzso fragments was constructed from cancer cells and used to zzso the colon zzso cell line zzso zzso cells were functionally selected for induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso of over 10,000 putative genetic suppression elements zzso sequences revealed zzso gene candidates that are implicated in zzso We further zzso 26 genes zzso cell surface and zzso proteins that can potentially serve as targets for therapeutic zzso zzso zzso from several gene candidates induced zzso in stable zzso 116 cell zzso Similar zzso were caused by zzso derived from the same zzso Our data suggest requirement for the cell surface targets zzso zzso and zzso in tumor cell growth in zzso and suggests that zzso is required for zzso tumor growth in a mouse zzso
