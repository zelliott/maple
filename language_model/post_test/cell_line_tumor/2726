The product of breast cancer zzso gene 1, zzso plays pivotal roles in the maintenance of zzso zzso zzso evidence indicates that zzso associates with many proteins or protein complexes to regulate diverse processes important for the cellular response to DNA zzso One of these complexes, which mediates the zzso of zzso at sites of DNA breaks, involves the zzso motif zzso protein zzso a zzso domain protein zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Here we describe the characterization of a novel component of this complex, zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso 40 zzso which together with an zzso protein zzso zzso the zzso DNA damage zzso zzso is assembled into this zzso complex via its direct interaction with zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso retention at DNA breaks and checkpoint function primarily via a role in maintaining the stability of zzso and this zzso protein complex at sites of DNA zzso Together, our study reveals that a stable complex containing zzso acts early in DNA damage response and regulates zzso zzso zzso
