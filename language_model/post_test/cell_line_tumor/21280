zzso zzso are a class of small zzso zzso with important zzso regulatory zzso Recent data suggest that zzso are zzso expressed in many human zzso and that they may play significant roles in zzso Here, we used zzso to profile the expression of 315 human zzso in 10 normal zzso samples and 49 stage II colon zzso differing with regard to zzso status and recurrence of zzso Several zzso were zzso expressed between normal tissue and tumor zzso zzso with zzso showing the lowest expression in cancer relative to normal zzso zzso status for the majority of zzso could be correctly predicted based on zzso expression zzso Furthermore, a zzso based on zzso expression profiles could predict recurrence of disease with an overall performance accuracy of zzso indicating a potential role of zzso in determining tumor zzso The expression levels of zzso and zzso both included in the zzso zzso correlated with the probability of recurrence-free survival by zzso zzso We successfully verified the expression of selected zzso using real-time reverse zzso zzso for mature zzso whereas in zzso zzso was used to detect the zzso of zzso and zzso in normal zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso zzso suppressed growth of three different colon zzso cell zzso In conclusion, our results suggest that zzso expression of numerous zzso in colon cancer may have a functional effect on tumor cell behavior, and, zzso that some zzso with zzso potential could be of clinical zzso
