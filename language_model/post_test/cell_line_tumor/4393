The zzso factor zzso mediates zzso transition zzso in zzso cancer but its control in this setting is not fully zzso Here, we report the definition of a zzso feedback loop involving zzso and zzso that regulates zzso and zzso zzso In zzso cancer cells, zzso was zzso by DNA damage in a zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso was zzso indirectly by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso which targeted the 3' untranslated region zzso of zzso zzso induced zzso transition zzso and inhibited zzso cancer cell migration and zzso The zzso of zzso was necessary for induction of zzso and cell cycle arrest by zzso In tumor zzso zzso zzso suppressed formation of lung zzso Furthermore, zzso directly suppressed expression of zzso In clinical specimens of zzso cancer, zzso levels zzso correlated with zzso protein levels shown previously to correlate with distant zzso and poor zzso In zzso our results define a zzso feedback loop involving zzso and zzso that zzso zzso and zzso states, respectively, which may determine zzso zzso
