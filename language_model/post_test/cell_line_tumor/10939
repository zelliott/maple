The aim of the present study was to investigate regulation of zzso coding for zzso zzso and specific zzso by novel zzso zzso zzso E zzso in human breast zzso cells of zzso line, sensitive and resistant to zzso agent zzso 

zzso analysis of zzso expression was estimated using zzso and DNA zzso zzso For comparison, another zzso drug zzso zzso was zzso THE zzso obtained indicate that zzso zzso zzso of zzso coding for zzso receptors type I and type II in zzso cells, as well as in their zzso zzso 

zzso action of zzso may be zzso by zzso and a signaling zzso of this zzso is not affected by the development of tumor cell resistance to zzso
