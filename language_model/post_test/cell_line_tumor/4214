zzso is a dual zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibitor that has significantly improved the clinical outcome of zzso breast cancer zzso However, patients zzso develop mechanisms of resistance that limit the efficacy of the zzso In order to identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention in zzso patients, we isolated, from zzso zzso breast cancer cells, the zzso zzso zzso which is able to routinely grow in 1 zzso zzso zzso cells have a more aggressive zzso compared with parental cells, as they show a higher ability to invade through a zzso zzso zzso cells have an increased zzso zzso activity and persistent levels of zzso of zzso and zzso compared with parental zzso Treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso in combination with zzso reduces zzso and zzso zzso and restores the sensitivity of resistant cells to zzso zzso zzso cells also show levels of expression of zzso that are higher compared with parental cells and are not affected by zzso zzso Treatment with zzso or a specific zzso zzso reduces the invasive ability of zzso zzso cells, with the two drugs showing cooperative zzso Finally, blockade of zzso signaling significantly increases zzso cell death in zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that breast cancer cells with acquired resistance to zzso have a more aggressive zzso compared with their parental counterpart, and that zzso signaling and zzso play an important role in this phenomenon, thus representing potential targets for therapeutic intervention in zzso breast cancer zzso
