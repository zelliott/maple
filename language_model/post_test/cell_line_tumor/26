The aim of the present study was to define the point at which zzso zzso responses fail in order to design better zzso A zzso model of zzso was used which was established with zzso zzso of zzso cells into zzso mice results in progressing zzso with similar zzso to human zzso The zzso cells zzso a marker zzso zzso similar to zzso zzso products, such as zzso The zzso zzso contains zzso elements including zzso cells, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells, all of which are activated in zzso zzso chronic zzso zzso zzso are rapidly transported to draining zzso zzso wherein zzso zzso responses are zzso Despite the generation of potent zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso those that zzso zzso cannot restrain zzso growth suggesting local zzso zzso zzso did not suppress protective responses in adoptive transfer experiments suggesting that systemic zzso play little role in regulating zzso immune zzso Finally, removal of zzso zzso from the zzso site and zzso zzso did not alter zzso growth with or without zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso are not potent regulators of zzso immunity and targeting these cells may not improve zzso
