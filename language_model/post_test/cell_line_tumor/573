zzso maintains zzso DNA zzso at zzso zzso in zzso zzso Recent findings revealed that zzso depletion causes distinct zzso changes in colon and gastric cancer cell lines, suggesting that the extent to which zzso influences the expression of its target genes is zzso zzso We determined the impact of zzso depletion in prostate cancer derived cells on their gene expression profiles and cellular zzso 

Small interfering zzso was used to silence zzso expression in prostate cancer derived zzso cells zzso The resulting cell line was validated by reverse zzso chain reaction and Western zzso zzso migration and invasion zzso were done in engineered cells to zzso the effect of zzso zzso on cellular zzso DNA zzso were done to monitor changes in gene zzso 

Our data showed that zzso loss dramatically decreased cell proliferation but significantly increased cell migratory and invasive zzso Additionally, in the limited set of genes whose expression and DNA zzso status were determined zzso loss was associated with increased zzso and zzso zzso and also culminated in specific zzso of zzso and zzso zzso 

These results show that the genetic and zzso consequences of zzso zzso in zzso cells are markedly different from those in colon and gastric zzso indicating that zzso zzso targets certain gene zzso Our findings also suggest that decreasing zzso levels or activity can potentially enhance prostate cancer cell zzso
