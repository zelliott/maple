High expression of vascular zzso growth factor zzso in patients with breast cancer has been associated with a poor zzso indicating that zzso could be linked to the efficacy of chemotherapy and zzso It has also been suggested that radiation resistance is partly due to zzso cell production of zzso zzso particularly zzso zzso zzso This evidence indicates that zzso of zzso might enhance the radiation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso inhibitor of several targets including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso has shown clinical efficacy in treating solid zzso such as zzso cell and zzso zzso However, strategies are yet to be identified to prolong and maximize the zzso effect of this zzso zzso The objective of this study was to determine whether a combination of zzso and radiation will enhance the treatment response in zzso and in zzso zzso effect of zzso was assessed by performing zzso zzso In addition, cell cycle analyses as well as zzso zzso zzso were performed 24 and 48 h after treatment, zzso To confirm our zzso results, zzso growth delay zzso were zzso Our results showed a strong and zzso zzso effect of radiation combined with zzso in zzso zzso enhancement factor of zzso The combined therapy demonstrated a strong and significant zzso cell cycle arrest zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso showed a significant increase in the level of zzso zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso Study of the zzso model demonstrated the superior potency of the zzso combined with zzso Our results demonstrate that higher zzso activity can be achieved when radiation and zzso are zzso
