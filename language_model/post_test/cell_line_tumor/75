zzso zzso zzso plays a crucial role in DNA zzso zzso of its activity by stimulation or zzso is considered as a potentially important strategy in clinical practice, especially to sensitize tumor cells to zzso and zzso through zzso of DNA zzso Here we studied the effect of the three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and for two of them the efficiency in slowing the rejoining of DNA strand breaks induced by zzso was zzso zzso of zzso changed its zzso zzso zzso cells exposed to the inhibitor zzso showed a significant tendency to accumulate zzso in large zzso whereas in zzso cells its distribution was more zzso The speed and efficiency of rejoining of zzso DNA strand breaks were lower in cells incubated with a zzso zzso and the zzso of rejoining were modulated in a different manner by each zzso At a concentration of 100 zzso the efficiency of the zzso could be ranked in the order zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The two first compounds were able to decrease the overall zzso activity below the level detected in control cells, while zzso showed up to zzso zzso activity after exposure to zzso
