A novel class of zzso zzso zzso and their zzso derivatives as zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso was designed and prepared for improving stability and zzso of the lead zzso Their zzso properties were assessed by several zzso The results showed that target compounds displayed positive free radical zzso abilities, superior to that of zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated remarkable protection effects against damage induced by hydrogen zzso which were apparently stronger than that of zzso Most of target compounds could inhibit zzso oxide zzso Additionally, target compounds showed high zzso barrier zzso
