Recent evidence indicates there is a role for small membrane zzso including zzso as vehicles for zzso zzso zzso zzso by most cell types can mediate transfer of zzso zzso and zzso but their role in the transmission of infectious agents is less zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso zzso containing zzso C virus zzso zzso can activate innate immune cells, but the role of zzso in the transmission of zzso between zzso remains zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso transfer zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso human zzso zzso cells were shown to contain full-length viral zzso viral zzso and zzso as determined by zzso mass zzso and transmission electron zzso zzso from zzso cells were capable of zzso infection to zzso human zzso zzso cells and establishing a productive zzso Even with zzso zzso lacking structural viral zzso zzso transmission of zzso zzso was zzso Treatment with zzso zzso showed a variable degree of zzso of zzso infection compared with free zzso In conclusion, this study showed that zzso zzso can transmit productive zzso infection in zzso and are partially resistant to zzso zzso This discovery sheds light on zzso zzso resistant to zzso transmission by zzso as a potential immune evasion zzso
