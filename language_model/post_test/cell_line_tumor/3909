The prognosis of pancreatic zzso is poor due to the difficulty in early diagnosis, zzso to routine therapies and limited understanding of its pathological zzso Gene therapy is now becoming an important strategy for the treatment of pancreatic zzso which includes zzso gene zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of an zzso zzso specific to point zzso zzso on the zzso of human pancreatic zzso cells in zzso Human pancreatic zzso zzso cells were zzso with an zzso zzso specific to a zzso point zzso by zzso The effect of the zzso zzso on the zzso of zzso cells was studied using flow zzso zzso and phase contrast zzso An zzso peak was observed in the experimental group, and most cells were arrested at the zzso phase with few cells at the S zzso The numbers of zzso cells in the experimental group increased as indicated by zzso and phase contrast zzso An zzso zzso specific to a zzso point zzso promotes zzso in zzso cells in zzso perhaps by zzso of zzso gene zzso
