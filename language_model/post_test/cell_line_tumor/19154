To study the effect of the over expression of zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso and zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso on the zzso and zzso of zzso and to further explore the contribution of zzso gene to the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso or zzso gene was amplified from zzso zzso by zzso respectively and then cloned into zzso zzso After the zzso of zzso plasmids or zzso into the zzso their expression was examined by fluorescent zzso and Western zzso The zzso content of zzso or zzso in the culture medium was tested zzso with zzso kit zzso The stained zzso were observed and their zzso rate was tested by flow zzso 

After zzso into zzso zzso fusion protein was mainly located in zzso while zzso fusion protein was completely located in zzso and zzso fusion protein was completely located in zzso The zzso of zzso or zzso increased the level of zzso and zzso and zzso the zzso rate of zzso Furthermore, the effect of zzso was obvious except on zzso level but the zzso of zzso did not show the same zzso 

The zzso of zzso or zzso fusion protein can induce the zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso
