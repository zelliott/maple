An zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a gene located within the zzso zzso zzso on human zzso zzso The expression of these zzso zzso genes is determined by zzso zzso structures that allow their ubiquitous expression in zzso however, their expression is limited to a single ACT gene in zzso In zzso and zzso cells, six specific zzso zzso sites zzso were found located exclusively in the zzso region of the ACT zzso We identified two enhancers that mapped to the two zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso which contain zzso zzso zzso binding sites, both of which are critical for zzso zzso expression of ACT zzso In zzso these elements are occupied by zzso zzso in zzso cells and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, functional zzso is required for the expression of ACT in zzso cells because both transient and stable zzso zzso of zzso zzso specifically abrogates zzso and reduces zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso of zzso 4 of zzso zzso was also lost in these cells, but the zzso distribution pattern and global zzso zzso were not changed upstream of the ACT zzso Interestingly, functional zzso is also indispensable for the expression of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso which is an zzso zzso We propose that zzso is a key zzso factor that, in part, controls zzso expression of genes including the ACT and zzso zzso
