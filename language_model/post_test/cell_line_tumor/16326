To establish an animal model of prostate cancer zzso zzso to the lung using zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso expressing red fluorescent protein zzso cell lines that can be monitored by in zzso zzso imaging zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso were used to compare the abilities of zzso migration and invasion of zzso and zzso zzso Twenty zzso nude mice were equally zzso to 4 groups to receive tail vein injection of zzso cell suspension at the concentration of 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B), 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso followed by the same dose 1 week later zzso zzso zzso zzso to the lung was then monitored by in zzso zzso imaging technology at the end of 2, 4, 6 and 8 zzso 

There were no statistically significant differences between zzso and zzso cells in their abilities of zzso migration and invasion zzso zzso zzso At the end of 4 weeks, lung zzso was observed in zzso of the mice in group D, and at the end of 8 weeks, it was detected in zzso in group A, zzso in group B, zzso in group C, and zzso in group D, all confirmed by pathological zzso 

The animal model of zzso zzso to the lung that can be monitored by in zzso zzso imaging technology was established successfully by tail vein injection of zzso cells carrying red fluorescent zzso
