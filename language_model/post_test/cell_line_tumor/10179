zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been reported to contribute to the development and progression of various zzso However, its role in prostate cancer zzso still remains poorly zzso In the present study, we investigate the influence of zzso in zzso a high-grade zzso zzso cell line, and demonstrate that zzso plays an essential role in cellular properties associated with tumor zzso namely cell zzso invasion, and zzso In this study, zzso expression in human zzso cell line zzso was reduced by zzso interference zzso technology, and the zzso invasion, and migration of zzso zzso cells were zzso We also detected an zzso expression pattern in 20 pairs of primary zzso samples and their corresponding normal zzso zzso of zzso was zzso in four zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicating its possible role in zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso cells, which expressed the highest level of zzso among four zzso cell lines, led to a decrease in zzso Similarly, suppression of zzso inhibited zzso cell migration and invasion through a basement membrane zzso Furthermore, we found that the normal prostate zzso showed a relatively low level of zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso demonstrated significantly higher expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that zzso affects multiple processes involved in tumor zzso and identify zzso as a potential therapeutic zzso
