zzso was reported to inhibit the proliferation of many cancer cells, including melanoma zzso In this report, we investigated the effect of zzso on melanoma invasion and zzso zzso Using different in zzso approaches, we found that zzso zzso cell invasion without affecting cell migration and independently of zzso zzso This zzso is correlated with zzso of expression of proteins involved in zzso transition such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, our data indicate that this process is dependent on zzso of zzso and tumor zzso protein zzso Finally, we showed that zzso zzso melanoma zzso development in mice using zzso and zzso zzso The presented data reinforce the fact that zzso might be a good candidate for clinical trial in melanoma zzso
