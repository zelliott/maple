zzso is the first zzso zzso analog to show potent zzso zzso activity and is currently under clinical zzso zzso differences in zzso toxicity between mice, rats, zzso and humans were observed during zzso and clinical zzso To better understand the different toxicity and efficacy results observed between the human zzso mouse tumor models used for zzso assessment and the clinical study results, the zzso and zzso of zzso were zzso in zzso and human zzso 

zzso and zzso incorporation zzso were used to investigate the in zzso zzso activity of zzso on a selected panel of mouse and human tumor cell lines and normal zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso of zzso was determined in mouse and human zzso obtained from peripheral zzso The zzso efficacy of zzso administered either as single or repeated high-dose zzso administrations or as zzso continuous infusions was evaluated in the human colon zzso zzso zzso We also determined plasma zzso of zzso using the different administration zzso 

Five to nine zzso lower zzso of zzso were required to inhibit cell growth in human compared with zzso tumor and normal zzso cell zzso Furthermore, the sensitivity of cells of both species to zzso was strongly time dependent, requiring zzso hours exposure for maximum zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso obtained from peripheral blood revealed subsequently higher levels of zzso zzso and zzso in human compared with zzso zzso efficacy studies revealed that prolonged exposure schedules (up to 6 zzso showed equivalent efficacy to repeated high-dose zzso zzso zzso continuous infusion of 20 zzso zzso via subcutaneous implanted zzso pump maintained systemic zzso of 262 zzso zzso zzso for the duration of administration, which are clinically achievable plasma zzso and led to significant zzso activity zzso versus control zzso of zzso and tumor zzso during zzso 

These studies support the hypothesis that zzso infusions might be the administration regimen with the greatest likelihood of fully exploiting clinically the potent zzso zzso activity of zzso
