zzso zzso zzso is a highly aggressive zzso zzso that includes two forms of zzso differing in zzso virus zzso infection status, zzso and zzso Although many efforts, such as zzso zzso combination chemotherapy, have been devoted to improving therapy for this rapidly zzso zzso there are still significant zzso zzso zzso there remains a need for novel effective therapeutic zzso zzso play a role in zzso zzso the zzso and pathological differentiation process, by which cells can rapidly regulate dynamic events such as zzso decisions and zzso This unique zzso feature shifts the traditional one drug target paradigm to a novel one drug multiple targets zzso Here, we found that zzso cell lines showed an extremely low expression of zzso zzso and then restored zzso expression at zzso levels in zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso The results showed that zzso of zzso reduced proliferation of zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso both of which are of zzso zzso center zzso origin, zzso with zzso can be rescued to differentiate toward zzso terminal zzso However, no significant changes were observed in zzso or Ramos cells, which are of zzso zzso center zzso zzso Of note, zzso of zzso also resulted in decreasing zzso protein zzso Additionally, zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cell lines zzso the partial characteristics similar to that caused by zzso of zzso Taken together, our findings show that zzso can induce zzso zzso differentiation by targeting zzso
