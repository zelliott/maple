zzso expression or activity of the zzso factor zzso box zzso zzso is associated with the development and progression of many zzso including breast zzso In this study, we show that the zzso zzso zzso selectively zzso cell cycle arrest and cell death in breast cancer cells through zzso zzso zzso zzso our data show that zzso treatment reduced zzso expression in a zzso and zzso manner, independent of de zzso protein synthesis and predominantly at zzso and gene promoter zzso Our results indicate that zzso can induce cell death through zzso intrinsic and zzso zzso pathways as well as through zzso death mechanisms, as observed in zzso cells, which are deficient of zzso and zzso Cell cycle analysis showed that zzso induced cell cycle arrest at zzso and S zzso and cell death, zzso with zzso repression in breast cancer zzso Furthermore, zzso also shows efficacy in zzso breast cancer cell migration, zzso and zzso which are all downstream functional attributes of zzso We also show that zzso of a zzso active zzso zzso zzso can abrogate the zzso effects of zzso Interestingly, zzso has no affect on zzso expression and proliferation of the zzso zzso breast zzso zzso zzso our data show that zzso is one of the primary cellular targets of zzso in breast cancer cells and that zzso may represent a novel lead compound for targeted therapy of breast cancer with minimal toxicity against zzso zzso
