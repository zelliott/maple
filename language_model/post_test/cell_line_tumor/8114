Human breast tumors contain a breast cancer stem cell zzso population with properties reminiscent of normal stem zzso We found 37 zzso that were zzso expressed between human zzso and zzso cancer zzso Three zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in human zzso normal human and zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso a known regulator of stem cell zzso was modulated by zzso zzso inhibited the zzso expansion of breast cancer cells and suppressed the growth of zzso zzso cells in zzso Most importantly, zzso strongly suppressed the ability of normal zzso stem cells to form zzso ducts and tumor formation driven by human zzso in zzso The coordinated zzso of three zzso clusters and the similar functional regulation of zzso expansion by zzso provide a molecular link that connects zzso with normal stem zzso
