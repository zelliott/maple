It has been reported that zzso of vascular zzso growth zzso zzso in tumors leads to increased zzso and resistance to zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso would be a good molecular target for cancer gene zzso In this study, we silenced the expression of zzso with the highly specific zzso suppression of zzso interference zzso in human breast cancer zzso cell zzso The expression of zzso was examined by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the effect of zzso on human zzso zzso cells zzso in zzso was analyzed by migration and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity to zzso agents was evaluated by zzso and zzso zzso and zzso genes zzso ratio was determined by Western zzso zzso showed that of three zzso zzso zzso most significantly suppressed the expression of zzso zzso and protein zzso of control and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with proliferation and migration of zzso in zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso combined with zzso markedly decreased breast cancer cells zzso reaching up to zzso and increased zzso rate from zzso to zzso as determined by decrease of zzso zzso In zzso zzso would be a good molecular target, and a combination of zzso and zzso targeting zzso could be an effective means for suppressing zzso zzso and enhancing zzso of human breast cancer zzso
