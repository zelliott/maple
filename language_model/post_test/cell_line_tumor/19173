zzso melanoma represents a complex and zzso disease for which there are no therapies to improve patient zzso Recent expression profiling of melanoma cell lines identified two zzso signatures, respectively, corresponding with zzso and invasive cellular zzso A model derived from these findings predicts that in zzso melanoma cells may switch between these zzso Here, DNA zzso cell lines were subjected to in zzso characterization before zzso injection into zzso zzso zzso growth rates were measured and zzso samples were assessed by zzso to identify invasive and zzso signature zzso In zzso tests showed that zzso signature melanoma cells are faster growing but less zzso than invasive signature zzso In zzso zzso signature cells initiated tumor growth in 14 zzso 3 days zzso By comparison, invasive signature cells required a significantly longer zzso zzso zzso period of 59 zzso 11 zzso zzso showed that regardless of the seed cell signature, tumors showed evidence for both zzso and invasive cell zzso Furthermore, zzso signature cell types were detected most frequently in the peripheral margin of growing zzso These data indicate that melanoma cells undergo zzso signature switching in zzso likely regulated by local zzso zzso Our findings challenge previous models of melanoma progression that evoke one-way changes in gene zzso We present a new model for melanoma progression that accounts for zzso signature plasticity and provides a more rational context for explaining observed melanoma zzso
