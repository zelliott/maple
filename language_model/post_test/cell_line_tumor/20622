The high concentration of zzso oxide zzso around the zzso junction zzso might play an important role in the development of Barrett's esophagus zzso a precursor of Barrett's zzso Although previous studies revealed that the expression of zzso zzso 2 zzso an important marker of zzso might be induced through zzso Growth Factor zzso zzso the roles of NO in this signal zzso remain zzso 

First, we investigated the expressions of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso study for BE and zzso zzso of human zzso Second, we studied the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso or NO zzso zzso on the expression of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso an zzso human zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and small interfering zzso for zzso zzso were employed to zzso the role of zzso in the induction of zzso 

The zzso study revealed that the expressions of zzso zzso and zzso in BE were stronger than those in zzso zzso with positive zzso Exposure to zzso zzso or zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso expression in zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso induction were significantly diminished by AG zzso and zzso 

We revealed for the first time that zzso NO might directly induce zzso expression through zzso zzso We suggested that NO had an important role in the development of BE from zzso zzso around zzso
