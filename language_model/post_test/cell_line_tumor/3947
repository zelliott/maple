zzso has been reported to be expressed by various types of cells such as zzso cancer and zzso cancer cells, and it promotes the proliferation and invasion of zzso cancer zzso Our previous study demonstrated that zzso is also expressed in gastric cancer zzso and that its expression is associated with the zzso but the role of zzso in zzso has not been well zzso 

In this study, we investigated the influence of zzso on gastric zzso and zzso in zzso and in zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso incorporation zzso zzso culture, zzso and zzso Western zzso analysis was also performed to identify the potential mechanisms zzso 

The zzso migration, and invasion of zzso and zzso gastric zzso cell lines were all significantly inhibited by zzso of zzso using small hairpin zzso In a zzso model, tumor growth was markedly inhibited after zzso zzso cells were implanted into nude zzso After zzso zzso zzso cells showed a more zzso zzso suggesting an zzso of the zzso transition zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso reduced the expression of zzso zzso expression of zzso markers including zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso markers including zzso and zzso zzso of zzso related to tumor zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso was also significantly zzso 

These findings indicate that zzso enhances cell zzso and zzso by modulating the zzso process, while zzso zzso in zzso suppresses zzso and zzso suggesting that it may be a potential therapeutic zzso
