In view of the limited success of available treatment zzso for zzso breast cancer, alternative and complementary strategies need to be zzso zzso zzso zzso strategies for breast cancer gene therapy and zzso are a promising novel therapeutic platform for the treatment of breast zzso However, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a major zzso zzso tissue specific promoters zzso to restrict zzso expression or viral replication is an effective way to increase specificity towards tumor zzso and to reduce adverse effects in zzso zzso such as the zzso In this regard, candidate breast cancer zzso include promoters of the genes for the zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso 

We employed zzso zzso that express the reporter gene zzso under the control of the promoters of zzso We evaluated this class of zzso in various established breast cancer cell lines, primary breast cancer cells and finally in the most stringent zzso available zzso system, constituted by precision cut tissue slices of human breast cancer and zzso 

Overall, the zzso promoter exhibited the highest zzso activity in breast cancer cell lines, primary breast cancer cells and breast cancer tissue zzso zzso the zzso promoter displayed a very low activity in human primary zzso and human liver tissue zzso Interestingly, gene expression profiles correlated with the promoter activities both in breast cancer cell lines and primary breast cancer zzso 

These data suggest that the zzso promoter has an ideal zzso zzso profile, and could, therefore, be a powerful tool in Ad zzso based gene therapy or zzso of the zzso of the zzso
