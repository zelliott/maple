zzso hormone zzso and its receptors zzso have a wide range of zzso functions and play a role in the treatment of numerous human diseases, including zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso growth of zzso cancer zzso cells through zzso zzso zzso However, the specific zzso zzso zzso and the zzso mechanism responsible for the negative regulation of zzso zzso by zzso have not been fully zzso 

zzso zzso in zzso colon cancer cells zzso by zzso regulation of the zzso zzso components zzso and zzso was zzso Cell zzso of zzso cells was measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression levels were confirmed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein levels were examined by Western zzso The distribution of zzso in the cell was analyzed with zzso 

zzso treatment increased zzso zzso of zzso colon cancer cells, promoted the plasma membrane zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso transcription, and zzso zzso target genes zzso D1 and zzso Further, zzso treatment zzso the zzso of zzso 

These preliminary findings showed the negative regulation of the zzso zzso by zzso hormone G zzso receptors zzso
