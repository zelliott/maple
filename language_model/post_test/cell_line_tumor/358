The bystander effect, zzso cells that are not traversed by zzso radiation exhibit various responses when in proximity to zzso cells, is well documented in the field of radiation biology, Here we demonstrate that considerable bystander responses are also observed after zzso stress using the zzso dye zzso zzso Using cells of a zzso human zzso cell line in suspension and a zzso insert system that zzso contact between targeted and bystander cells, we have shown that the bystander signaling is zzso by zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso used suggests that primary DNA damage is not the trigger for initiating these bystander responses, which include elevated zzso stress, DNA damage zzso zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso In addition, zzso stress in the bystander population was reduced by the presence of the membrane zzso vitamin E in the targeted cells, suggesting that zzso zzso may play a key role in zzso these bystander zzso The zzso responses for these bystander effects are zzso with larger effects seen at lower zzso and toxicity to the target cell zzso zzso when considering outcomes of zzso action in cells and zzso bystander effects may be zzso especially at zzso zzso
