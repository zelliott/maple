With the rapid development in design and zzso carbon zzso zzso are being studied for potential applications in a variety of biomedical fields, such as zzso drug delivery, zzso imaging, and zzso drug zzso In the present study, we observed that zzso could significantly induce cell death of human zzso cancer zzso zzso More importantly, we demonstrated that zzso could sensitize zzso cells to the zzso compound zzso zzso resulting increased cell zzso zzso investigations suggested that zzso provoked cell death in the absence or presence of zzso mainly via zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso contribute to regulating the zzso of zzso cancer cells to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso drugs might thus stand for a promising approach to improve the cancer zzso
