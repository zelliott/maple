zzso zzso of the mouse prostate zzso mice spontaneously develop zzso and zzso prostate cancer zzso that potentially resembles the human pathological zzso The aim of the study was to validate PET imaging as a reliable tool for in zzso assessment of disease biology and progression in zzso mice using zzso routinely applied in clinical practice: zzso and zzso 

Six zzso mice were zzso evaluated starting at week 11 of age to zzso PC development and zzso The time frame and imaging pattern of PC zzso were subsequently confirmed on an additional group of five zzso 

PET and zzso allowed detection of PC zzso starting from 23 weeks of zzso zzso was clearly taken up only by zzso mice carrying neuroendocrine zzso as revealed by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso molecular imaging represents a state-of-the-art tool for the in zzso monitoring and zzso characterization of PC development, progression and differentiation in the zzso zzso
