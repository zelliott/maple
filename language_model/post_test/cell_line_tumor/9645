It has been widely accepted that zzso therapy could zzso tumor cells of nutrients and oxygen and suppress tumor zzso However, in the present study, Lewis lung zzso and zzso zzso established in male zzso and zzso nude mice, respectively, were treated with zzso human zzso zzso Earlier studies document discrepancies in the zzso and zzso outcomes of zzso treatment, at doses equivalent to clinical zzso Although there was no significant zzso of tumor growth, tumor zzso was widely disrupted within the first few days of treatment with zzso as indicated by reduced blood zzso zzso by zzso magnetic resonance zzso and reduced zzso zzso Interestingly, when zzso treatment was zzso there was an zzso in the diffusion of oxygen and zzso zzso in both tumor classes, which was detected by zzso zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso outcomes in the zzso and zzso properties of zzso might derive from the zzso tolerance to zzso zzso Additionally, zzso might have the ability to zzso zzso tumor zzso
