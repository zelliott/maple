zzso cells are known to express specific recognition molecules for cell surface zzso However, mechanisms involved in zzso zzso interactions in zzso immunity have largely been left zzso zzso We found that several zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso cells serve as zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso receptors carried by immune zzso The zzso zzso zzso in normal zzso zzso cells included zzso zzso which was found to have binding activity to both zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso which exhibited significant binding to zzso zzso of these zzso zzso was impaired upon zzso and they were replaced by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which have no zzso zzso zzso When we characterized immune cells expressing zzso in zzso zzso zzso by flow zzso and zzso zzso the majority of zzso zzso immune cells expressing zzso turned out to be resident zzso characterized by low expression of zzso and high expression of zzso A minor zzso of zzso T zzso also expressed zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso expression and zzso production by zzso These results suggest that normal zzso of zzso cells exert a zzso effect on zzso expression by resident zzso thus maintaining zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Our results also imply that loss of zzso zzso by impaired zzso during zzso zzso enhances inflammatory zzso zzso
