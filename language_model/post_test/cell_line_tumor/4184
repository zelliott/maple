zzso 1 zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that is implicated in plethora of biological zzso including zzso aging, stress response, and zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso zzso zzso of zzso is considered a crucial step in zzso and therefore it is a potential therapeutic target against zzso We have recently found that zzso expression is highly elevated in zzso zzso and the depletion of zzso leads to substantial reduction in zzso zzso and protein zzso However, the underlying molecular mechanism of zzso zzso expression remains zzso Here, we zzso if zzso regulates zzso expression via zzso zzso and zzso zzso We report that depletion of zzso does not lead to significant change in zzso activity and zzso zzso patterns of the zzso promoter, nor does it affect zzso stability or zzso regulation of zzso zzso depletion of zzso is associated with substantial induction of zzso zzso zzso and reduction of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso which are known to be associated with gene zzso Our data revealed that zzso regulates zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso We zzso that zzso may regulate zzso expression via long-range interaction, or via yet unidentified zzso zzso
