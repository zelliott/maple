zzso targeting gastric cancer cells have effectively cured zzso zzso in a nude mouse model following zzso zzso Because the zzso zzso has proven to be beneficial in targeted therapy, zzso was investigated in this study in order to compare its therapeutic efficacy and toxicity with those of zzso 

zzso mice were zzso zzso with zzso gastric cancer cells expressing zzso and were treated zzso 1 or 8 days later with different activities of specific zzso zzso targeting zzso or with zzso zzso zzso efficacy was evaluated by monitoring survival for up to 250 zzso For evaluation of zzso both zzso of zzso and blood cell counts were determined at different time points and zzso were examined zzso 

Treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly prolonged zzso As expected, treatment on day 1 after zzso cell zzso was more effective than treatment on day 8, and specific zzso zzso were superior to zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso of zzso was most successful, with zzso of the animals surviving longer than 250 zzso However, treatment with zzso effective activities of zzso was not free of toxic side zzso In some animals zzso lymphoma, zzso zzso and zzso were seen but were not observed after treatment with zzso at comparable therapeutic zzso 

The therapeutic efficacy of zzso zzso in zzso zzso is impaired by toxic side zzso Because previous therapy with zzso revealed comparable therapeutic efficacy without toxicity it should be preferred for the treatment of zzso zzso
