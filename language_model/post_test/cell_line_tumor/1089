To test the hypothesis that zzso adult human cartilage zzso zzso are a true zzso primitive zzso 

Studies to characterize zzso HAC included cell cycle and zzso analysis, cell fusion, zzso zzso length zzso and ABC zzso zzso zzso HAC were characterized by flow zzso in parallel with bone zzso zzso stem cells zzso and processed zzso zzso zzso The in zzso differentiation potential of zzso HAC was studied by cell culture under several inducing conditions, in zzso and zzso cell zzso 

zzso HAC cultures were zzso stable and maintained cell cycle dynamics while showing zzso zzso The zzso of zzso HAC was quite similar to that of human bone zzso zzso In addition, this population expressed human embryonic stem cell zzso zzso populations of zzso HAC differentiated to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Following zzso zzso zzso HAC expressed characteristics of zzso cells, including zzso zzso A total of 53 zzso populations of zzso HAC were efficiently zzso 17 were able to differentiate to zzso zzso and zzso zzso No correlation was observed between zzso length or zzso population and differentiation potential in the clones zzso 

zzso HAC should be considered a human zzso primitive zzso
