zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso are potent zzso factors produced by zzso and zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of zzso and zzso in the organ zzso We implanted human zzso colon zzso cell lines into the zzso and zzso wall of nude zzso The expression of zzso and zzso zzso and proteins were examined by reverse zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso Under culture conditions, zzso zzso was not detected in zzso zzso however, zzso expression was detected after zzso of zzso cells into nude zzso zzso and zzso protein contents were higher in zzso zzso wall) zzso than in zzso zzso zzso Small vessels expressing zzso zzso were observed in the peripheral portions of zzso zzso In zzso liver zzso zzso and zzso proteins were produced in lower amounts than those in zzso zzso These data suggest that the expression of zzso factors is influenced by the organ zzso zzso experimental studies of colon cancer zzso should be performed with zzso zzso zzso
