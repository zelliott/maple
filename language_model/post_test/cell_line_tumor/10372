zzso gene zzso involving zzso family genes are a distinguishing feature of human prostate zzso with zzso zzso representing the most common zzso The zzso fusion transcript and its zzso zzso are well characterized in prostate zzso however, not much is known about the levels and regulation of zzso zzso By employing an zzso approach, we show that the zzso gene fusion product binds to the zzso locus and drives the zzso of zzso zzso in prostate zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells resulted in the zzso of zzso zzso transcription, whereas stable zzso of zzso in the gene zzso zzso cells was associated with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Further, zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The loss of zzso zzso expression was associated with a decrease in the invasive potential of zzso zzso zzso 38% of clinically localized prostate zzso and zzso of zzso prostate zzso harboring the zzso gene zzso exhibited zzso of zzso zzso Taken together, these results provide novel insights into the regulation of zzso in human prostate zzso
