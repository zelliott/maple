Most prostate zzso escape zzso therapy by diverse zzso One of them might be growth repression by zzso We reported that zzso zzso the growth in culture of zzso cells (a zzso of zzso zzso and that of zzso cell zzso although tumor growth becomes zzso zzso Here we explore whether zzso tumors contain zzso zzso ME zzso cells were established from zzso zzso The responses to zzso were examined by cell zzso zzso zzso flow zzso zzso zzso and tumor size zzso zzso receptors zzso were analyzed by western zzso and DNA zzso The pattern of responses of these cells to zzso was compared to that of zzso cells and that of zzso cells established from zzso zzso zzso zzso a synthetic zzso zzso zzso the growth of all the six ME cell lines zzso zzso and zzso cells, zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso induced spectacular cell zzso and zzso blocked the cell cycle and induced a modest increase of zzso All the zzso cells expressed the same level of zzso zzso as zzso zzso In nude mice, the growth of zzso cell zzso displayed transient zzso repression similar to that of zzso zzso In culture neither zzso nor zzso zzso altered the effects of zzso on cell zzso These results demonstrate that zzso tumors contain zzso zzso The apparent zzso between the responses to zzso of tumors and those of zzso cells in culture suggests that zzso factors contribute to the zzso responsiveness of tumor cells in zzso These zzso albeit zzso could be suitable targets for restoring the zzso responsiveness of zzso zzso
