Brain zzso of breast cancer seem to be zzso zzso as systemic therapy zzso zzso disease in the brain is associated with high morbidity and zzso We present the first gene expression analysis of zzso zzso cells from zzso human brain zzso of breast cancer compared with zzso primary breast zzso The tumors were matched for zzso zzso stage, and hormone zzso zzso Most zzso expressed genes were zzso in the brain zzso which included, surprisingly, many genes associated with zzso zzso real-time zzso analysis confirmed statistically significant differences or strong trends in the expression of six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso was also of interest because of its increased expression in brain zzso zzso is important in zzso metabolism and zzso In agreement with our zzso results, zzso levels (both zzso and zzso were elevated in a brain zzso zzso zzso of the human breast zzso cell line zzso relative to the parental cell line zzso in zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso cells using short hairpin zzso reduced cell proliferation when cultures were maintained in zzso zzso Finally, zzso expression was analyzed in a cohort of 123 zzso brain zzso of breast zzso High zzso expression was significantly associated with poor patient survival after zzso zzso zzso zzso The data suggest that zzso zzso is associated with zzso to the brain in breast cancer and it may be a therapeutic zzso
