The zzso zzso is important for the zzso dissemination of melanoma zzso We could recently show that zzso can block zzso zzso which zzso next to blocking zzso and zzso to the understanding of zzso activities of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso by numerous zzso is responsible for increased zzso and zzso This has been attributed to zzso binding to, and thus zzso zzso However, a zzso axis has not yet been zzso Since zzso possesses zzso binding capabilities, zzso can be supposed as potential target for zzso to indirectly interfere with zzso zzso The present in zzso studies address zzso the existence of a zzso axis and zzso the functional relevance of zzso interference via zzso The zzso module III of zzso could be exposed as zzso zzso binding site for zzso A zzso zzso of zzso in zzso human melanoma cells reduced zzso cell binding to zzso migration on zzso and zzso zzso functions zzso Using a zzso approach we provide insight into zzso interference with this zzso The zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso binds module IV of zzso with zzso zzso But zzso cannot interfere with zzso zzso onto zzso indicating different zzso binding sites for zzso and other zzso Nonetheless, zzso affects the zzso binding and zzso functions selectively via zzso already at very low concentration most likely by blocking the cellular zzso free zzso This study zzso zzso as promising, and zzso not considered target for zzso to selectively influence zzso zzso
