zzso growth factor zzso beta zzso frequently activated in zzso zzso is a promising cancer therapeutic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a selective inhibitor of zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso and zzso and enhances tumor drug zzso by reducing the zzso fluid zzso We previously showed that zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso Here, we aimed at investigating these combined treatments in a novel zzso zzso 

zzso zzso cells, infected with a zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso were injected in the zzso of severe combined zzso zzso This model allowed imaging of live animals treated with zzso or zzso zzso or with zzso zzso alone, as well as with a combination of zzso and zzso zzso 

We show here that, consistent with our previous in zzso studies, zzso inhibited tumor growth, whereas zzso was zzso even at the highest dosage zzso Compared with zzso the combination of zzso with zzso zzso led to a further tumor growth zzso and improved mice survival, by a decrease rate of tumor cell proliferation and an increase in number of zzso tumor zzso 

zzso zzso enhances the therapeutic response to zzso in accordance with our previous in zzso zzso These in zzso results validate zzso zzso and zzso as a combination treatment of zzso zzso also in view of its known positive effects on tumor drug zzso These zzso provide the rationale for the currently ongoing clinical zzso
