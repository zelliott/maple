Although a high frequency of zzso zzso zzso expression in human breast zzso has been zzso exploiting this knowledge for therapy has been zzso This is in part because zzso can either inhibit or stimulate cell proliferation in zzso models of breast zzso In addition, many breast zzso zzso other steroid hormone receptors that can affect zzso zzso further zzso the effects of zzso on breast cancer zzso 

To create zzso models of zzso signaling in human breast zzso cells, we took zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso human breast zzso cell lines, both zzso and zzso and engineered them to express zzso thus allowing the zzso study of zzso zzso We cloned a full-length zzso of human zzso and expressed this zzso in zzso zzso human breast zzso cells and zzso human zzso zzso We characterized the responses to zzso zzso binding using various zzso and used zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines expressing zzso to demonstrate the requirement for zzso in zzso the zzso responses to zzso signaling in human breast zzso zzso 

We found that zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso from both zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling resulted in a zzso response, whereas zzso signaling from either zzso or zzso zzso resulted in cellular zzso Additionally, zzso gene zzso studies confirmed that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is dependent on zzso 

These studies present a new model for the analysis of zzso signaling in human breast zzso cells lacking zzso zzso providing an experimental system without the potential zzso effects of zzso zzso Using this system, we provide a zzso explanation for previous observations zzso a dual role for zzso signaling in human breast cancer zzso As previous reports have shown that approximately zzso of breast zzso can lack zzso zzso our data also identify potential new zzso for exploiting zzso as a target for breast cancer zzso
