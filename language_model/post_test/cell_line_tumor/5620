Most methods for zzso of rates of zzso production are not zzso in human in zzso clinical zzso We describe here an approach for measuring zzso zzso turnover in zzso using zzso as a precursor for de zzso zzso zzso Because this method involves neither zzso nor toxic zzso it is suitable for human zzso 

For method development in zzso a zzso cell line zzso was cultured in the presence of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to either the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso before zzso We identified optimum zzso and analysis conditions and demonstrated quantitative incorporation of zzso from zzso into zzso of dividing zzso 

Pilot clinical studies demonstrated the zzso of this approach to blood zzso and solid zzso A patient with chronic zzso leukemia received zzso (1 zzso orally in zzso administered every 30 zzso for a period of 10 zzso When we analyzed zzso B cells that had been zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso we observed zzso enrichment, a finding consistent with a zzso zzso production rate of about zzso despite the slow division rates observed in concurrent zzso zzso Similarly, in 2 patients with zzso zzso of zzso zzso administration of zzso (by intravenous infusion for 24 zzso before zzso biopsy allowed zzso of DNA and zzso turnover in zzso zzso zzso 

Our study results demonstrate the zzso that zzso zzso may be used to analyze zzso zzso in addition to DNA zzso zzso in clinical zzso
