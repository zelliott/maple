The high zzso of prostate cancer and lack of an effective, long-term treatment for zzso disease highlights the need for more potent zzso vitamin D zzso as potential alternative or zzso prostate cancer zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso zzso known as zzso or zzso has less zzso effects and an zzso activity as zzso D3 zzso in several in zzso and in zzso zzso It was recently demonstrated that a modified analog of zzso zzso D3 zzso compared to zzso was more effective in zzso proliferation of an immortalized normal prostate cell line zzso zzso and invasion of zzso prostate cancer cells zzso In this study, the effects of zzso and zzso on zzso vitamin D zzso zzso vitamin zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and induction of zzso gene expression were compared in an zzso prostate cancer cell model, zzso The results demonstrated that zzso was zzso more active than zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso was more active than zzso in zzso a vitamin D zzso zzso construct and inducing zzso gene expression in zzso prostate cancer zzso In addition, zzso has a lower affinity for zzso and less zzso degradation by zzso compared to zzso indicating that zzso has more zzso and a longer zzso Thus, these data suggest that zzso may be a potential candidate as a therapeutic agent for prostate cancer, especially for patients who fail in conventional zzso
