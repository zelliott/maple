It has been recently reported that zzso zzso a zzso zzso is able to kill zzso cells, both in zzso and in zzso independently of zzso zzso zzso However, the underlying zzso mechanisms were not zzso In the present study, we performed zzso analysis of the effect of zzso both in zzso by using zzso tumor zzso excised from nude mice, and in zzso by using zzso zzso zzso In zzso exposure of tumor zzso to zzso significantly decreased the activity and content of zzso zzso by approximately zzso and of its end product zzso B4 ( approximately zzso In contrast zzso zzso activity and content, and the amount of its end product zzso zzso were not affected by zzso In addition, in zzso treatment with zzso markedly zzso ( approximately zzso the activity of fatty acid zzso zzso zzso the main zzso zzso while decreasing zzso content ( approximately zzso and binding to zzso zzso receptors ( approximately zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells with zzso a specific zzso zzso significantly enhanced the zzso effect of zzso whereas the zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso did not alter zzso zzso The study of the zzso system revealed that zzso was able to induce a zzso increase of zzso activity in zzso zzso Moreover, a significantly reduced growth rate was observed in zzso zzso cells, compared to zzso zzso In conclusion, the present investigation indicates that zzso exerts its zzso effects through zzso of the zzso zzso and of the zzso system, suggesting a possible interaction of these routes in the control of tumor zzso
