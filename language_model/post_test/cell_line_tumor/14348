zzso evidence suggests that zzso zzso zzso zzso triggers the early pathological events in Alzheimer's disease zzso However, little is known about the consequence of zzso zzso In this study, we zzso expressed zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso cells by expressing a fusion protein of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso are zzso produced with the same zzso ratio in the zzso zzso was completely zzso in more than 50% of the zzso zzso However, if zzso was not zzso in their zzso then zzso cells underwent zzso The number of zzso cells is significantly increased by the zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso which has escaped degradation zzso zzso and thereby may accelerate the zzso of zzso and its zzso zzso Our findings suggest that cells have the potential to degrade zzso in their zzso but if zzso appears in the zzso due to its incomplete degradation, it accumulates and may trigger the fatal cascade of pathology of zzso
