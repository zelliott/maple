The use of zzso zzso in a multiplex zzso can have several advantages over the zzso method for an experimental zzso zzso such as zzso zzso screening purposes, efficiency, and in zzso applications can be addressed using a multiplex zzso Here we describe a functional reporter multiplex method using zzso zzso fused to zzso tags to identify the different reporters that are zzso zzso specific zzso are used to bind and separate the zzso zzso zzso
