The present work investigates the relationship between cancer cell zzso and zzso distribution, molecular interaction, and metabolism of an zzso zzso To get insights into this relationship, we took advantage of the differential sensitivity of two breast cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso to zzso along with the property of zzso acid zzso zzso to zzso enhance their zzso zzso The fluorescent drug zzso zzso was used because of the possibility to study its zzso zzso by zzso spectral imaging zzso The use of zzso allowed us to obtain zzso maps of four zzso zzso nuclear zzso bound to DNA, zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and finally, zzso in a low polarity environment characteristic of zzso zzso cells were found to be more sensitive to zzso zzso zzso 18 zzso than zzso cells zzso zzso 196 zzso According to zzso levels, the nuclear and zzso zzso content was higher in zzso than in zzso cells, indicating that mechanisms other than nuclear zzso zzso account for zzso In the zzso the relative proportion of oxidized zzso was higher in zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso cells to zzso and increased zzso zzso by zzso in zzso cells zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was attributed mainly to the zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso effect on both zzso zzso and cell zzso to zzso We conclude that drug metabolism and zzso are associated with cell zzso and the related zzso mechanisms may involve zzso zzso
