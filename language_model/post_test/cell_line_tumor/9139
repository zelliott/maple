The recent development of hormonal therapy that blocks zzso synthesis represents a major advance in the treatment of zzso zzso breast zzso However, cancer cells often acquire adaptations resulting in zzso A recent report reveals that zzso zzso zzso of breast cancer cells requires zzso an zzso zzso protein located primarily at the zzso zzso zzso zzso for novel partners that interact with zzso at the zzso we discovered that zzso selectively forms complex with the zzso protein zzso a major zzso zzso with zzso properties naturally induced in the tumor zzso zzso zzso decreases zzso of zzso cells induced by zzso zzso For zzso zzso breast cancer cells, zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transition, and zzso zzso Further, zzso of zzso zzso by small interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso This effect was substantially reduced when the expression of zzso was also reduced by zzso Our results provide the first evidence that zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso in human breast cancer cells via a novel mechanism zzso by zzso These results further suggest that zzso expression level in the tumor cells may serve as a zzso marker for responsiveness to hormonal therapy based on zzso zzso and that combination therapy targeting zzso may enhance efficacy and reduce zzso
