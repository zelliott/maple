zzso zzso and its zzso are widely used for the treatment of a variety of human solid zzso However, the molecular mechanism of its action remains to be zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso is a potent zzso of zzso and is zzso in many human zzso In this study we demonstrated that zzso zzso expression in human zzso cancer zzso We found that zzso inhibited the zzso reporter activity in a zzso manner, indicating that zzso zzso zzso of zzso We also found that: zzso zzso activity zzso by the zzso reporter containing a zzso of the zzso binding site was much lower than that of the reporter containing a zzso zzso binding site in zzso cancer cells, thus confirming that zzso is a major zzso regulator of zzso zzso and that zzso zzso greatly inhibited zzso reporter activity containing the zzso but not the zzso zzso binding zzso This result indicates that zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically by decreasing zzso zzso zzso of a dominant negative construct of zzso inhibited zzso reporter activity in zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically through the expression of zzso but not zzso We demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso cancer cells, and that zzso zzso expression was linked with cellular zzso which was rescued by zzso zzso These results suggest a novel mechanism of zzso zzso activity in zzso cancer cells via zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso
