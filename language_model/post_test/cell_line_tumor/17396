zzso zzso is the zzso agent of zzso zzso zzso A major zzso factor of zzso zzso is zzso a toxin that causes massive zzso of zzso cell lines in zzso and gastric zzso erosion in zzso Although zzso is exported over the outer membrane and is released from the bacteria, a portion of the toxin remains associated with the bacterial zzso We have found zzso toxin to be biologically active and zzso organized into distinct zzso zzso on the bacterial zzso Upon bacterial contact with host cells, toxin clusters are transferred directly from the bacterial surface to the host cell surface at the zzso zzso followed by zzso and zzso This zzso transfer of zzso represents a zzso route for delivery of zzso and potentially other bacterial zzso molecules to target zzso
