zzso zzso orphan zzso zzso alpha is a nuclear zzso involved in many zzso processes such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the present study we first demonstrate that zzso increases the amount of zzso transcripts in a wide panel of cell lines derived from diverse zzso In addition, we identified a functional promoter sequence upstream of the first zzso of the human zzso zzso spanning zzso and zzso from the translation initiation site of zzso When cloned in a zzso reporter zzso this sequence allowed the efficient zzso of the zzso gene in several cell zzso Interestingly, the activity of the zzso promoter was enhanced by zzso in zzso human zzso cells, and this effect was dependent on an zzso zzso response zzso spanning from zzso to zzso Using zzso zzso we showed that zzso zzso factor 1), which plays a key role in the zzso response to zzso bound to this zzso zzso of zzso increased the activity of the zzso promoter through the zzso zzso of a zzso form of zzso producing zzso inactive zzso zzso abolished hypoxic zzso of the zzso zzso This indicated that zzso is involved in the response of zzso to zzso Taken together, our data reveal zzso as a new zzso target zzso This illustrates, at the molecular level, the existence of zzso between zzso pathways zzso by zzso and those zzso by nuclear zzso
