zzso bone zzso transplantation zzso an important treatment for zzso zzso is often complicated by zzso disease zzso zzso of zzso is associated with the unwanted zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to maintain the benefits of zzso during zzso suppression through isolated blockade of zzso migration zzso To this end, we developed a zzso model of zzso zzso which was treated with zzso to induce zzso Within this model, functional blockade of zzso was analyzed by observing zzso zzso and clinical variables of zzso zzso zzso zzso of collected tissue identified several zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso zzso that were zzso during zzso but reduced by zzso the zzso zzso In addition, donor zzso blockade of zzso combined with recipient administration of zzso caused a significant decrease in zzso while preserving the zzso zzso We propose that blocking the zzso axis represents a novel strategy to separate the toxicity of zzso from the beneficial effects of zzso after zzso zzso
