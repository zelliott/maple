To evaluate the killing effect of zzso double suicide gene driven by zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter on gastric cancer zzso zzso 

The zzso packaging cells were zzso by the plasmids zzso to generate infectious zzso The gastric cancer zzso cells were infected by the Ad followed by treatment with zzso and/or zzso at different zzso The zzso effects were evaluated and the bystander effects analyzed after zzso of the cells without zzso infection with the infected cells at different zzso The cell cycle distribution was detected by flow zzso and the pathological changes of the cells were observed by electron zzso 

The infection rate of the zzso zzso Ad in the cells increased gradually with zzso of the zzso of infection zzso of the zzso The killing effect of zzso fusion gene on the zzso cells was much stronger than that of either of the single suicide gene ( zzso and considerable bystander effect was zzso The Ad infection caused zzso cell growth arrest at zzso phase with onset of zzso and zzso zzso of the cells as seen under electron zzso 

The zzso fusion gene system driven by the zzso promoter possesses effective killing effect on the zzso gastric cancer zzso zzso
