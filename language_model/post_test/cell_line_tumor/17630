zzso oxygen species including zzso activate an array of zzso zzso zzso that are closely associated with cell death and cell survival zzso The human zzso zzso cell line is widely used as model cell system for studying zzso cell death induced by zzso zzso However, at present very little is known about the zzso pathways activated by zzso in zzso zzso zzso in this study we have investigated the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso B zzso zzso in zzso and differentiated zzso zzso zzso zzso time and concentration increases in zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and differentiated zzso zzso No increases in zzso zzso zzso were observed following zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso increases in zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso increases in zzso zzso were sensitive to the zzso zzso 1 zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso responses were blocked by the zzso inhibitor SP zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso (1 zzso 16 zzso significantly increased the release of zzso zzso zzso into the culture medium indicative of a decrease in cell zzso zzso with zzso SP zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso release from zzso or differentiated zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and zzso zzso significantly decreased zzso cell death in both zzso and differentiated zzso zzso In conclusion, we have shown that zzso stimulates robust increases in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and differentiated zzso zzso Furthermore, the data presented clearly suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso protects zzso cells from zzso cell zzso
