zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso in the pathways of cholesterol zzso It has been shown that new zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso activity in animal experimental zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso has been shown to be released in response to zzso however, its role in cellular protection has remained zzso The effect of increased local production of AM in cells and zzso zzso of AM receptors has not been investigated zzso We hypothesized that increased expression of AM in hypoxic cells was the result of excessive AM production with zzso AM zzso zzso zzso protein degradation and that the new specific zzso inhibitor would reduce AM induction in zzso and thus proliferation of zzso In order to investigate specific cellular AM signaling and protection induced by zzso we characterized specific zzso zzso receptors expressed on cells, evaluated AM zzso zzso zzso AM zzso expression in cultured cells zzso zzso and proliferation zzso of zzso in control, hypoxic and metabolically stressed human zzso cell lines exposed to gradually increasing zzso of zzso The new zzso inhibitor zzso in concentration zzso and zzso zzso significantly zzso specific AM receptors on zzso cells, reduced AM zzso of zzso cells exposed to zzso These results suggest that zzso as new member of zzso family of zzso could zzso regulate cell proliferation induced by zzso which may correlate with zzso of zzso AM receptors on zzso cells, and moreover, with the induction and expression of AM in zzso
