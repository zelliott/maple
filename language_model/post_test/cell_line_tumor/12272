zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that has been implicated in breast cancer progression and zzso Research concerning how zzso functions in tumor progression has led to the identification of a limited number of genes that contribute functionally to zzso cellular zzso Recent zzso analysis, comparing zzso breast cancer cells zzso to zzso zzso zzso with control cells, revealed zzso zzso 2 zzso to be a gene highly zzso in zzso zzso In this study, we further examined the relationship between zzso and zzso We show that zzso zzso cells express high levels of zzso which is associated with increased zzso production and zzso retention and is necessary for tumor cell zzso to bone zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso Finally, stable zzso of zzso zzso into zzso cells zzso zzso resulted in a reduction in zzso zzso zzso production, and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso also resulted in a significant decrease in cellular proliferation and colony growth in soft zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report of the ability of zzso to regulate zzso expression and zzso production in breast cancer cells and further illustrates a unique functional relationship by which enhanced zzso production zzso zzso cell zzso
