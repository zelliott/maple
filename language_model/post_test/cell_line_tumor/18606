zzso of zzso D was investigated after treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso hormone treatment resulted in both zzso and zzso increases of zzso D activity, zzso of protein zzso zzso and zzso I zzso from zzso to membrane within 30 zzso and zzso zzso increase of zzso zzso C zzso zzso calcium concentration was rapidly increased and zzso level remained high up to 3 h after the zzso zzso of the cells with zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso C, inhibited zzso zzso zzso D zzso zzso zzso C activity was zzso by zzso of the zzso cells with either protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso or zzso of the cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 24 zzso This treatment largely abolished the zzso zzso zzso of zzso D, thus further confirming the involvement of protein zzso C in the zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso D zzso may be due to zzso zzso C, and zzso of protein zzso C zzso is responsible for this zzso
