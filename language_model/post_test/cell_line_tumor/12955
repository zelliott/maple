Cancer gene therapy using tumor zzso genes is considered to be an attractive approach for arresting cell growth and inducing zzso zzso cell death 4 zzso is a tumor zzso zzso which prevents zzso and tumor zzso To address the issue of whether expression of zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso cells, the zzso gene was delivered using zzso zzso containing zzso gene zzso was constructed by attachment of zzso to the zzso surface using chemical zzso The zzso showed enhanced zzso efficiency, efficiently expressed zzso zzso and induced zzso in human zzso zzso zzso cells as compared with an unmodified zzso In a tumor zzso study, injection of zzso into tumors established from the zzso cell line by subcutaneous zzso significantly suppressed tumor growth and induced zzso Thus, this study shows a new zzso tumor zzso gene delivery system for cancer zzso
