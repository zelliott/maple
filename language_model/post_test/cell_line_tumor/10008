zzso factor zzso and membrane zzso protein zzso are the key molecules involved in cell protection against zzso complement, which restricts the action of complement at critical stages of the cascade zzso The cooperative effect of zzso and zzso on the survival of human cervical cancer cell zzso has not been zzso 

In this study we applied, for the first time, short hairpin zzso zzso to knock down the expression of the zzso and zzso with the aim of exploiting complement more effectively for tumor cell zzso Meanwhile, we investigated the cooperative effects of zzso and zzso on the viability and migration, zzso the proliferation of zzso zzso 

The results showed that zzso zzso of zzso and zzso expression enhanced zzso zzso zzso up to zzso for zzso and up to zzso for zzso and the combined zzso of both regulators yielded further additive effects in zzso zzso Thus, the activities of zzso and zzso when present together, are greater than the sum of the two protein zzso 

These data indicated that combined zzso and zzso zzso described in this study may offer an additional alternative to improve the efficacy of zzso zzso cancer zzso
