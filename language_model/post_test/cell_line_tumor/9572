zzso cells reorganize their zzso zzso in response to zzso calcium signals while in parallel zzso zzso and other inflammatory zzso The effect of calcium on zzso is zzso in large part through zzso zzso zzso is concentrated in the zzso zzso of zzso mast zzso zzso with small interfering zzso directed against the zzso and zzso protein zzso dramatically reduced expression of the latter protein and reduced or eliminated the concentration of zzso at the zzso zzso Both zzso reorganization and zzso were enhanced in zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest a model in which zzso is targeted to and zzso at the zzso zzso by zzso Upon cell stimulation and the subsequent zzso increase, it is immediately available to activate local downstream zzso
