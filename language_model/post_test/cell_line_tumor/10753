The poor efficacy of various zzso treatments against zzso cells has focused attention on the role of tumor zzso in cancer zzso To understand the contribution of the zzso zzso zzso environment to this phenomenon, we isolated zzso surrogate invading cell populations from zzso breast cancer cells and studied their zzso and zzso zzso 

We isolated invasive zzso zzso from non invasive populations zzso using a zzso zzso a surrogate of zzso membrane zzso zzso and zzso populations were investigated by zzso zzso and for their capacities to zzso invade and zzso in zzso and to form zzso in nude zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso were stable in culture and present different zzso zzso zzso cells were characterized by reduced expression of cell zzso and zzso junction genes zzso of down regulated zzso and by a gain in expression of zzso and zzso gene zzso In line with this zzso in zzso zzso cells showed reduced zzso and increased zzso through zzso zzso and zzso When injected into the zzso zzso cells induced zzso formation, and reduced injected mice survival by up to zzso as compared to zzso zzso In nude mice, zzso zzso grew rapidly inducing vessel formation and displaying resistance to zzso 

Our findings reveal that the in zzso zzso zzso per zzso was sufficient to select for tumor cells with a stable zzso zzso in zzso characterized by loss of zzso molecules expression and induction of zzso and survival zzso
