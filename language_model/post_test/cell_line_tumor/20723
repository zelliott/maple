To investigate the killing effect on zzso cells of a combination of zzso and TRAIL and related molecular zzso 

TRAIL and zzso were applied to zzso cells zzso or jointly and survival zzso rates were measured by zzso zzso changes of cellular shape being assessed with zzso phase contrast and zzso zzso zzso rates were analyzed by flow zzso zzso and zzso was used to examine zzso expression of zzso zzso 

The survival zzso rate of combined application of 100 zzso TRAIL and 1 zzso zzso on zzso cells was significantly higher than that of either agent zzso ( zzso Changes of cellular shape and zzso rates also indicated zzso effects of combined application to be much stronger than those of individual zzso zzso had the effect of zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso 

A combination of TRAIL and zzso exerts strong killing effects on zzso cells which might be related to zzso of zzso zzso
