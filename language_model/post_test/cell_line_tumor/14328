Among numerous gene therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment, gene transfer by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso may be useful because of the possibility that it will yield zzso zzso immune responses, and zzso zzso In this study, we constructed a human zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso and armed with a mouse or human zzso gene to generate novel immune zzso therapeutic systems, zzso and zzso zzso The systems can specifically target, replicate in, and lyse cancer cells, while sparing normal zzso The advantage of these systems is that the number of zzso copies and their expression increase markedly via viral replication within infected cancer cells, and zzso viral progeny can then zzso additional cancer cells within the tumor zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso in liver cancer models in both zzso and zzso mice by triplex mechanisms including selective zzso zzso and immune zzso We conclude that combining immune gene therapy and zzso zzso can enhance zzso efficacy as a result of zzso between zzso zzso and zzso composite zzso zzso
