Since zzso synthesis of zzso zzso is coupled to the zzso respiratory chain zzso via zzso acid zzso zzso respiratory chain dysfunction should impair zzso zzso To investigate this, we used specific zzso zzso zzso A and zzso to treat primary human zzso and zzso cells, a human zzso cell line, in zzso This resulted in severe impairment of de zzso zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso zzso were not restricted to zzso zzso but concerned zzso zzso zzso While the total amount of zzso zzso was not diminished, they were significantly broken down from zzso to zzso reflecting impaired zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso was similar to that of zzso zzso This was surprising since zzso zzso complex I of the respiratory chain, which is upstream of zzso where zzso interacts with the zzso In order to avoid unspecific effects of zzso we examined the consequences of a zzso DNA zzso that causes a specific complex I zzso The effect was much less pronounced than with zzso suggesting that complex I zzso cannot fully explain the marked effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso
