Three zzso zzso zzso zzso hollow zzso zzso and zzso zzso were evaluated for their comparative zzso efficiencies at killing three types of zzso cells zzso lung cancer cells, zzso zzso cancer cells and zzso zzso cancer zzso using a CW zzso zzso zzso efficiency was evaluated as a function of the number of zzso required to destroy the cancer cells under zzso zzso laser wavelength at fixed laser zzso Of the three zzso zzso zzso needed the minimum number of particles to produce effective zzso whereas zzso zzso needed the largest number of zzso Together with the calculated zzso conversion efficiency, the zzso efficiency rankings are zzso zzso zzso hollow zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, we found that zzso cells seem to present better heat tolerance than the other two cancer cell zzso
