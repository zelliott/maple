zzso zzso are zzso zzso which regulate the expression of number of zzso zzso genes responsible for a variety of biological zzso Deciphering the molecular mechanism of action of these compounds is of great importance because it would increase our understanding of the zzso these zzso chemicals play in prevention and treatment of zzso zzso In this study, we applied suppression zzso zzso zzso to identify genes that are regulated by zzso through either the classic zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso from zzso zzso treated zzso cells as zzso resulted in a significant increase in zzso zzso expression levels as compared with 10 zzso zzso zzso or the no treatment zzso zzso zzso expression was up regulated two- to fivefold following exposure to zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso protein expression was up regulated 12- to zzso GE regulation of zzso was zzso zzso in the presence of the zzso zzso both zzso zzso and protein expression were zzso Analysis of the zzso promoter using zzso zzso showed a zzso association of zzso zzso alpha zzso and beta zzso to the zzso zzso This association was specific for zzso since association was not observed when the cells were zzso with GE and the zzso zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that the levels of zzso zzso zzso are regulated by zzso through an zzso zzso zzso and further suggest that zzso may control the ratio of zzso to zzso of the zzso complex in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2009 zzso zzso
