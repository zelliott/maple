zzso acting through the zzso zzso zzso and its zzso prepares the human zzso for zzso to zzso zzso and maintains zzso The zzso zzso expression of melanoma zzso zzso in the zzso human zzso suggested a novel function in human zzso zzso Here we show that zzso is an zzso zzso responsible for the greater zzso activity of human zzso relative to zzso zzso was recruited to zzso response regions of zzso zzso protein 5 zzso zzso and small Ras family G protein cell growth inhibitor zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso cells expressing zzso showed that zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso was not required for zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso Target gene specificity of zzso depended on the synergistic actions of zzso and zzso zzso by the unique zzso zzso zzso motif that interacts with the zzso zzso region in a zzso and zzso zzso A zzso mechanism is proposed in which zzso and zzso increase zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso similar to the effects of zzso and interacts with zzso to stabilize a complex with zzso We conclude that the zzso function of zzso extends to zzso regulation of zzso during the zzso development of the human zzso
