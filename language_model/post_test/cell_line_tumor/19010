To investigate the effect of zzso zzso zzso interference zzso in zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso gene in breast cancer cells in zzso 

A small interfering zzso zzso targeting zzso gene was constructed and zzso into human breast cancer cell in zzso via zzso zzso The zzso cells were zzso into nude mice, and the tumor growth zzso rate was zzso The tumors were then removed for zzso and Western zzso to examine the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to detect the zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso performed to assess the zzso level in both the serum and tumor zzso 

In zzso nude mice, zzso cells had obviously lower tumor formation rate than zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso of the cells with zzso zzso significantly inhibited tumor formation capacity of the cells in zzso as compared with the cells zzso with empty zzso or irrelevant zzso The results of zzso demonstrated that in mice bearing the tumors grown from zzso zzso cells, the zzso levels in the serum and tumor extraction were lowered by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso caused a specific zzso of zzso zzso expression by zzso in the zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso duplexes can be effectively delivered via zzso 2000 into breast cancer cells in zzso to induce a zzso gene zzso effect than in zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene may indicate a promising approach for management of lung zzso especially those zzso ones with easy zzso
