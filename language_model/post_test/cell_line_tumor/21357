A variety of fluorescent proteins with different spectral properties have been created by mutating green fluorescent zzso When these proteins are split in two, neither zzso is fluorescent per se, nor can a fluorescent protein be zzso by zzso the complementary zzso and zzso zzso However, when these fragments are genetically fused to proteins that associate with each other in zzso the zzso and zzso fragments of the fluorescent protein are brought together and can zzso a fluorescent zzso A similar protein zzso zzso zzso can be performed with two complementary fragments of various zzso zzso This makes these zzso useful tools for detecting the association of two proteins in living zzso zzso resonance energy transfer zzso or zzso resonance energy transfer zzso occurs when energy from, respectively, a zzso or fluorescent donor protein is zzso transferred to a fluorescent zzso zzso This transfer of energy can only occur if the proteins are within zzso of each zzso Thus, zzso and zzso are also useful tools for detecting the association of two proteins in living zzso By combining different protein zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso or zzso it is possible to demonstrate that three or more proteins are simultaneous parts of the same protein complex in living zzso As an example of the utility of this approach, we show that as many as four different proteins are simultaneously associated as part of a G zzso zzso zzso zzso
