zzso therapy zzso which is used clinically for the zzso treatment of cancer, zzso local tumor cell death but has no effect on tumors in zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to determine if local zzso followed by zzso injection of zzso zzso cells zzso zzso systemic zzso immunity that can inhibit the growth of zzso as well as zzso + zzso zzso 

zzso or zzso mice were injected zzso with zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso melanoma cells, respectively, and following 10 to 12 days of tumor growth, the tumors were treated with zzso alone or zzso followed by zzso or zzso In other studies, tumors were established simultaneously in both lower zzso or in one flank and in the zzso but only one flank was zzso 

Whereas neither zzso nor zzso alone was effective, zzso + zzso eradicated both zzso and zzso tumors in a significant proportion of animals and prolonged the survival of mice of which the tumors were not zzso The zzso of mice treated with zzso + zzso contained zzso zzso and zzso T cells whereas the zzso of control groups did zzso Moreover, adoptive transfer of zzso from successfully treated zzso zzso mice protected zzso animals from a subsequent challenge with zzso and this was zzso mainly by zzso T zzso Most importantly, zzso plus zzso administered to one tumor site led to tumor zzso at distant sites, including multiple lung zzso 

zzso + zzso zzso potent systemic zzso immunity in mice and should be evaluated in the treatment of human zzso
