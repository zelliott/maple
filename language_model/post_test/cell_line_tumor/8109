The presence of vascular invasion in zzso cancer zzso zzso with zzso and is a critical zzso of both the therapeutic approach and the recurrence or zzso zzso The authors sought to identify candidate therapeutic agents capable of targeting the invasive zzso in zzso 

A gene expression signature associated with vascular invasion derived from 81 human cases of zzso was used to screen a database of 453 zzso profiles associated with zzso zzso molecules using the connectivity zzso zzso agents were identified by their inverse correlation to the query gene zzso The efficacy of the candidate agents to target invasion was zzso verified in zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The gene signature associated with vascular invasion in zzso comprised of 47 zzso and 26 zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed several putative candidates, including zzso and zzso zzso Both of these agents reduced zzso cell invasion at zzso zzso zzso a heat shock protein 90 zzso zzso was shown to zzso the expression of several diverse zzso zzso including zzso part of the query signature, and zzso an zzso protein with a tumor zzso role in zzso 

Candidates for further evaluation as therapies to limit invasion in zzso have been identified using a zzso zzso analysis of zzso gene zzso zzso targeting using zzso profiling is a rational approach for drug zzso zzso strategies targeting a defined zzso zzso can be identified without a detailed knowledge of individual downstream zzso
