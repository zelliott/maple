The zzso zzso factor human zzso zzso specifically promotes the proliferation of zzso and enhances their zzso We examined the effects of zzso on cervical cancer cell lines of zzso origin, in which the differentiation program is zzso From zzso a clone that can be induced to make zzso by zzso zzso was prepared and zzso Shortly after the zzso the cells expressed zzso 10 zzso a major marker protein in zzso zzso While maintained for several days in the presence of zzso the zzso cells showed a slightly prolonged time of population doubling, the occasional appearance of flat cells with lowered DNA zzso and a low level of zzso DNA zzso In zzso and zzso zzso cultures, zzso zzso and zzso DNA fragmentation were detected at 48 h after infection with an zzso zzso capable of expressing zzso A colony zzso zzso showed that the growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells was zzso as seen from the decreased number and average size of the drug-resistant colonies at 2 or 3 weeks after zzso with a zzso that can express zzso and zzso resistance zzso These results suggest that the expression of zzso zzso the growth of the cervical cancer cells through the partial resumption of the differentiation zzso followed by slow suppression of cell replication and zzso
