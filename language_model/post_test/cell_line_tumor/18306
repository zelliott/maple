zzso was isolated as a zzso binding protein that also binds to the zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene is a potent zzso inhibitor and a putative tumor zzso since it zzso zzso activity and affects zzso in nude zzso This study investigated aberrations of zzso gene in gastrointestinal tract zzso zzso We examined zzso zzso expression and promoter zzso of zzso gene in 15 zzso cell lines, and 20 patients with primary zzso We found a zzso zzso at zzso 254 zzso in a colon and an zzso zzso cell line, and in zzso and matching normal zzso of 2 patients with primary zzso zzso It might be a benign zzso No zzso was found in the promoter region and the treatment by zzso did not affect zzso zzso expression level in any of the cell zzso It was concluded that the human zzso does not affect zzso of human zzso
