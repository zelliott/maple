This paper presents a zzso zzso chip capable of forming and zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso using removable cell zzso zzso Compared to the conventional zzso zzso formation methods, including zzso zzso and zzso methods, the recent zzso zzso chips have the advantage of forming smaller zzso with better zzso The recent zzso zzso chips, however, have difficulties in zzso the zzso due to fixed cell zzso zzso The present zzso zzso having two zzso zzso uses removable cell zzso zzso thereby making it easy to form and extract uniform and zzso zzso We have zzso zzso and characterized a 4 zzso 1 zzso zzso where membrane cell zzso barriers are inflated at a pressure of 50 zzso for zzso formation and are zzso at zero gauge pressure for simple and safe extraction of the zzso zzso In this experimental study, the cell suspension of zzso lung cancer cells, zzso is supplied to the zzso zzso chip in the pressure range zzso zzso The zzso zzso chips collect the cancer cells in the cell zzso regions from the cell suspension at a concentration of 2 zzso zzso zzso thus forming uniform zzso zzso with a diameter of zzso zzso zzso zzso after 24 h incubation at zzso zzso and zzso zzso After the removal of the cell zzso zzso the zzso formed were extracted through the outlet ports at a cell inlet pressure of 5 zzso The cells in the extracted zzso showed a viability of zzso zzso zzso The present zzso chip offers a simple and effective method of obtaining uniform and zzso zzso zzso for the next stage of zzso biomedical research, such as gene expression analysis and zzso zzso in animal zzso
