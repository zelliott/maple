The zzso zzso zzso is zzso and highly associated with poor prognosis in many zzso Nevertheless, the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso has not been thoroughly zzso The aim of this study is to investigate the expression of zzso and its zzso value in zzso patients after zzso zzso 

zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso and real-time quantitative zzso zzso were used to measure zzso zzso expression in 60 pairs of zzso tumors and matched zzso zzso zzso expression was detected in zzso cell lines by Western zzso zzso Furthermore, we investigated zzso expression in correlation with the zzso features and analyzed the potential zzso significance of zzso in 192 zzso patients by zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso was significantly higher in zzso tumor zzso than in their paired zzso liver zzso The expression of zzso protein was detected in five zzso cell zzso Positive zzso protein expression was significantly associated with a high zzso zzso level zzso zzso zzso large tumor size zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso vascular invasion zzso zzso zzso zzso formation zzso zzso zzso and poor differentiation zzso zzso zzso In zzso and zzso zzso zzso was an excellent zzso factor for both recurrence-free survival and overall survival zzso zzso expression status was associated with poor prognosis independent of zzso zzso stage and zzso zzso 

The zzso is a potential zzso zzso for survival and tumor recurrence in zzso patients after zzso zzso
