zzso of zzso DNA is thought to be one of the mechanisms zzso zzso genes in zzso To identify the most likely target for amplification in the region zzso detected previously in zzso cells by a zzso screening of DNA zzso aberrations in a panel of oral zzso zzso zzso cell lines, we determined the extent of the zzso analyzed a panel of cell lines for the expression of candidate genes within the zzso and then evaluated zzso effects by knocking down genes of zzso zzso information about the function and/or expression of each zzso remarkable zzso in zzso cells and relatively frequent zzso in additional zzso lines compared with an immortalized normal oral zzso cell line, and expression zzso zzso activity led us to conclude that the zzso zzso 4 zzso gene was the most likely zzso An zzso analysis of primary tumors from 105 cases of head and neck SCC including 50 cases of zzso demonstrated the zzso of zzso to be significantly associated with a poorer zzso These findings reveal that the zzso zzso through amplification or other mechanisms promotes the proliferation and/or survival of zzso cells, and that zzso might be a good diagnostic and/or therapeutic zzso
