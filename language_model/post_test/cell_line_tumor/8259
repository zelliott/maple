The zzso zzso zzso zzso has recently been identified as a zzso zzso target that controls the zzso zzso architecture through repulsive interactions with zzso zzso Many reports have demonstrated that most human zzso zzso lose zzso expression despite zzso zzso zzso zzso we investigated the mechanisms that cause zzso zzso in zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that DNA zzso was not responsible for the frequent loss of zzso expression in zzso zzso Cloning and functional characterization of the zzso gene zzso region revealed a potential negative regulatory element in the zzso regulatory zzso In zzso zzso gel mobility shift and in zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso directly binds to the putative zzso zzso zzso activity or knocking down zzso expression by zzso interference in colon cancer cells was sufficient to induce zzso zzso Furthermore, transient zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in colon cancer zzso We demonstrate for the first time that zzso acts as a zzso zzso of zzso and plays an active role in zzso zzso in zzso zzso
