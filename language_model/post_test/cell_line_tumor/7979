More than zzso of human transcripts have naturally occurring zzso products (or natural zzso zzso some of which may play a key role in a range of human zzso To date, several databases of in zzso defined human zzso zzso pairs have appeared, however no study has focused on differential expression of zzso pairs in breast zzso We therefore investigated the expression levels of sense and zzso transcripts in normal and zzso human breast zzso using the zzso zzso Plus zzso and zzso zzso Breast Cancer zzso zzso technologies as well as zzso parallel signature sequencing zzso zzso 

The expression of more than zzso zzso transcripts were detected in normal breast duct zzso cells and in primary breast tumors substantially enriched for their zzso cell content by zzso zzso zzso of 431 zzso were confirmed by either of the other two zzso A corresponding sense transcript could be identified on zzso for zzso zzso zzso Of these zzso pairs, zzso have not been previously zzso A positive correlation of differential expression between normal and zzso breast samples was observed for most zzso zzso Orientation specific zzso of selected zzso pairs validated their expression in several breast cancer cell lines and solid breast zzso 

zzso and zzso enriched zzso platforms (such as Breast Cancer zzso confirm the assumption that zzso zzso in the human breast is more prevalent than previously zzso zzso of a proportion of these zzso has already been confirmed by other technologies while the true existence of the remaining ones has to be zzso Nevertheless, future studies will reveal whether the relative zzso of zzso and sense transcripts have regulatory influences on the translation of these zzso
