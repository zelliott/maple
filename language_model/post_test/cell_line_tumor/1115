zzso of zzso especially its zzso zzso occurs consistently in colon cancer, as compared to zzso normal zzso and this change occurs also in most other types of zzso One of the basic features of zzso transformation is the acquisition of resistance to zzso In this study, we asked whether the expression of zzso and some of its zzso zzso commonly found in colon cancer participate in resistance to zzso and what are the mechanisms zzso A human colon cancer cell line, zzso which does not express zzso was zzso zzso with standard, zzso and zzso containing zzso of zzso zzso and zzso cells were exposed to zzso to induce zzso zzso and zzso changes relevant to the mechanisms of zzso were monitored by flow zzso DNA zzso and zzso zzso It was observed that resistance to zzso induced by zzso is promoted by zzso expression in zzso and this resistance is better sustained by the full zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 9, zzso 3, zzso and zzso indicated that the resistance to zzso in this model involved the zzso zzso The differential response of zzso zzso was associated with a zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The results of this study are consistent with the conclusion that expression of zzso zzso zzso which is characteristic of colon cancer, and most other types of cancer, zzso a selective advantage to resist zzso thereby promoting cell transformation into a zzso zzso in conjunction with other zzso zzso
