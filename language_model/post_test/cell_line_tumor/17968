zzso cell zzso of zzso zzso is a small zzso protein of unknown zzso zzso is enriched in the zzso complex and its zzso half contains a BAR domain, a module that can zzso zzso and interacts with zzso Here we show that in zzso zzso cells zzso binds to the small zzso zzso which regulates the transport of zzso zzso between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso in a zzso fashion and recruits it to zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso in zzso cells results in a zzso characterized zzso zzso impaired zzso transport of the zzso zzso protein precursors zzso and zzso zzso zzso reduction of zzso insulin zzso Taken together, these data identify zzso as a novel zzso zzso and point to its role in regulating the early transport of insulin zzso zzso zzso
