zzso zzso zzso has a promising usage in the field of material science for industrial purposes because of its unique zzso zzso However, zzso administration of zzso was reported to cause zzso in experimental zzso zzso inflammation may contribute to zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso is a zzso DNA zzso formed during inflammation and may play a role in zzso zzso In this study, we examined zzso formation in zzso human lung zzso zzso cells treated with zzso zzso zzso by fluorescent zzso Both zzso with diameter of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso significantly induced zzso formation at 5 and 10 zzso ( zzso which persisted for zzso although there was no significant difference in zzso abilities of these zzso zzso significantly induced the expression of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso for 24 h ( zzso zzso also significantly increased the level of zzso a zzso product of oxidized zzso in the culture zzso at 4 and 8 h ( zzso zzso zzso formation and zzso expression were largely suppressed by zzso of zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso was mainly located in zzso structures in the zzso and its cellular zzso was reduced by zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso is zzso into cells via zzso and zzso zzso leading to inflammatory reactions including zzso expression and resulting zzso DNA damage, which may contribute to zzso
