zzso zzso of the zzso gene may contribute to individual zzso in drug response and the prognosis of zzso 

In the present study, the genetic zzso and expression of zzso were zzso in blasts cells obtained from 184 Chinese patients with de zzso acute zzso to investigate their possible association with clinical zzso 

A novel synonymous zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso 16 zzso zzso and five known zzso at zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso 13 zzso zzso and zzso 14 zzso zzso were identified with occurrence rates of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We found that patients with the zzso zzso zzso displayed longer disease free survival zzso ( zzso and overall survival zzso ( zzso than those with the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso and zzso were significantly diminished in bone zzso transplantation zzso patients with the zzso zzso relative to those with the zzso zzso 

These results suggest that these highly prevalent zzso zzso zzso are associated with poor prognosis of Chinese patients with acute zzso and zzso zzso
