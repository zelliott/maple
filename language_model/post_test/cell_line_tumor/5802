The diverse zzso patterns that distinguish zzso cells are specified by zzso regulatory complexes containing distinct combinations of factors that assemble at zzso response zzso To investigate zzso control, we examined a set of zzso zzso zzso genes bearing nearby regulatory complexes that include both zzso and the zzso zzso an zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We analyzed how zzso and zzso affect each other's occupancy and activity by utilizing zzso treatment and zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso regulation and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occupancy and activity were altered zzso by zzso zzso at specific activated and zzso primary zzso target zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso occupancy at activated zzso zzso whereas we identified two classes of zzso zzso at which zzso zzso either increased or decreased zzso zzso zzso treatment increased both zzso occupancy and zzso accessibility at zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso activity decreased after zzso zzso only at genes with zzso zzso Our study revealed multiple distinct patterns of zzso and zzso zzso Thus, monitoring as few as two factors within regulatory complexes is sufficient to reveal functionally distinct zzso providing an zzso method for gaining insights into zzso zzso
