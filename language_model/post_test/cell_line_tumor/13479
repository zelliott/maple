zzso zzso zzso is a high-grade primary brain cancer with a median survival of only zzso months in humans despite standard zzso treatment consisting of surgical zzso zzso radiation therapy and zzso zzso New therapeutic approaches are clearly needed to improve patient survival and quality of zzso The development of more effective treatment strategies would be aided by animal models of zzso that zzso human disease yet allow serial imaging to monitor tumor growth and treatment zzso In this paper, we describe our technique for the precise zzso zzso of zzso zzso cancer cells into the brains of nude mice resulting in tumor zzso that zzso key clinical features of zzso This method yields tumors that are zzso and are located in precise zzso locations while allowing in zzso zzso imaging to serially monitor zzso zzso growth and response to zzso This method is also zzso by the animals with low zzso morbidity and zzso
