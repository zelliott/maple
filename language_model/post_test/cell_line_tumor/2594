zzso zzso expression is associated with tumor zzso and poor clinical zzso however, there is a lack of zzso animal model to address whether zzso plays a zzso role in the zzso prognosis of zzso In the current study, zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso expression was analyzed with western zzso and flow zzso zzso experiment was performed to analyze the cell migration and invasion capability and/or zzso zzso formation was investigated with the zzso culture zzso in zzso The effects of zzso expression for tumor cell organ zzso and for mouse survival was analyzed with the zzso zzso mouse zzso Our data showed that zzso and zzso cells are of higher invasion potential compared with the parental zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso formation exists only in zzso cells in a zzso culture zzso In zzso zzso mouse model, widespread zzso was observed in mice zzso with zzso cells, but not in the group with parental zzso Mouse survival was dramatically decreased in zzso and zzso zzso mice than that with zzso and zzso cells, zzso In zzso our study provided the first evidence that zzso expression is associated with tumor zzso and with poor survival in an animal model with zzso zzso
