A key role of zzso zzso in zzso cell death in early stages of Alzheimer's disease zzso has been zzso Apparently, terminally differentiated zzso are precluded from zzso division, yet some zzso markers of cell cycling are present in zzso brain zzso In this paper, we investigated whether dividing human zzso cells are zzso vulnerable to zzso zzso toxicity in some specific cell cycle zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso added to the cell culture media bind to the plasma membrane and are zzso faster in the S than in the zzso and zzso cells possibly as a result of a lower content in membrane cholesterol in the zzso Earlier and sharper increases in zzso oxygen species production triggered a membrane zzso injury and a significant impairment of zzso capacity, eventually culminating with zzso zzso in S and, to a lesser extent, in zzso exposed zzso zzso cells appeared more resistant to the zzso zzso attack possibly because of their higher zzso zzso The high vulnerability of S cells to zzso toxicity extends previous data suggesting that zzso loss in zzso could result from zzso zzso of terminally differentiated zzso with arrest in the S zzso
