zzso quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso is a versatile tool for precise zzso of gene zzso zzso and zzso zzso tissue is well suited for zzso if zzso extraction is zzso and small zzso sizes are zzso However, little is known whether individual zzso may show variable sensitivity to zzso This is of great importance, if a direct comparison of different transcripts is performed within the same sample, such as for zzso zzso zzso We established a cell culture model to test for and zzso differences in performance of individual zzso zzso on zzso as compared with fresh material, using zzso zzso zzso was isolated from 7 different cell lines either directly or after preparation of a zzso cell zzso zzso from both sources was reverse transcribed and gene expression zzso using 13 different zzso zzso All zzso allowed highly zzso target zzso using both fresh and zzso zzso The 13 zzso showed an average zzso difference of zzso between fresh and zzso cells, if identical amounts of zzso were used as zzso However, the zzso shifts varied from zzso to zzso for individual zzso indicating variable resistance to zzso These zzso shift differences were statistically highly significant in zzso zzso of all possible combinations of zzso Because the zzso shift remained constant for each zzso they could be used for calculation of correction factors which rendered zzso expression data highly comparable to those obtained from fresh material, and as a consequence among each zzso Thus, a standardized assessment of zzso zzso efficiencies in zzso allows for precise zzso comparison of zzso species, such as zzso zzso with different zzso functions, in archival zzso
