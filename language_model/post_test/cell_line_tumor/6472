zzso zzso zzso play an important role in cancer cell growth and zzso however, the potential roles of zzso in zzso remain largely zzso By applying a zzso zzso platform and zzso zzso zzso analysis, we found that several zzso have altered expression levels in zzso cell lines and tumor zzso when compared with normal human zzso Three zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly decreased in zzso cell lines, whereas zzso and zzso were increased in zzso cell lines in comparison with zzso zzso of precursor zzso into zzso cell lines significantly decreased cell growth and migration, thus indicating that the zzso effect is associated with an increase in the zzso and a decrease of the zzso cell zzso In addition, we observed decreased zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso This study provides new insights for zzso in zzso and suggests that zzso may play a functional role in zzso cell growth and zzso zzso zzso function may provide therapeutic benefits in zzso
