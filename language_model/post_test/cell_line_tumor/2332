To evaluate zzso as an zzso target for eliminating zzso zzso cancer initiating cells zzso of high-grade zzso with particular focus on the potential of genetically engineered zzso primary human zzso zzso zzso zzso to target this zzso resistant zzso zzso 

A panel of zzso zzso tumor sphere zzso and zzso zzso lines were expanded from patient zzso zzso These zzso lines were evaluated for expression of zzso and for zzso to zzso zzso killing in zzso and in zzso 

We observed that although zzso zzso expression varies between patients, for zzso cases this zzso was detected on both zzso and more differentiated tumor cell zzso zzso zzso were capable of efficient recognition and killing of both zzso zzso and zzso differentiated cells in zzso as well as eliminating zzso activity in an zzso mouse tumor zzso Furthermore, zzso administration of zzso zzso displayed robust zzso activity against established zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors in zzso 

Within zzso expressing high-grade zzso this zzso is expressed by zzso and differentiated tumor zzso rendering both zzso by zzso zzso Thus, our results support the potential zzso of zzso zzso approaches for zzso zzso resistant zzso zzso
