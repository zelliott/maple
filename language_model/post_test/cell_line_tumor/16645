Human zzso such as human zzso 5 zzso block infection of zzso zzso including human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Through zzso analysis of zzso we have identified zzso zzso that contribute to zzso activity against zzso and zzso Of two zzso zzso paired on one face of zzso zzso is critical for both zzso while zzso is only important for zzso Two zzso zzso on the opposite face of the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso are less important for zzso In addition, zzso at zzso 29 is a major zzso of zzso activity, and a chemical modification that prevents zzso zzso was strongly zzso Although zzso binds to the zzso of zzso the molecular basis for this interaction is zzso zzso binding by zzso is not purely zzso as substitution of zzso for zzso and zzso was zzso Analysis of zzso zzso that retained varying levels of potency demonstrated that zzso activity is directly correlated with zzso binding to the virus, confirming that the viral zzso rather than the cell is the relevant zzso Also, zzso zzso induced by zzso binding is not sufficient for zzso Rather, these studies confirm that the major mechanism of zzso zzso of zzso depends upon specific binding to the viral zzso through interactions zzso in part by critical zzso zzso zzso at zzso 29, and zzso of zzso which increases initial binding of virus to the cell but prevents subsequent viral zzso and zzso delivery to the zzso
