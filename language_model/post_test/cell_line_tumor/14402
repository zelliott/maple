zzso is a state of low oxygen availability that limits tumor zzso The mechanism of protein synthesis zzso by zzso and its zzso by transformation are not well zzso zzso breast zzso cells are shown to zzso protein synthesis by zzso of the zzso zzso which suppresses zzso translation through a novel mechanism zzso in transformed zzso disruption of zzso degradation of zzso zzso factor 2 zzso zzso and zzso of the regulatory protein zzso In transformed breast zzso cells under zzso the zzso and zzso zzso are zzso activated and the zzso negative regulator zzso sclerosis complex 2 zzso protein fails to zzso Gene zzso of zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso of protein synthesis in immortalized breast zzso zzso Breast cancer cells therefore acquire resistance to zzso by zzso zzso signaling pathways from zzso function, eliminating zzso of protein synthesis zzso by zzso and zzso
