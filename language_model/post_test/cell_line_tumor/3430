zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso activity is the major characteristic of zzso positive zzso In this study, we developed a method to detect the zzso proteins by flow zzso and we asked whether zzso was affected by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso were treated or not with zzso zzso fixed and zzso by zzso followed by zzso then stained with zzso zzso zzso zzso and analyzed by flow zzso 

zzso zzso parameters were performed with zzso zzso using zzso and zzso lines that displayed high levels of zzso zzso as compared to the control line, zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso in a zzso manner, but not modified by other zzso demonstrating that the zzso detected is specific to zzso zzso The zzso of zzso cell lines such as the zzso zzso cell line or resistant zzso patient cells, showed that zzso was not affected by zzso zzso In one zzso patient, our technique permitted us to detect a small zzso population resistant to zzso that appeared zzso and amplified at the time of zzso 

We have developed a flow zzso technique presenting several advantages such as zzso and sensitivity, which requires fewer cells than the Western zzso
