To investigate small zzso modifier zzso zzso 1 zzso expression in human prostate cancer zzso cells and its zzso value for zzso patients after radical zzso zzso 

zzso expression in zzso cells was detected by quantitative zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and Western zzso By using zzso coupled with the tissue zzso zzso technique, we examined zzso protein expression in 115 specimens of zzso 19 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 24 normal prostate zzso Moreover, correlations between zzso protein zzso zzso features, and prognosis were statistically zzso 

Three zzso cells, zzso zzso and zzso had zzso of zzso zzso and zzso while the zzso immortalized prostate cell zzso had relatively weak zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso cell line, showed higher zzso and zzso level of zzso than the zzso zzso protein expression correlated with some zzso zzso such as zzso stage, zzso score, and zzso recurrence zzso Positive zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and normal prostate tissue samples were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso patients undergoing zzso with positive zzso expression were significantly associated with poor zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso protein expression was an independent zzso factor for zzso survival after zzso 

This study confirmed the zzso of zzso zzso and protein level in zzso zzso We suggested that zzso expression might contribute to the zzso progression of zzso zzso zzso presented as a potential zzso factor for zzso after zzso
