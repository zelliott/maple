zzso and other zzso zzso are widely used to treat a broad spectrum of zzso However, their application is limited by both intrinsic and acquired zzso Most zzso that result from DNA damage are the consequence of zzso zzso DNA zzso which could be responsible for the acquired resistance against zzso zzso Recent studies have shown that the suppression of crucial gene products zzso zzso zzso involved in the zzso zzso DNA synthesis zzso can sensitize zzso resistant tumors to chemotherapy and reduce the frequency of acquired drug resistance of relapsed zzso In this context, combining conventional zzso chemotherapy with zzso zzso represents a promising strategy for treating patients with zzso To this end, we developed a versatile zzso zzso platform to deliver a zzso zzso and zzso zzso simultaneously to the same tumor zzso zzso are formulated through zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated the potency of the zzso zzso to knock down target genes efficiently both in zzso and in zzso The therapeutic efficacy of zzso containing both zzso zzso and zzso zzso was further investigated in zzso and in zzso zzso real-time zzso results showed that the zzso exhibited a significant and sustained suppression of both genes in tumors for up to 3 d after a single zzso zzso these zzso revealed a synergistic effect on tumor zzso in a human zzso zzso Carcinoma of the zzso zzso mouse model that was zzso more effective than platinum zzso
