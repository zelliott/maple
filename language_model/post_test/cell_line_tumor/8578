Platinum complexes are widely used zzso zzso New generations of metal zzso offer the prospect of combating platinum resistance and expanding the range of zzso zzso Such new complexes might be effective if they form distinctly different zzso on zzso In this Forum zzso we discuss the possibility that targeting the zzso balance in cancer cells may also be a highly effective strategy, especially because it is a zzso approach and offers selectivity over normal zzso Metal complexes can interfere in cellular zzso chemistry in several ways: directly through metal or zzso zzso centers or indirectly by binding to zzso involved in cellular zzso zzso We illustrate that a surprisingly large number of active metal zzso agents have a potential zzso arm to their mechanism of zzso For such complexes, the possibility arises of using combination therapy together with zzso zzso to increase the zzso zzso attractive for lowering the doses of metal complexes that need to be zzso We illustrate that zzso zzso and zzso zzso complexes and zzso zzso complexes of the type zzso can achieve zzso potency toward cancer cells in combination with the zzso zzso zzso zzso Our discussion highlights the importance of determining not only the distribution of metal zzso complexes in cells but also their zzso the chemical form of the metal complex, including the zzso state of the metal, the fate of the zzso and dynamic processes such as zzso This will be aided in the future by zzso and zzso analyses but needs to be supplemented by new zzso methods that have the sensitivity and spatial and zzso resolution to reveal such zzso To achieve this, major new funding programs are needed that support global research on the design of novel zzso drugs with new mechanisms of action, tailored to patient zzso
