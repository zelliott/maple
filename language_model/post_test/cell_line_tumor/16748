Exposure of cells to zzso zzso electric fields zzso causes a rapid increase in zzso zzso The zzso responsible for this calcium burst remains unknown, but is hypothesized to be from direct influx through zzso the zzso of specific zzso channels, or direct disruption of zzso It is zzso however, that several mechanisms are zzso thereby resulting in a complex chain of events that are difficult to separate by slow imaging zzso In this letter, we describe a novel high-speed imaging system capable of determining the spatial location of calcium bursts within a single cell following zzso zzso zzso data in zzso zzso cells are zzso demonstrating the ability of this system to track the location of calcium bursts in zzso within milliseconds of zzso These data reveal that calcium zzso enter the cell from the plasma membrane regions closest to the zzso zzso and that zzso calcium release occurs in the absence of zzso zzso We believe that this novel technique will allow us to temporally and zzso separate various zzso effects, leading to powerful insights into the zzso of interaction between electric fields and cellular zzso
