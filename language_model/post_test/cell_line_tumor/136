zzso treatment following breast cancer, zzso zzso and mastectomy, may not efficiently remove all zzso zzso As such, when zzso stem cells zzso are incorporated into the breast reconstruction process, it is likely that those zzso will encounter remnant zzso cells after transplantation into the zzso zzso The potential interaction between breast cancer cells and zzso remains zzso We hypothesized that zzso interactions might occur between cells and various zzso growth factors and other zzso molecules in the local zzso zzso media zzso from two mouse zzso cancer cell lines zzso and zzso and one mouse zzso zzso cell line zzso were studied in the experimental zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso were differentiated with an zzso hormonal zzso zzso media from the three cell types did not have an zzso effect on D1 cell zzso however, zzso zzso and Oil red O zzso analysis results showed that zzso significantly inhibited D1 zzso differentiation and reduced zzso zzso zzso in the zzso D1 zzso zzso analysis of the zzso media revealed that a higher presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was present in the zzso as compared to the levels found in zzso and zzso which were below the detection zzso Additionally, the zzso medium of differentiated D1 cells on day 12 had a negative effect on zzso and zzso cell viability but no effect on zzso cell zzso The results suggest that mouse breast cancer cells zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso the level of zzso specific to the zzso zzso
