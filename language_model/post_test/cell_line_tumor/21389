zzso zzso fatty liver disease is one of the most common forms of chronic liver diseases and is associated with zzso states such as diabetes and zzso Recent work has revealed potential implications of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and insulin zzso In this study, we examined the effect of zzso on zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso a pivotal zzso factor controlling zzso in zzso Treatment with zzso the zzso zzso or zzso of zzso markedly reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso induced the expression of zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso at both the zzso and the protein zzso zzso inhibited the zzso processing of zzso into the mature active form, thereby suppressing the expression of the zzso genes fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso Our results revealed a direct binding of zzso to a zzso zzso zzso responsive element motif upstream of the zzso initiation site of human zzso The disruption of this site diminished the induction of zzso which suggested that zzso is a direct zzso target gene in zzso zzso of zzso zzso attenuated the zzso effect of zzso on zzso and its target zzso indicating zzso inhibited zzso zzso via induction of zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso by intravenous infection with the zzso zzso induced the expression of zzso suppressed zzso zzso and, consequently, ameliorated zzso zzso in obese zzso zzso 

Our study reveals a novel mechanism by which zzso regulates zzso suggesting potential therapeutic applications of zzso zzso in obesity and type 2 diabetes, as well as related zzso liver zzso
