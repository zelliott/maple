zzso genes are well known as master control genes in embryonic zzso We hypothesized that zzso genes give cells spatial information to maintain zzso or zzso in adult body and that the zzso expression of zzso genes results in tumor zzso We established a comprehensive analysis system to zzso expression of 39 human zzso genes based on the real-time reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of 39 zzso genes of 20 normal adult zzso by this system revealed that zzso zzso genes were expressed in zzso in the zzso parts of the body, and that the more zzso regions the more numbers of zzso genes were zzso It was also found that the expression patterns of zzso genes were more similar in the adjacent genes on the same cluster rather than in those belonging to the same zzso Compared with normal zzso zzso zzso cancer cell lines showed the altered expression of some zzso zzso especially zzso zzso family zzso Our results showed that zzso genes were zzso expressed in adult body and that the zzso expressions of zzso family genes were implicated in zzso tumor zzso
