zzso 17 zzso converting zzso zzso is a potential target for cancer therapy, but the small zzso zzso reported to date are not specific to this zzso family zzso This zzso zzso is responsible for zzso shedding of zzso significant zzso including zzso and zzso zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso zzso and zzso efficacy of the first specific zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso clone zzso We used zzso zzso of the human zzso cancer cell line zzso in zzso nude mice, chosen because it was previously reported that growth of these zzso is inhibited by zzso of zzso In zzso 200 zzso zzso inhibited shedding of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso In zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso showed zzso properties suitable for efficacy studies, with a single zzso dose of 10 zzso zzso sufficient to maintain zzso plasma and zzso fluid zzso above 100 zzso for more than 7 zzso The plasma half life was zzso zzso Next, an efficacy study was performed, dosing zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso at 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso burden by zzso zzso zzso showed a significant reduction in zzso growth zzso zzso of vehicle zzso Surprisingly, zzso did not reduce the concentration of circulating human zzso suggesting that another zzso may compensate for zzso of zzso in zzso (but not in zzso However, zzso did show clear zzso effects in the mice, with significant zzso of shedding from zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for all zzso Thus, zzso has zzso activity in zzso zzso shedding of zzso zzso and has potential for use in zzso zzso zzso
