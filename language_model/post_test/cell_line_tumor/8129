zzso of: zzso D, zzso C, zzso zzso et zzso zzso as novel potent zzso of zzso zzso zzso viral zzso zzso B1 zzso zzso zzso zzso 52, zzso zzso There are currently no therapies known to alter the clinical course of zzso zzso zzso profiling studies have shown that the majority of zzso harbor zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso work has validated zzso zzso as a therapeutic target in melanoma, and a number of zzso zzso zzso are now undergoing clinical zzso The only zzso inhibitor to be investigated extensively in clinical trials of melanoma at this time is zzso compound with very limited zzso zzso As zzso has poor cellular activity against the zzso zzso zzso the conclusion that many researchers have arrived at is that zzso did not provide a test of the therapeutic value of zzso zzso Thus, more highly selective zzso zzso have been zzso The current paper describes the identification of a new class of zzso zzso that contain zzso as the zzso zzso domain and a rigid zzso zzso Building upon this novel scaffold, the authors derived a series of compounds with low zzso potency against zzso zzso in isolated zzso zzso and low zzso potency in cellular zzso These new chemical leads represent a significant step forward in the search for new, potent zzso zzso zzso
