The drug zzso function of zzso zzso zzso by zzso can be influenced by genetic zzso including two synonymous changes in the coding region of zzso Here we report that the zzso of zzso and its drug zzso activity can be altered by synonymous zzso in stable zzso zzso expressing zzso Several cell lines with similar zzso DNA copy number were developed and termed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso common zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso that carries a different zzso zzso in position zzso These cell lines express similar levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in each case is localized on the zzso surface of polarized zzso However, the zzso and its zzso zzso fold differently from the zzso as determined by zzso zzso shift zzso and limited zzso zzso Surface zzso experiments suggest that the zzso zzso have longer recycling zzso Drug transport zzso show that zzso and zzso zzso respond differently to zzso zzso that block zzso of zzso 123 or zzso In addition, zzso zzso show that the zzso cells are more resistant to zzso than the zzso cells after being treated with a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso however, does not affect the host cell's zzso growth rate, or zzso zzso Also, zzso activity zzso indicate that neither zzso nor zzso zzso activities are affected in the zzso zzso Taken together, our findings indicate that zzso zzso significantly change zzso function, which would be expected to affect zzso drug disposition and zzso
