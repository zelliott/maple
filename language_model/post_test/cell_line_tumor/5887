The zzso and body distribution of zzso zzso zzso composed of chemically zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso surrounded by zzso zzso zzso chains were investigated to evaluate their feasibility as drug zzso for systemic zzso zzso zzso with different zzso zzso zzso 2, and zzso were prepared to evaluate their zzso by in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso acute toxicity zzso The toxic effect of the zzso zzso derived from zzso gel zzso was significantly reduced when the zzso density was increased, and those with a zzso density of zzso showed a remarkably high median lethal dose zzso value zzso the abundance of zzso groups in the zzso One hour after intravenous injection the zzso zzso were found to have been eliminated from the systemic zzso and less than zzso of the injected dose zzso remained in the zzso To improve the blood circulation time by increasing the surface zzso density of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso (via the zzso reaction between zzso zzso of the zzso gel core and zzso short zzso was carried zzso A zzso study of these zzso zzso revealed that the blood circulation time of the zzso was definitely prolonged as the zzso content was zzso zzso the precise design of zzso zzso with increased zzso zzso in their zzso gel zzso and increased surface zzso zzso seems promising for systemic zzso
