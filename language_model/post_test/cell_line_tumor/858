NO produced in tumors can either positively or zzso regulate zzso To examine this zzso effects of NO concentration and duration on the zzso regulation of several key proteins were examined in human breast zzso cells under zzso zzso We found that different concentration thresholds of NO appear to elicit a discrete set of signal zzso zzso At low zzso zzso of NO zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced via a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso was associated with an intermediate amount of NO zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso 15 zzso occurred at considerably higher levels zzso zzso zzso zzso was transient during NO zzso zzso stabilization paralleled the presence of zzso whereas zzso zzso 15 zzso was detected zzso and persisted after, NO zzso The zzso effects of synthetic NO donors were zzso by activated zzso zzso with zzso cells at varying zzso zzso and zzso zzso was similar in breast cancer cell lines either zzso zzso or zzso zzso in zzso The stabilization of zzso by NO was not observed with increased zzso cell density, demonstrating the zzso between NO and zzso zzso The findings show that concentration and duration of NO exposure are critical zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso
