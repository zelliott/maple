zzso zzso influence the differentiation of neural zzso cells such as those zzso zzso tumors like zzso as well as zzso and zzso In order to obtain further information on the effects of zzso on cells evolving from the neural zzso we have used the human zzso cell line zzso to zzso 1) the presence and the binding characteristics of zzso receptors in these cells, 2) the effect of zzso zzso on the migration of zzso cells, and 3) the effect of zzso on the organization of the zzso of zzso zzso We show that: 1) receptors that bind zzso with high affinity and high capacity zzso of zzso zzso zzso of 47 zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso are present in zzso preparations of zzso cells, and 2) treatment with zzso (in the range of 10 zzso to 1 zzso has an zzso effect (from zzso to 74 and zzso zzso on the zzso of zzso cells zzso by fetal bovine zzso This zzso is completely reversed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso and 3) as demonstrated by fluorescent zzso zzso the effect of zzso zzso zzso on zzso cell migration is accompanied by modifications of the zzso organization that appear with stress zzso These modifications did not take place in the presence of 1 zzso zzso The present data demonstrate for the first time that zzso affects the migration of zzso cells as well as their zzso organization by interacting with specific zzso These findings provide new insights on the zzso of action of zzso on cells originating in the neural zzso
