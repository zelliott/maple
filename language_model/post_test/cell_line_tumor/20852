DNA zzso breaks zzso can be processed by the zzso zzso complex, which is essential to promote zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms linking zzso activity to zzso are not fully zzso Here, using zzso zzso egg extract we show that zzso processing of zzso leads to the zzso of short zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso The zzso complex isolated from the extract containing zzso is bound to zzso zzso and stimulates zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso results in rapid extinction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be isolated from human cells damaged with zzso radiation and injection of small synthetic zzso zzso into undamaged cells also zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso generation of zzso zzso which constitute a unique signal of ongoing zzso repair not encountered in normal DNA zzso stimulates zzso zzso
