zzso bone diseases are a prominent feature of multiple myeloma zzso resulting from zzso zzso bone zzso that is zzso from zzso bone zzso zzso stimulates zzso which is largely dependent on an increase in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and a decrease in zzso zzso within the bone zzso zzso Recently, zzso zzso factor zzso was identified as a zzso factor that zzso with increased zzso levels and contributes to zzso bone destruction in myeloma zzso Because zzso zzso zzso B zzso the zzso of zzso is abundantly expressed in zzso we sought to evaluate the role of zzso in zzso interactions and the effect of this zzso on the zzso ratio and zzso zzso systems constructed with zzso zzso revealed that, in zzso zzso zzso increased zzso and decreased zzso production in zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso These effects were completely abolished by a specific small interfering zzso for zzso zzso regulates zzso expression in zzso through the zzso zzso To investigate the biological effects of zzso on myeloma in zzso a zzso mice model was constructed using zzso short hairpin zzso zzso zzso In this system, stable zzso of zzso in zzso cells significantly restored the zzso zzso inhibited zzso bone destruction and reduced zzso and tumor zzso Our studies provide further support for the potential zzso effects of zzso which mediates zzso interactions to disrupt the balance of zzso zzso ultimately increasing zzso in zzso
