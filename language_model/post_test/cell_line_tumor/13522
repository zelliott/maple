zzso mediates sustained tumor cell zzso and survival in the pulmonary zzso thereby zzso the zzso dissemination of tumor zzso zzso is the major functional zzso zzso on colon zzso zzso Growth factors, such as zzso growth factor zzso induce zzso protein zzso which zzso zzso binding zzso In view of the roles of zzso zzso and zzso in cancer zzso we aimed to delineate the effect of zzso on zzso zzso By zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso colon zzso cells, which express primarily zzso we demonstrate that zzso enhances the zzso of zzso beads to immobilized zzso zzso zzso studies coupled with zzso zzso zzso and zzso reveal that zzso zzso the binding of zzso to zzso by significantly attenuating the extent of zzso zzso primarily on zzso and zzso zzso zzso Surface zzso resonance zzso confirm that zzso enhances the affinity of zzso binding by markedly reducing its zzso rate while modestly increasing the association zzso zzso mildly reduces the affinity of zzso binding without affecting zzso zzso The latter is attributed to the fact that zzso binds to zzso via zzso zzso zzso independent of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso moderately reduces the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso these data offer a novel perspective into the mechanism by which zzso regulates zzso binding of zzso colon zzso cells to zzso
