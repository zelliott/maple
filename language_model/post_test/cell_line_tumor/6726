The vascular development of zzso grown human zzso cell zzso zzso was examined using a silicon based casting technique in nude zzso Images taken of these vascular casts showed zzso tumors to be highly zzso and zzso The spread of the tumor within the zzso of the kidney revealed that zzso recruits the zzso own zzso destroying the functional zzso in the zzso The loss of these zzso was further highlighted by the presence of enlarged zzso resulting from the development of super zzso zzso size and density zzso were then made in this zzso This was done using both computer-based and manual measurement zzso In the vessel size studies the computer-based method tended to overestimate the number of larger diameter vessels whereas the vessels density assessment showed good agreement between the two zzso Nevertheless, both methods showed that zzso tumors possessed a higher proportion of larger diameter vessels and a lower vessel density than normal kidney zzso In zzso silicon based vascular casting proved to be a simple and effective tool for the study of tumor zzso In particular this technique could readily be used to examine the invasion of tumor into normal zzso The computer-based technique for evaluating vessel number and vascular density was found to have merit in both normal and tumor zzso particularly in the vascular density zzso However, in both settings this technique did tend to overestimate the number of larger diameter zzso
