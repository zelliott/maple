An increased carbon flux and exploitation of zzso pathways for the rapid generation of zzso precursors is a common zzso observed in breast zzso To support this zzso zzso cancer cells zzso regulate the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, activity of several zzso involved in zzso metabolism requires an adequate supply of zzso In particular, vitamin B1 zzso is zzso as an essential zzso for zzso zzso that intersect at critical junctions within the zzso zzso zzso availability of zzso is facilitated by the activity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the objective of this study was to establish if the cellular zzso regulating zzso zzso differ between breast cancer and normal breast zzso zzso zzso zzso of breast cancer and normal breast zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be significantly zzso Similarly, zzso was also observed in breast cancer cell lines compared to human zzso zzso zzso zzso transport zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso established a significantly greater extent of zzso transport and free zzso levels in breast cancer cell lines compared to human zzso zzso zzso Overall, these findings demonstrate an zzso response by breast cancer cells to increase cellular availability of zzso
