Side population zzso cells are isolated from various zzso and cell lines based on the exclusion of zzso dye zzso zzso and exhibit potent stem cell zzso There have been few previous reports of SP cells in head and neck cancer cell zzso Thus, we isolated SP cells from oral zzso cell zzso cell line, zzso zzso contained zzso SP zzso zzso SP cells showed zzso capacity, generating both SP and zzso zzso Next, we analyzed zzso expressed genes between zzso SP and zzso cells using zzso zzso and quantitative real-time zzso SP cells expressed high levels of zzso cassette zzso with related zzso resistance zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso were significantly zzso in zzso SP zzso In addition, the expression of zzso zzso and zzso which are associated with zzso were also significantly increased in the SP zzso zzso to zzso agents, including zzso and zzso were compared between zzso SP and zzso cells using flow zzso and zzso salt zzso plate zzso zzso SP cells survived significantly longer and SP ratio remarkably increased after zzso agent treatment compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso validated these results, and suggested an zzso potential for zzso SP zzso zzso SP cells survived with various agents which were not only probably due to high level expression of ABC zzso but also zzso zzso These observations indicated that zzso SP cells were zzso zzso and should be the main target for effective cancer zzso
