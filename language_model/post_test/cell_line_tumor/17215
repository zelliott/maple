zzso zzso zzso formerly zzso is an effective therapy for all stages of chronic zzso leukemia zzso While responses in zzso zzso are generally zzso resistance develops in many patients with advanced zzso We evaluated novel zzso agents for their potential to overcome resistance in various zzso cell zzso Using cell proliferation zzso we investigated whether different mechanisms of resistance to zzso would alter the efficacy of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso alone and in combination with zzso Our results indicate that resistance to zzso induced by zzso zzso or by engineered expression of clinically relevant zzso zzso does not induce zzso to zzso or zzso Combined treatment with these agents and zzso is beneficial in cell lines that have residual sensitivity to zzso zzso with synergistic growth zzso achieved only at doses of zzso that overcome zzso In some zzso cell lines, combination treatments that use low doses of zzso lead to zzso zzso studies suggest that this can be explained in part by the reduced zzso activity of zzso in resistant cell zzso These data underline the importance of resistance testing and provide a rational approach for zzso administration of zzso when combined with other zzso
