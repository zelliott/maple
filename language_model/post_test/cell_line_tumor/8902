zzso zzso is an essential trace element due to its participation in many zzso zzso However, zzso to this metal leads to a neurological disorder known as zzso whose clinical manifestations and molecular mechanisms resemble Parkinson's zzso Several lines of evidence zzso zzso as an early target of zzso zzso being the zzso the most affected zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the possible zzso dynamics zzso in zzso human zzso zzso we employed zzso cells which express the zzso markers zzso and zzso We demonstrated that zzso triggers the zzso zzso zzso revealed by increased zzso ratio, by the loss of zzso membrane potential and by zzso zzso This zzso program may be in turn responsible of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, we determined that zzso zzso deregulation in zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso expression levels in parallel with the disruption of the zzso network toward to an exacerbated zzso Since zzso dynamics is altered in several neurodegenerative diseases, these proteins could become future targets to be considered in zzso zzso
