Our previous studies have shown that zzso transition zzso may be involved in the zzso mimicry zzso formation in zzso zzso Here, we zzso that zinc finger zzso binding zzso 1 zzso promotes zzso formation in zzso zzso zzso by inducing zzso We identified zzso in 39 zzso out of zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso was associated with aggressive biological behavior and was an zzso zzso zzso By zzso analysis, we found that the zzso zzso samples showed increased zzso expression compared with the zzso samples and the zzso expression occurred zzso with features of zzso In zzso zzso of zzso in poorly differentiated zzso zzso cells destroyed the zzso structures in the 3-D culture, a property associated with zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in restoration of zzso zzso and significantly inhibited the ability to migrate and zzso In addition, zzso zzso decreased the expression of vascular zzso zzso and zzso which are characteristics of zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso can promote zzso formation by inducing zzso in zzso and might represent an important target in zzso
