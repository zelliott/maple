zzso cell zzso is zzso regulated by the expression of target cell zzso class I zzso We show that this relationship is zzso due to an zzso cell zzso zzso Ewing's zzso family tumor cell zzso which were highly susceptible to zzso cells in zzso developed a highly resistant zzso when cultured as three-dimensional zzso tumor zzso zzso This suggested that tumor architecture is likely to influence the zzso to zzso cells in zzso Resistance of the zzso tumor zzso was associated with the increased expression of zzso class I molecules and greatly reduced zzso cell zzso zzso that a threshold of zzso cell zzso had been zzso zzso zzso class I expression on Ewing's zzso family tumor zzso did not alter their zzso to zzso cells, whereas increased expression of zzso class I rendered them resistant and allowed the threshold point to be zzso This zzso as defined by zzso class I zzso was zzso of the number of zzso target cells within a zzso A threshold permits modest changes in the target cell surface zzso to profoundly alter the zzso to zzso zzso Whereas this allows for the efficient detection of target cells, it also provides a route for pathogens and tumors to evade zzso cell zzso
