The zzso acid zzso in breast zzso zzso cells has been ascribed to an insufficient expression of either the zzso involved in its zzso or the cellular zzso binding protein zzso or zzso In an attempt to define the mechanisms underpinning zzso acid zzso in these cell model systems, we have investigated the potential regulatory effect of zzso zzso on one key player in zzso acid zzso the zzso zzso zzso This zzso is consistently expressed and very active in zzso human zzso zzso cells zzso as opposed to zzso zzso and zzso zzso In these latter two cell lines, as opposed to zzso cells, we observe a residual ability of zzso to produce zzso acid from zzso and the inability to use retinol, as a consequence of a deficit in zzso In addition, zzso treatment of zzso and zzso cells decreases protein expression and activity of the zzso with no modification of the zzso transcript levels, eventually leading to deteriorate further zzso acid zzso
