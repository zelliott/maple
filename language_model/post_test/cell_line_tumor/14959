zzso an aurora B zzso zzso cell division, introduces zzso and consequently causes zzso In the present study, we evaluated the effect of the combination of zzso and zzso zzso a key agent for leukemia chemotherapy, on zzso cells in zzso Human leukemia zzso cells and zzso cells, a zzso zzso zzso were zzso The 50% growth zzso zzso of an active zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were 51 zzso and 300 zzso for zzso cells and 70 zzso and zzso zzso for zzso cells, zzso zzso induced zzso with a subsequent induction of zzso phase zzso indicating the zzso specific zzso zzso treated with the zzso specific zzso accumulated in S phase and subsequently died through zzso When zzso cells were treated with zzso and zzso in zzso a zzso zzso was zzso This enhancement was obtained when the cells were treated with zzso prior to zzso zzso zzso or with both zzso zzso zzso but not with zzso prior to zzso zzso zzso The combination effects were similarly obtained in zzso cells with zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and another zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso inhibited aurora B zzso and zzso zzso zzso in all the cell zzso zzso did not inhibit DNA zzso allowing zzso incorporation into DNA for its zzso Thus, zzso and zzso provided a zzso zzso in zzso cells in zzso
