zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso mediates various signaling pathways and zzso several cellular zzso In the present study, we have explored the functional role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso using zzso cell line as a zzso We first demonstrated that zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso the extent of zzso cell zzso The observed zzso zzso cell zzso is associated with the zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso mobility shift zzso and reporter gene zzso By contrast, a zzso domain deletion zzso zzso functioning as a zzso zzso ameliorates zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso To explore whether the activated zzso alone is sufficient for inducing zzso a zzso activated zzso zzso a zzso fusion protein of zzso zzso zzso and zzso domain of zzso zzso was introduced into zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso zzso the zzso could stimulate zzso activity and zzso cell zzso independent of zzso zzso Taken together, our findings indicate that zzso is a downstream signaling zzso of zzso zzso and suggest that zzso zzso is essential for zzso the zzso zzso zzso
