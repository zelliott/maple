Following exposure to radiation and zzso agents, the zzso growth factor zzso zzso can zzso the repair of DNA zzso breaks zzso by forming protein complexes that include the zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso This is one of the key mechanism by which tumors become resistant to zzso zzso Our previous studies have shown that zzso growth factor binding zzso zzso is a zzso for zzso and can zzso zzso We therefore questioned whether zzso might interact with the zzso complex that regulates the DNA damage zzso The aim of this study was to delineate the role of zzso in the response of breast cancer cells to zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso which express zzso zzso nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso was enhanced by treatment with zzso drugs zzso or zzso and reduced by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso association among zzso zzso and zzso following the exposure to zzso drugs was supported by both zzso analysis and direct zzso by proximity zzso zzso The zzso of zzso at zzso DNA repair as measured by a zzso zzso zzso and the increase in zzso and zzso interaction induced by zzso agents, were all decreased by zzso zzso suggesting that zzso has an obligatory role in the DNA repair response to zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso to the nucleus of breast cancer cells and its formation of a complex with zzso and zzso in response to DNA damage shows its potential involvement in the regulation of DNA zzso This suggests the possibility of a therapeutic approach for zzso breast cancer to zzso or zzso by targeting the DNA repair function of zzso
