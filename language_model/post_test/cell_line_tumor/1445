Nine known compounds were zzso isolated from the zzso extract of zzso zzso stem by zzso activity guidance, and the chemical structures were identified by using zzso and zzso zzso zzso evaluation against four cancer cell lines was performed on all these compounds, which showed that zzso could be significantly inhibited by partial compounds with zzso values at the range from 40 to 60 zzso
