Success of human gene therapy depends upon the development of delivery vehicles or zzso which can selectively deliver therapeutic genes to target cells with efficiency and zzso Previous studies have shown an efficient, systemic zzso expression in many cell lines (in zzso by using an zzso zzso zzso based on the composition of zzso envelopes zzso viral envelopes, zzso The zzso and their complexes with zzso zzso were characterized according to zzso potential zzso and transmission electron zzso zzso We successfully demonstrated that zzso zzso dispersed in zzso zzso growth zzso efficiently delivered zzso DNA to zzso zzso zzso cell line) zzso We assessed the utility of zzso zzso as a zzso delivery system for the treatment of liver zzso We found that small zzso zzso zzso containing 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso are efficiently targeted to the liver via the zzso zzso zzso
