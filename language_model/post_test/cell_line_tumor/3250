zzso 3 is the major zzso in patients with zzso zzso Earlier studies have shown that circulating zzso from patients with zzso zzso show elevated zzso 3 surface expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso patients also have increased levels of zzso 3 in zzso A single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the promoter region has been associated with zzso This zzso introduces a new potential zzso zzso factor binding site that may be responsible for the observed zzso expression of zzso zzso To investigate this a zzso base pair long region of the promoter was cloned from zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso as well as a control zzso zzso exchange, were introduced by zzso chain reaction zzso and cloned into a zzso reporter zzso zzso expression levels of zzso 3 zzso and promoter activity of the cloned zzso were measured in three zzso cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso and in zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrate a good correlation between the zzso zzso 3 zzso expression and the promoter activity, as judged by zzso zzso However, no significant differences in activity between the zzso zzso and the zzso control zzso were zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso zzso is not responsible for the increased expression levels seen in zzso cells from patients with zzso zzso
