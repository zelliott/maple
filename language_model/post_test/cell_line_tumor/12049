An acute zzso zzso zzso cell line was cloned and established from the zzso cells of zzso zzso zzso Acute myeloma zzso syndrome would be induced in normal zzso mice after intravenous injection of zzso cells, and the death of mouse happened within about two zzso In general, zzso cells transplanted into the mice would zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso An interesting observation in our study was that zzso cells were present not only in the zzso zzso and liver but also in the zzso and zzso It was beyond our expectation that the zzso cells could go through the zzso barrier in most zzso On the basis of the zzso we expect that zzso cells could be used as a very useful model to zzso the mechanism of zzso the zzso barrier for certain type of zzso
