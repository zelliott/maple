The zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso is a zzso high-resolution approach to detect DNA zzso in whole zzso or zzso zzso base followed by a zzso zzso zzso The method zzso zzso zzso to zzso DNA that contains highly zzso zzso zzso Enriched zzso DNA can be interrogated using DNA zzso or by massive parallel sequencing zzso This combined approach allows researchers to rapidly identify zzso regions in a zzso manner, and compare DNA zzso patterns between two samples with zzso different DNA zzso zzso zzso has been applied successfully for analyses of zzso DNA in the different targets including animal and plant zzso Here we present a zzso protocol that is routinely used in our laboratory, illustrated with specific examples from zzso analysis of breast cancer cell zzso Potential technical pitfalls and solutions are also provided to serve as zzso zzso
