zzso zzso uses the zzso type zzso zzso system zzso to deliver zzso protein zzso to the host cell, promoting replication zzso zzso The zzso state of the zzso zzso within the bacterial cell is unknown, so we sought to determine if folded zzso could be zzso via this zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso small proteins known to fold zzso resulted in proteins with low zzso zzso The folded zzso did not cause increased zzso of the zzso and did not impede interaction with the zzso protein complex zzso which is thought to form a soluble complex that promotes zzso The zzso zzso was alleviated with a zzso zzso harboring zzso known to destabilize its structure, indicating that unfolded proteins are preferred zzso zzso analysis of zzso following movement during the first 30 zzso after bacterial contact with host cells, revealed that the folded zzso caused a kinetic zzso in zzso zzso zzso of an zzso fused to a folded zzso zzso with the zzso of other zzso consistent with it causing a zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, the folded protein zzso also zzso with zzso growth, consistent with inefficient or impaired zzso of proteins critical for zzso zzso zzso zzso These studies indicate that zzso of the zzso zzso are zzso to the host zzso in an unfolded zzso and that folded proteins are stalled within the zzso channel, zzso the function of the zzso zzso
