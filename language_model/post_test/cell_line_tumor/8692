zzso zzso a multiple zzso zzso is the only clinically approved drug for patients with advanced zzso However, its therapeutic success is limited by the emergence of drug zzso Here we found that zzso and zzso are major players in the resistance to zzso We recently reported that zzso zzso expression in zzso contributes to zzso resistance in zzso and, therefore, we focused on the mechanisms that associate zzso to acquired drug zzso In this study we first found that zzso zzso significantly increased the zzso inducing effect of zzso in zzso cells via specific zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso Using a mouse zzso model we further found that zzso depletion combined with 21 days of zzso treatment exerts a substantial zzso effect in zzso Interestingly, we showed that, upon exposure to zzso treatment, zzso depleted zzso maintain lower levels of zzso and higher levels of zzso than control zzso Thus, this study demonstrated that zzso of zzso signaling prevents zzso drug resistance and zzso zzso cells to zzso Finally, we validated our in zzso and in zzso results in primary human zzso showing that zzso protein expression positively correlated with zzso protein expression and zzso correlated with zzso zzso In conclusion, the results presented in this study demonstrated that zzso zzso enhances the effect of zzso by overcoming drug zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso can be a promising strategy for treatment of zzso
