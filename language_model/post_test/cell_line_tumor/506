A series of zzso derivatives of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and tested on zzso zzso The zzso derivatives such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso to zzso from mouse zzso and human zzso melanoma cells, while the corresponding derivatives of zzso and zzso were almost inactive or less active than the zzso zzso The zzso activity of the zzso derivatives increased with increasing number of zzso zzso groups in the zzso zzso zzso formation in the culture of zzso cells was suppressed by 3 and 9 with no zzso in the concentration range tested zzso 3 and zzso for 3, 9, and zzso acid, zzso Thus the zzso derivatives having a zzso group are potential zzso zzso Their zzso of zzso is primarily performed through the zzso zzso and further strengthened by the zzso zzso groups in the zzso zzso
