Upon zzso the human zzso zzso gene is zzso by the zzso zzso factor 1 zzso zzso zzso is a zzso complex involved in the zzso of gene zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso and zzso gene 1 zzso alternative zzso zzso of zzso zzso reporter gene zzso zzso by zzso in an zzso zzso zzso was more potent than zzso in the reporter gene zzso zzso depletion of both zzso and zzso by small interfering zzso significantly compromised the zzso of the zzso EPO gene triggered by zzso Whereas knocking down zzso alone resulted in a moderate reduction in zzso of the EPO zzso depletion of zzso resulted in an zzso of zzso of both the EPO gene and the zzso zzso indicating that zzso can compensate for loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso and sequential zzso zzso analysis showed that both zzso and zzso associate with the zzso region of the EPO gene in zzso in a zzso fashion and that each is present in a complex with zzso zzso and zzso were also recruited to the promoter of the vascular zzso growth factor zzso gene in a zzso fashion, although hypoxic induction of zzso zzso was not affected by zzso of either or both zzso and zzso Together these studies reveal a novel role for zzso in the zzso of zzso of the EPO zzso indicate an important communication and compensation between zzso and zzso and suggest that the requirement for zzso during hypoxic induction is zzso
