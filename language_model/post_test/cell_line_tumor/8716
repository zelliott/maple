The zzso transformation of zzso zzso zzso into a zzso state provides cancer cells with the ability to zzso locally and to zzso Different degrees of zzso transition zzso have been found to occur in zzso from breast, colon and zzso zzso zzso among zzso Numerous studies have focused on bona fide zzso and zzso states but rarely on intermediate zzso In this study, we describe a model system for zzso the spectrum of zzso using 43 zzso OC cell zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals four zzso zzso Intermediate zzso Intermediate M and zzso which represent different zzso compositions along the zzso zzso In zzso zzso functional studies, OC cells zzso an Intermediate M zzso are zzso by high zzso and zzso expression and low zzso and zzso expression and are more zzso and zzso A specific zzso zzso zzso zzso restores zzso expression in Intermediate M cells in in zzso and in zzso models and abrogates zzso We show how a zzso zzso Signature can zzso an OC cohort into four zzso States zzso with zzso survival zzso We conclude that the zzso of intermediate zzso states provides a new approach to better define zzso The concept of the zzso zzso allows the zzso of zzso genes as zzso markers and the design and application of therapeutic targets for reversing zzso in a selective zzso of zzso
