zzso is a key regulator of cell migration and zzso zzso We examined the correlation of zzso with human breast cancer, in zzso in zzso and in clinical breast cancer zzso zzso study of frozen zzso human breast zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso cells stained positively for zzso and that cancer cells in zzso zzso stained very zzso zzso zzso revealed that breast cancer zzso had significantly lower levels of zzso compared with normal background zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso Although no significantly correlation was found with zzso grade and zzso staging, lower levels of transcript were seen to correlate with clinical outcome following a ten year follow zzso Thus zzso from patients with predicted poor prognosis had significantly lower levels than from those with good prognosis zzso vs zzso zzso Patients with zzso zzso of breast cancer had significantly lower levels of zzso compared to those remaining disease free zzso and zzso vs zzso zzso and zzso zzso During in zzso experiments, zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso zzso exhibited a significantly reduced in zzso zzso and zzso compared with control and wild type cells ( zzso had increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso reduced in zzso growth zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso caused a relocation of zzso to the cell periphery in a zzso and spatial zzso It is concluded that zzso a member of the zzso family may act as a zzso progression zzso in human breast cancer and may therefore have significant clinical value in this zzso
