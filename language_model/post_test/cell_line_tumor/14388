We previously reported that zzso (an inhibitor of base zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in human tumor zzso In this study, we investigated the potential mechanisms of this enhanced cell zzso Human zzso zzso zzso cells were exposed to zzso (3 zzso and/or zzso (3 zzso for 48 hours before zzso radiation (5 zzso We found that zzso altered cell cycle zzso and led to an increased zzso population but a decreased S population before zzso zzso Immediately following zzso radiation (up to 6 hours), zzso cells showed a stringent zzso checkpoint but an insufficient zzso checkpoint, whereas a prolonged zzso arrest, containing zzso and zzso cells, was found at later times up to 72 zzso zzso of cell zzso markers zzso zzso zzso A, zzso zzso and zzso and DNA damage signaling proteins zzso zzso and zzso supported these altered cell cycle zzso Interestingly, we found that zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the extent of cell death through necrosis or zzso seemed similar in all zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso treatment zzso However, a larger population of zzso zzso cells was seen in zzso zzso cells, which was correlated with the increased zzso of the zzso factors zzso and zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso enhanced the effects of zzso radiation by causing a prolonged zzso cell cycle arrest and by promoting zzso premature zzso Thus, zzso a novel zzso zzso tumor suppression pathway, may be effectively targeted by zzso zzso resulting in an improved therapeutic gain for zzso zzso
