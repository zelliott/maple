Fast zzso and slower hormone release share the same core fusion machinery consisting of zzso zzso zzso factor attachment protein zzso zzso In evoked zzso interactions between zzso and the zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso protein family, are essential for zzso whereas other zzso proteins are zzso To address if the zzso of zzso demonstrated in zzso also applied to fast insulin zzso we characterized the presence and function of zzso and its closest zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso We show that pancreatic zzso express both zzso and zzso The two zzso zzso exhibit different zzso zzso and only zzso redistributes in response to zzso zzso However, both zzso and zzso augment zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and high resolution zzso patch clamp recordings show that zzso and zzso zzso shift the zzso sensitivity of the fastest phase of insulin zzso zzso In addition, we reveal that zzso sensitivity of zzso in zzso depends on the zzso status of the zzso zzso Even though zzso emerges as the key zzso determining the zzso threshold for triggering zzso activity in a zzso zzso zzso has the ability to increase zzso sensitivity and thus mediates the release of zzso zzso requiring a lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso display distinct zzso zzso and can coordinate the insulin zzso process differently as a consequence of the actual zzso
