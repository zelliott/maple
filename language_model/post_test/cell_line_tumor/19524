Advanced zzso end products zzso that arise from the reaction of zzso with protein side chains and the terminal zzso group are supposed to be involved in the zzso of several diseases and therefore the effects of zzso on cells are the objective of numerous zzso The effects of zzso on cells are commonly assumed to be zzso via the zzso for zzso zzso but there are also other receptors known to interact with zzso and they are likely to be involved in signal zzso The primary cellular effect of zzso on cultured cells was found to be the formation of zzso oxygen species zzso For the present study one zzso and three human cell lines were zzso The effects of a set of different highly modified zzso and zzso compounds derived from the incubation of different zzso with zzso were tested for their effects on these zzso Almost all zzso tested induced the production of zzso oxygen species zzso in the different cell lines although the intensity of the detected signals varied considerably between the cell lines and are strongly dependent on the zzso used for cell zzso The most highly modified zzso were shown to inhibit cell growth in all cell lines, whereas a moderately modified zzso derived zzso and zzso did not show any zzso effect on cell growth even when a high zzso formation was zzso
