The DNA zzso agent zzso zzso is widely used in the treatment of human zzso such as zzso and zzso On the basis of previous zzso studies, we recently zzso a new zzso zzso analog by rationally introducing an zzso extension to the zzso functionality in zzso zzso 

This zzso analog showed a superior zzso to zzso in human zzso and melanoma cells and a more potent zzso activity than zzso in mouse zzso and melanoma zzso zzso zzso was also effective against a zzso zzso cell zzso To explore the mechanism underlying the superior zzso activity of zzso we compared the effects of zzso and zzso on zzso and zzso zzso was significantly increased in tumor cells treated with zzso in comparison to those treated with zzso zzso also triggered greater zzso response, as compared with zzso and suppressing zzso partly rescued cell death induced by zzso indicating that zzso zzso contributed to cell zzso Although zzso level of the key zzso zzso zzso 1, was increased, zzso 1 protein was zzso in the cells treated with zzso The decrease in zzso 1 following zzso treatment were rescued by the zzso zzso and the zzso degradation of zzso had no effect on zzso but promoted zzso in cells treated with zzso 

Our study indicates that incorporation of zzso into zzso can render greater potency to this zzso zzso
