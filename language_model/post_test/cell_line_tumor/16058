A series of zzso acid zzso lacking the zzso zzso unit, was zzso and subsequently evaluated for their ability to inhibit the migration of human breast cancer cells, zzso as well as of human prostate cancer cells, zzso These cell lines provide a good model system to study migration and invasion, since they represent zzso zzso Our studies show that zzso acid zzso with zzso zzso at the aromatic ring demonstrate no zzso effect on the migration of both cancer cell lines, whereas a precursor in the synthesis of these zzso acid zzso zzso a zzso zzso is an excellent inhibitor of the migration of both cancer cell zzso
