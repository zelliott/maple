This paper reports the synthesis and labeling of zzso zzso zzso We also investigate their biological characteristics as potential tumor imaging agents zzso by zzso preferring zzso zzso zzso 

Three new zzso zzso derivatives were prepared from corresponding zzso through a zzso labeling zzso In zzso zzso studies to evaluate and to compare these three zzso were carried out in zzso zzso and zzso prostate cancer cell zzso Potential transport mechanisms, protein incorporation and stability of zzso zzso were investigated in zzso zzso zzso Its zzso was determined in a zzso zzso tumor zzso PET imaging studies were performed on rat bearing zzso zzso tumors and transgenic mouse carrying spontaneous generated zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso 

New zzso zzso derivatives were prepared with zzso zzso zzso yields, excellent zzso purity zzso and good zzso purity zzso In zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso and zzso prostate cancer cells was higher than that observed for the other two zzso derivatives and zzso in the first zzso zzso of cell zzso studies suggested that zzso zzso in zzso zzso was predominantly via transport system zzso After entering into cells, zzso remained stable and was not incorporated into protein within zzso In zzso zzso studies demonstrated that zzso had relatively high zzso in liver and zzso zzso zzso was fast, reaching a maximum within 30 zzso The zzso zzso and zzso ratios at 60 zzso post injection were zzso zzso and zzso zzso In PET imaging studies, tumors were zzso with zzso in both zzso rat and transgenic zzso 

zzso showed promising properties as a PET imaging agent for zzso zzso zzso associated with tumor zzso
