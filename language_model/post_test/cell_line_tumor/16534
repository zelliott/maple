zzso precursor zzso has previously been reported to control cancer growth, invasion, zzso and served as novel therapeutic target for cancer zzso However, the nature and characteristics of zzso interacting partner remain zzso The present study aims to identify and characterize the novel zzso interacting partner of zzso using zzso and mass zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to capture zzso and its interacting partner from the protein extract of the liver cancer cells zzso The zzso proteins were analyzed by zzso followed by mass zzso and the protein identity was demonstrated to be zzso 3 zzso The interaction has been validated in additional cell models using zzso zzso and zzso to confirm zzso as the interacting zzso zzso and zzso expressions were then examined by real-time quantitative zzso in clinical samples, and their transcript levels were significantly zzso zzso zzso levels were observed in liver cancer compared with the adjacent zzso liver, and patients with elevated zzso levels were shown to have poor recurrence-free zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso was observed only in the zzso of liver cancer cells by zzso zzso 

zzso is an interacting partner of zzso and may play an important role in zzso
