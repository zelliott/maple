zzso and its zzso zzso are potent zzso compounds that inhibit proliferation of cells at zzso zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso and zzso attached to zzso zzso have shown promising clinical zzso To determine the mechanism by which the zzso zzso inhibit cell zzso we examined the effects of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso on zzso human breast tumor zzso We also examined the effects of the free zzso zzso and zzso zzso (a version of zzso that is stable in cell culture zzso for zzso Both the zzso and free zzso zzso inhibited zzso cell proliferation at zzso and zzso zzso respectively, by arresting the cells in zzso zzso Arrest occurred in concert with the zzso and zzso processing of both zzso under conditions that induced abnormal zzso organization and suppressed zzso dynamic zzso zzso zzso occurred only at significantly higher drug zzso The results indicate that free zzso zzso zzso and their zzso exert their potent zzso effects through a common mechanism involving suppression of zzso dynamic zzso
