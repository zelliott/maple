Gene therapy offers great potential for brain zzso However, therapeutic genes could not reach zzso zzso A zzso gene delivery system is highly desired to transfer zzso genes throughout the tumor zzso In this study, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was selected as the main zzso zzso zzso which has been demonstrated to bind specifically to zzso expressed in zzso was exploited as the targeting zzso to zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso yielding zzso The cellular zzso of zzso itself was observed apparently in zzso zzso cells, almost not in zzso zzso The modification of zzso could significantly increase the cellular zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The in zzso distribution of zzso zzso in the brain was higher than that of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the gene expression of zzso zzso was higher zzso in zzso than that of unmodified and zzso zzso The zzso analysis showed a more zzso zzso in the zzso group, compared to other groups including commercial zzso zzso The median survival time of zzso group and zzso group was zzso and 49 days, respectively, significantly longer than that of other zzso The results suggested that zzso could be exploited as a special zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a potential zzso delivery system for gene therapy of zzso via intravenous zzso
