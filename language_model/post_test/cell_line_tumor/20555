Triple negative breast cancer zzso is very aggressive and currently has no specific therapeutic targets, such as hormone receptors or human zzso growth factor zzso type 2 zzso therefore, prognosis is zzso zzso a zzso zzso may exert efficacy in zzso through its multiple cellular zzso Here, we tested the efficacy of zzso and examined the drug mechanism in breast cancer zzso 

Five breast cancer cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso positive zzso were used for in zzso zzso zzso was examined by both flow zzso and Western zzso Signal zzso pathways in cells were assessed by Western zzso Gene zzso was done by small interfering zzso zzso In zzso efficacy of zzso was tested in nude mice with breast cancer zzso zzso study was performed on tumor zzso from patients with zzso 

zzso induced significant zzso which was independent of its zzso zzso in the three zzso cell lines, but not in zzso or zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibitor of protein zzso 2A zzso a cellular inhibitor of protein zzso 2A zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso We showed that zzso inhibited zzso in association with zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso manner in all sensitive zzso cells, whereas no zzso in zzso expression and zzso were noted in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and protected zzso and zzso cells from zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso by zzso overcame the resistance to zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso but did not affect the degradation of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso exerted in zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso tumors, but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in the zzso tumors but not in the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is readily zzso in tumor samples from zzso zzso 

zzso is a major zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso may thus be a potential therapeutic target in zzso
