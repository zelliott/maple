The zzso X zzso zzso is a member of the nuclear zzso zzso that is highly expressed in liver, zzso adrenal zzso and zzso It plays an important role in regulating the progression of several zzso including zzso zzso zzso So it is necessary to study the regulation of zzso In this study, we found that the expression of zzso was zzso correlated with zzso protein level in zzso cell zzso Treatment with zzso mimic zzso zzso zzso The reporter zzso revealed that zzso targeted 3' untranslated region of human zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso by zzso promoted the zzso migration, and invasion of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may serve as a novel molecular target for manipulating zzso expression in zzso and for the treatment of zzso
