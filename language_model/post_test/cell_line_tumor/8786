zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso Analysis of these zzso zzso in the zzso of afflicted patients represents a potential platform for zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso for quantitative assessment of zzso zzso remains zzso Here, we demonstrate that the reference transcripts commonly used for quantitative zzso (including zzso zzso zzso and zzso were unreliable for assessing zzso zzso In this context, we zzso zzso zzso in absolute terms and zzso this value to the input zzso zzso Using this method, we examined the abundance of zzso a highly zzso zzso in zzso in zzso In a panel of zzso cell lines, the cellular levels of zzso correlated with zzso zzso levels ( zzso suggesting that zzso cells actively zzso zzso containing zzso zzso with this hypothesis, the zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso patients zzso were, on average, zzso higher than levels in zzso isolated from the zzso of zzso patients zzso zzso zzso none of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso level below zzso copies per zzso in this zzso Using this zzso value, we were able to zzso distinguish zzso derived from zzso and zzso patients in an independent cohort of zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso may serve as a platform for zzso zzso zzso
