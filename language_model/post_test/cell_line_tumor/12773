Human zzso cell zzso zzso is characterized by a high level of resistance to all treatment zzso zzso the investigation of global gene expression in zzso might help understand its zzso behavior and develop treatment zzso Using zzso zzso analysis, we initially compared gene expression profiles between zzso and adjacent normal zzso and found that 87 were zzso and zzso genes were zzso Next, a subset of zzso twofold zzso zzso were validated by Northern zzso zzso zzso a gene reported to be a tumor zzso zzso was found to be zzso in zzso zzso zzso level of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was higher than in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was more resistant to zzso zzso than zzso zzso gene was slightly induced in surviving zzso cells after zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso cells, which were zzso with zzso of zzso zzso were more sensitive to zzso compared to zzso but reduction of zzso gene expression did not affect tumor formation in zzso of kidney and lung zzso On the other hand, induction of zzso gene affected the production of lung zzso under zzso drug zzso the zzso of pulmonary zzso was significantly lower in zzso mice injected with zzso cells, and the number of pulmonary zzso decreased significantly zzso The above results together suggest that zzso may zzso a growth advantage to cancer cells during zzso chemotherapy and surviving zzso cells eventually might develop lung zzso
