We evaluated the effects of the over expression of zzso one of the high molecular form of zzso on the zzso potential of zzso human zzso cancer cells in zzso and in zzso 

We introduced zzso complementary DNA into zzso cells, which do not express zzso level of zzso zzso and generated the zzso over expressing cell line zzso and the zzso only zzso cell line zzso The effects of the introduction of zzso into zzso cells on the ability to bind zzso acid zzso were analyzed by the cell zzso zzso and the cell migration zzso We then evaluated tumor progression of zzso zzso after subcutaneous and zzso injection into zzso nude zzso 

There were no significant differences in in zzso growth zzso zzso cells showed significantly decreased binding and migration ability to zzso but not to other zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso cells demonstrated significantly increased tumor growth after subcutaneous as well as zzso injection into zzso nude mice and enhanced zzso zzso zzso after zzso injection compared with zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso over expression in human zzso cancer cells decreases their interaction with zzso and zzso their zzso zzso
