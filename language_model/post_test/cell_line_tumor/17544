Gene zzso associated with zzso DNA zzso of promoter zzso islands is one mechanism through which tumor zzso genes are zzso in human zzso zzso (target of zzso zzso is a zzso zzso gene that functions in the regulation of zzso In this study, we examined the DNA zzso status of the zzso promoter in zzso cancer cell lines and zzso by zzso zzso zzso and its zzso expression by reverse zzso and quantitative zzso zzso zzso of zzso was present in zzso zzso cancer cell lines and zzso primary zzso cancer zzso The median value of relative zzso gene expression in zzso with zzso zzso was significantly lower than that in zzso without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression of the zzso gene was relatively high zzso in the normal zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression was restored by treatment with the zzso agent zzso in the zzso cell line, which lacks the zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso may play a role in the zzso of zzso zzso
