The principles and performance are described for the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso screening and drug zzso zzso zzso grown and subjected to compound treatments in zzso plates were subjected to a zzso zzso protection zzso in zzso The zzso protection zzso destroyed all zzso zzso but left intact zzso amounts of 16 zzso zzso zzso Upon transfer of processed cell zzso to a zzso that contained a zzso zzso array at the bottom of each well, the various probe species were separated by zzso at zzso elements of the zzso zzso detection of zzso zzso was by zzso zzso A high-resolution zzso device zzso was used for the simultaneous zzso of all zzso array elements in a zzso zzso For the measurement of 16 genes in samples of zzso cells, the average standard zzso from well to well within a plate was zzso of signal intensity and was zzso from plate to zzso zzso response was linear and zzso was constant for all detected genes in samples ranging from 1000 to zzso zzso When zzso zzso were differentiated with zzso zzso and subsequently activated with bacterial zzso that contained different zzso of zzso zzso effects of zzso on the zzso levels of several genes were zzso
