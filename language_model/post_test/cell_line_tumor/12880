Small cell lung cancer zzso is an aggressive zzso with extremely high mortality due to the appearance of widespread zzso early in its clinical course and rapid acquisition of zzso after initial zzso A theory of cell zzso drug resistance is thought to be a principal mechanism in which zzso zzso proteins provide a survival advantage against zzso drug-induced zzso We found that the zzso family member zzso was expressed zzso in zzso tumors and zzso from three of seven relapsed patients, whereas zzso primary tumors from 16 patients were zzso negative with only one zzso Additionally, zzso was highly expressed on zzso cell lines rendered resistant to zzso or zzso and was zzso in parental zzso cells within 48 hours after exposure to either of these zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso more tightly to zzso via zzso zzso but they were less zzso than the respective zzso parental zzso zzso treatment of the zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso restored zzso Moreover, selective targeting of zzso by treatment with specific zzso zzso zzso or a small interfering zzso triggered zzso in the zzso zzso Taken together, our findings zzso zzso in the cell zzso drug resistance zzso highlighting zzso as an attractive therapeutic target to improve therapeutic outcomes in zzso
