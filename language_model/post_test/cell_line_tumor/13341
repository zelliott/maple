zzso and chemotherapy zzso resistance zzso success in combating small and zzso cell lung zzso zzso The underlying molecular mechanisms of zzso resistance of zzso are zzso and have been understood in part zzso zzso key regulators of zzso are zzso zzso however, their role in regulating zzso response remains poorly zzso 

Six human zzso and five zzso cell lines with different zzso values were zzso Using zzso we examined whether expression of zzso is linked to the zzso resistance of zzso or zzso zzso data were validated by quantitative real-time zzso zzso and zzso were zzso using zzso zzso western zzso and flow zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso is zzso in zzso zzso cells relative to zzso zzso Considering zzso as a putative regulator of zzso resistance, we demonstrate that zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso them to zzso by stimulation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso protected against zzso zzso Protection was zzso by zzso as zzso of this zzso could reverse the zzso zzso resistance of zzso zzso 

zzso profiling of zzso revealed putative zzso resistance zzso zzso which might help in zzso of zzso to zzso
