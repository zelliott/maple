zzso zzso cell zzso zzso 1 zzso a cell zzso zzso expressed in a variety of cell types is a putative tumor zzso zzso Alternative zzso of zzso generates 11 different zzso zzso which include zzso zzso with either short or long zzso domain generated by the exclusion zzso or inclusion zzso of zzso zzso Studies in zzso indicate that optimal ratios of zzso zzso zzso are required to inhibit zzso tumor cell zzso 

We show that zzso is expressed in a tissue specific manner with significant differences in the ratios of its short zzso and long zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso we find dramatic differences between the ratios of zzso zzso in normal breast zzso versus breast cancer zzso suggesting that altered zzso of zzso may play an important role in zzso Furthermore, we have identified two regulatory zzso elements required for the alternative zzso of zzso Replacement of these regulatory elements by human zzso zzso sequences resulted in zzso zzso zzso as the zzso zzso Interestingly, while zzso of zzso 7 in a zzso reporter gene resulted in its zzso zzso 7 along with the zzso zzso sequences zzso the alternative zzso of zzso 

Our results indicate that a network of regulatory elements control the alternative zzso of zzso These findings may have important implications in therapeutic zzso of zzso linked human zzso
