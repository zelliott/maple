The recognition and removal of zzso cells is critical to development, tissue zzso and the resolution of zzso Many studies have shown that zzso is regulated by signaling mechanisms that involve distinct zzso interactions that drive the zzso of zzso zzso Studies from our laboratory have shown that the plasma protein zzso 1 zzso a member of the short consensus repeat zzso binds zzso zzso and zzso cells and promotes their bridging and subsequent zzso by zzso The zzso zzso for the zzso cell complex, however, is zzso Here we report that a member of the low density zzso zzso protein family on zzso binds and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cell zzso Using zzso zzso we also show that zzso zzso is zzso by bridging of the target cell to the zzso through the protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso
