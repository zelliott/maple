zzso zzso is a drug that is commonly used in the treatment of zzso breast zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of prior exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso on the subsequent ability of human zzso T zzso to adhere to zzso of zzso human breast zzso zzso zzso T cells that survived culture for 24 h in the presence of zzso zzso or 3 zzso zzso exhibited a diminished ability to adhere to zzso breast cancer cell zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso T cells revealed reduced surface expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but normal zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso interferes with the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso molecules by surviving T zzso zzso experiments with zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that zzso of zzso T cells to zzso breast cancer cell zzso was dependent upon zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso We conclude that prior exposure to zzso caused a reduction in zzso T cell zzso to zzso breast zzso cells by preventing optimal zzso and zzso interactions with their corresponding zzso on tumor zzso A similar effect by zzso on T zzso of breast cancer patients may compromise zzso zzso immune zzso
