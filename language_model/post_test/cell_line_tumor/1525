Breast cancer is one of several tumors, including zzso zzso and zzso which display a remarkable zzso for zzso to zzso The preference to zzso to bone by tumor cells relies on specific interactions among tumor cells, bone zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso is zzso to enable the survival of tumor cells in the bone zzso Using gene profiling array and zzso we demonstrated the message expression of few bone zzso proteins in zzso zzso cells as well as that of cell zzso molecules zzso A zzso zzso named zzso was previously shown to be expressed in zzso cells both in zzso and in zzso zzso cell zzso in the bone-marrow zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso regulate the expression of zzso molecules and act in zzso We focused on differential regulation of zzso gene comparing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activated zzso promoter, increased its message and protein levels in both cell zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we zzso zzso promoter occupancy by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and their binding was also regulated by both zzso By comparing zzso with zzso zzso cells, the study expands our understanding of zzso gene expression regulation and it sheds light on its involvement in zzso zzso
