zzso is a zzso protein recognized as a cell zzso zzso zzso In this study, we focused on the activity regulation of an alternative promoter (AP) and the expression of alternative zzso forms of zzso from zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso was analyzed on zzso isolated from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells grown alone or following zzso between these zzso The zzso system aimed to mimic the cellular cross talk that exists in the bone zzso once the zzso cells invade the zzso We demonstrated that zzso zzso were zzso expressed between these zzso The various zzso levels were affected by zzso or in cells treated with zzso or zzso Both cell lines exhibited an increase of message levels of a and e zzso following the zzso zzso A novel aspect presented here is related to existence of an alternative promoter (AP) in zzso zzso The zzso was in zzso predicted and analyzed for binding by specific zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso The binding of these zzso results in a non uniform binding pattern when comparing between the zzso and zzso zzso Using the zzso agent, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso allowed to study the zzso level of the zzso and the message zzso This study provides insights into alternative zzso forms of zzso and their regulation that may play a role within the bone niche with invading zzso zzso
