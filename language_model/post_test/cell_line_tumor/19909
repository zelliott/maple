zzso of zzso DNA is dependent upon both the viral DNA zzso and the viral core zzso the zzso of the zzso in which viral DNA synthesis takes zzso In a study of natural zzso of duck zzso B virus zzso we cloned full-length viral zzso from a zzso zzso One of the clones failed to direct viral DNA replication in zzso cells, apparently as a result of a 3 zzso zzso deletion of zzso 107 in the core zzso zzso 107 is located in the center of a predicted zzso region of the zzso zzso a stretch of 45 zzso acids which appears to be at the tip of a spike on the surface of the zzso The zzso was introduced into a zzso strain of zzso for further zzso Core protein accumulated in cells zzso with the zzso zzso but was partially zzso suggesting that it was zzso zzso zzso were not detected by zzso gel zzso Interestingly, the zzso protein appeared to form zzso zzso with zzso core zzso The zzso zzso supported viral DNA zzso These results suggest that the zzso domain of the spike may play a role either in assembly of stable zzso possibly in formation of the zzso zzso or in triggering zzso zzso required during initiation of new rounds of zzso
