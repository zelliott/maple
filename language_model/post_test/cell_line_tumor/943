The blockade of zzso zzso through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso represents a major signaling mechanism zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso however, is a weak zzso inhibitor zzso 48 zzso requiring at least 30 zzso to exhibit zzso effects on the growth of tumor cells in zzso Here, we report the zzso zzso of zzso to develop zzso zzso with greater potency in zzso zzso and growth zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso with respect to zzso suggest that zzso derivatives inhibit zzso by competing with zzso for zzso a mechanism reminiscent to that of many zzso zzso zzso analysis together with molecular modeling was used to generate compounds that were tested for their potency in zzso zzso zzso activity and in inducing zzso in zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso of potent compounds into the zzso site of zzso was performed for lead zzso leading to two compounds, zzso and zzso with zzso values in zzso zzso and zzso induction in the low zzso zzso Exposure of zzso cells to these agents led to zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso active forms of zzso and zzso partially protected zzso zzso zzso in a panel of 60 cell lines and more extensive testing in zzso cells indicated that the mean concentration for total growth zzso was approximately 3 zzso for both zzso Considering the zzso role of zzso signaling in promoting zzso these zzso zzso are of zzso relevance for cancer prevention and zzso
