The discovery of an zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso disorders has opened new avenues for the development of targeted therapies for these zzso However, no effective zzso zzso are currently available for clinical zzso 

We investigated the activity of zzso zzso a novel analogue of the zzso inhibitor zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and in blood cells from patients with zzso zzso 

We found that zzso significantly inhibited zzso and its downstream signal zzso and zzso of zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso pathways in a zzso and zzso zzso As a result, zzso zzso in the low zzso range induced zzso and zzso zzso and zzso effects in zzso zzso As expected, zzso inhibited the proliferation of peripheral blood zzso zzso of patients with zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso is active both in zzso and ex zzso and should be further developed for the treatment of zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso
