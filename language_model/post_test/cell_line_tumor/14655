zzso zzso is the most common and deadly form of primary brain tumor with a median survival of zzso months, despite use of extensive chemotherapy, zzso and zzso We have previously shown that nuclear zzso B zzso is zzso expressed in zzso tumors and primary cell lines derived from tumor zzso Here we show that zzso a zzso is also zzso expressed by zzso cell lines and expression of zzso is in large part, attributable to the zzso zzso of zzso We hypothesized that zzso of zzso cells is driven at least in part by zzso expressed zzso In support of the hypothesis we found that treatment of zzso cells with an zzso zzso zzso markedly decreased their zzso compared to cells treated with control zzso or left zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso protein production with use of zzso targeted zzso also resulted in decreased invasion in zzso We next investigated the presence of zzso receptors by zzso analysis and found that zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and zzso only express zzso but not zzso Treatment of zzso cells with a blocking zzso zzso reduced their invasion through zzso Finally, we found that addition of zzso zzso following zzso of zzso which results in loss of zzso zzso production, incompletely restored tumor cell zzso Our data indicate that zzso is necessary but not solely responsible for zzso cell invasion and mediates its effect in an zzso zzso
