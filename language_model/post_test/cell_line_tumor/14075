The influence of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and on attachment to both fixed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and fixed zzso zzso zzso zzso cells was zzso zzso cell wall characteristics were examined by transmission electron zzso zzso zzso were shown to adhere equally to both zzso cells and zzso zzso In zzso cells, the addition of zzso zzso zzso fragile zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly increased attachment to at least 1 of the cell cultures as compared to zzso incubated without any zzso The zzso attachment was reversed by zzso of zzso zzso with 250 zzso of each specific sugar (for a given zzso In zzso zzso zzso as low as zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within 60 zzso Finally, in zzso samples, zzso gold zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso attached to zzso and this could be competitively inhibited by a zzso zzso This suggests that zzso zzso zzso are highly zzso to zzso zzso zzso and that the presence of zzso containing molecules on zzso can potentially help in zzso attachment to host zzso
