zzso stabilization of the complex between zzso acid zzso and the modified zzso zzso whose zzso zzso zzso groups are selectively removed utilizing mild zzso has been zzso With the decrease in the zzso zzso groups of zzso the complex with zzso can be considerably stabilized compared with unmodified zzso for example, the zzso value after the removal of the zzso zzso groups from zzso zzso to zzso is enhanced by 14 degrees zzso In addition, the zzso stabilization effect is even operative under the zzso conditions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This effect is exerted zzso to the construction of the zzso atmosphere around the zzso Although zzso lost the zzso zzso groups, it still kept the protection effect of the bound zzso chain against zzso zzso as observed for unmodified zzso The assessment of the zzso for zzso zzso melanoma, and zzso zzso leukemia revealed that the modified zzso scarcely increases the zzso These results indicate that the present modification for zzso is of great significance in a viewpoint to develop the practical gene carriers operative even under the zzso zzso
