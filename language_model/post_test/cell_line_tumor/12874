Recent findings have highlighted that zzso active zzso zzso zzso target of zzso zzso signaling is a common feature of zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso where it zzso cell zzso survival, and drug zzso These observations lend compelling weight to the application of zzso zzso in the therapy of zzso Here, we have analyzed the therapeutic potential of the novel dual zzso inhibitor zzso an orally zzso zzso zzso which has entered clinical trials for solid tumors, on both zzso cell lines and patient zzso zzso was zzso to a panel of zzso cell lines as determined by zzso zzso zzso treatment resulted in cell cycle arrest and zzso Western blots showed a zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso downstream targets in response to zzso zzso zzso targeted the side population of both zzso cell lines and patient zzso which might zzso to zzso cells, and zzso with zzso agents zzso zzso zzso currently used for treating zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso to zzso induced in zzso cells by zzso with zzso zzso cells, which mimic the bone zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso patient zzso displaying zzso zzso where the drug zzso zzso initiation factor zzso protein 1, at zzso with zzso Taken together, our findings indicate that zzso zzso at two zzso of the zzso network with zzso either alone or in combination with zzso drugs, may be an efficient treatment of those zzso that have zzso zzso of this signaling zzso for their proliferation and zzso
