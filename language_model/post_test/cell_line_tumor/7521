This study was to investigate the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso on the proliferation and zzso of human gastric cancer cell line zzso zzso were treated with different zzso of zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso zzso were performed to evaluate the effect of zzso on the cell growth and zzso zzso fluorescent microscope was used to observe cell zzso zzso scanning zzso microscope zzso was used to analyze zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso transition pore zzso and zzso membrane potential zzso zzso was applied to zzso the activity of zzso and zzso zzso was used to determine the expressions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso It was shown that zzso inhibited the growth of zzso After the treatment for 72 zzso the cell zzso zzso was obvious, which showed that cell zzso and zzso body appeared, and the zzso was zzso the zzso peak appeared and the zzso rate increased in a zzso zzso After the treatment for 24 zzso zzso activated zzso zzso and decreased zzso It also increased the activity of zzso and zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso the expression of zzso induced the release of zzso zzso induced zzso zzso through a zzso pathway, suggesting it may be an agent for cancer zzso
