zzso type 3 zzso strain zzso has an inherent propensity to zzso zzso and destroy cancer zzso The zzso activity of zzso as a single agent has been demonstrated in zzso and in zzso against various zzso including zzso zzso zzso and breast zzso Its human safety and potential efficacy are currently being investigated in early clinical zzso In this study, we investigated the in zzso combination effects of zzso and zzso agents against human zzso cell lung cancer zzso 

zzso alone exerted significant zzso activity in 7 of 9 zzso cell lines zzso with the 50% effective dose, defined as the initial virus dose to achieve 50% cell killing after 48 hours of infection, ranging from zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the combination of zzso with zzso zzso or zzso demonstrated strong synergistic effects on cell killing, but only in cell lines that were sensitive to these zzso In contrast, the combination of zzso and zzso was invariably synergistic in all cell lines tested, regardless of their levels of sensitivity to either zzso Treatment of zzso cell lines with the zzso combination resulted in increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity compared to single therapy, indicating enhanced zzso induction in zzso treated zzso zzso zzso cells treated with the zzso combination showed increased proportions of zzso and zzso cells, and a more pronounced level of zzso zzso was demonstrated in zzso arrested zzso 

These data suggest that the zzso activity of zzso can be zzso by zzso and other zzso agents, and that the zzso combination most effectively achieves zzso through accelerated zzso triggered by prolonged zzso zzso
