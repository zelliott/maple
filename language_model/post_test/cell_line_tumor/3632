zzso zzso zzso is one of the crucial zzso factors in gastric zzso We have reported that zzso gene zzso was effective against zzso zzso zzso of gastric zzso zzso one of the zzso factors, was reported to induce zzso T zzso when using melanoma and zzso cancer cell lines, as well as zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso by zzso gene zzso into gastric cancer zzso 

We zzso zzso genes into a gastric cancer cell line zzso and analyzed the effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso the in zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso to cancer cells and zzso zzso zzso ability after zzso zzso of gastric cancer cells in zzso 

We revealed that zzso zzso showed significantly stronger adherence and zzso to zzso zzso cells zzso than its parent zzso zzso The tumor growth rate of zzso zzso was significantly slower than zzso zzso in nude zzso In zzso zzso experiments for nude mice, zzso cells in stomach developed significantly less zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso findings showed that zzso were zzso infiltrated in both the zzso tumors and its zzso zzso however, were scarcely observed in the zzso associated with zzso zzso 

zzso may play an important role in zzso zzso zzso zzso by the mechanism of enhanced zzso and that zzso gene zzso might be effective against zzso zzso zzso of gastric zzso
