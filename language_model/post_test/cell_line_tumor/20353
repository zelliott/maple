zzso a zzso protein zzso by the zzso gene of chicken anemia virus zzso has been shown to not only induce zzso when introduced into the precursors of chicken zzso but has been found to specifically kill human cancer cells, tumor cell and transformed cells without affecting the proliferation of normal zzso This zzso zzso characteristic of the protein potentially may allow the development of a protein drug that has applications in tumor zzso However, several major problems, which include poor expression and poor protein zzso have hampered the production of zzso in zzso 

zzso increased expression of zzso full-length zzso that originated from chicken anemia virus was demonstrated using an zzso coli expression zzso The zzso zzso gene was fused with a synthetic sequence containing a zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso domain zzso The resulting construct was cloned into various different expression zzso and these were then expressed in various zzso coli zzso The expression of the zzso in zzso coli was significantly increased when zzso was fused with zzso rather than a zzso When the various rare zzso acid zzso of zzso were zzso the expression level of the zzso in zzso coli zzso was significantly further zzso The highest protein expression level obtained was zzso zzso per liter of bacterial culture after induction with zzso zzso zzso for 4 h at 25 zzso Moreover, approximately zzso of the expressed zzso under these conditions was zzso After zzso by zzso affinity zzso the zzso zzso zzso protein was used to evaluate the zzso zzso zzso activity on tumor zzso The results demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso showed zzso activity and was able to induce human zzso leukemia zzso cells to enter zzso 

On expression in zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso that has been fused to a zzso tag and had its zzso zzso was found to have great zzso This protein may in the future allow the development of a therapeutic protein that is able to specifically kill tumor zzso
