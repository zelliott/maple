Current methods for engineering zzso zzso growth factor patterns have not addressed the need for presentation of the growth factors in a zzso zzso We developed an zzso printing methodology for creating zzso patterns of unmodified growth factors on native biological material zzso We demonstrate this approach by printing zzso of zzso labeled bone zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso Concentration zzso were created by zzso individual zzso locations using a dilute zzso to zzso the surface concentration of deposited growth zzso zzso studies using zzso zzso verified that the zzso retained their shape for up to 7 zzso zzso experiments performed with zzso and zzso were used to zzso the surface concentration of growth factor retained on the zzso for up to 10 days in serum containing media after zzso of the zzso growth zzso The zzso method is zzso so the zzso shape can be easily modified as demonstrated by printed linear zzso with varying slopes and exponential zzso In addition, the versatility of this method enabled zzso zzso of multiple growth factors to be created by printing overlapping zzso The overlapping printing method was used to create a zzso square pattern array consisting of various surface zzso of zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso precursor cells were seeded on the zzso and alkaline zzso zzso was performed to determine the effect of zzso and zzso surface concentration on guiding zzso cells towards an zzso zzso These results demonstrate the utility of zzso printing for creating zzso growth factor zzso to investigate how combinations of immobilized growth factors influence cell zzso
