zzso zzso 3 zzso is a zzso that has been implicated in the control of stress response, cell viability and zzso zzso and has been linked to medical conditions, including insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease and zzso zzso the understanding of mechanisms that regulate zzso expression is of considerable zzso We have previously described the existence of several human zzso zzso zzso zzso that differ in their zzso region zzso In this study, we use a reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso system to characterize the expression levels of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells cultured in regular medium or exposed to zzso and investigate the effect of zzso zzso zzso on the efficiency of zzso zzso The data indicate that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso of zzso in both the stressed and zzso states, and that the remainder consists mainly of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso together forming less than zzso of the population in either zzso In addition to the substantial zzso zzso of all zzso zzso zzso zzso the exposure of cells to zzso results in a marked increase in the proportion of zzso zzso zzso molecules containing a truncated zzso The shortened zzso zzso proved to be zzso more efficient than the zzso zzso zzso due to the lack of an zzso upstream open reading frame zzso Thus, increased zzso as well as altered usage of zzso zzso contributes to the zzso of zzso protein synthesis in stressful zzso
