Nine zzso zzso zzso zzso generated against a zzso zzso protein zzso acids zzso of a zzso 4 zzso E virus zzso strain recognized four sets of zzso by zzso competitive zzso One zzso zzso was able to capture zzso efficiently regardless of zzso and was tested for its ability to neutralize a zzso 3 zzso strain zzso in a recently developed cell culture system for zzso in a zzso cell line zzso When zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso incubated with 100 zzso of a negative control zzso zzso zzso in the culture medium continued to be zzso after day 14 or 12 zzso zzso zzso However, when cells were zzso with the two distinct zzso of zzso that had been mixed with 100 zzso of zzso the harvested culture zzso were negative for zzso zzso throughout the zzso observation zzso Upon prior mixing of the virus with 10 zzso of zzso zzso zzso in culture zzso continued to be zzso until 46 or 28 zzso zzso In conclusion, one zzso zzso against zzso zzso protein that can efficiently neutralize zzso in zzso was obtained in the present zzso
