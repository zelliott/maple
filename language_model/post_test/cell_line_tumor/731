The zzso gene is compromised in most human zzso by point zzso Evidence is accumulating that these zzso frequently do not result in a complete loss of the zzso zzso regulatory function of zzso Here, we describe the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso isolated from a Ewing's zzso with high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso into a zzso zzso cell line resulted in zzso not only of the zzso but also of the zzso gene compatible with the presence of zzso expressed zzso transcripts initiated from the zzso promoter in the zzso zzso Ewing's zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso genes was further enhanced on zzso of this cell zzso Here, suppression of zzso by zzso reduced zzso promoter activity, zzso and protein zzso zzso gene zzso revealed that the potential of zzso to zzso zzso expression was similar to zzso zzso whereas zzso of the zzso promoter was at least zzso increased over zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence present in zzso 1 of the zzso gene was found to be responsible for zzso zzso In zzso with a role of zzso protein for cell death, we showed residual zzso activity of zzso to which the described Ewing's zzso cell line was found to be zzso zzso has previously been reported to bind to DNA with altered sequence specificity and to be unable to activate generic zzso target genes in zzso functional zzso Our results, therefore, show that a zzso zzso may behave differently when tested in its authentic cellular zzso
