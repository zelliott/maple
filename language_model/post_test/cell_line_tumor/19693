The family of zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso zzso regulate cell zzso migration, and zzso An important role in zzso zzso is emerging for some of its zzso In this study, we evaluate the role of zzso in zzso cancer and its value as a zzso zzso zzso levels were assessed by zzso zzso of tissue zzso of 137 zzso tumors and zzso zzso of the zzso promoter was investigated using zzso zzso We found that zzso expression is frequently reduced or lost in zzso zzso Patients with low zzso tumor levels had significantly shorter survival than patients in the high zzso group zzso survival, zzso and zzso years, zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso and this finding was validated using an independent set of 125 tumor zzso In addition, we show that zzso promoter zzso is a common mechanism of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso resulted in a significant reduction in the zzso potential of zzso cells, whereas zzso of zzso in cells with high levels of this zzso lead to a significant increase in zzso In zzso we identified zzso as a useful zzso marker for zzso zzso In addition, we provide zzso evidence showing that promoter zzso regulates zzso zzso and functional evidence that zzso can regulate the long-term zzso potential of zzso tumor cells, revealing zzso as a potential new tumor zzso gene in zzso zzso
