zzso a zzso expressed zzso binding zzso is responsible for the formation of the zzso zzso and is indispensable for cell cycle zzso However, the association between zzso expression and the cell cycle remains to be zzso In this study, we found that the expression level of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells, while zzso of zzso expression by small interference zzso zzso in these cells led to a reduction in the population of zzso zzso To investigate the role of zzso in the control of zzso phase zzso a zzso gene expression system was introduced to zzso different zzso of zzso in zzso The results showed that zzso phase progression was blocked following induction of zzso zzso A survey of the cell cycle proteins controlling the zzso phase progression revealed that the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso was the primary zzso induced by zzso zzso in a time and dose dependent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso expression in the zzso zzso cells released the zzso phase zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso of zzso led to induction of zzso gene promoter zzso using zzso reporter gene zzso This effect was associated with increase of zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso of zzso protein for zzso zzso degradation was also involved in zzso of zzso These data suggest that zzso expression and its regulation of zzso expression is important for the control of zzso phase zzso
