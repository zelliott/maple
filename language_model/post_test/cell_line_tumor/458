The very early zzso effects of the zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso protocol were assessed in mice implanted with a human zzso cell zzso The aim of this study was to identify changes in gene expression patterns and to detect combinations of PET parameters that may be helpful in identifying treated zzso early after chemotherapy using dynamic PET zzso 

A human zzso cell line zzso zzso was used in nude zzso Dynamic PET studies were performed in zzso zzso zzso zzso and treated zzso zzso zzso zzso The data were assessed using zzso and zzso zzso The removed zzso specimens were assessed by gene array analysis to obtain quantitative information on gene zzso 

One zzso treatment using the zzso protocol resulted in an zzso of zzso gene zzso by more than zzso while zzso zzso were zzso following zzso The gene array data demonstrated primarily an enhancement of genes related to zzso In particular, the zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso and the G zzso zzso 87 zzso were zzso to zzso zzso as compared to the expression in zzso zzso There was a zzso separation of zzso and treated animals on the basis of these three zzso The zzso and the zzso kinetic parameters obtained by zzso and zzso fitting were not significantly different when individual parameters were compared between zzso However, zzso analysis of the combination of the PET parameters zzso zzso zzso and influx revealed an overall accuracy of zzso We were able to identify zzso zzso of the treated animals and zzso zzso of the zzso animals correctly using the zzso analysis of PET zzso 

Even one zzso treatment using zzso has an impact on gene expression and significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso assessment of the zzso zzso and the application of zzso analysis to the data are promising tools to identify those zzso that demonstrate a zzso effect very early following zzso
