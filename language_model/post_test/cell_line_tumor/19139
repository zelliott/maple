The zzso effect of black pine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tested in zzso was negligible in comparison with bovine seminal zzso zzso However, in the experiments in zzso a significant decrease of the human melanoma tumor size was observed in the mice treated with this zzso and also with the animal zzso and zzso zzso In nude mice injected zzso with zzso (10 zzso the tumor size decreased from zzso in the control mice to zzso in treated mice whereas in counterparts treated with zzso and zzso I the tumor growth was reduced a little more, however after ten times higher doses zzso and 80 zzso per zzso Certain zzso and zzso activity as an expression of side effects of zzso and comparative zzso also appeared, but it was lower compared to the effect of bovine seminal zzso zzso of zzso was significantly weaker in comparison with zzso The zzso against black pine zzso produced in the injected mice did not zzso the biological effects of this plant zzso in zzso In conclusion zzso zzso proved in zzso higher zzso activity against human melanoma tumors growing in zzso mice in comparison with animal bovine seminal zzso and zzso zzso
