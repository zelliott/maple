The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are increased in zzso zzso zzso zzso and induce DNA damage and zzso via a zzso mechanism in zzso human zzso Based on these zzso we hypothesized that chronic exposure of zzso to these zzso zzso may allow a growth advantage to a subset of these cells through selection for resistance to zzso thereby contributing to zzso To test this hypothesis, we cultured zzso cells long-term in the presence of zzso zzso in survival and zzso factors of zzso cells were zzso zzso cultured long-term in the presence of zzso were resistant to zzso zzso and demonstrated an increase in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the ratio of zzso and in the protein levels of zzso factors including zzso zzso and zzso were zzso These results show that long-term exposure of zzso cells to low doses of zzso selects for zzso molecules which regulate resistance to zzso and thereby enhance cell zzso zzso expansion of such zzso cells may contribute to the genesis of zzso
