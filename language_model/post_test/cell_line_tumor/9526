The zzso properties of a zzso resistant zzso sodium channel, zzso and its restricted expression to the peripheral sensory zzso suggest that blocking this channel might have therapeutic potential in various pain states and may offer improved zzso compared with existing sodium channel zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso cannot be tested using a traditional pharmacological approach with small molecules because currently available sodium channel zzso do not distinguish between sodium channel zzso We sought to determine whether small interfering zzso zzso might be capable of achieving the desired zzso Using Northern zzso analysis and membrane potential zzso several zzso were identified that were capable of a zzso zzso of zzso message as well as functional expression in zzso zzso cells which were zzso zzso with the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso of the channel was confirmed using zzso zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso showing a robust zzso of zzso current was evaluated for in zzso efficacy in reversing an established tactile zzso in the rat chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso which was delivered to zzso zzso root zzso zzso via an zzso zzso zzso caused a significant reduction of zzso zzso expression in zzso 4 and 5 zzso zzso zzso and consequently reversed mechanical zzso in zzso zzso We conclude that zzso of zzso channel using a zzso approach is capable of producing pain relief in the zzso model and further support a role for zzso in pathological sensory zzso
