The role of the zzso system in degrading nuclear hormone receptors and regulating their zzso function has emerged in the last few zzso We identified the zzso zzso zzso as part of zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes zzso from nuclear extracts of zzso cells zzso expressing the zzso The interaction between zzso and the zzso was confirmed by zzso pull-down zzso Fluorescence zzso documented that zzso was zzso in the nucleus and the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells revealed that zzso of zzso zzso but not of an zzso inactive form, zzso zzso activity zzso by reporter zzso zzso selective zzso response elements zzso zzso steroid response elements zzso or the mouse zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso expression zzso by zzso impaired the zzso response to zzso In zzso the data indicate that zzso is a new zzso that binds to the zzso and stimulates the zzso response of target zzso This finding zzso the role of the zzso system in modulating the zzso zzso
