zzso zzso are small zzso zzso that contribute to zzso by acting as zzso or tumor zzso genes and may be important in the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of zzso Many zzso genes have associated zzso islands, suggesting zzso regulation of their zzso Compared with sporadic zzso the role of zzso in zzso or familial cancer is poorly zzso We investigated 96 zzso zzso 58 gastric zzso and 41 zzso zzso occurring as part of inherited DNA mismatch repair zzso zzso zzso zzso familial zzso zzso without zzso gene zzso or zzso zzso multiplex zzso probe amplification zzso zzso were developed for 11 zzso zzso that were chosen because all could be zzso regulated through the associated zzso islands and some could additionally zzso the zzso by zzso targeting the DNA zzso or their zzso zzso 2 zzso Compared with the respective normal zzso the zzso zzso in tumor zzso was increased zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 152 and zzso decreased zzso for zzso and zzso and no major change for zzso and zzso The zzso with which the individual zzso zzso were affected in tumors showed statistically significant differences relative to the tissue of origin zzso versus gastric versus zzso zzso proficiency versus zzso and sporadic versus zzso zzso In particular, zzso at zzso and zzso was associated with zzso (as opposed to zzso tumors and zzso at zzso with sporadic disease (as opposed to Lynch zzso zzso at zzso zzso correlated with zzso at classic tumor zzso promoters in the same zzso Our results highlight the importance of zzso events in zzso and sporadic zzso and suggest that zzso is an excellent choice for quantitative analysis of zzso in archival zzso zzso samples, which pose challenges to many other techniques commonly used for zzso zzso
