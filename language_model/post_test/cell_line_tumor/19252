Although zzso acid zzso a third-generation zzso zzso has been identified as an attractive therapeutic agent against breast cancer, prostate cancer, multiple myeloma as well as zzso lung cancer zzso as best as we are aware, the zzso effect of zzso upon zzso lung cancer zzso remains to be effectively zzso This study examined the effects of zzso upon the zzso tumor cell, using a zzso lung zzso cell line similar to the behavior of human lung zzso 

We investigated the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso on zzso tumor cells in zzso including cellular zzso by means of an zzso zzso zzso analysis by flow zzso and by assessing the level of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Further, we evaluated the growth and survival of zzso tumor cells following zzso treatment (1 zzso using an animal zzso We also examined the in zzso zzso pattern using zzso zzso cells zzso 

zzso significantly slowed the zzso tumor growth in a zzso manner in zzso The treated zzso tumor cells typically arrested at the zzso of the zzso following zzso exposure, but no zzso cells could be detected by either zzso zzso or zzso zzso When the zzso was washed out, the zzso cells continued to zzso again and the zzso zzso zzso earlier by the drug, then zzso Within zzso h following drug zzso the zzso of the treated cells revealed a similar distribution to that of the zzso zzso In zzso studies demonstrated that zzso significantly slowed the zzso tumor zzso Indeed, mice lived significantly longer when they had been zzso than was the case for zzso mice ( zzso Using zzso cells, the in zzso zzso distribution of zzso tumor cells subsequent to zzso exposure revealed zzso arrest that was identical to the in zzso zzso 

zzso maintains the potential to reduce tumor burden and prolong survival for zzso pulmonary zzso The flow zzso analysis of zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso no zzso but is able to arrest zzso tumor cells at the zzso Although the clinical relevance of these results warrants zzso for human lung cancer patients, zzso combined with chemotherapy and/or zzso appears to be a new therapeutic strategy for the effective treatment of zzso
