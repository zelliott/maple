Although the zzso zzso has been shown to be the zzso genetic aberration in chronic zzso leukemia zzso there is mounting evidence that the deregulation of other zzso such as the zzso factor zzso regulatory factor 4 zzso is also implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso target sites or direct zzso of genes are mechanisms of a zzso or permanent zzso of gene zzso zzso zzso we investigated whether zzso promoter zzso or zzso may be involved in the regulation of zzso expression in leukemia zzso Whereas promoter zzso or structural zzso could be excluded as a cause of altered zzso expression in zzso cells, the zzso promoter zzso status was found to significantly influence zzso zzso First, treatment of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines with the zzso zzso resulted in a zzso and zzso increase of zzso zzso and protein zzso Second, using a zzso and zzso we identified specifically zzso zzso sites in zzso but not in zzso zzso Third, we clearly determined promoter zzso as a mechanism for zzso zzso via reporter gene zzso but did not detect an association of zzso status and zzso expression of DNA zzso or zzso zzso Together, these data suggest zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso as a putative mechanism of zzso zzso expression in zzso
