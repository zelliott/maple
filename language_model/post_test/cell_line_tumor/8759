Natural killer zzso cells are important zzso of zzso immunity and are active against several zzso zzso including multiple myeloma zzso zzso zzso blood zzso is a promising source of zzso zzso cells but large scale ex zzso expansion is required for generation of clinically relevant zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Here we describe a novel strategy for expanding zzso cells from zzso CB units using artificial zzso presenting zzso cells zzso in a gas permeable culture zzso After 14 days, mean fold expansion of zzso cells was zzso from fresh and zzso from zzso CB with zzso purity for zzso cells zzso and less than zzso zzso zzso Though surface expression of some zzso receptors was zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited a zzso similar to zzso cells expanded with zzso alone with respect to various zzso zzso zzso and zzso and maintained strong expression of zzso factors zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso cells formed functional immune zzso with and demonstrated zzso against various zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso cells showed significant in zzso activity against zzso in a zzso mouse zzso Our findings introduce a clinically zzso strategy for the generation of highly functional zzso cells which can be used to eradicate zzso
