Cancer stem cells zzso are capable of continuous proliferation and zzso and are proposed to play significant roles in zzso tumor growth, zzso and cancer zzso zzso are considered derived from normal stem cells affected by the tumor zzso although the mechanism of development is not clear zzso In 2007, zzso group succeeded in generating zzso mouse induced zzso stem zzso cells, in which green fluorescent protein zzso has been inserted into the zzso region of the zzso zzso Usually, zzso cells, just like embryonic stem cells, are considered to be induced into zzso cells, which differentiate into various normal zzso depending on the normal zzso We hypothesized that zzso could be derived from zzso zzso cells in the zzso culture medium of cancer cell lines, which is a mimic of zzso zzso As a result, the zzso zzso cells treated with the zzso medium of mouse Lewis lung zzso acquired characteristics of zzso in that they formed zzso expressing zzso in suspension culture, and had a high zzso in zzso nude mice exhibiting zzso in zzso In addition, these zzso zzso had a capacity of zzso and expressed the marker zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso associated with stem cell properties and an zzso zzso Thus we concluded that a model of zzso was originally developed from zzso cells and proposed the zzso culture medium of cancer cell lines might perform as niche for producing zzso The model of zzso and the procedure of their establishment will help study the genetic zzso and the zzso factors in the tumor zzso which convert zzso cells to zzso Furthermore, the identification of potentially bona fide markers of zzso which will help the development of novel zzso therapies, might be possible though the zzso zzso
