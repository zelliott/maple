T zzso zzso of which zzso B is a key mediator, is believed to contribute to the zzso of inflammatory vascular zzso In this report, we investigate the mechanism of zzso zzso smooth muscle cell zzso zzso 

The addition of zzso zzso B alone to cultured zzso caused a significant reduction in cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and membrane zzso were observed, indicating that the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso death was through zzso zzso zzso from zzso mice induced zzso death through a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso activities of zzso and zzso B prevented zzso zzso zzso death, whereas zzso of zzso B zzso with zzso zzso did zzso Further, zzso B induced the zzso of several zzso zzso zzso including zzso and reduced focal zzso zzso zzso 

These results indicate that zzso B can induce zzso of zzso in the absence of zzso by zzso zzso zzso such as zzso
