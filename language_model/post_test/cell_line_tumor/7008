The objective of this study was to investigate the key genetic changes and molecular mechanisms in the process of invasion and zzso of human zzso zzso zzso The in zzso invasion zzso was used to further testify that the human zzso zzso cancer cell line zzso is more invasive and zzso compared with its parental line zzso A total of 17,000 human zzso complementary DNA zzso were used to compare the gene expression patterns of the two cell zzso zzso zzso chain reactions and Western zzso were performed to validate the results of the zzso zzso zzso twofold zzso expressed genes were screened out by 17,000 human zzso complementary DNA zzso between the two cell lines, including some important genes such as, zzso zzso and other unknown genes or expressed sequence tags with remarkable fold zzso The results of the zzso experiment were further confirmed by reverse zzso chain reactions and Western zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is more invasive and zzso than its parental zzso The invasion and zzso mechanism of zzso zzso cancer is a very complex process in which many important genes like zzso zzso as well as other unknown genes or expressed sequence tags were zzso
