zzso effects on zzso zzso and breast cancer zzso cells are zzso by the nuclear receptors zzso and zzso zzso factors that display functional antagonism with each other, with zzso acting as zzso and interfering with the effects of zzso on cell zzso tumor promotion and zzso Indeed, zzso zzso BC cells often lack zzso which when present associates with a less aggressive clinical zzso of the zzso Recent zzso point to a significant role of zzso zzso in zzso where specific zzso expression profiles associate with distinct clinical and biological zzso of the zzso Considering the possibility that zzso might influence BC cell behavior via zzso we compared zzso expression in zzso vs zzso zzso BC cells and found a widespread effect of this zzso zzso on the expression pattern of these zzso zzso More importantly, the expression pattern of 67 zzso including 10 regulated by zzso in BC cells, clearly zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dissection of zzso zzso revealed multiple mechanisms for direct regulation of this process by zzso in BC cell zzso In particular, zzso zzso zzso by binding to two specific sites zzso to the gene and thereby zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso promotes zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the cell by binding in close proximity of the corresponding gene cluster and preventing in zzso the zzso effects of zzso on zzso maturation by the zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that cell autonomous regulation of zzso expression is part of the mechanism of action of zzso in BC cells and could contribute to establishment or maintenance of a less aggressive tumor zzso zzso by this nuclear zzso
