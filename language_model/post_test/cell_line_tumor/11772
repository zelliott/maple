zzso zzso the zzso agent for zzso disease, is ubiquitous in the zzso environment, where it replicates as an zzso zzso of zzso zzso Our understanding of zzso zzso zzso is obtained mostly from study of derivatives of several clinical zzso which employ almost identical virulent zzso to exploit host zzso To determine whether environmental zzso zzso zzso interact similarly with the model host systems, we analyzed zzso replication of several recently isolated such strains and found that these strains cannot zzso grow in bone zzso zzso of zzso mice, which are zzso for all examined laboratory zzso By focusing on one strain called zzso we found that its zzso in zzso replication in primary zzso zzso is not caused by the lack of important zzso zzso because this strain replicates zzso in two zzso hosts and the human zzso zzso zzso We also found that in the early phase of infection, the trafficking of this strain in zzso zzso is similar to that of zzso a zzso of strain Philadelphia zzso Furthermore, infection of these cells by zzso caused extensive cell death in a process that requires the zzso type IV zzso zzso Finally, we showed that the cell death is caused neither by the zzso of the zzso zzso nor by the recently described zzso zzso zzso Our results revealed that some environmental zzso zzso strains are unable to overcome the defense zzso by primary zzso from mice known to be zzso for laboratory zzso zzso zzso These results also suggest the existence of a host immune surveillance mechanism differing from those currently known in responding to zzso zzso zzso
