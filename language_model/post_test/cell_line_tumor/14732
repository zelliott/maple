The loss of zzso and the gain of zzso expression are known as zzso zzso zzso switching is a major hallmark of zzso transition zzso zzso is a crucial process in cancer zzso providing cancer cells with the ability to escape from the primary focus, to invade zzso zzso and to migrate to distant zzso Although zzso of zzso is well known in various zzso there are a few studies on zzso expression in zzso Here, therefore, we investigated whether zzso expression was associated with the progression of head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso First, we examined the expression of zzso by zzso and its correlation with zzso zzso High expression of zzso was observed in 52 of 80 zzso cases and was significantly correlated with zzso zzso Next, we examined the correlation between zzso and zzso zzso switching zzso expression of zzso and low expression of zzso was found in 30 of 80 zzso cases and was well correlated with zzso zzso pattern of invasion and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, we examined the expression of zzso and zzso by zzso in 16 zzso cell lines to confirm the zzso zzso zzso expression was observed in 7 of 16 zzso cells, and zzso switching was observed in 2 zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso cells with zzso switching have zzso zzso In conclusion, we suggest that zzso zzso may play an important role in zzso behaviors of zzso and zzso zzso switching might be considered as a discrete critical event in zzso and zzso potential of zzso
