The zzso zzso the product of an alternate reading frame of the zzso locus on human zzso zzso zzso the ability of zzso to target zzso for zzso degradation and causes an increase in zzso zzso levels, leading to a zzso and zzso arrest of cells in the cell zzso Although much is known about the function of zzso in the zzso pathway, not as much is known about its function in human tumor growth and zzso independently of zzso of zzso protein zzso To learn more about its effect on cellular proliferation and zzso independent of zzso zzso human zzso zzso cells zzso for zzso and harboring a defective zzso zzso were zzso zzso with zzso zzso under the tight control of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso caused a decrease in cell proliferation rate and colony formation and a marked decrease in the level of zzso zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso protein levels was specific, because zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein levels were not decreased nor were zzso or zzso protein levels zzso The decrease in zzso protein was abolished when the cells were treated with the zzso inhibitor zzso demonstrating that zzso zzso zzso degradation of the zzso Surprisingly, induction of zzso increased resistance to the folate zzso methotrexate, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in the medium reversed this resistance, indicating that zzso induction increases the reliance of these cells on zzso zzso
