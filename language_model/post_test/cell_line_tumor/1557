Natural killer zzso cells are an important zzso cell of innate zzso Their interaction with susceptible target cells triggers zzso cell zzso and the release of zzso zzso flow zzso zzso are now the preferred methods for measuring zzso cell zzso For these zzso assessment is made on zzso cells zzso zzso within the viable zzso gate, defined by the parameters of size zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells that have not zzso from target cells at the time of zzso or that have undergone target zzso zzso are excluded from the viable zzso gate and therefore from zzso This unit describes a protocol for assessing zzso cell function in response to target cells (both natural killing and zzso cell zzso based on the loss of zzso cells from the zzso zzso This zzso zzso loss zzso should provide a sensitive measure of zzso cell responses in a clinical laboratory zzso
