We have previously reported that the major zzso of zzso expressed in zzso breast cancer cells was a truncated zzso zzso transcribed from zzso 21 zzso zzso This zzso zzso the active form of zzso and increased breast cancer cell zzso Since expression of the zzso and soluble zzso zzso of zzso is activated by zzso zzso we wondered whether the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was also dependent on zzso zzso We report here that the expression of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells is zzso by the zzso inhibitor zzso In addition, treatment of zzso cells with zzso specific for zzso and zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso In agreement with these findings, zzso and zzso breast cancer cells, cultured on dishes coated with zzso human zzso zzso domain, express higher levels of zzso zzso In cancer cells, zzso is a target of the zzso zzso family zzso In zzso breast cancer cells, the truncated zzso zzso zzso zzso is also zzso regulated by zzso zzso acid interferes zzso zzso expression by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso breast cancer cells with both a zzso inhibitor and zzso acid suppresses the expression of zzso zzso providing a new mechanism to explain the effectiveness of this therapeutic zzso
