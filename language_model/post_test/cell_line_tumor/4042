zzso zzso which is zzso produced in the brain, has an important role in maintaining brain cholesterol zzso We have previously reported that zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms by which zzso cell death zzso We found that zzso droplets formed at the early stages in the treatment of zzso cells with zzso These zzso droplets could be almost completely eliminated by treatment with a specific inhibitor or by zzso zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso In association with disappearance of zzso zzso cell viability was recovered by treatment with the inhibitor or zzso for zzso Using gas zzso zzso we confirmed that zzso cells exhibited zzso of zzso zzso but not of zzso zzso and confirmed that zzso of zzso zzso was reduced when zzso was zzso zzso induced zzso in zzso zzso cells, which zzso expressed zzso but did not induce zzso in zzso cells, which expressed no zzso In zzso cells treated with the zzso inhibitor zzso and in zzso zzso cells, zzso was found to induce zzso cell death, and this was partially but significantly inhibited by zzso Similarly, zzso of zzso protein zzso 3, which is one of the essential zzso for zzso significantly suppressed zzso cell death in zzso cells treated with zzso These results suggest that zzso can induce zzso or zzso which of the two is induced being determined by zzso zzso Regardless of the presence or absence of zzso zzso treatment induced the formation of zzso droplets and cell death in zzso cells, and this was suppressed by treatment with zzso zzso zzso these results suggest that it is zzso zzso zzso and the resulting zzso zzso formation that is the initial key event which is responsible for zzso cell zzso
