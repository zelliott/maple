The zzso potential of cells is an important zzso in the design of optimal strategies for the personalized treatment of zzso Using atomic force zzso zzso we show, consistent with previous studies conducted in other types of zzso cancer, that zzso cancer cells are generally zzso and display lower intrinsic zzso in cell zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso A detailed examination of highly invasive zzso cancer cells zzso zzso relative to their less invasive parental cells zzso demonstrates that zzso is also an accurate zzso of zzso zzso Comparative gene expression analyses indicate that the reduced zzso of highly zzso zzso A8 cells is associated with zzso zzso zzso and microscopic examination of zzso fiber structure in these cell lines is consistent with this zzso Our results indicate that cell zzso may be a useful zzso to evaluate the relative zzso potential of zzso and perhaps other types of cancer zzso
