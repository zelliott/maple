Increased copy numbers of zzso zzso region have been shown to occur in different zzso types and to be associated with zzso progression and with poor zzso Several genes have earlier been proposed as potential zzso at this region largely on the grounds of cell lines zzso In this study, we performed a systematic gene expression survey on 26 primary breast zzso with known zzso amplification status by quantitative real-time reverse zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso zzso is restricted to an approximately 5 zzso region in breast cancer and contains 29 known zzso Our survey revealed a statistically significant ( zzso difference between the high level and no amplification groups in a set of zzso genes whereas no difference between the moderate and the zzso zzso groups were zzso Interestingly, these 11 genes were located adjacent to one another within a zzso zzso core region in which all except one of the genes were zzso These data suggest that only high-level amplification at the zzso zzso core leads to elevated gene expression in breast zzso Moreover, our results highlight the fact that zzso zzso carries multiple candidate genes and that this may be a more common event in gene amplification than previously zzso
