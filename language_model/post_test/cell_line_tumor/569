zzso similarities exist between molecular mechanisms driving embryonic liver development and progression of zzso zzso zzso Bone zzso proteins zzso particularly zzso have been proposed to regulate embryonic zzso zzso zzso expression has been observed in zzso but the expression and biological role of zzso in human zzso are zzso We found increased zzso zzso and protein in zzso cell lines and tissue samples compared to primary human zzso and corresponding zzso zzso zzso further induced zzso expression in zzso cells, which was abolished by zzso of a dominant negative form of zzso alpha zzso zzso However, gel shift zzso revealed only minor binding activity in nuclear extracts from zzso zzso cells to a putative zzso element in the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso promoter revealed two zzso binding sites, and zzso activity was increased in zzso cells under hypoxic zzso zzso of zzso alpha completely zzso zzso zzso activity as well as zzso zzso zzso of zzso markedly enhanced zzso promoter activity, while zzso zzso almost completely abolished zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso activity contributes to baseline expression of the zzso gene and is the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso induction under hypoxic zzso To determine the functional relevance of zzso zzso zzso cell lines were treated with zzso zzso zzso or zzso against zzso zzso suppression resulted in a strong reduction of the migratory and invasive potential and zzso zzso Furthermore, tube formation zzso indicated that zzso expressed by zzso cells promotes zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso is increased in zzso and promotes zzso zzso zzso zzso expression may have clinical zzso and interfering with zzso zzso appears as an attractive therapeutic target for this highly aggressive zzso
