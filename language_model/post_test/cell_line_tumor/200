zzso zzso are common and aggressive brain tumors in zzso The rapid proliferation and diffuse brain migration are main obstacles to successful zzso Here we show that zzso a central zzso introduced clinically a century ago, is capable of suppressing proliferation and migration of zzso zzso zzso cells in a zzso zzso zzso also leads to a zzso phase cell cycle arrest accompanied by suppressed zzso cell cycle regulatory proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, noticeable zzso changes and interrupted zzso zzso assembly are induced by zzso zzso zzso signal pathways involved in the effect of zzso is concerned with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso Together, these findings suggest zzso and zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso most likely by arresting cell cycle and interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are possible signaling pathways zzso
