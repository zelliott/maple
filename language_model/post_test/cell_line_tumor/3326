To study the zzso effects of zzso targeting zzso growth factor zzso zzso on the proliferation and invasion of human zzso zzso 

Two zzso expression zzso using zzso zzso that targeted sequences of human zzso zzso L domain zzso - zzso and zzso domain zzso - zzso respectively, were zzso Human zzso zzso cells of the line zzso were cultured in zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso blank zzso zzso (as negative zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso by zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso were used to detect the zzso zzso Cell zzso was detected by zzso index zzso using zzso zzso Cell cycle was analyzed by flow zzso and cell zzso activities were measured by zzso The expression and zzso activities of zzso zzso 9 zzso were measured by Western zzso and gelatin zzso and cell invasive capabilities were evaluated by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and Western zzso showed that the expression of zzso was zzso by zzso and zzso respectively in the zzso zzso zzso groups, while zzso by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells in comparison with the zzso cells and the cells zzso with blank zzso zzso zzso showed that almost no zzso cell was found in the parental cells or the cells zzso with blank zzso however, zzso was increased in zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the S phase fraction zzso was lowered in both zzso zzso zzso cells than that in the parental cells, the cells zzso with blank zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that compared to the parental cells and the cells zzso with blank zzso the survival rates of zzso cells dramatically dropped down from the first day after zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso cells demonstrated much lower survival rate than the zzso zzso zzso zzso Meanwhile, the expression and zzso activities of zzso decreased significantly after the zzso of zzso zzso into the zzso cells compared to the zzso cells and the cells zzso with blank zzso and were much lower in the zzso groups than that in the zzso groups zzso zzso zzso Cell invasive capability zzso demonstrated the similar zzso results in the zzso zzso zzso 

Compared with zzso approach, zzso expression zzso targeting zzso specifically suppresses the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso cell growth and zzso The zzso zzso approach should be a new strategy in zzso gene therapy targeting zzso
