In order to explore the zzso effect associated with the zzso zzso several zzso acid derivatives zzso were zzso Variation in the functional group at zzso of the zzso led to set of compounds bearing zzso zzso Their chemical structures were confirmed by zzso zzso zzso and Mass zzso zzso These zzso compounds containing zzso zzso exhibits moderate to strong zzso activity in a cell cycle zzso and dose dependent manner in two different human leukemia cell zzso The importance of the electron zzso groups on zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso and zzso blue zzso and it was concluded that the 4th position of the zzso zzso ring plays a dominant role for its zzso zzso Among the zzso compounds, zzso and zzso have shown potent zzso activity on both the cell lines zzso To zzso the role of electron zzso group in the induction of zzso we have chosen two molecules zzso and zzso having different electron zzso group at different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and DNA fragmentation suggest that zzso is more zzso and able to induce the zzso
