zzso 3 zzso maintains zzso metal zzso and protects against zzso oxygen species zzso DNA zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso zzso and gene expression of the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso 

Using quantitative zzso zzso we detected unique DNA zzso profiles in the zzso promoter zzso The zzso zzso from zzso to zzso from the zzso start site zzso were highly zzso in tumor zzso and normal samples zzso whereas zzso zzso closest to the zzso zzso and zzso remained zzso in all normal and most tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso in two regions (from zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso were significantly zzso in zzso as compared to normal samples zzso zzso The DNA zzso levels from zzso to zzso zzso sites showed the strongest correlation with zzso gene expression zzso zzso Moreover, the DNA zzso from zzso to zzso zzso sites significantly correlated with advanced tumor stages and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso analysis demonstrated a more repressive zzso modification zzso and less active zzso modifications zzso zzso in zzso cells than in zzso zzso zzso with the presence of higher DNA zzso levels and zzso of zzso expression in zzso as compared to zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso restored zzso expression with zzso of its promoter region and reversal of the zzso modifications towards active zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso are characterized by frequent zzso zzso of zzso The choice of specific regions in the zzso island is a critical step in determining the functional role and zzso value of DNA zzso in cancer zzso
