The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is known as a putative tumor zzso The decreased expression of zzso has been involved in multiple primary zzso in several zzso However, its expression and function in the zzso of zzso cell cancer zzso remain zzso In this study, we investigated the expression of zzso in zzso by in zzso zzso zzso and real-time zzso chain reaction zzso Our results indicated that zzso was frequently zzso in human zzso tissue and cell lines, which involved both zzso events zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso deletion of zzso Moreover, we testified that zzso of zzso by zzso significantly promoted zzso growth, cell migration and invasion in zzso cells and zzso cancer cells zzso in zzso We further found that zzso of zzso altered the expression of focal zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities, which regulate the zzso zzso Taken together, these results strongly support that zzso may function as a tumor zzso against zzso cell cancer, and may regulate cell zzso via zzso zzso and zzso zzso reorganization in zzso
