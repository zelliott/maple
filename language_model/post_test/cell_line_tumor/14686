We have generated cell lines with significantly reduced expression of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, and used these cells to investigate zzso zzso role in zzso of breast cancer zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso with a zzso producing small interfering zzso that inhibited the expression of zzso zzso Control cells were zzso zzso with the same zzso producing zzso zzso The reduction in the zzso zzso activity caused a significant increase in the expressions of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso but eliminated the expression of zzso zzso zzso cells showed an enhanced overall growth response to zzso zzso whereas zzso plus zzso growth factor were largely ineffective growth zzso in these cells compared to zzso Although the long-term net growth rate of the zzso zzso cells was increased in response to zzso their proliferation rate was lower compared to controls in short-term zzso However, the zzso zzso cells did show a significant decreased rate of zzso after zzso treatment and a reduction in the zzso zzso of zzso tumor zzso protein compared to zzso When the zzso zzso cells were zzso into zzso zzso nude mice, their zzso was enhanced compared to control zzso Increased zzso of zzso zzso cells was caused mainly by a decrease in the zzso rate indicating that the lack of the zzso zzso caused an imbalance to increase the zzso ratio and a reduction in the activity of the zzso tumor zzso zzso
