zzso is a primary bone cancer which occurs mainly in zzso zzso is a zzso protein involved in the maintenance of zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of zzso depletion on the response of zzso cells to zzso In normal circumstances, zzso is localized at zzso which zzso to nuclear zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not affect cell viability in the absence of zzso but led to enhanced zzso in zzso zzso zzso increased the population of zzso cells by zzso in zzso cells compared to that in control zzso zzso of zzso zzso induced the expression of zzso and the zzso of zzso leading to increased zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso is required for maintaining cellular zzso and may contribute to the improved efficiency of zzso
