zzso zzso interactions play a pivotal role in the zzso of inflammatory zzso zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso zzso enhances bacterial zzso and invasion zzso zzso zzso cells zzso In this study, we designed to identify the exact mechanism of how zzso enhances the bacterial zzso on zzso in zzso As compared with wild type zzso of zzso zzso zzso binding protein zzso 21 knockout strain of zzso zzso significantly decreased the zzso to zzso cells that express zzso zzso A zzso fusion protein was produced with zzso zzso which was transformed into zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly increased the zzso but not invasion, of zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso coli was inhibited by zzso with zzso but not with other zzso After zzso zzso on zzso cells, the zzso rate of zzso zzso coli was further increased by approximately zzso zzso engineered zzso coli with a single zzso of either zzso or zzso position of zzso exhibited a decreased binding ability, and the binding was zzso diminished by the combined zzso of three zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso as compared with zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso or zzso short interfering zzso reduced the zzso of zzso zzso coli to zzso In conclusion, zzso is involved in the enhancement of zzso bacterial zzso to zzso zzso and its zzso may be required for the zzso enhancement of bacterial zzso to zzso through the zzso zzso zzso
