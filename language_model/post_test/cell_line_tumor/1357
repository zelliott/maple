Several zzso cell zzso including zzso contribute to tumor progression by inducing zzso transition zzso at the invasive front, a mechanism also linked to zzso zzso associated zzso zzso reside mainly at the invasive front but they also zzso tumors and in this process they mainly assume a tumor promoting zzso In this study, we asked if zzso also regulate zzso zzso We found that zzso through zzso signaling and zzso of the zzso zzso can induce zzso in zzso cancer zzso 

We depleted zzso in zzso bearing mice using zzso and analyzed the tumors for correlations between gene and protein expression of zzso and zzso zzso The functional relationship between zzso and zzso was characterized in zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells, using a zzso medium culture zzso The clinical relevance of our findings was evaluated on a tissue zzso cohort representing zzso patients with zzso cell lung cancer zzso 

Gene expression analysis of zzso revealed a positive correlation between zzso and zzso marker zzso Moreover, zzso showed that zzso cluster with zzso zzso cells in the zzso In zzso long term exposure of zzso zzso to zzso medium led to decreased expression of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso of the zzso zzso pathway, increased expression of zzso markers and an invasive zzso In a candidate based screen, zzso zzso was identified as the main zzso of this zzso zzso Lastly, zzso analysis of zzso patient samples identified a positive correlation between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels and tumor zzso 

Data presented here identify a novel role for zzso in zzso tumor zzso The observation that zzso cluster with zzso zzso cells suggests that the role of zzso in zzso extends beyond the invasive zzso As zzso zzso and pronounced zzso tumor zzso correlate with increased grade in zzso patients, we propose that zzso also promote tumor progression by inducing zzso locally in zzso
