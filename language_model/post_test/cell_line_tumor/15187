The purpose of this study was to assess the zzso effect of the zzso zzso extract of zzso zzso mushroom in cultures of zzso cells zzso and tumor cells zzso The cells were maintained in zzso cell culture medium added of zzso of fetal bovine serum and zzso zzso For the zzso test we prepared the zzso mushroom extract at zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso For the culture, 2 zzso zzso zzso was deposited in zzso zzso during 24 hour incubation with subsequent exchange of medium by another containing the mushroom zzso After 24 hour incubation the medium was discarded and 100 zzso of zzso blue zzso was added at a concentration of 5 zzso The zzso were incubated for 2 h at zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed using zzso zzso zzso From the values of the optical zzso we determined the drug concentration capable of reducing cell viability by zzso zzso the mushroom zzso zzso at all zzso tested, did not show zzso effects, once the zzso concentration zzso obtained for tumor cells zzso was zzso zzso and the zzso checked for zzso cells zzso was zzso zzso This test made it possible to determine that zzso zzso mushroom has no zzso effects, suggesting its use safe for human zzso
