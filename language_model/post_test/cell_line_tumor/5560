zzso evidence suggests that tumors are composed of a zzso cell population with a small subset of cancer stem cells zzso that sustain tumor formation and zzso Recently, there have been efforts to explain drug resistance of cancer cells based on the concept of zzso having an intrinsic detoxifying zzso In the present study, to investigate the role of zzso in acquiring zzso in pancreatic cancer, zzso cells were established by exposure to serially escalated doses of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells were more zzso in zzso and in zzso and had greater zzso activity than parental zzso After high-dose zzso treatment to eliminate most of the cells, zzso cells proliferated and zzso the population of resistant zzso zzso cells remained as a small subset in the resistant cell zzso Among zzso cassette (ABC) zzso which are known as the mechanism of drug resistance in zzso zzso zzso was significantly zzso during the acquisition of drug zzso ABC zzso inhibitor zzso zzso the resistant cells to zzso in a zzso manner and zzso interference of zzso inhibited the zzso activity of resistant zzso In human pancreatic cancer samples, zzso expression was correlated with zzso grade and the patients with zzso tumors showed poor zzso These data indicate that cancer zzso cells were expanded during the acquisition of zzso resistance and in therapeutic application, targeted therapy against the zzso or ABC zzso zzso could be applied to overcome drug resistance in the treatment of pancreatic zzso
