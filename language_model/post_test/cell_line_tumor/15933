The zzso domain zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso sensors of zzso molecular patterns and zzso molecular zzso A zzso of zzso can form zzso complexes, which facilitate the maturation of zzso 1 to zzso 1, leading to zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso is predominantly expressed in zzso cells and has not been studied for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso nearly eliminated zzso 1, zzso and zzso processing in response to bacterial infection, zzso molecular patterns, and zzso molecular zzso This was confirmed in primary human zzso zzso zzso together with zzso 1, zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity that showed zzso with zzso The range of pathogens that activate zzso zzso zzso with those that activate zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso associates with zzso in a zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso These results invoke a model in which zzso interacts with zzso to zzso activate the zzso
