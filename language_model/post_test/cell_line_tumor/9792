The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso has been reported as a potent zzso agent against several types of zzso The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of zzso on zzso prostate zzso using a human prostate cancer cell zzso and the transgenic rats developing zzso of the prostate zzso zzso Treatment of zzso prostate cancer cells with 500 zzso zzso resulted in zzso of viability measured on zzso zzso with induction of zzso 43 zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso Feeding of zzso roughly prepared zzso zzso to zzso from the age 3 weeks to 13 weeks resulted in significant reduction of the relative zzso areas within the zzso and zzso of the zzso in the lateral prostate zzso zzso and terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling of fragmented DNA zzso zzso cancer cells were more frequently observed in the lateral zzso treated with zzso than in the zzso These in zzso and in zzso results suggest that zzso possesses zzso activity associated with induction of zzso expression and zzso
