zzso death zzso zzso has emerged as an effective strategy for cancer zzso However, certain types of cancer cells are zzso resistant to death zzso zzso In an effort to identify agents that can sensitize cancer cells to death zzso zzso we have identified zzso a natural product with zzso activity, as shown in various zzso studies, as an effective zzso of death zzso zzso zzso alone moderately inhibited the growth of human lung cancer zzso however, when combined with tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso greater effects on decreasing cell survival and inducing zzso than TRAIL alone were observed, indicating that zzso zzso with TRAIL to enhance zzso This was also true to zzso zzso when combined with zzso zzso or an zzso zzso zzso Among several zzso proteins tested, cellular zzso protein zzso was the only one that was rapidly zzso by zzso in all of the tested cell zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso could be prevented by the zzso inhibitor zzso Moreover, zzso increased zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso by zzso its degradation through a zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso abolished the ability of zzso to enhance zzso zzso Several zzso zzso which exhibited more potent effects on zzso of zzso than zzso showed better efficacy than zzso in zzso the growth and enhancing zzso zzso as zzso zzso we conclude that zzso zzso is a key event for zzso to zzso the death zzso zzso
