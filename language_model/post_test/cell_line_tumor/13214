zzso zzso infection causes gastric zzso inflammatory responses, resulting in zzso of zzso zzso and overproduction of zzso zzso oxide zzso The authors previously demonstrated that zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, they extend the study to investigate the downstream effect of zzso on zzso zzso gastric inflammation and zzso DNA zzso 

Human gastric cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso with and without zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were treated with zzso or infected with zzso zzso zzso zzso status of zzso was examined by zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and nuclear factor zzso zzso was assessed by quantitative reverse zzso zzso Western zzso or zzso NO production and total DNA zzso zzso activity were zzso zzso 

Both zzso treatment and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso led to a decrease in zzso expression at both zzso and protein zzso Total zzso zzso activity was significantly elevated in treated cells, accounting for the observed zzso zzso zzso Increased expression of zzso was accompanied by zzso of zzso and production of NO in treated zzso Reversal of all these phenomena in cells zzso with zzso suggested zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso stimulation of the zzso zzso system, leading to zzso of zzso activity by NO zzso 

These findings reveal a previously unknown effect of zzso and NO on zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso This possible zzso indicates the role of NO in zzso modification that links inflammation to zzso
