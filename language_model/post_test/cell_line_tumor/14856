Blood zzso factor zzso zzso is zzso zzso in the liver and released into the zzso zzso of zzso to tissue factor zzso is related to the zzso potential of tumor cells, also a significant risk factor in the development of zzso zzso in patients with zzso cancer zzso It has been found that some cancer cells can produce zzso zzso However, little is known about zzso and zzso We therefore hypothesized that zzso cells may zzso zzso leading to tumor invasion and zzso 

We detected the expression of zzso protein in 55 zzso specimens by zzso zzso The zzso zzso in 45 of 55 zzso cases, 6 colon cancer cell lines and one zzso cell line was measured by real-time reverse zzso zzso zzso invasion zzso were performed to evaluate the changes of cell migration and invasion of zzso cancer cells in zzso We further observed the likely zzso regulated by the zzso complex Western zzso zzso 

zzso synthesis of zzso was detected in the zzso of 32 zzso zzso specimens by zzso but not in normal zzso Liver zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso staging zzso zzso zzso were significantly correlated with zzso zzso zzso The positive ratios in stages I, II, III and IV were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso in zzso with zzso zzso was significantly higher than zzso without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a slight increase zzso in the number of zzso cells, which was inhibited by the specific zzso zzso The formation of zzso complex resulted in a marked increase in the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso synthesis of zzso by zzso cells may promote tumor invasion and zzso zzso as downstream zzso of zzso zzso facilitate the development of zzso in colon zzso
