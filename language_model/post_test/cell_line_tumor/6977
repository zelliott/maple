The aims of this study was to investigate whether zzso is able to exert zzso effect on zzso or stimulate the zzso of zzso zzso cell line was used for zzso consumption zzso zzso At moderate high zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells was increased by zzso to zzso with zzso 1 zzso zzso to 1 zzso zzso zzso which was comparable to that with 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso decreased as the zzso concentration of medium zzso The zzso potency was reached in the presence of zzso zzso zzso and the effect was disappeared as the zzso consumption was increased to zzso zzso This effect was independent on insulin zzso which was similar to that of zzso and was different from that of zzso whose zzso effect was zzso zzso had a better zzso potency than zzso when insulin was zzso zzso a significant toxicity of zzso to zzso cells was zzso zzso cells were not zzso by zzso that is, no zzso effect of zzso was zzso The results indicate that zzso is able to exert the zzso effect in zzso which is zzso but has no effect on insulin zzso
