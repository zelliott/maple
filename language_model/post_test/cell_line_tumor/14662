zzso peptides zzso can be used for zzso delivery of a broad variety of zzso including various zzso pharmaceutical zzso However, the zzso nature of all zzso zzso and thus lack of cell zzso limits their in zzso use for drug delivery zzso Here, we have devised and tested a strategy for zzso delivery of zzso and drugs into cancer cells by using zzso bearing a light activated zzso zzso zzso The positive charge of zzso zzso on the minimum sequence of the zzso zzso zzso was masked with zzso groups to minimize zzso zzso and cellular zzso Once illuminated by zzso light, these protecting groups were zzso the positively charged zzso regained its activity and facilitated rapid zzso delivery of the zzso or zzso zzso into cancer zzso We have found that a zzso light zzso time was sufficient to enhance the penetration of the zzso zzso bearing the zzso zzso zzso into zzso of the target cells, and to promote a zzso like zzso activity resulting a shift from zzso to zzso in cell viability after 2 zzso This report provides an example for tumor targeting by means of light zzso of zzso peptides for zzso drug zzso
