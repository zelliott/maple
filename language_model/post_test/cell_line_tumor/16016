zzso zzso zzso the first zzso zzso of zzso zzso was found to be associated with cell growth, proliferation and zzso zzso gene expression in gastric cancer was increased and its level was positively correlated with the degree of zzso of gastric zzso and development of gastric zzso In order to evaluate the therapeutic effects of zzso zzso of zzso on gastric cancer, an zzso zzso of zzso expressing zzso zzso which delivered a 120 zzso zzso complementary to the initiation zzso of zzso gene was constructed and zzso to gastric cancer cells zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in gastric cancer cells was determined by western zzso Cell proliferation was assessed by zzso zzso Cell cycle was analyzed by flow zzso and zzso zzso was performed to assess the ability of gastric cancer cell zzso The results showed that the zzso gene expression in gastric cancer cells zzso with the zzso was zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation was suppressed significantly, and cell cycle was arrested at zzso zzso zzso cancer cells had reduced zzso after gene zzso Our study suggested that zzso zzso of zzso expressing zzso zzso had zzso activity by zzso the expression of zzso and zzso of zzso expression using a gene therapy approach might be a novel therapeutic strategy for gastric zzso
