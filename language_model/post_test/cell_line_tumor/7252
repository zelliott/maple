Treatment of zzso cells with zzso drugs zzso including zzso zzso and zzso induced distinct structural changes, such as zzso of the cells with zzso zzso of zzso when the cells were treated for up to 10 zzso When the incubation time with zzso was longer than 10 zzso zzso cells appeared, and their population increased with zzso In this study zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the nucleus that had lost the nuclear membrane was zzso This observation was distinct from that reported in the zzso zzso were aligned in a few zzso the occurrence of zzso in even a single line is an extreme case, resulting in one plane of section for electron zzso zzso reconstructions of zzso microscopic images of zzso revealed that they were assembled as a zzso zzso The majority of the cells with zzso zzso of zzso remained intact for up to 24 zzso zzso were observed to be clustered around the nucleus in the zzso zzso or in some cases they were moderately condensed, as observed electron zzso zzso V and zzso double zzso of cells showed that more than zzso of cells were zzso In the case of treatment with zzso membrane potential of zzso per cell was well maintained although it was moderately lowered in the case of treatment with zzso Taking into consideration the previous data reported from our laboratory, the present results may assist in zzso of the zzso of zzso during the dividing processes of zzso cells, which is yet to be zzso
