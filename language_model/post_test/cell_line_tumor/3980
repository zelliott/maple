zzso zzso are directly involved in cancer zzso progression and zzso zzso of zzso expression in cancer tissue may be reflected in zzso attempted to investigate the expression and clinical significance of plasma zzso zzso and zzso in patients with zzso cell lung cancer zzso The plasma levels of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso patients and zzso healthy controls zzso zzso evaluated and compared among various zzso zzso The relationship between zzso expression and clinical outcome of zzso patients was examined in an independent cohort zzso cases and 53 zzso The expression level of zzso in tissue was also zzso Plasma zzso levels in zzso patients were significantly decreased in both patient zzso zzso b zzso In addition, patients with zzso zzso had lower plasma zzso expression than those with zzso zzso zzso b zzso Survival analysis showed that patients with low zzso expression had worse overall survival rates than those with high zzso expression zzso ratios zzso zzso zzso This association was independently validated in a separate cohort of 53 zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression level of zzso was also found to be significantly zzso in zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso b zzso These findings indicate that zzso has an important role in zzso initiation and zzso and may be an independent poor zzso factor in zzso zzso
