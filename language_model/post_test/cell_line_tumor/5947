Both zzso acid zzso and zzso A zzso exhibit potent zzso activity through distinct mechanisms of zzso zzso However, it is unknown whether a combination of these two compounds results in a synergistic zzso effect on pancreatic cancer growth and/or has a therapeutic advantage over zzso In zzso mouse models of human pancreatic cancer, treatment with either BA or zzso alone showed zzso zzso activity but led to systemic side effects as measured by overall weight zzso Treatment with a nontoxic dose of either compound alone had only marginal zzso zzso zzso combination treatment with nontoxic doses of BA and zzso produced synergistic zzso activity, including zzso effects on cell zzso invasion, and zzso The treatment combination also produced less discernible side effects than therapeutic doses of zzso Moreover, combined treatment of BA and zzso resulted in drastic zzso of zzso recruitment onto zzso and zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso rendered tumor cells resistant to BA, zzso and the combination of the zzso Overall, our findings argue that zzso is an important target of BA and zzso and that their combination can produce an enhanced therapeutic response in human pancreatic zzso
