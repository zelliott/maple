zzso zzso zzso such as zzso have demonstrated clinical efficacy in zzso breast zzso By profiling nearly 700 human cancer cell lines, we identified a subset of zzso amplified cancer cells with striking sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso from head and neck zzso These cells were found to depend on a zzso zzso zzso loop driving zzso zzso which can be disrupted by zzso zzso zzso expression and activated zzso are strongly associated with zzso sensitivity zzso and these zzso were enriched in a subset of primary head and neck cancer zzso The findings suggest that patients with zzso tumors lacking zzso amplification may derive significant clinical benefit from zzso zzso
