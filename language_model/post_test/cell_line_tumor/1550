zzso zzso of promoter zzso islands is a major zzso mechanism of zzso genes that play a crucial role in the progression of zzso in human zzso including zzso zzso zzso We have examined the promoter zzso status of five important DNA damage response genes in zzso zzso zzso and cell lines, as well as the possible correlation between zzso patterns and clinical features of the zzso zzso zzso status of zzso zzso association domain family 1), zzso zzso with zzso and ring finger zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) were examined by the MSP zzso zzso in 70 zzso zzso and five zzso cell zzso The zzso expression levels of these genes were measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of these genes tested in zzso were 54 zzso for zzso 30 zzso for zzso 26 zzso for zzso and 22 zzso for zzso No zzso was detected for zzso in any case of zzso or zzso cell zzso Moreover, promoter zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in both zzso and zzso cells, and zzso of zzso in zzso cells, were zzso Treatment of three cell lines with zzso zzso restored or increased the expression of these zzso implicating zzso DNA zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and patient age were significantly zzso zzso zzso status showed a statistically significant correlation with zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes seem therefore to play an important role in the zzso of zzso These zzso changes may have zzso importance for patients with zzso
