zzso on zzso proteins is a common feature of cancer cells and provides a therapeutic zzso zzso is an zzso of zzso zzso proteins and therefore is a good predictor of zzso zzso Surprisingly, analysis of zzso multiple myeloma cell lines revealed zzso on zzso in half the cells zzso zzso is not predicted by the expression level of zzso zzso rather through interactions with zzso zzso with these findings, acquired resistance to zzso results in loss of zzso through zzso of zzso to zzso Overall, these results suggest that complex zzso and not simply expression patterns of zzso zzso need to be investigated to understand zzso dependence and how to better use agents, such as zzso
