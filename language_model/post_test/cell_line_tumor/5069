The zzso resistance zzso zzso is characterized by the zzso of a few transport proteins at the plasma membrane level, one of which is the breast cancer resistance protein zzso These proteins are expressed in zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso barrier, and are involved in the transport of drugs and zzso zzso Because some of these proteins are expressed in the zzso this study was designed to determine whether zzso is expressed at a zzso level and to investigate its function in various zzso and parental zzso cell zzso By using Western zzso analysis, zzso zzso and electron zzso flow zzso analysis, and the zzso zzso small interfering zzso these experiments showed that zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso in which it is functionally zzso zzso zzso was significantly reduced in zzso and in cells that zzso zzso in comparison to parental zzso zzso The specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso of zzso significantly in comparison with zzso conditions in both whole cells and in zzso of zzso cell zzso In conclusion, this study shows that zzso is zzso and functionally active in the zzso of zzso cancer cell zzso However, its presence in the zzso of parental zzso cells suggests that zzso can be involved in the physiology of cancer zzso
