The effect of zzso on levels of DNA damage and global DNA zzso was examined in lung zzso zzso zzso DNA damage was assessed by the zzso gel zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso status by the zzso extension zzso zzso exposed to zzso radiation zzso 1, 2, 4, or 8 zzso showed increasing rates of percentage of DNA in the tail and tail length with increasing radiation zzso When cells were exposed to room air zzso for 1 day and zzso zzso zzso for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 days, data indicated that zzso caused zzso increases in levels of zzso single strand breaks, zzso double strand breaks, and zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso also was observed at day 5 of zzso exposure, suggesting that zzso DNA damage can influence patterns of DNA zzso in a zzso cell zzso
