To facilitate the evaluation of zzso zzso zzso 2) as a cancer target, the in zzso and in zzso properties of zzso zzso and a water soluble zzso zzso were zzso zzso selectively inhibited the growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso required to inhibit cell growth by zzso 14 zzso versus zzso zzso and was more zzso in zzso zzso or zzso versus zzso zzso cells zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso 1 zzso deficient cells zzso In zzso cells zzso induced a zzso arrest, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for a zzso zzso The zzso zzso rapidly generated zzso in zzso in mouse zzso and zzso zzso levels in zzso consistent with activity in zzso Eight or 12 hourly dosing of 120 zzso zzso for 10 days was well tolerated in zzso zzso mice and inhibited zzso zzso in zzso zzso Two (8 hourly zzso and 3 (12 hourly zzso day zzso growth delay was observed zzso and zzso zzso following zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso have pharmacological properties consistent with zzso zzso and represent useful tool molecules for the evaluation of zzso as a target in zzso
