Breast cancer is a zzso cancer, and the presence of zzso zzso alpha zzso in tumors is used clinically to predict the likelihood of response to hormonal zzso The clinical value of the second recently identified zzso zzso called zzso is less clear, and there is currently conflicting data concerning its potential role as a zzso or zzso zzso 

To assess whether zzso expression is associated with clinical outcome, protein levels were measured by zzso analysis of a retrospective bank of tumor cell zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso A total of 119 received no zzso therapy, and 186 were treated with tamoxifen zzso The median follow-up time was 65 zzso zzso and zzso Cox zzso modeling was done to assess the zzso and zzso significance of zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso protein did not correlate significantly with any other clinical zzso including zzso and zzso levels (as measured zzso binding zzso tumor size, age, or zzso zzso zzso In the zzso population, those patients whose tumors who expressed both zzso zzso exhibited the most favorable outcome as compared with those patients who had lost zzso zzso However, there was no association between zzso levels alone and either zzso or overall survival in the zzso patient zzso In contrast, in both zzso and zzso zzso high levels of zzso predicted an improved zzso and overall survival in patients treated with zzso tamoxifen zzso 

These findings provide evidence that zzso may be an independent predictor of response to tamoxifen in breast zzso Furthermore, these results suggest that zzso may influence tumor progression in ways different from those zzso by the zzso zzso
