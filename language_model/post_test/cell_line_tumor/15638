zzso cell zzso is necessary for zzso cell proliferation and zzso which is a major zzso in zzso zzso In this study, we compared two novel, structurally similar, zzso zzso zzso compounds having different zzso zzso for their zzso of zzso cell proliferation and induction of zzso on functionally relevant zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso was specific for zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso antagonized zzso zzso zzso and zzso Both compounds were potent zzso of zzso cell zzso when zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso which was dependent on the ability to induce cell zzso However, with zzso cells zzso on zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso only zzso was able to significantly prevent growth and induce zzso This effect was not dependent on the induction of zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso revealed that zzso of zzso was not required for the ability of zzso to induce zzso However, the zzso of growth zzso zzso cell zzso required zzso and correlated with zzso potent zzso of zzso cell attachment to zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso to zzso collagen required zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso In addition, zzso exerted a significant zzso of zzso zzso in the chick zzso membrane in zzso These results suggest that zzso antagonism of both zzso and zzso are important for zzso induction of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso collagen interactions required for zzso
