zzso zzso zzso zzso are additive flame zzso that have been found in the environment as well as human zzso Environmental zzso of these compounds have been increasing in many parts of the world in recent zzso Due to their structural zzso zzso are believed to have similar toxicity to zzso but their zzso properties are still being zzso In this study, the zzso effects of zzso zzso and/or zzso derivatives of zzso were assessed at both the gene and zzso levels in the zzso human zzso zzso cell zzso The expression levels of 10 zzso genes were measured using quantitative real-time zzso zzso zzso activity in the cells and sex steroid zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the culture medium were also zzso zzso which regulates the synthesis of zzso was the most sensitive gene and was induced by most of the compounds tested in this zzso zzso gene zzso zzso activity, and zzso production were also affected by several zzso but no consistent relationship was observed between these zzso Several zzso zzso showed some potential ability to interfere with zzso including zzso a biologically relevant zzso zzso which significantly decreased zzso activity and zzso production at a concentration of 10 zzso The results of this study indicate that zzso zzso affect zzso in zzso and that they may have the potential to affect zzso and reproduction in whole zzso
