zzso zzso zzso are emerging novel new zzso for zzso diagnosis and therapeutic intervention of zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso has the highest expression in normal brain among other zzso Although its expression has been extensively studied in many types of cancer and in neurodegenerative diseases, very little is known for its expression in zzso zzso In the present study, 73 zzso tumor samples were examined for zzso zzso zzso acid zzso gene expression using quantitative real-time zzso chain zzso zzso analysis revealed the significant association of zzso expression with clinical and pathological zzso zzso information was available for a median time of 20 months zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed more frequently in tumors of high zzso like the zzso zzso zzso and less in tumors of low zzso like the zzso zzso zzso zzso positive expression is associated with tumor grade zzso zzso zzso zzso status zzso zzso zzso and tumor zzso type zzso zzso zzso Cox zzso hazard zzso model using zzso analysis revealed for the first time that positive zzso expression is a significant factor for zzso survival zzso p zzso zzso of patients suffering from zzso zzso zzso survival zzso demonstrated that negative zzso expression is significantly associated with longer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression may have clinical utility as a marker of zzso prognosis for zzso tumors, and consequently, it could be used as target for therapeutic zzso
