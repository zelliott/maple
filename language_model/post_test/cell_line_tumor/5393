Gold zzso compounds have exhibited favorable zzso properties both in zzso and in zzso In a previous study, the authors reported that the novel gold zzso complex zzso zzso zzso exhibited strong zzso in some tumor cell zzso In the current study, the effect of gold zzso was investigated on colon cancer zzso 

The zzso of gold zzso was determined by using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to detect zzso and cell zzso The expression of protein was evaluated by Western zzso zzso zzso growth in zzso was evaluated in nude zzso 

Gold zzso exhibited marked zzso effects in zzso to human colon cancer, and the concentration of drug required to inhibit cell growth by 50% compared with control zzso values ranged from zzso zzso to zzso zzso which represented zzso to zzso greater potency than that of zzso Gold zzso significantly induced zzso and cell cycle arrest and zzso zzso 3, zzso 7, and zzso zzso released zzso C, and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso injection of gold zzso at doses of zzso zzso and zzso zzso significantly inhibited tumor cell zzso induced zzso and suppressed colon cancer tumor zzso An acute zzso study indicated that gold zzso at effective zzso zzso did not cause any toxic side effects in zzso 

The current results suggested that gold zzso may be a new potential therapeutic drug for colon zzso
