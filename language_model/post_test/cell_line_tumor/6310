A series of zzso complexes of the potent DNA minor groove zzso zzso zzso were prepared from a series of zzso zzso zzso The final zzso complexes carried formal overall charges ranging from zzso to zzso and showed limited improvements in zzso They showed similar zzso to that of the complex with the zzso zzso zzso and large but variable zzso of the zzso of the free zzso zzso compared to zzso for the zzso zzso However, they had zzso ratios zzso comparable to that of the zzso zzso complex zzso
