zzso zzso status is an imperfect predictor of sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cancer, motivating efforts to identify novel molecular aberrations driving zzso This study aimed to build a quantitative zzso of zzso zzso activity to zzso uncover molecular surrogates of zzso activity specific to zzso cancer, zzso improve the prediction of zzso response in patients, and zzso suggest new treatment zzso 

A model of zzso zzso activity was trained in a large zzso cancer zzso and validated in three independent zzso cancer patient zzso Novel molecular traits were zzso from The Cancer Genome zzso zzso cancer zzso The ability of the zzso model to predict resistance to zzso was tested in mouse zzso and three independent patient zzso Drug sensitivity correlations between our model and large cell line compendiums were zzso 

The performance of the zzso model was remarkably robust across three validation zzso zzso Our model confirmed the zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso patients, and suggests novel molecular traits driving its zzso zzso zzso loss, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It improved the prediction of response and zzso survival zzso zzso P zzso zzso to zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso and patient zzso zzso Our model consistently predicted sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in two cell panel zzso 

Modeling the zzso zzso in zzso cancer allows for the robust interrogation of zzso zzso activity across cell lines, zzso and patient zzso It demonstrates clinical utility in predicting response to zzso agents and zzso zzso
