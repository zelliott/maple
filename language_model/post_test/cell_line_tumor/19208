zzso zzso drug transport may lead to a zzso resistance zzso often associated with a poor response to the successful treatment of a variety of human zzso Several agents have been found to zzso zzso drug resistance, most probably by blocking its transport zzso The aim of this study was to examine the effects of some zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso able to bind to zzso in zzso on its transport function and zzso activity in the human cancer cell line, zzso The toxicity of the zzso drugs towards zzso cells was first evaluated and the non toxic drugs zzso were used to assess the drug zzso and the zzso zzso Using the flow zzso approach, the zzso and zzso of zzso were followed by measuring the zzso associated geometric mean zzso zzso zzso was employed as a comparative zzso zzso zzso was able to inhibit the zzso zzso in zzso zzso activity determined by a zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso the zzso zzso activity, indicating zzso between drug transport and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso behaved as zzso of the zzso zzso activity, suggesting a role as transported zzso and did not interfere in the zzso zzso
