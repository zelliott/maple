In the cancer stem cell model a cell hierarchy has been suggested as an explanation for zzso zzso and tumor formation is thought to be driven by this tumor cell zzso The identification of cancer stem cells in zzso zzso and the biological processes zzso in this cell zzso also known as zzso cells zzso may provide new therapeutic zzso The goal of this study, therefore, was to identify and characterize the gene expression profiles of zzso isolated from human zzso cell zzso We analyzed the zzso capacity of zzso cell lines and primary zzso tumors based upon their ability to form zzso structures zzso under zzso zzso zzso were identify from zzso cell lines using the long-term label retention dye zzso zzso zzso and the bulk of tumor cells were isolated and used to assess their ability to initiate tumors in zzso zzso Gene expression profiles of zzso zzso were obtained from fresh zzso tumor zzso We observed that increased zzso efficiency correlated with an enhanced zzso potential in zzso zzso cells were shown to constitute zzso zzso based upon their capacity to form more zzso as well as to generate both primary bone tumors and lung zzso efficiently in zzso zzso zzso profiling of zzso zzso revealed that both bone development and cell migration processes were zzso in this tumor cell zzso zzso labeling represents a valuable tool to identify zzso zzso and gene expression analysis of this tumor cell compartment may identify potential therapeutic zzso
