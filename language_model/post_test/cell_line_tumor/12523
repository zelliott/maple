The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in the zzso modification of proteins that are involved in the regulation of cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso is by far the most potent and widely investigated zzso zzso but it has modest zzso activity and may have zzso limitations due to its zzso zzso We report here that zzso can be structurally modified to give zzso that are as potent in zzso zzso but with significantly greater zzso zzso Key modifications were the replacement of the zzso side chain by zzso zzso groups, the zzso side chain by zzso and the zzso ring by zzso Moreover, these zzso have lower zzso that could lead to improved zzso zzso
