The zzso makes a significant contribution to the progression of oral zzso Many different zzso events, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the presence of specific zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso 5 are all characteristics of the tumor zzso Less is, however, known of the significance of the zzso properties of the tumor zzso The purpose of the present study was to investigate how cellular and mechanical properties of the three-dimensional collagen zzso may influence cell proliferation and invasion of oral zzso cell zzso 

zzso cancer cells were cultured in an zzso culture system on different collagen zzso and invasion was zzso Furthermore, the presence of cancer associated proteins such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso 5 was zzso 

We found that expression of zzso zzso zzso was increased in the invasive zzso of oral zzso cell zzso zzso we demonstrated that certain zzso of collagen in the zzso tissue zzso appears to stimulate zzso of oral zzso zzso
