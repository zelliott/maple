zzso zzso signaling is a highly zzso zzso and zzso communication mechanism that zzso zzso and is zzso in zzso of numerous zzso including zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso Sonic zzso and Desert zzso has been reported in zzso and zzso prostate cancer zzso In a cohort of therapy zzso zzso and long-term zzso hormone zzso zzso and zzso zzso we observed elevated zzso expression predominantly in long-term zzso specimens and elevated zzso expression predominantly in zzso zzso Together with previously demonstrated zzso signaling between zzso prostate cancer zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso zzso expression promotes zzso progression through zzso zzso signaling within the tumor zzso We tested whether the orally available zzso zzso zzso zzso could impair zzso progression of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso or zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso zzso or viability of zzso cells, zzso progression of zzso zzso was significantly delayed in animals treated with zzso In zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was substantially zzso while expression of the corresponding human zzso was zzso As zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso but are not sensitive to zzso antagonists, these studies indicate that zzso leads to delayed zzso progression of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso signaling with the tumor zzso Thus, zzso zzso signaling may offer unique opportunities for zzso zzso development, drug targeting and therapeutic response monitoring of zzso zzso
