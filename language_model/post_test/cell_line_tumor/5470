zzso lung cancer zzso is a highly aggressive disease that exhibits rapid growth and genetic zzso We found earlier frequent zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and showed that zzso cells were addicted to continued expressions of zzso and zzso major components of this zzso zzso In this study, we identified the frequent presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso which reflects continuing DNA damage, zzso in zzso zzso of RB induced zzso zzso formation in zzso cell lung cancer zzso cells with zzso zzso in association with growth zzso and zzso oxygen species zzso generation, which was canceled by zzso of zzso zzso induction of zzso was observed in a zzso zzso cell line with zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso may serve as a zzso influence to counterbalance the generation of DNA damage in zzso zzso cells, thus reducing excessive DNA damage to a tolerable level and consequently leading to genetic zzso zzso zzso may be an excellent therapeutic target candidate to elicit excessive DNA damage in combination with zzso zzso
