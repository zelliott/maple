zzso zzso zzso is a disease that responds to current treatment zzso however, patients in general zzso with increasingly zzso zzso zzso vaccines are currently under trial for the treatment of zzso These vaccines comprise the patient's zzso zzso zzso as the tumor zzso zzso to the protein carrier zzso zzso zzso zzso however, other protein carriers may enhance the immune response to the zzso zzso In this study we investigated whether an alternate carrier, zzso O zzso would amplify the immune response to Id protein and provide better protection against challenge by zzso zzso zzso The zzso vaccine compared favorably against zzso in zzso studies and both vaccines provided systemic immunity against zzso zzso However, the immune response to the two zzso was different in that zzso induced a more powerful zzso response characterized by high zzso zzso zzso zzso after one zzso and the presence of zzso cells zzso zzso In zzso studies demonstrated that immune serum contributed to the zzso efficacy seen following zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso mice, when challenged twice with zzso zzso provided better protection against challenge by the zzso loss zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso mice have more potential to develop zzso spreading than zzso In conclusion, zzso compared favorably against zzso in its zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso induced a more potent zzso and zzso immune response and promoted zzso spreading after zzso zzso Thus, zzso vaccines incorporating zzso may be a better therapeutic option for treatment of zzso zzso
