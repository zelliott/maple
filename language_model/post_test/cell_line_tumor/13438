Heat shock protein 90 zzso is an essential, zzso zzso molecular zzso Cancer cells rely on zzso to zzso zzso and/or activated zzso and its involvement in numerous signaling pathways makes it an attractive target for drug zzso Surprisingly, however, the impact of zzso zzso on cancer cells is frequently zzso in nature, and efforts to enhance the zzso activity of zzso zzso in the clinic remain a significant zzso In agreement with previous data obtained using zzso zzso we show that dual zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso causes cancer cells to undergo zzso in zzso and in zzso Gene expression profiling revealed that induction of the intrinsic zzso zzso by this drug combination coincided with zzso zzso of zzso and zzso an outcome not seen in cells treated separately with either zzso At the zzso level, expression of these two zzso as well as activated zzso was completely zzso These data support the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso cancer cells to zzso zzso they establish combined zzso zzso as a novel therapeutic zzso and they provide a zzso rationale for enhancing the zzso activity of zzso zzso
