zzso side population zzso cells can be resistant to chemotherapy and are thought to resemble cancer stem zzso We characterized the relevance of the SP zzso in zzso cancer cell lines and their relation to chemotherapy resistance and zzso The SP zzso was detected using zzso zzso zzso in five zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines were developed after long-term exposure to zzso zzso and zzso and validated by analysis of resistance zzso zzso zzso and zzso While neither zzso nor zzso had zzso SP cells, zzso zzso and zzso were found to contain varying levels of SP zzso With increasing duration of zzso or zzso therapy, the SP zzso substantially emerged in zzso and zzso zzso cells displayed significant higher zzso than zzso zzso zzso cells after subcutaneous tumor cell injection in zzso SP cells isolated from zzso and zzso were subsequently analyzed by an zzso transition zzso zzso chain reaction zzso Interestingly, the SP fraction of zzso showed a dramatic zzso of zzso genes compared to the SP fraction of zzso Our results provide evidence that zzso the proportion of SP cells is different in zzso cancer, zzso SP cells exhibit stem cell properties and are associated to chemotherapy resistance, and zzso long-term zzso selects for SP cells with an zzso zzso gene profile, which might be the source of systemic disease zzso Further investigations are necessary to zzso target these zzso SP cells in zzso zzso
