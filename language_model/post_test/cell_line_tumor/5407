The targeting of a zzso zzso zzso zzso to bind to cancer cells by zzso incorporation of a synthetic zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso G zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso was produced by expression in a zzso zzso strain and subsequent treatment with zzso zzso A zzso zzso was generated on the expressed zzso zzso by utilizing zzso processing zzso in the zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 was zzso and then zzso attached to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso using native chemical zzso The resulting chemically modified zzso fragment, zzso zzso zzso retained biological activity similar to that of the free zzso zzso zzso 1 when zzso for its ability to both promote and inhibit the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso melanoma zzso In addition, fluorescent zzso experiments were conducted using zzso 5 and confirmed binding of 5 to zzso melanoma zzso zzso modified zzso fragments such as the one described here may be used to combine the beneficial properties of synthetic zzso zzso with zzso fragments to develop useful zzso tools and improved zzso The methods described here can also be used to produce zzso fragments for the zzso synthesis of homogeneous zzso
