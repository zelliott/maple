The primary aim of this study was to zzso the role of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso factor involved in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso A real-time zzso chain reaction zzso zzso was used to zzso the zzso zzso expression levels of surgically isolated zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso 6 per zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity zzso were used to investigate the zzso zzso regulation of zzso gene zzso We observed that breast tumors with higher zzso zzso expression levels zzso a mean fold ratio in the zzso samples of greater than zzso were associated with the lowest zzso zzso survival rate zzso zzso zzso total zzso 8 patients, zzso zzso in contrast to breast tumors with low levels zzso a mean fold ratio of less than zzso of zzso expression zzso zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso Furthermore, higher zzso zzso expression levels were zzso detected in zzso tumor zzso in comparison to zzso tumor zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean fold ratios of zzso expression zzso 11 zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso fold, zzso In zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso is a major zzso factor that mediates zzso and zzso zzso of zzso gene expression in zzso zzso In conclusion, our data indicate that the zzso plays a central role in zzso zzso gene zzso in response to either nicotine or zzso zzso
