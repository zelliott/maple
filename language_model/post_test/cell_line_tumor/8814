In Alzheimer's disease zzso enhancing zzso processing of zzso precursor protein zzso is an important zzso to decrease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso is reported to be regulated by protein zzso C zzso and various zzso proteins or cell surface zzso In this report, we first examined whether zzso reduces zzso activity, and showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reduced the zzso of soluble zzso precursor protein zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (3 zzso which is a potent zzso inhibitor that prevents zzso degradation, ameliorated the zzso reduction of zzso zzso In addition, we observed that zzso significantly enhanced zzso production by zzso neutral zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso also reduced zzso zzso and in addition, zzso eliminated the observed decrease of zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso may play an important role in zzso processing by modulating zzso zzso
