zzso zzso motif protein 5) is a nuclear zzso binding protein containing 2 zzso recognition zzso The zzso gene is located at the tumor zzso locus zzso zzso of this locus is the most frequent genetic zzso in lung cancer, but is also found in other human zzso zzso is known to induce zzso and cell cycle arrest but the molecular mechanisms of zzso function are poorly zzso Here, we show that zzso is important for the activity of the tumor zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso enhanced zzso zzso of cell growth and colony zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in reporter gene zzso and resulted in increased zzso and protein levels for zzso zzso target zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of zzso zzso led to decreased zzso zzso activity and reduced levels of zzso and protein for zzso zzso target zzso zzso affected zzso but not zzso levels of zzso zzso after DNA damage suggest that zzso contributes to zzso activity through zzso zzso Our results show that zzso contributes to zzso zzso activity after DNA damage and that growth suppression and zzso zzso by zzso are linked to activity of the tumor zzso protein zzso
