zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso inhibit zzso zzso 3 zzso activity in the intact zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso directly binds zzso an interaction that is necessary for zzso zzso of zzso activity, and that zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso may scaffold zzso signaling proteins necessary for regulation of zzso zzso zzso regulation of zzso activity is also zzso zzso however, the mechanism by which zzso is involved is zzso We hypothesized that the zzso zzso of zzso might link zzso to zzso complexes to mediate zzso zzso of zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso decreased zzso activity by zzso an effect abolished with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso treatment increased the amount of active zzso as early as 1 zzso through increased zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso associated with zzso but not zzso under zzso conditions, an interaction that increased rapidly after zzso treatment and occurred before the zzso of zzso and zzso that occurred 10 zzso after zzso zzso Finally, direct binding to zzso only occurred through the zzso zzso zzso an interaction that was prevented by blocking the zzso zzso zzso This study demonstrated that zzso 1) activity is necessary for zzso zzso of zzso activity, 2) zzso occurs rapidly zzso zzso after zzso treatment, 3) directly binds zzso zzso zzso and associates zzso with zzso under elevated zzso conditions, and 4) does not directly bind zzso Under elevated zzso conditions, zzso scaffolds zzso into zzso zzso complexes before zzso of zzso from zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso
