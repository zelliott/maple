zzso cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality zzso zzso the zzso process of zzso of gastric cancer is pivotal to develop novel therapeutic zzso zzso imaging in zzso cancer models bridges the gap of zzso experiment and clinical zzso To this end, the human gastric cancer cell line zzso was established to zzso express zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso models were developed by zzso transplantation of zzso into the zzso layer of the stomach of zzso zzso zzso progression and therapeutic responses were zzso tracked by zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to monitor zzso zzso and signal changes during tumor zzso Good correlation between cell number and zzso intensity was observed zzso in zzso zzso progression and therapeutic response could be successfully followed directly by zzso zzso BLT provided a more accurate spatial location and zzso zzso of the internal zzso In conclusion, our novel zzso zzso gastric cancer models enable superior, zzso monitoring gastric cancer progression and their drug zzso The BLT technique in particular, may have great potential for future zzso zzso
