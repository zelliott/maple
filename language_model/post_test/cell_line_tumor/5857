The growth of many human breast tumors requires the zzso effect of zzso acting via the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling is therefore a clinically important target for breast cancer prevention and zzso Although extensively zzso the mechanism by which zzso promotes proliferation remains to be fully zzso We observed an zzso of transcript zzso the zzso zzso domain zzso channel zzso in a screen for genes zzso by zzso zzso in the zzso breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso zzso zzso increased starting 1 h after the onset of zzso treatment, and protein levels followed after 12 zzso zzso elements are found in the zzso region of zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed binding of zzso to the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso treated with zzso also showed increases in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso as assessed by zzso zzso These currents are blocked by zzso Although zzso zzso suggested that most of the channels are located in zzso zzso the increase in zzso currents suggests that zzso treatment increases the number of active channels at the cell zzso Application of small interfering zzso specific for zzso decreased zzso zzso currents and also reduced the zzso proliferation of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso the expression of zzso via zzso in breast cancer cells, and this channel plays a role in regulating proliferation in these cell zzso zzso may therefore represent a useful target for treatment, for example, of zzso breast zzso
