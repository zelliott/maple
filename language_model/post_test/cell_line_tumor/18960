zzso of serum from cell cultures constitutes a useful model for the study of mechanisms involved in the regulation of zzso function in zzso However, there have been several reports of changes in zzso activity that are not fully explained by the current model of zzso zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate the expected loss of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells cultured in zzso conditions, yet we also observed a paradoxical increase in zzso zzso activity in the same zzso These events corresponded with zzso of zzso the regulatory zzso of zzso to the zzso region and a local increase in zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso growth factor zzso maintained the association between zzso and the zzso zzso during serum withdrawal and restored zzso production at the plasma zzso Although this protected zzso from zzso it only slightly reversed zzso zzso These effects were not sensitive to treatment with zzso growth factor, thus zzso a generalized role for growth zzso Our data suggest that loss of growth factor zzso including zzso zzso may disrupt recruitment and/or zzso of an active zzso complex at the plasma membrane during serum withdrawal, which could account for the concurrent loss of zzso zzso
