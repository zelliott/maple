Despite the reported zzso and zzso properties of zzso zzso in colon cancer cells, the details concerning individual mechanisms and signaling zzso underlying zzso zzso remain zzso To understand different aspects of zzso zzso signaling in advanced colon zzso we investigated its mechanisms in zzso zzso cell zzso Our results indicate that in zzso cells zzso acts to induce zzso zzso including zzso response zzso whose zzso signaling is nevertheless reduced zzso to the zzso status of zzso and zzso zzso which seems to complement and enhance zzso zzso however only in zzso zzso Furthermore, both pathways require the active role of zzso and do not depend on generation of zzso making zzso an attractive zzso agent whose zzso properties should be further investigated in colon zzso
