This study was to investigate the role of the zzso signaling in zzso zzso cancer development and its mechanism in zzso zzso 

Western zzso and zzso were used to determine the expression of zzso zzso at protein and zzso levels in normal and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso were constructed as zzso zzso The role and mechanism of zzso specific inhibitor or zzso in different models before and after zzso treatment were determined by multiple cellular and molecular approaches such as cell growth zzso flow zzso and western zzso 

zzso zzso was detected in 33 out of 39 zzso zzso cancer specimens at protein level, but not detected in normal zzso zzso A significant zzso of zzso zzso at zzso level was observed in tumor zzso and an increasing trend in advanced stage was also zzso zzso zzso of the zzso signaling was detected in zzso cells and zzso zzso of zzso by zzso or zzso zzso could zzso zzso resistance through zzso zzso 

The zzso signaling was involved in zzso zzso cancer development and zzso chemotherapy, and zzso of zzso could be an effective zzso zzso zzso
