In response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates genes required for zzso zzso zzso expression zzso to those required for zzso and zzso Previous studies suggest that zzso of zzso invasion and capsule expression is zzso through the zzso zzso zzso Here we performed gene expression profiling and functional studies to determine the role of zzso an auxiliary protein of the zzso response regulator, in controlling zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of genes zzso zzso and the zzso type III zzso system zzso through repression of the zzso regulators zzso and zzso resulting in reduced invasion, reduced zzso and reduced expression of zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso but only zzso altered zzso expression in response to zzso Introduction of zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso rendered zzso zzso sensitive to changes in zzso These data suggest that the auxiliary zzso protein zzso a new regulatory input into the zzso zzso of zzso zzso thereby altering expression of genes zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso in response to zzso
