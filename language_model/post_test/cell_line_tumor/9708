DNA zzso is an zzso modification of the zzso zzso that occurs predominantly at zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Following zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA and particularly zzso the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso patterns are a feature of most cancer types, a characteristic that may determine their zzso to specific drug zzso Given their common target, DNA zzso may zzso the DNA damage induced by zzso zzso In zzso transcription, mass zzso and zzso band shift zzso were zzso to establish that zzso zzso formation was consistently enhanced zzso at discrete zzso zzso zzso The zzso enhancement was exquisitely sensitive to the position of the zzso zzso since zzso at neighboring zzso zzso failed to zzso an increase in zzso zzso zzso modification of DNA by zzso zzso but not zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso of binding by zzso zzso is not a general feature of all zzso zzso colon cancer cells vastly deficient in zzso zzso were 12- and zzso more resistant to zzso and zzso relative to the zzso line, suggesting that these drugs may selectively recognize the zzso zzso zzso profiles characteristic of most zzso zzso
