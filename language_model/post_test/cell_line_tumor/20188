To detect the expression of zzso zzso 6 zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso and to analyze the effects of zzso of zzso expression on cell cycle, proliferation and migration of zzso zzso cell zzso cell line zzso cells, and to explore their possible molecular zzso 

zzso was used to detect the expression of zzso protein in 55 cases of zzso zzso cell zzso and 20 cases of normal zzso zzso zzso zzso and control zzso were zzso into zzso cells via zzso 2000, and the interfering effect was analyzed using Western zzso The effects of zzso of zzso expression on cell cycle, proliferation and migration were determined by cell counting zzso zzso flow zzso and zzso chamber, zzso Finally, Western zzso was used to detect the expressions of cell cycle, proliferation and migration related zzso 

There was a high level expression of zzso protein in zzso zzso cell zzso and its expression was not related to age and sex of the patients zzso zzso zzso but closely associated with the degree of zzso zzso zzso staging and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso effectively zzso the expression of zzso protein in zzso zzso cell zzso cell line zzso cells, and zzso of its expression obviously inhibited cell zzso arrested cell cycle at zzso phase and decreased cell migration ability in zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso of zzso protein expression markedly decreased the expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but increased the expressions of zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso may play a pivotal role in the zzso and development of zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso of zzso zzso cell proliferation zzso cell cycle arrest and decreased cell migration ability may be closely associated with the decrease of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins and increase of zzso and zzso zzso
