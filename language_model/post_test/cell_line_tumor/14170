zzso probe has been successfully used for the analysis of either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso we wanted to see if zzso could also simultaneously assess both, zzso activity and zzso in acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso 

zzso activity was measured using zzso and compared to the results of the zzso 123 zzso zzso zzso in zzso negative and zzso positive cell lines, and 12 zzso zzso For zzso spontaneous zzso as well as, zzso induced by zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Both zzso red zzso and zzso green zzso of zzso with and without a zzso inhibitor zzso A : zzso were used for the identification of zzso cells, and this was compared to zzso zzso zzso 

zzso We found a good correlation between zzso and zzso 123 in viable zzso Even in a small population of viable cells, zzso positive cells emitting low red fluorescence, gained on red zzso after zzso zzso with zzso permitting an evaluation of zzso zzso zzso We found a good correlation between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the assessment of zzso zzso Most importantly, the zzso cells could be distinguished by the loss of red zzso and the increase of green zzso without any change after zzso zzso with zzso 

zzso can simultaneously evaluate two important parameters involved in drug resistance in zzso cells, zzso activity and zzso
