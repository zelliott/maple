zzso zzso is a childhood cancer originating from skeletal muscle, and patient survival is poor in the presence of zzso zzso Few zzso that regulate zzso development have been zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in zzso zzso suggesting a role in zzso although its functional importance has not been zzso Here, we report the identification of zzso in zzso in human zzso tumors that lead to its zzso and present evidence that it functions as an zzso in zzso Higher zzso expression in zzso tumors was associated with zzso cancer and poor survival, while zzso zzso in a human zzso cell line reduced tumor growth and experimental lung zzso when the cells were transplanted into zzso Moreover, 6 zzso zzso zzso domain zzso were found among 7 of 94 zzso primary human zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso increased zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso and zzso potential when expressed in a zzso zzso cell zzso These zzso also transformed zzso zzso cells and led to an enhanced zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso cell lines expressing the zzso and zzso zzso zzso were substantially more susceptible to zzso in the presence of a zzso zzso inhibitor than the control cell lines expressing the empty zzso or zzso zzso Together, our results demonstrate that zzso activated zzso acts as an zzso and these are what we believe to be the first known zzso in a zzso zzso zzso in zzso These findings support the potential therapeutic targeting of zzso in zzso
