zzso as an important class of protein zzso inhibitor are widely investigated for zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso zzso A series of novel zzso derivatives zzso were prepared and evaluated for their zzso zzso zzso zzso activity as well as their zzso properties on three zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso The zzso results showed most of the designed compounds exhibited moderate to potent in zzso zzso activity in the zzso and cellular zzso of which compound 21 revealed the most potent dual zzso zzso activity, with zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, comparable to the control compounds zzso and zzso Furthermore, the zzso selectivity profile of 21 was zzso and demonstrated its good selectivity over the majority of the close zzso zzso zzso simulation was performed to position compound 21 into the zzso active site to determine the probable binding zzso These new findings along with molecular zzso observations could provide an important basis for further development of compound 21 as a potent zzso dual zzso zzso
