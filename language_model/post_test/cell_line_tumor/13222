Lung cancer is the leading cause of zzso death zzso zzso is known to increase cancer cell migration and zzso We have previously reported that zzso zzso zzso transition zzso in lung cancer zzso However, it is unknown whether zzso promotes lung cancer cell migration and invasion via zzso and whether zzso zzso zzso dependent protein zzso zzso plays a role in this zzso We found that zzso increased zzso activity and induced zzso and protein expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and regulatory zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso prevented zzso induction of zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity with chemical zzso prevented zzso induced by zzso and tumor growth factor zzso However, zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso did not induce zzso Furthermore, treatment with zzso and zzso of zzso prevented zzso zzso cell migration, and invasion, whereas zzso of mouse zzso rescued zzso migration and invasion in zzso deficient cancer zzso Our results suggest that zzso enhances zzso activity by zzso zzso gene expression in a zzso dependent mechanism and that zzso plays a key role in zzso zzso migration, and invasion in lung cancer zzso
