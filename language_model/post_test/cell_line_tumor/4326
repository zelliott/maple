zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso was shown previously to be zzso in human primary breast zzso and to suppress zzso in zzso zzso breast cancer cells in zzso However, it is not known whether zzso is important for zzso tumor zzso maintenance and/or zzso We have used a combination of three-dimensional cultures, a transgenic mouse model of breast cancer lacking zzso as well as zzso of human breast cancer cell lines to address these zzso We found that zzso zzso after overt tumor development reduced the growth of zzso human breast cancer cell lines, and that this effect was accompanied by a reduction in zzso zzso However, zzso zzso did not affect zzso of zzso human breast cancer cells grown in three-dimensional zzso Moreover, in zzso mice, zzso zzso did not affect zzso tumor onset or zzso but decreased the number of tumors per zzso Thus, we demonstrate that zzso contributes to both zzso zzso tumor initiation and zzso Our results suggest that zzso of zzso can have a beneficial effect on zzso breast zzso but that zzso of additional targets is needed to block breast zzso
