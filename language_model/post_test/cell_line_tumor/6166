zzso zzso is a zzso zzso inhibitor that was approved by the zzso Food and Drug Administration in 2001 for treatment of many different stages of chronic zzso leukemia and in 2002 for treatment of gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso is known to inhibit the zzso proliferation of chronic zzso zzso which is associated with the zzso zzso in gastrointestinal zzso tumors, zzso is known to act via zzso zzso zzso The objective of this study was to zzso an zzso analog of zzso not as a primary imaging agent but rather as a zzso for in zzso drug distribution and zzso concentration that can be used as a PET imaging surrogate for zzso 

zzso modeling studies based on the crystal structure of zzso bound to the active site of zzso were performed for designing the fluorinated zzso A zzso analog of zzso zzso was zzso using well-established zzso The selectivity and binding affinity of zzso were compared with those of zzso in zzso Mice bearing zzso tumor zzso which are known to zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso A zzso study was also performed on zzso zzso mice to which our zzso zzso was zzso 

The zzso zzso verified that zzso and zzso bind to the same targets with similar zzso The feasibility of using zzso as a PET agent was examined in zzso and zzso PET was shown to zzso zzso tumor zzso in nude zzso The tumor was visible on PET 1 h after injection, with zzso of zzso of the injected zzso zzso studies in zzso mice were also performed, and the zzso of zzso zzso injected dose per zzso for each organ was zzso 

The results of the binding zzso showed that zzso has selectivity and binding affinity comparable to zzso zzso PET of zzso zzso mice using zzso as a PET agent displayed promising tumor zzso and zzso zzso Because zzso has been taken up in zzso by tumors that zzso zzso we are exploring a possible role for identifying tumors that will respond to zzso before zzso
