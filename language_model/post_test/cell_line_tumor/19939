zzso zzso therapy using zzso human zzso zzso or zzso zzso is a promising treatment for future protection against chemical warfare nerve agent zzso Potential immune response due to the complex structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso and genetic variation is a limiting factor against zzso zzso zzso We investigated an alternative zzso approach using zzso an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso which activates zzso promoter and zzso its zzso A mouse zzso cell line, zzso zzso was treated with various doses of zzso and analysis of the expressed zzso indicates that the zzso activity was significantly increased in cells exposed to repeated administration of the drug every other day for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso activity was increased approximately zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso The optimal dose found for zzso zzso production was zzso zzso zzso while the optimal dose for zzso was 12 zzso In parallel with the rise in the zzso level, the zzso of zzso cells showed zzso growth with increasing zzso zzso treatment protects zzso 2A cells from zzso zzso a surrogate of the zzso chemical warfare agents zzso and zzso induced toxicity in zzso 2A zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso such as zzso can sufficiently zzso cellular zzso production and protect cells against zzso zzso
