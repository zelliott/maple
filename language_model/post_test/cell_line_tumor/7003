zzso a zzso zzso tumor associated zzso is the smallest member of the inhibitor of zzso family that is abundantly expressed during development but essentially absent in normal adult zzso Interestingly, zzso expression is zzso in virtually all types of zzso zzso as well as in vascular zzso cells during tumor associated zzso zzso links zzso to cell cycle progression and plays a pivotal role in regulation of cell zzso These characteristics make zzso a potentially promising generic target for cancer zzso zzso a genetic zzso strategy to induce zzso immune responses against human zzso in a zzso animal model was zzso In initial studies, zzso mice were zzso by intramuscular injection with DNA coding for human zzso zzso In addition, a construct zzso a zzso version of zzso zzso was zzso A zzso coding for zzso zzso zzso factor zzso was zzso in both cases as a molecular zzso zzso of zzso following zzso in mouse cells was zzso zzso responses against human zzso were detected in mice zzso using two zzso protocols zzso at zzso or zzso zzso The zzso response was markedly improved by zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso The zzso zzso zzso detected in responsive mice was zzso suggesting that a zzso cellular response had been zzso Furthermore, DNA zzso with zzso zzso zzso generated an effective zzso T cell response measured as an increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T zzso In conclusion, intramuscular genetic zzso of mice with human zzso zzso plasmids induced a zzso zzso as well as cellular immune response in recipient zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso as a genetic zzso appear to be more important in generating an zzso than a cellular immune zzso
