zzso cancer is still a major cause of death in Asian people despite a complete cure after the zzso of early zzso mainly because zzso dissemination is difficult to zzso In the present study, we used two-dimensional differential gel zzso zzso zzso to identify specific proteins zzso expressed between a highly zzso stomach cancer cell line zzso and its parental cell line zzso We detected 27 protein spots in at least 2 of 3 experiments which showed statistically significant differences in zzso All 27 protein spots were identified using zzso laser zzso of flight zzso mass zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso analysis revealed 13 different proteins with some zzso sharing different zzso zzso and that 8 proteins were zzso and 5 were zzso The 13 proteins were mainly involved in protein synthesis zzso zzso zzso metabolism zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and signal zzso zzso I and zzso the zzso zzso 5, zzso 8) and cell cycling zzso These results suggested that a zzso approach including zzso zzso would be an efficient way to identify the proteins responsible for specific biological zzso Moreover, these observations might be novel findings leading to the prediction of zzso zzso zzso
