A zzso disruption was performed on the destruction box sequence of zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of the DNA replication initiation complex, in a human cancer cell line zzso resulting in the formation of a protein that was stable in the zzso phase of the cell zzso Although the total amount of zzso in zzso cultures was not zzso the zzso stabilization of zzso diminished zzso loading of zzso maintenance complex, inhibited DNA zzso and resulted in the zzso of cells in zzso The zzso zzso suppressed in zzso zzso and in zzso cell zzso zzso carrying this zzso failed to support the replication of a zzso bearing the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The DNA damage checkpoint zzso was activated in the zzso cells with increased levels of zzso protein and its target, the zzso zzso All these deficits were rescued by zzso of zzso a replication zzso protein that binds to zzso zzso zzso of the cell zzso regulation of zzso zzso in human cells without increasing total protein level zzso DNA replication and suppresses tumor zzso
