This study was designed to evaluate some parameters that may play a role in the prediction of cancer cells sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso induction and repair of DNA zzso breaks zzso cell cycle regulation and induction of zzso were measured in four cancer cell lines with different sensitivities to zzso Using a zzso zzso the cervical zzso cells zzso were found to be the most sensitive to zzso followed by breast zzso cells zzso and liver zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were the most zzso As measured by zzso gel zzso zzso zzso zzso but not residual zzso exhibited a significant correlation with the sensitivity of cells to zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso analysis revealed that zzso of zzso cells and zzso of zzso cells shift to zzso phase after incubation with zzso Additionally, zzso induced the arrest of zzso cells in zzso and the arrest of zzso and zzso cells in both S phase and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso level and zzso activity indicated that zzso zzso results from the zzso zzso zzso These results, if confirmed using clinical samples, indicate that the induction of DNA zzso as measured by zzso and the induction of zzso should be considered, along with other zzso zzso in future clinical trials to develop zzso zzso for platinum zzso zzso
