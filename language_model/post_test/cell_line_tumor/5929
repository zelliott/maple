zzso interference zzso is an evolutionary zzso mechanism for specific gene zzso There are currently numerous cancer therapy clinical trials based on zzso zzso Using an zzso system as a delivery zzso of zzso we investigated the therapeutic effects of targeting three genes simultaneously in zzso and in zzso In this study, we constructed an zzso zzso zzso expression system as zzso for zzso zzso Our results showed that the zzso zzso can achieve above zzso of zzso efficiency and induced obvious zzso in zzso cell both in zzso and in zzso compared with targeting the zzso alone or controlled zzso
