zzso zzso acid zzso is one of the most widely used zzso zzso zzso However, the potential advantage of zzso has not been sufficiently validated as an adjunct to gene therapy of head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso zzso has been shown to boost the efficiency of gene transfer by zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso on treated zzso The zzso family zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to have characteristics similar to zzso and although they are not confirmed as tumor zzso zzso signals induce their zzso We previously reported that the zzso transfer of zzso or zzso showed an effective zzso effect similar to that of zzso In this study, we combined zzso with zzso delivery of zzso or zzso to enhance the efficiency of gene zzso This combination resulted in a significantly enhanced zzso effect in zzso cell lines but had no effect on normal human zzso zzso treatment added to zzso gene delivery caused an increase in zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso treatment could be developed as a therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficiency of zzso gene transfer in the treatment of zzso
