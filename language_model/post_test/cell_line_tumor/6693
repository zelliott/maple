This paper investigates a series of zzso based on the zzso zzso scaffold that displays a naturally occurring zzso zzso on their zzso These zzso have previously been shown to interact with DNA in a generation dependent manner with the more highly zzso zzso exhibiting a strong zzso effect for the zzso surface zzso In this paper, we investigate the ability of these zzso to zzso DNA into cells zzso breast zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso cells, zzso as determined by the zzso zzso Although the zzso are unable to zzso DNA in their own right, they are capable of delivering DNA in zzso when administered with zzso which assists with escape from zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso was determined using the zzso zzso and it was shown that the zzso were nontoxic either alone or in the presence of zzso However, when administered with DNA and zzso the most highly zzso zzso did exhibit some zzso This paper zzso the relationship between in zzso zzso efficiency and zzso While zzso efficiencies are modest, the low toxicity of the zzso both in their own right, and in the presence of DNA, provides encouragement that this type of building block, which has a relatively high affinity for DNA, will provide a useful starting point for the further synthetic development of more effective gene zzso zzso
