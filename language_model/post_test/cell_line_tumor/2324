High zzso zzso zzso have recently attracted great attention from zzso because of their similarity to zzso However, the actual risk associated with the exposure to zzso zzso which escapes most regulations worldwide, is still zzso zzso fibers of zzso zzso have been prepared from two natural sources to investigate whether zzso may zzso zzso toxicity and gain insight on the hazard posed by naturally occurring zzso which may be defined as zzso because of their zzso Power ultrasound was used to obtain zzso from two different zzso zzso one from the dismissed zzso mine in zzso zzso Western zzso and the other from a zzso zzso in the Italian Central zzso zzso zzso X-ray zzso and zzso zzso revealed that the procedure does not affect zzso and chemical zzso Surface reactions related to zzso stress, free radical generation, zzso of iron, and zzso zzso revealed a consistent reduction in zzso upon reduction in zzso When tested on zzso human zzso cells, the pristine but not the zzso fibers proved zzso zzso zzso induced NO production, and caused zzso zzso However, zzso still induced some toxicity relevant zzso stress activity zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The reduction in length and a lack of poorly coordinated zzso iron in zzso may explain this zzso The present study provides a zzso procedure for the preparation of a homogeneous batch of natural zzso zzso and shows how a well-known toxic material might not necessarily become more toxic than its zzso counterpart when reduced to the zzso
