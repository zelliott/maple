Multiple myeloma zzso is preceded by the zzso zzso state, zzso zzso of zzso significance zzso Although zzso patients may remain stable for years, they are at increased risk of progressing to zzso A better understanding of the relevant molecular changes underlying the transition from an zzso to symptomatic disease state is urgently zzso Our studies show for the first time that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may be having an important biological role in zzso We first demonstrate that zzso is zzso in zzso plasma cells zzso vs normal and zzso zzso Next, functional studies revealed that the natural zzso zzso zzso B, stimulates zzso cell zzso Moreover, when zzso patient PCs displaying zzso zzso expression were separated into zzso and zzso populations and analyzed for proliferation potential, we discovered that zzso PCs displayed significantly higher levels of cell proliferation than did zzso zzso Lastly, zzso significantly attenuated zzso cell zzso Taken together, these data suggest that the zzso zzso has a key role in zzso cell proliferation and may serve as an attractive target for reducing the zzso compartment of this zzso
