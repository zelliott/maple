zzso is a zzso that has been linked to zzso function in breast, zzso and prostate zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso acts to induce zzso properties is largely zzso One intriguing feature of zzso is the presence of a zzso zzso zzso site that is zzso from a zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso may bind to cell surface zzso zzso little is known about the zzso zzso zzso In the current study, we use the zzso zzso zzso tumor cell lines zzso and zzso these cells are zzso zzso derived from the parental population of zzso cells from zzso zzso Using flow zzso and zzso resonance energy transfer, we show that the zzso zzso of zzso binds with another marker of zzso function zzso C or zzso to the zzso cell surface zzso (also known as zzso zzso zzso zzso to activate zzso and zzso zzso In in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to generate short zzso zzso in the presence of zzso C increases migration and invasion of both zzso and zzso zzso This interaction between zzso zzso and zzso C has not been previously described but assigns a zzso unknown function for the zzso zzso zzso zzso
