zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso is known to catalyze the generation of zzso zzso in zzso Although the cellular role of zzso is not well zzso it has been implicated in human zzso virus zzso DNA repair, and zzso zzso zzso is known to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and this zzso regulates the zzso zzso of zzso resulting in gene zzso To identify in a zzso manner genes regulated by zzso zzso we performed a zzso analysis on zzso zzso cells zzso with control and zzso small interfering zzso We identified zzso zzso a potent natural inhibitor of zzso as a zzso repression target of zzso Moreover, we show that zzso zzso cells exhibited cell migration defects that were rescued by blocking the zzso zzso with a zzso zzso or blocking zzso zzso zzso associates with the zzso promoter and regulates the balance of zzso of zzso and zzso such that in zzso cells zzso was zzso and zzso was zzso at the zzso zzso Using a zzso promoter reporter zzso we further show that zzso directly regulates the zzso promoter zzso These findings show that zzso is a zzso repression target of zzso and suggest that zzso the activity of zzso could inhibit tumor progression and therefore may be of cancer therapeutic zzso
