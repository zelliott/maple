There is increasing evidence that zzso zzso promote the zzso of some zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed by many tumors and is a growth factor for zzso and mediates zzso zzso zzso we report the efficacy of a novel orally active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in proof of concept studies of solid tumor growth and zzso bone zzso zzso lung zzso cells did not express zzso and were not growth inhibited by zzso in zzso Nevertheless, daily zzso administration of zzso caused zzso suppression of zzso tumor growth in nude mice that correlated with marked reductions in zzso zzso zzso and with increased plasma zzso a possible zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, the tumor zzso was reduced in zzso mice, consistent with a role for zzso in tumor zzso In separate studies, zzso was compared with zzso in a model in which zzso zzso zzso cells zzso into the zzso of rats led to severe cortical and zzso bone zzso Both agents reduced tumor growth and preserved zzso However, zzso reduced the number of zzso zzso superior to zzso zzso exhibited additional activity against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To more fully define the therapeutic potential of this new agent, zzso was evaluated in a zzso acute zzso leukemia tumor zzso model and caused tumor zzso In zzso this novel zzso inhibitor represents a new agent with potential therapeutic activity in acute zzso leukemia and in settings where zzso zzso and zzso contribute to tumor growth and skeletal zzso
