zzso zzso zzso cells zzso have shown potential clinical zzso However, previous assessments of zzso behavior in recipients have relied on visual detection in host tissue following zzso failing to monitor in zzso zzso zzso in a single animal and limiting the number of variables that can be observed zzso In this study, we used zzso in zzso zzso imaging to determine conditions under which zzso selectively zzso in sites of zzso zzso modified to express zzso zzso zzso were injected into healthy mice or mice bearing inflammatory zzso and zzso zzso was followed with zzso zzso The inflammatory insults investigated included zzso zzso and surgical incision wounds, as well as zzso and zzso zzso We also compared tumor models in which zzso were zzso or zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso human zzso zzso zzso delivered to zzso animals initially reside in the zzso then zzso to the liver and zzso and decrease in signal over zzso However, zzso in wounded mice zzso and remain zzso only at injured zzso Similarly, in zzso and zzso breast zzso mice, zzso detection of zzso delivered zzso revealed persistent, specific zzso with sites of tumor zzso This pattern of zzso was also observed in an zzso tumor model in which zzso were zzso zzso In this study, we identified conditions under which zzso zzso and selective zzso in sites of inflammation can be monitored by zzso imaging over zzso zzso these consistent findings were independent of tumor type, zzso and route of zzso zzso
