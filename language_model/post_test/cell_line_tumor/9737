The common genetic zzso associated with complex traits typically lie in zzso DNA and may alter gene regulation in a cell zzso zzso zzso the choice of tissue or cell model in the dissection of disease associations is zzso We carried out an expression quantitative trait zzso zzso study of primary human zzso zzso derived from 95 unrelated donors of Swedish origin, each represented by two independently derived primary lines to provide biological zzso We combined our data with publicly available information from a zzso association study zzso of bone mineral density zzso The top 2000 zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso were tested for zzso of gene expression in zzso and in zzso cell lines zzso using publicly available data and showed that zzso have a significantly greater enrichment zzso of zzso zzso as compared to zzso The top 10 zzso zzso with zzso showing strong zzso on gene expression in zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso - 7 zzso zzso were selected for further validation using a staged design in two zzso of Caucasian male zzso All 10 zzso were tested in the Swedish zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso providing evidence for two novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso These zzso were then tested in the Rotterdam Study zzso zzso zzso yielding zzso evidence for zzso association at the zzso zzso locus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect was further zzso to the zzso promoter of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that primary cells relevant to disease zzso complement traditional approaches for zzso and validation of zzso hits for follow-up zzso
