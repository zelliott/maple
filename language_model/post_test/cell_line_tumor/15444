zzso zzso stem cells zzso are the origin of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso is among the generated zzso zzso zzso proteins play a crucial role in promoting the acceptance of zzso However, the mechanisms regulating the expression of zzso in human zzso are zzso We induced differentiation of zzso and found that zzso was greatly zzso only in zzso cells zzso for zzso Growth plates and bone callus zzso in adults showed that only zzso cells and zzso zzso were positive for zzso Use of gene zzso and zzso factors revealed that zzso depends on the expression and function of the zzso master genes zzso and zzso In addition, zzso could directly inhibit zzso by acting on zzso through zzso However, in mature zzso the expression of zzso protein was greatly suppressed whereas the zzso factor, zzso was zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression during the maturation of zzso was due to binding of the zzso zzso a signal zzso of the zzso pathway, to the zzso binding element within the zzso zzso Our findings show that zzso zzso and zzso cells specifically express zzso during zzso with a key role in bone zzso
