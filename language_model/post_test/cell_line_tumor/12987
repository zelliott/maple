zzso cancer is one of the most lethal zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been recognized as targets for pancreatic cancer zzso Although zzso has been the recommended chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer, the prognosis is extremely zzso The development of zzso targeted therapies has been required for patients with pancreatic zzso To assess the validation of zzso as a target for pancreatic cancer therapy, we examined its expression in pancreatic cancer using real-time zzso analyses and zzso We also measured the zzso cell rate using zzso zzso In addition, zzso in signaling pathways were detected by zzso zzso Treatment with zzso which reduced the cell viability and zzso the cell zzso rate, activated and subsequently attenuated zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso zzso or zzso treatment enhanced the zzso zzso zzso formation of zzso with zzso and zzso of zzso indicating that the presence of zzso promoted the activity of targeted molecules including zzso zzso and zzso for pancreatic cancer zzso Combined treatment with an inhibitor for zzso and zzso zzso or zzso induced synergistic zzso effects, accompanied by the suppression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso suppressed the activities of zzso zzso and zzso and the expression of zzso zzso According to this evidence, combination chemotherapy of conventional zzso drugs plus an inhibitor for zzso would allow us to provide more favorable clinical outcomes for patients with pancreatic zzso
