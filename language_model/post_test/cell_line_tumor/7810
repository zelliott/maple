zzso is an integral component of the zzso complex important for zzso DNA zzso However, exactly how this activity is regulated in zzso remains zzso Here we provide evidence to show that zzso is a novel zzso protein that ensures regulated zzso zzso We found that the direct interaction between zzso and zzso is zzso by an zzso zzso region on zzso zzso although zzso zzso zzso formation and zzso C sensitivity appeared normal in zzso defective zzso zzso these cells exhibited a significant increase in gene conversion zzso zzso we found that zzso of the zzso interaction resulted in elevated sister zzso exchange zzso Our results suggest that loss of the zzso interaction relieved the cells with the suppression of sister zzso exchange and therefore led to a zzso zzso in the gene conversion zzso Together, our study indicated that although zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso it could also govern the choice of templates used in zzso zzso zzso
