zzso zzso C delta zzso a zzso family zzso regulates diverse signal zzso pathways during DNA damage to induce zzso To explore the zzso mechanism that zzso zzso we sought to uncover zzso factor targets of zzso by devising a screening strategy that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso factor candidates were generated with the application of public access zzso tools and this resulted in the identification of zzso as a novel zzso DNA damage responsive zzso The results demonstrated that zzso is zzso associated with zzso zzso regulated zzso to activate zzso zzso upon zzso zzso Furthermore, both zzso and zzso were associated with DNA zzso zzso Taken together, we have discovered a novel regulation of zzso which zzso zzso by zzso to induce cell death in response to zzso zzso
