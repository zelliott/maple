Global zzso approaches in cancer research have provided new and innovative strategies for the identification of signatures that differentiate various types of human zzso zzso analysis of the promoter composition of the genes within these signatures may provide a powerful method for zzso the regulatory zzso networks that mediate their collective zzso In this study we have systematically analyzed the promoter composition of gene classes derived from previously established genetic signatures that recently have been shown to reliably and zzso distinguish five molecular zzso of breast cancer associated with distinct clinical zzso zzso made from the trends of zzso factor binding site enrichment in the promoters of these gene groups led to the identification of regulatory pathways that zzso discrete zzso networks associated with specific molecular zzso of breast zzso One of these zzso pathways predicted a role for nuclear zzso in a novel zzso zzso zzso module regulated by the zzso family of growth factor zzso The existence of this zzso was verified in zzso by zzso zzso and shown to be zzso in breast cancer cells zzso zzso This analysis indicates that approaches of this type can provide unique insights into the differential regulatory molecular programs associated with breast cancer and will aid in identifying specific zzso networks and pathways as potential targets for tumor zzso therapeutic zzso
