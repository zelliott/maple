We have previously demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso independently of zzso zzso melanoma cell zzso Further investigations now show that zzso effects are zzso through the regulation of zzso zzso zzso screening of several genes involved in melanoma biology reveals that zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in melanoma and contributes to zzso We show that zzso zzso a diminution of zzso level in different human melanoma cell zzso This effect is zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso factor, zzso the master gene in zzso differentiation and involved in melanoma zzso Further, zzso zzso protein is sufficient to abrogate zzso effects such as zzso zzso whereas extinction of the zzso zzso mimics zzso changes observed in response to zzso Finally, zzso of human melanoma tumor development in nude mice treated with zzso is associated with a strong decrease in zzso and zzso zzso Our results show that zzso effects of zzso involve an zzso of the zzso axis and highlight the key role of this specific zzso in melanoma zzso
