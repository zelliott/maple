Nearly zzso of human zzso are zzso zzso of zzso arm zzso often in conjunction with deletion of zzso has been observed in zzso of these zzso This has suggested the presence of a tumor zzso gene located on the zzso zzso zzso 19 deletion is also of interest due to the better prognosis of patients with zzso including longer survival and better response to chemotherapy, compared with patients without zzso Two zzso cell lines with deletion of zzso were used for zzso 19 zzso transfer, to assess the effect of replacing the deleted zzso zzso with zzso 19 significantly reduced the growth rate of the hybrid cells compared with the parental cell zzso zzso zzso Plus zzso Gene zzso analysis was performed to measure and compare the expression of the zzso 19 genes in the zzso 19 hybrid cell lines to the parental cell zzso zzso were considered significantly different when a P value zzso was seen in all of the cell line zzso Of 345 zzso within the commonly deleted zzso region, seven genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified as potential candidate zzso zzso analysis of primary tumor specimens showed that several genes had significant differences when zzso by tumor zzso or deletion zzso This suggests that one or more of these candidates may play a role in zzso formation or zzso
