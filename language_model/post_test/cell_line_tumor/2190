zzso complement zzso which causes disruption of the zzso zzso is recognized as a key zzso factor in zzso zzso zzso zzso specific targeting of complement zzso to the site of complement zzso is a potential therapeutic strategy for treatment of zzso 

We assessed expression of zzso zzso zzso accelerating factor zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso based on the rat complement inhibitor zzso in zzso systems, and studied its zzso effect on complement deposition in zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso completely retained the zzso binding activity of zzso to zzso and inhibited complement zzso of zzso in zzso 

We found that zzso could bind specifically to zzso cells, and it is significantly more potent at zzso complement deposition than the zzso parent zzso zzso zzso may be a candidate for in zzso protection of the zzso in zzso
