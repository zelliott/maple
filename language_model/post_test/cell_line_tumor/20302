zzso is a novel zzso zzso and plays an essential role in zzso however, its role in the molecular mechanism underlying zzso remains poorly zzso In the present study, we show that zzso interacts directly with zzso on zzso cells and at the molecular level and identify the structural basis of zzso binding to zzso In addition, we show that zzso is required in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and thus promotion of zzso cell migration and zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso zzso or zzso zzso abrogates all zzso zzso induced by zzso An in zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso formation was impaired in the zzso conditional knockout of zzso zzso Our animal experiments demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso zzso have an additive zzso effect on zzso human pancreatic and melanoma zzso The results of the present study suggest that zzso is a new zzso for zzso and is therefore a promising target for blocking zzso zzso
