The association of zzso zzso alpha zzso expression with differentiated breast tumors presenting a lower zzso risk could be explained by the zzso zzso of cell zzso zzso and zzso Since zzso play a crucial role in zzso zzso and may interfere in tumor zzso we studied their regulation by zzso in human breast cancer and normal zzso zzso zzso increased the formation of zzso in normal and zzso zzso Furthermore, four zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso appeared significantly zzso by zzso in three zzso cancer cell lines and this effect was reversed by a pure zzso Finally, zzso of zzso or zzso expression by specific zzso revealed that zzso zzso proteins are essential for the zzso control of zzso zzso This zzso zzso of zzso formation could contribute to the lower zzso of zzso tumors and to the integrity of zzso layers in zzso target zzso
