zzso is a zzso process involving the degradation of zzso own unnecessary, injured, or aged proteins and recycling of zzso products to maintain zzso Recently, studies indicated that zzso plays a crucial role in cancer zzso However, the role of zzso in tongue zzso cell zzso zzso has not been well zzso This study aims to assess the expression of zzso protein and investigate its effect on zzso 

zzso 50 zzso samples were zzso zzso were performed to examine the expression of zzso and zzso zzso analyses were carried out to assess the associations among zzso zzso In zzso cells were treated with zzso or zzso Then, zzso western zzso and zzso were performed to detect the expression of zzso and zzso zzso electron zzso was zzso to identify zzso For functional analysis, cell proliferation and cell cycle were evaluated with zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso At last, cell migration and invasion zzso were assessed by wound healing zzso and zzso zzso 

We confirmed that zzso of zzso and zzso is a frequent event in zzso Then, we demonstrated that decreased expression of zzso was associated with T stage, clinical stage and zzso Furthermore, we showed that zzso of zzso by zzso suppressed zzso migration and invasion while zzso of zzso by zzso promoted zzso migration and invasion in zzso zzso 

Taken together, these data suggest that zzso plays a pivotal role in the progression of zzso
