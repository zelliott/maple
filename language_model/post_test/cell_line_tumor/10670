Eleven novel zzso zzso were designed and obtained from appropriate zzso zzso by zzso reaction with zzso acid and subsequent zzso of intermediate chain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses confirmed the chemical structure of all the zzso zzso The zzso zzso method was zzso and proved to be zzso and reliable for the analysis of these unknown small molecules zzso These compounds were zzso on zzso zzso zzso stationary phase and their zzso parameters expressed as the log zzso values were determined by zzso using zzso of methanol and water as mobile zzso with different methanol zzso zzso acid sodium salt zzso and zzso zzso buffer zzso zzso was added to the mobile phase zzso containing zzso zzso zzso in organic modifier zzso mobile zzso The high values of zzso zzso zzso zzso for all the compounds investigated proved the excellent fit between experimental data and the zzso zzso zzso obtained from the zzso zzso were compared both with those theoretically calculated and with those obtained from an zzso zzso software by the use of nine different zzso methods for zzso of log zzso The predicted values of log P by use of AB log P zzso revealed the best correlation with the experimental log zzso values for the investigated zzso since a good correlation zzso between these quantities was zzso The majority of novel zzso were found to be evidently effective in zzso against human zzso cells zzso and zzso in an effective concentration of 50 zzso Five compounds (13, 15, 16, 18 and zzso revealed remarkable zzso activities and selective zzso for cancer cells over normal zzso zzso Therefore these ones may be considered as a basis for the design of novel useful zzso (13, 15 and zzso and low toxic (18 and zzso zzso zzso
