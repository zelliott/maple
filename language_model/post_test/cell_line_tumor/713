zzso zzso growth factor zzso has been identified as a critical regulator of zzso Currently, several different strategies are being used to target the zzso zzso signal zzso zzso in zzso Although zzso therapy seems be effective in zzso abnormal tumor zzso leading to an enhanced response to radiation and chemotherapy, tumors eventually become resistant to the therapy and adopt a highly zzso and invasive zzso 

In the present study, we evaluated the effects of zzso therapy zzso on zzso invasion both in zzso and in zzso and evaluated the zzso and zzso zzso of developed resistance to this zzso 

We found that zzso tumors escaped from zzso treatment by zzso zzso zzso through zzso of other zzso factors and zzso invading normal brain areas, which was seen in association with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso In addition to the zzso effects of zzso on zzso cells, zzso zzso signaling seemed to regulate zzso invasion because zzso therapy increased tumor zzso in zzso 

zzso these findings reinforce the importance of zzso in regulating tumor invasion and identify potential zzso of resistance to targeted zzso zzso These results will be important for developing novel combination therapies to overcome this resistance zzso
