zzso zzso or zzso compounds can be zzso by various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso is especially important due to the large number of drugs and chemical zzso that are zzso through this zzso zzso and harmless zzso can be zzso by zzso zzso thus zzso of zzso activity reduce the risk of chemical zzso The aim of this study was to reveal whether this mechanism contributes to the zzso effect of green tea zzso which has been shown in various animal zzso zzso we investigated the effect of these zzso on zzso in rat liver zzso and in zzso zzso mouse zzso cells, using zzso zzso as model zzso Tea zzso inhibited zzso in intact zzso where zzso transport across the zzso membrane is zzso but were almost ineffective in zzso zzso zzso zzso the major green tea zzso was shown to have a zzso zzso effect on both zzso activity and zzso transport in native zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso activity in native zzso zzso mouse zzso cells, while failed to affect the zzso in zzso cells, where the zzso membrane barrier was zzso Our findings indicate that tea zzso inhibit zzso in the zzso zzso at the zzso transport zzso This phenomenon might potentially contribute to the zzso dietary or pharmacological effect attributed to these zzso
