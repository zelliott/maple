We have demonstrated previously that the zzso zzso growth factor zzso is a zzso zzso zzso To establish whether or not the related zzso zzso also binds zzso we used human breast zzso zzso cells, because these cells zzso this zzso thus zzso the detection of this zzso In the present paper, we show that zzso could be zzso using zzso beads in a zzso manner, as detected by Western zzso analysis using an zzso zzso zzso was also isolated by zzso zzso zzso We also demonstrate using an overlay technique with zzso zzso that zzso binds directly to the zzso zzso The binding of zzso zzso to zzso depends strictly on the presence of zzso since it was prevented by the presence of zzso Moreover, the addition of an excess of free zzso prevents the binding of its zzso form, demonstrating that this was a specific zzso We excluded any interference with the zzso as zzso cells express considerably lower levels of this zzso and no zzso zzso signal was observed by Western zzso analysis in the zzso zzso preparations used to perform the overlay zzso with zzso zzso We also demonstrate that treating living cells with zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and show that zzso does not interfere zzso with the activity of zzso zzso zzso We also show that zzso zzso the zzso zzso of both zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2) and zzso zzso zzso B), in accordance with the zzso observed in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso treatment increased the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso factors that operate downstream of these zzso zzso zzso most likely because of the absence of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is a new zzso zzso and that zzso plays a role in the regulation of this zzso and its downstream zzso pathways in zzso
