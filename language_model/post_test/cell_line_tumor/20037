zzso is known to be an essential zzso factor for generating zzso stem cells zzso but much less is known about its role in the downstream process of zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be part of a large zzso factor complex, together with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso et zzso Development zzso 2006) in zzso zzso We used a tagging strategy to show that zzso interacts with two novel protein partners, zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso is bound in zzso cells and is lost upon zzso whereas zzso is bound in differentiated zzso zzso zzso followed by sequencing zzso and zzso expression analysis were used to show that zzso binds approximately 9,000 target sites in zzso cells and is primarily active in the zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that a subset of the target genes is suppressed by zzso via the newly identified partner zzso zzso of zzso expression in developing zzso results in a reduced number of zzso
