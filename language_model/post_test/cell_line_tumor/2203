Bone formation in the zzso skeleton occurs via the processes of zzso and zzso zzso Bone zzso contain zzso zzso zzso chains that regulate zzso zzso However, the function of zzso in zzso zzso is zzso Here, using zzso zzso cells we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso differentiation by binding to both zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited an increase in the total amount of zzso and of zzso units of zzso over zzso In addition, zzso zzso but not zzso zzso bound to zzso and zzso and enhanced zzso zzso In contrast, zzso differentiation was inhibited in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activated zzso signaling during zzso differentiation in zzso zzso cells, decreased zzso zzso and activated zzso and zzso these reactions were blocked by zzso zzso against zzso or zzso even though zzso zzso is reported to be required for initiation of zzso cell zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso in zzso cells increased zzso of the cells to zzso and zzso and promoted zzso zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso is a selective zzso for the potential zzso zzso zzso and zzso leading to zzso differentiation of zzso zzso
