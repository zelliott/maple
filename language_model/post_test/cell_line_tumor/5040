zzso of tumor zzso together with zzso molecules is a strategy in DNA vaccination aiming at an amplification of the zzso immune zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that binds to the zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed on mature zzso cells zzso and distinct zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is mainly expressed in secondary zzso zzso and plays a central role in regulating the encounters between DC and T zzso We asked whether zzso is able to augment zzso of a DNA vaccine in a zzso mouse model with zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso Mice were vaccinated twice zzso on days 1 and 15 and tumor challenge was performed zzso on day zzso zzso of zzso DNA zzso zzso plus zzso zzso was compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso mock zzso and zzso saline (PBS) zzso zzso of zzso resulted in enhancement of a zzso immune response with substantial improvement of the protective effect of the DNA zzso zzso zzso revealed an increased zzso zzso zzso in the tumor tissue of mice that had been zzso with zzso zzso plus zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is an attractive zzso for DNA vaccination able to augment zzso immunity and that this effect is partially caused by enhanced zzso zzso zzso
