zzso levels in prostate cancer correlate with the extent of disease and are significantly elevated in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso controls two distinct zzso zzso leading to opposite effects, zzso zzso and zzso in prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso cell survival and resistance to zzso The zzso of prostate zzso cancer cells zzso and zzso was investigated upon treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso were exposed to these molecules for 18, 24 and 48 zzso zzso was assessed via zzso Western zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso followed by flow zzso or zzso and zzso zzso zzso were performed to evaluate zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso in the zzso zzso cells, whereas no effect was observed in the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly such zzso effect in zzso cells was associated with reduced zzso levels through zzso degradation via increased zzso oxygen species production and zzso zzso such zzso reduction was reversed in the presence of either the zzso inhibitor zzso or the zzso oxygen species scavenger zzso zzso in zzso but not in zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso such effect was associated with reduced zzso promoter activity and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso may be zzso in prostate cancer zzso cells, through zzso zzso Increased sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso with reduced zzso levels which are zzso to a zzso and a zzso mechanism in zzso and zzso cells zzso
