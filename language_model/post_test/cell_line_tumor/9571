In this study we have analyzed the dynamic zzso of the zzso cell zzso with respect to functional zzso during zzso culture of zzso zzso myeloma cells producing a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were cultured in duplicate 10 L zzso zzso degrees C, zzso zzso pH zzso for 335 h and supplemented with a continuous feed stream after 120 zzso zzso growth rate declined continuously after 72 h of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production rate zzso varied zzso through zzso zzso zzso correlated with relative zzso heavy chain zzso abundance up to 216 zzso zzso subsequently declined, independent of zzso heavy chain or light chain zzso zzso zzso cultures were sampled at 48 h intervals between 24 and 264 h of culture for zzso zzso Total protein abundance and nascent zzso synthesis was determined by zzso PAGE of zzso proteins zzso by zzso Ruby and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of nascent zzso synthesis and abundance with zzso cell growth, zzso and zzso consumption, zzso and zzso production rates were then examined using two partial least squares zzso zzso Most changes in zzso synthesis or abundance for proteins previously identified by mass zzso were positively correlated with zzso growth zzso We conclude that the substantial transitions in cell physiology and zzso that occur during culture zzso a relatively constant complement of the most abundant host cell machines that vary primarily with respect to induced changes in cell growth zzso
