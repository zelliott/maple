zzso zzso zzso is the primary zzso responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso In this study, we identify three zzso of mouse zzso zzso named zzso zzso and zzso which possess distinct lengths in their zzso zzso zzso These zzso are produced by leaky scanning from zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were found to be localized in the zzso apparatus, as expected, whereas zzso was exclusively found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso multiple zzso zzso arranged in an zzso zzso zzso necessary for zzso zzso were found in the zzso tail of zzso and in zzso zzso zzso by zzso was very low because of restricted transport to the zzso zzso In addition, zzso and zzso had a long zzso relative to zzso This is the first report demonstrating the presence of an zzso zzso motif in the zzso tail of a protein in the zzso zzso family of zzso The system, which produces zzso zzso having distinct zzso is likely to be of critical importance for the regulation of zzso zzso under various pathological and zzso zzso
