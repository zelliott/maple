zzso type 5 zzso gene therapy zzso require protection against zzso complement proteins and blood cells if they are to be delivered zzso to treat zzso zzso Such protection can be achieved by chemically zzso zzso with zzso based on zzso zzso Here, such zzso were designed to include side chains bearing zzso zzso zzso groups zzso to zzso modify available zzso groups of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Furthermore, the inclusion of side chains bearing positively charged zzso ammonium groups zzso was designed to improve zzso interaction of the zzso with zzso charged zzso zzso zzso Finally, to enable triggered zzso and zzso of the zzso either the zzso or both the zzso and the zzso were linked to zzso backbone via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that these zzso zzso modified zzso zzso proteins in a reduction zzso zzso In infection studies, zzso containing zzso prevented binding of zzso factor X to zzso Furthermore, the zzso and complement zzso binding of zzso to zzso was reduced by such zzso zzso without zzso zzso following zzso These data indicate that coating zzso zzso with such zzso will improve blood circulation zzso and deposition at disease zzso
