Given its significant role in the maintenance of zzso stability, zzso zzso has been zzso to regulate DNA zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso of zzso to a DNA zzso break zzso during zzso zzso repair, but a role in zzso repair by zzso zzso zzso has not been zzso By screening for zzso zzso after zzso induction by zzso radiation we found that generation of zzso zzso zzso zzso 36 zzso was the major zzso Using a novel human cell system that rapidly generates a single defined zzso in the vast majority of cells, we found that the DNA repair protein zzso (also zzso which has a zzso zzso zzso domain, localized to an induced zzso and directly zzso the formation of zzso near the induced zzso This zzso of zzso improved the association of early DNA repair zzso including zzso and zzso with the induced zzso and enhanced zzso zzso In addition, expression of zzso (an zzso zzso or zzso zzso in which zzso was zzso to zzso or zzso to prevent zzso formation decreased the association of early zzso repair components with an induced zzso and decreased zzso zzso Thus, these experiments define a zzso zzso event that enhances DNA zzso repair by zzso
