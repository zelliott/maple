We previously reported that the abnormal zzso expression was related to zzso of zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso expression in zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso For this purpose, modified zzso zzso primary zzso rat model was zzso Target proteins and zzso were measured by western zzso and zzso zzso zzso In rat liver, expression of zzso and other proteins was determined by western zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso was detected by zzso tissue zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was increased in fetal liver, zzso and zzso cell lines but decreased in zzso zzso zzso were expressed early after DEN treatment, peaked at zzso and decreased gradually zzso zzso expression increased significantly with the tumor zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso by zzso and correlated with zzso zzso of zzso zzso E was positive in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein expression was lost in zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso expression correlated significantly with the increasing tumor grade zzso In conclusion, zzso expression is commonly impaired in zzso which may be a factor involved in deregulation of zzso expression during zzso
