zzso zzso zzso which is one of the most aggressive, zzso tumors in humans, results in an extremely poor prognosis despite chemotherapy and zzso The present study was designed to evaluate therapeutic effects of radiation by zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso To examine the effectiveness of zzso in radiation induced zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, we performed colony formation zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso was analyzed with zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso formation zzso zzso cells became zzso when zzso was added to culture medium before X-ray zzso zzso was induced by zzso in the presence of zzso However, there was little zzso induced by X-ray zzso or zzso zzso The binding activity of whole cell extracts to zzso promoter region was induced by zzso in the presence of zzso but not by zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso is effective against zzso of zzso zzso zzso
