zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso show notable effects against zzso cell lung zzso zzso harboring zzso zzso However, almost all patients eventually acquire resistance to zzso In this study, we established novel zzso resistant zzso cells and examined their resistant zzso zzso cells were established in 14, 3, and 0 zzso exposed to zzso 1, and 10 zzso zzso zzso The zzso values of these cells were zzso to zzso higher than that of the parent zzso No secondary zzso zzso was detected in any resistant zzso However, in zzso resistant cells, zzso copy number was reduced less than approximately one-eighth of parent cells, and in one resistant cell zzso zzso of the population was zzso zzso Most zzso parent cells showed zzso amplification, but zzso of the population comprised zzso zzso An zzso clone zzso isolated from parent cells in zzso normal medium also showed zzso resistance comparable to the resistant B10 zzso Loss of an zzso zzso 7 zzso was observed in zzso and B10 zzso zzso cells were constantly maintained as a minor population of the parent cells under normal cell culture zzso In conclusion, loss of an zzso causes acquired resistance in zzso zzso cells exposed to a relatively low concentration of zzso but a high concentration prevents the emergence of zzso
