Previously, we found that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in human acute zzso leukemia zzso Since zzso has been shown to act as a growth factor in zzso melanoma cells, we decided to evaluate the in zzso effect of zzso and other zzso zzso zzso antagonists, such as zzso zzso and zzso on four zzso human melanoma cell zzso These zzso were found to induce zzso cell death in all four melanoma cell zzso zzso was determined by assessment of zzso exposure on the surface of the cells and nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso treatments did not adversely affect the viability of human zzso and zzso zzso at the same doses and duration of zzso Treatment of melanoma cells with zzso induced DNA damage and zzso 2, 3, 6, 8 and 9 zzso Furthermore, the general zzso inhibitor zzso and a selective inhibitor of zzso zzso protected melanoma cells from zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso inhibitor zzso was zzso In addition, we found that zzso are involved in zzso zzso characterized by the dissipation of the zzso zzso potential, the release of zzso c into the zzso compartment and zzso zzso On the basis of these results we conclude that zzso zzso zzso zzso induce zzso in human melanoma cells but not in normal zzso and embryonic zzso zzso this zzso appears to be zzso and involves the zzso zzso The present results may contribute to the zzso of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of zzso human zzso
