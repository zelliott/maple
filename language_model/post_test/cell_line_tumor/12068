Although human zzso zzso are zzso to gap junction zzso their zzso function in zzso remains poorly zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso of zzso results in the formation of zzso gap junction channels between adjacent cells, thus, allowing direct zzso zzso diffusion and zzso zzso zzso wave zzso More zzso our results strongly suggest that zzso may also form zzso channels in the zzso zzso zzso These channels contribute to the zzso zzso leak and thereby affect the zzso zzso zzso Because leakage remains the most enigmatic of those processes involved in zzso calcium zzso and the molecular nature of the leak channels is as yet unknown, the results of this work provide new insight into calcium signaling zzso These results imply that for zzso a new protein family, referred to as zzso may not simply duplicate the zzso function but may also provide additional pathways for zzso and zzso calcium signaling and zzso
