We have developed a method for the rapid collection and detection of leukemia cells using a novel zzso zzso with zzso as the molecular recognition zzso An zzso sequence was selected using a zzso zzso strategy in our laboratory for zzso acute leukemia cells that, when applied in this method, allows for specific recognition of the cells from complex zzso including whole blood zzso zzso magnetic zzso were used for target cell zzso while zzso fluorescent zzso were simultaneously added for sensitive cell zzso Combining two types of zzso allows for zzso selective, and sensitive detection not possible by using either particle zzso Fluorescent zzso amplify the signal intensity corresponding to a single zzso binding event, resulting in improved sensitivity over methods using individual zzso zzso In addition, zzso magnetic zzso allow for rapid extraction of target cells not possible with other separation zzso Fluorescent imaging and flow zzso were used for cellular detection to demonstrate the potential application of this method for medical zzso
