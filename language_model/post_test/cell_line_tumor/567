Head and neck zzso cell zzso represents a complex set of zzso arising in diverse anatomical zzso The site and stage of the cancer determine whether patients will be treated with single or zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso is effective in treating some zzso zzso and shows promise for certain zzso zzso As with other human cancer cell lines, zzso causes zzso of zzso zzso cell cycle arrest, and cell death of human zzso cell lines, as measured using flow zzso and zzso zzso Global zzso expression studies following treatment of the zzso cell line zzso with zzso reveal zzso of genes required for zzso zzso and segregation zzso sister zzso cohesion zzso and zzso structure zzso zzso and zzso these zzso changes in gene expression coupled with the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso provide a plausible explanation for the early zzso arrest and cell death zzso When zzso changes in gene expression were compared with gene expression profiles of 41 primary zzso samples, many of the genes that were zzso by zzso showed increased expression in primary zzso suggesting that some patients with zzso may respond to treatment with zzso
