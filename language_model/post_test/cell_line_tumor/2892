zzso cell zzso zzso is characterized by the uncontrolled zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso compounds have shown potent zzso activity against zzso by inducing zzso arrest and zzso However, the exact molecular mechanism by which these compounds function is yet to be zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso zzso compound ON zzso decreased zzso D1 and zzso protein levels in zzso cells, whereas zzso levels of zzso D1 were minimally zzso zzso ON zzso suppressed zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso zzso D1 zzso translation, decreased levels of zzso zzso zzso target of zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso lowered the cap site binding activity of zzso and directly inhibited activity of zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso signaling pathways revealed that ON zzso induced the release of zzso c from zzso altered expression of zzso family of proteins and zzso zzso of zzso Taken together, zzso zzso can cause a rapid decrease of zzso D1 by blocking zzso D1 zzso translation through zzso of the zzso signaling zzso and triggering a zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
