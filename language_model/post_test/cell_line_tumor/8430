Pulmonary zzso hypertension zzso has been associated with a number of different but interrelated zzso zzso zzso and zzso stresses have been shown to play important zzso roles in a variety of model zzso However, many of these relationships remain at the level of zzso We sought to establish a direct role for zzso stress and zzso injury in the zzso of zzso Mice that universally express a zzso zzso in bone zzso protein zzso 2 zzso were exposed to room air or to brief daily zzso zzso oxygen for 3 zzso for 6 weeks, and were compared with zzso animals undergoing identical zzso In both zzso zzso and cultured zzso cells, the expression of zzso zzso was sufficient to cause zzso injury that was particularly pronounced in zzso zzso With the enhancement of zzso generation of zzso oxygen species by zzso zzso injury was substantially enhanced in zzso zzso even in zzso distant from the zzso zzso despite its zzso actions in the pulmonary zzso significantly worsened the zzso zzso zzso right zzso zzso pressure, decreased cardiac zzso and increased pulmonary vascular zzso in zzso zzso zzso These experiments demonstrate that zzso injury and zzso stress contribute directly to disease development, and provide further evidence for zzso as a systemic disease with zzso zzso zzso
