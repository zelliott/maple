In mantle cell zzso zzso and some cases of multiple myeloma zzso zzso D1 expression is zzso by zzso zzso involving the zzso heavy chain zzso zzso To evaluate the mechanisms responsible, gene targeting was used to study long-distance gene zzso zzso these targeted cell lines lost the zzso zzso zzso In these zzso and zzso cells, the zzso zzso D1 zzso locus reverts from zzso zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso induced a loss of zzso at the zzso zzso zzso providing evidence of a zzso regulatory zzso In these cell lines and primary zzso patient samples, the zzso zzso are packaged in zzso zzso binding factor zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso We show that zzso and zzso are bound at the zzso 3' regulatory elements only in the zzso zzso cell zzso Furthermore, zzso short hairpin zzso produces a specific growth arrest in these zzso Our data demonstrate zzso in human cancer and suggest a functional role for zzso and zzso
