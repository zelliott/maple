zzso is a zzso agent for advanced pancreatic cancer zzso However, its efficacy is often limited by its poor zzso metabolism and zzso To exert its zzso activity, zzso requires to be converted to its active zzso zzso Thus, our aim was to improve zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso therapy based on zzso association with the zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion gene zzso and small interference zzso directed against zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso was assessed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene expression and activity were analyzed by reverse zzso chain reaction, Western zzso and zzso For in zzso studies, the treatment efficacy was evaluated on subcutaneous and zzso pancreatic tumor zzso Our data indicated that cell exposure to zzso induced a zzso of zzso expression and zzso of zzso and zzso expression in zzso cells when compared with zzso and zzso zzso The combination of zzso small interference zzso with zzso induced a zzso decrease of zzso zzso in zzso zzso This strong zzso was associated to zzso induction with a remarkable increase in TRAIL expression and a diminution of zzso nuclear zzso zzso In zzso the zzso zzso strongly reduced tumor volumes and significantly prolonged mice zzso Moreover, we observed an obvious increase of zzso and decrease of cell proliferation in tumors receiving the zzso zzso Together, these findings suggest that simultaneous zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso markedly improved zzso therapeutic zzso Clearly, this combined strategy warrants further zzso
