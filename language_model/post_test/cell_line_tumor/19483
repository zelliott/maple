zzso disease zzso zzso zzso is an zzso entity that usually requires zzso in zzso and other interacting zzso zzso levels of zzso expression may lead to the manifestation of zzso We previously showed that zzso zzso was decreased due to zzso of the zzso binding site by two zzso zzso promoter single zzso zzso zzso This prompted us to investigate whether DNA zzso in zzso could play a role in zzso by affecting the zzso properties of the zzso zzso Our initial study on 86 Chinese zzso patients revealed a zzso zzso acid substitution in the zzso zzso In this study, we have examined 102 additional Chinese and 70 Caucasian patients and zzso Chinese and 60 Caucasian zzso zzso subjects as zzso The relevance of the DNA changes detected in zzso by direct sequencing were evaluated using zzso reporter and zzso mouse zzso culture, zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified in 2 Caucasian and 1 Chinese patients zzso In zzso analysis showed that zzso reduced the activity of the zzso promoter by zzso in the presence of the zzso or zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso The apparent binding affinity of the zzso zzso protein was not zzso The zzso zzso may affect the interaction of zzso with its protein zzso The absence of zzso expression in mouse but not in human gut suggests that the role of zzso in gut development differs between the two zzso zzso zzso could contribute to zzso by affecting zzso expression through defective interactions with other zzso zzso
