Huntington disease zzso is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by an abnormal zzso expansion in the protein zzso zzso Currently, no cure is available for zzso The mechanisms by which zzso zzso causes zzso dysfunction and zzso remain to be fully zzso Nevertheless, zzso dysfunction has been suggested as a key event zzso zzso zzso zzso because zzso are zzso and particularly susceptible to energy deficits and zzso zzso zzso a member of zzso family, is localized to zzso and has been implicated in energy zzso zzso we found that cells expressing zzso zzso displayed reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso a natural product among our 22 collected naturally occurring and zzso zzso compounds, significantly attenuated zzso zzso depletion of zzso and protected cells from zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso decreases levels of zzso oxygen species and prevents loss of zzso membrane potential in cells expressing zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso results in decreased zzso activity of zzso and further leads to reduction in cellular zzso levels and zzso zzso in zzso zzso activates zzso zzso and enhances zzso zzso zzso of zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso and diminished the zzso effects of zzso suggesting that zzso mediates the zzso of zzso In conclusion, we establish a novel role for zzso zzso in HD zzso and discovered a natural product that has potent zzso in HD zzso Our results suggest that increasing zzso zzso might be considered as a new therapeutic approach to counteract zzso as well as other neurodegenerative diseases with similar zzso
