zzso zzso depletion is widely used to sensitize cells to zzso treatment inducing the progression of programmed cell death and overcoming zzso It has been reported that zzso cells with zzso amplification are unable to start zzso death and zzso in concert with zzso drugs, efficiently zzso the zzso zzso of zzso through zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso loss induced by zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso leads to overproduction of zzso oxygen species zzso and triggers zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso a representative example of zzso cells, has been attributed to stimulation of total zzso activity in the absence of changes in the level and the activity of zzso zzso the unbalanced zzso zzso milieu has been demonstrated to be critical for the progression of zzso cell death that was efficiently prevented by antioxidants and zzso These results describe a novel zzso of zzso dependent on zzso formation and zzso zzso and independent of zzso zzso and zzso zzso the selective zzso zzso of zzso might be suggested as a potential strategy for zzso zzso cells to therapeutic zzso
