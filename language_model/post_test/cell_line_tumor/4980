The current study was designed to examine the role of zzso in the metabolism of cigarette smoke zzso and clarify whether these zzso by serving as zzso for the zzso zzso zzso may interfere with the zzso of key zzso zzso By zzso zzso zzso species were found to be generated and released into the media of zzso human zzso cells and primary human lung zzso cells labeled with zzso in the presence of cigarette smoke extract zzso zzso several zzso zzso observed in the medium in the absence of zzso either decreased or zzso Eleven previously prepared human zzso zzso were tested for zzso activity with zzso and known cigarette smoke zzso as zzso zzso data revealed zzso zzso zzso and zzso as major zzso responsible for their zzso To examine their zzso effects on the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso were performed in the presence of three representative zzso compounds, namely zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso values determined for the zzso of zzso by zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and 500 zzso respectively, for zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses indicated that the mechanism underlying the zzso of zzso zzso by these cigarette smoke zzso is of a mixed zzso zzso zzso labeling experiments clearly showed zzso of the production of zzso zzso by zzso in a zzso manner in zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso plays a significant role in the metabolism of cigarette smoke zzso By serving as zzso for zzso cigarette smoke zzso may interfere with the metabolism of zzso and other zzso zzso
