We sought to demonstrate that a single systemic administration of zzso (a fusion protein constituted by the zzso zzso specific for the zzso zzso domain of zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso in combination with zzso induced complete and long-lasting tumor zzso in zzso mice and triggered the generation of a specific T zzso immune response that protects the animals from a second tumor challenge, as well as from challenges with zzso tumor cells of different zzso zzso 

Treatment with zzso in combination with zzso induced complete tumor zzso in zzso of zzso mice with zzso zzso and zzso of animals with zzso colon zzso All cured mice rejected challenges with the same tumor cells and, in a very high percentage of animals, also rejected challenges with zzso tumor cells of different zzso zzso In adoptive immunity transfer experiments, the zzso from zzso mice protected zzso mice both from zzso colon zzso and from zzso zzso Similar results were also obtained in adoptive immunity transfer experiments using severely zzso zzso zzso using depleted zzso showed that T cells play a major role in tumor zzso 

The results show that the selective targeting of zzso to the tumor enhances its zzso properties to the point of generating a therapeutic immune response against different zzso unrelated zzso zzso These findings zzso treatment approaches for cancer patients based on the targeted delivery of zzso to the tumor zzso
