Evidence of zzso zzso infection in human gastric cancer zzso has been found in previous zzso In this study, we demonstrate that the expression of zzso a membrane zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso enhances zzso in soft zzso and zzso with human zzso growth factor zzso 2 to inhibit cell zzso zzso truncated zzso zzso with the first 28 zzso acids deleted from its N zzso promotes cell zzso Taken together, our findings suggest that zzso promotes zzso changes in zzso zzso With the identification of this molecular zzso which is responsible for mycoplasma zzso activity, it is possible that a better understanding of the relationship between zzso zzso infection and human gastric zzso will lead to novel zzso and zzso
