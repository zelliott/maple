zzso encounter oxygen deprivation zzso in various zzso and pathological zzso zzso to hypoxic stress occurs in part by suppressing zzso a key regulator of cellular zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been reported to inhibit zzso through multiple means, including disruption of zzso zzso complexes and decreased zzso protein zzso Here we identify enhanced zzso degradation and zzso zzso as important mechanisms for hypoxic zzso zzso in human colon zzso zzso zzso protein levels were similarly reduced in hypoxic primary zzso Increased zzso turnover at low zzso tension was dependent on the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as hypoxic induction of zzso D and zzso zzso zzso protein levels coincided with hypoxic zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso target zzso which zzso regulates independently of its binding partner zzso Finally, zzso zzso in hypoxic cells promoted cell cycle progression but also enhanced cell death via increased expression of the zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso these results indicate that hypoxic cells promote zzso degradation as an zzso strategy to reduce zzso suppress zzso zzso and promote cell survival under low zzso zzso
