zzso zzso is a common finding in zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso delivers a strong survival signal in zzso large cell zzso zzso Although zzso activates multiple zzso zzso the zzso relevance and therapeutic potential of more downstream zzso zzso are mostly zzso In this report, the zzso induction of zzso (but not of zzso was identified in human zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was required to promote zzso expression and its protective effect on zzso zzso zzso of zzso significantly reduced the zzso potential of zzso in both transformed zzso zzso zzso cells and human zzso zzso zzso To zzso the role of zzso in zzso zzso cells expressing a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were injected into nude zzso zzso administration prevented a fatal systemic disease in 15 of 15 zzso injected mice and the appearance of subcutaneous tumor zzso in 9 of 12 zzso in zzso zzso of zzso was also zzso Our results show a pivotal role for zzso in zzso zzso a single protein placed downstream of a known zzso can be crucial for the survival of zzso cells both in zzso and in zzso zzso deserves further investigation as a possible therapeutic target in zzso zzso
