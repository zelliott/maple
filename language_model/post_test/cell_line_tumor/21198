The zzso of gap zzso communication between tumor cells and between tumor and vascular zzso cells during zzso and zzso is zzso The notion of a role for loss of gap zzso zzso communication in zzso and zzso has been zzso While some of the stages of zzso and zzso such as uncontrolled cell division and cellular zzso would zzso the loss of zzso zzso other zzso such as zzso zzso attachment, and zzso likely require increased zzso zzso We hypothesized that, in this zzso zzso zzso is centrally involved as a cell zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor attachment to the pulmonary zzso 

zzso cell attachment to pulmonary zzso tumor growth, and zzso expression was studied in zzso lung tumor sections obtained after zzso injection into nude mice of zzso breast cancer cell lines, zzso wild type zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis was performed using a zzso zzso zzso zzso Orange Red AM dye transfer by zzso imaging was used to evaluate the gap junction zzso 

zzso of breast cancer cells to the pulmonary zzso increased with cancer cells zzso zzso and markedly decreased with cells expressing zzso zzso zzso of zzso was observed in tumor zzso cell contact areas in zzso and in zzso and in areas of zzso blood vessels and in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso by increasing zzso of cancer cells to the lung zzso zzso The marked zzso of zzso in tumor zzso cell contact areas, whether in zzso zzso vessels or in newly formed tumor vessels, suggests that zzso can serve as a potential marker of zzso and tumor zzso and that it may play a role in the early incorporation of zzso cells into small tumors as seeds for zzso
