In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso zzso short hairpin zzso zzso targeting zzso on the growth and zzso of breast zzso The zzso zzso effectively delivered the zzso zzso to zzso cells, leading to significant reduction of zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso reduced cell growth and zzso zzso of zzso cells with suppressed zzso expression in zzso mice reduced tumor growth and zzso These data collectively suggest that zzso zzso is an effective way to suppress zzso expression and to inhibit growth and zzso of breast zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression with zzso represents a promising approach for the treatment of breast zzso
