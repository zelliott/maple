To explore biological aspects of zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso expression plasmids were zzso into zzso zzso cells of zzso and zzso by zzso zzso real-time zzso and Western zzso zzso were performed to evaluate the expression of zzso zzso and protein levels, zzso In zzso cell zzso wound healing and zzso invasion zzso were used to study the biological impact of zzso on cell zzso mobility and zzso 

zzso over expression significantly increased the abilities of zzso migratory and invasion of zzso and zzso cells, comparing with that of the control zzso cells zzso zzso zzso 

zzso expression zzso with the invasion and zzso of zzso zzso zzso
