zzso zzso zzso zzso are used as flame zzso and are universally present in the zzso An exponential increase in zzso zzso in the zzso population have been reported over the last 3 zzso zzso 47 zzso and 99 zzso are the most commonly detected zzso zzso in the environment and in human zzso zzso zzso is the only remaining zzso flame zzso commercially manufactured in the United zzso Several zzso are known to induce zzso in rats, but the mechanism of induction remains zzso The goal of this study was to clarify the mechanism by which zzso zzso induce zzso Treatment of zzso mice with zzso 47, 99, and 209 induced gene expressions of zzso and zzso but not zzso Because the first two genes are known target genes of zzso X zzso zzso a zzso zzso factor in the nuclear hormone zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso zzso are zzso zzso Using reporter gene zzso zzso the present data show that zzso 47, 99, and 209 activated zzso and its human counterpart, steroid X zzso but not zzso hydrocarbon zzso Furthermore, induction of zzso and zzso by zzso 47, 99, and 209 was markedly suppressed in zzso mice, indicating that zzso zzso activate zzso in zzso In zzso our study provides the first evidence that zzso are zzso for zzso nuclear zzso
