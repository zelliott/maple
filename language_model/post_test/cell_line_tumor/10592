The purpose of this study was to develop zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for targeted chemotherapy using zzso as a model zzso 

zzso was zzso and its zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso modified by zzso were prepared by an organic zzso injection method and zzso to obtain zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso cell lines zzso and zzso zzso were cultured with zzso solution, conventional zzso zzso or zzso and the zzso and zzso was evaluated for each zzso The zzso of the zzso preparations into zzso cells was studied by zzso laser scanning zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to study the zzso and tissue distribution characteristics of the zzso 

The existence of an enlarged fixed zzso layer on the surface of the zzso was affirmed by zzso potential zzso The zzso efficiency and particle size distribution were almost the same as those of zzso zzso The drug release profile showed that the release rate was faster at higher molecular weight of the zzso Compared with zzso solution and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated the strongest zzso against two zzso cell lines, the greatest zzso zzso especially in the nucleus, as well as the most powerful zzso zzso In zzso studies, the area under the plasma zzso curve of zzso was increased zzso and zzso times in comparison with the values for the zzso zzso and zzso solution, zzso Meanwhile, a lower concentration of zzso was observed for zzso in the liver and zzso and a significantly higher concentration of zzso in tumors suggested that the presence of zzso on the zzso resulted in greater zzso of the drug in tumor zzso 

zzso modified by zzso could be one of the promising suspensions for the delivery of zzso drugs in zzso
