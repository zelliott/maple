The synthesis and zzso evaluation of zzso C in zzso models are zzso zzso C resulted by zzso a zzso zzso to zzso C zzso zzso which, after zzso afforded zzso zzso zzso C showed high affinity and selectivity for the zzso during zzso zzso on human cancer samples zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 106 zzso 18; and zzso zzso It triggered zzso zzso in zzso cells and zzso release in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C rapidly and specifically zzso at 37 zzso in zzso cells and was stable in mouse zzso zzso C efficiently and specifically localized in human zzso implants in mice zzso zzso zzso at 1 h zzso zzso zzso zzso at 4 h zzso and zzso zzso zzso at 4 h zzso zzso Thus, human zzso zzso such as zzso C, can successfully target zzso human tumors in zzso while displaying attractive biological zzso higher zzso their zzso
