zzso libraries are widely used to identify genes and zzso zzso and as a physical resource for full-length zzso zzso zzso libraries contain a high percentage of zzso zzso Current library construction methods that enrich for full-length zzso are laborious, and involve several zzso steps performed on zzso which renders them sensitive to zzso zzso The SMART technique for full-length enrichment is robust but results in limited zzso insert size of the zzso 

We describe a method to construct SMART full-length enriched zzso libraries with large insert zzso zzso were generated from zzso zzso with an average insert size of up to seven zzso The percentage of full-length clones was calculated for different size ranges from zzso results of over 12,000 zzso 

The presented technique is suitable to generate full-length enriched zzso libraries with large average insert sizes in a straightforward and robust zzso The representation of zzso clones is high also for large zzso zzso zzso zzso when high-quality starting zzso is zzso
