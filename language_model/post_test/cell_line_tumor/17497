To observe the effect of zzso on the proliferation of human gastric zzso cell line zzso and the zzso of zzso 

Using growth zzso zzso zzso and reverse zzso reaction zzso we examined cell growth rates, activities of zzso zzso zzso and -9 zzso and expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells after the treatment with zzso for 24 h and 48 zzso zzso 

zzso had an zzso effect on the growth of zzso zzso Eight days after the treatment with zzso at zzso of 25, 50, 100 and 200 zzso the zzso rates were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso value of zzso for zzso cells was estimated to be 89 zzso The effects of zzso on zzso and zzso activities in zzso cells were not zzso However, the levels of zzso and zzso transcripts were elevated in cells treated with zzso in a zzso zzso 

zzso can inhibit the proliferation of zzso cells, zzso the expression of zzso and zzso zzso and may influence zzso of zzso
