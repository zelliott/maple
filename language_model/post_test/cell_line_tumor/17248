After bacterial infection, zzso dominate the cellular zzso Their main function is assumed to be killing invading pathogens and resolving the inflammation they zzso zzso zzso are also known to release a variety of zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso The release of these zzso during inflammation creates a zzso environment where degradation of different molecules zzso the inflammatory zzso zzso the structural component of zzso on many bacterial species, is a zzso factor with a strong zzso activity on zzso cells and other cell zzso In this study we show that both human and mouse zzso zzso zzso cleave zzso from zzso zzso and other bacterial zzso More important, zzso of zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso G resulted in loss of the biological activity of this zzso factor, as evidenced by the lack of innate host defense gene expression in human zzso zzso The finding that zzso is susceptible to zzso by zzso zzso zzso suggests a novel role for these zzso in the inflammatory response to zzso Not only can these zzso kill bacteria, but they also degrade their zzso factors to halt the inflammatory response they zzso
