zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso essential for control of cell survival during zzso embryonic zzso This suggests that zzso zzso zzso zzso responsible for reducing oxidized zzso may also be a key player in the regulation of zzso zzso With this in mind, we investigated the effects of zzso of zzso zzso or both on zzso cell responses to various zzso zzso zzso zzso of mouse zzso cells were generated that zzso zzso or an zzso fusion zzso zzso was zzso active and was localized in zzso zzso protein level and zzso activity could be increased up to zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed reduced growth rates as compared with control zzso This growth zzso was not due to zzso effects nor related to changes in zzso zzso zzso potential zzso zzso oxygen species production, or to other zzso zzso components such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whose levels were not affected by increased zzso zzso In response to various zzso zzso the extent of zzso zzso zzso oxygen species zzso zzso zzso and loss of viability were remarkably similar in zzso and control zzso Excess zzso did not prevent zzso zzso zzso differentiation of zzso cells nor did it protect them against zzso zzso Neither massive zzso depletion nor zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso cells revealed any differential cellular resistance to zzso or zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that neither zzso nor zzso gain of function modified the zzso regulation of zzso zzso in these zzso zzso
