The zzso surveillance of acute zzso paralysis zzso is a critical component of the initiative of the World Health Organization zzso to eradicate zzso zzso zzso rapid methods are needed either to detect or rule out the presence of zzso during the late stages of zzso especially in zzso zzso 

The aim of this study was to evaluate a fast protocol combining one passage (5 zzso in cell culture followed by zzso and molecular typing in order to detect and type zzso zzso and other zzso associated with zzso zzso 

A total of 216 zzso suspensions from zzso suspected cases were tested by using this approach and compared with the WHO gold zzso 

Using the WHO protocol zzso was detected in 12 out of the 216 zzso samples zzso while with the proposed protocol zzso was detected in 15 out of the 216 zzso samples zzso The additional positive samples detected by the proposed method were classified as zzso zzso zzso 

The proposed protocol showed higher sensitivity than the WHO gold standard, reducing the entire process of identification and typing of the zzso from the typically zzso days to only approximately zzso zzso
