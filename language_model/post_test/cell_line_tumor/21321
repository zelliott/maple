Cellular origins and genetic factors governing the genesis and maintenance of zzso zzso are not well zzso Here, we report a zzso role of the zzso regulator zzso zzso of differentiation 4) in zzso In primary zzso zzso zzso and human zzso cells, we provide evidence that enforced zzso can drive zzso transformation by stimulating increased zzso E to produce a zzso profile and by increased zzso expression with zzso zzso to drive zzso into a neural zzso cell zzso Thus, zzso plays an integral role in the transformation of zzso via its combined actions on zzso cell cycle and differentiation regulatory zzso
