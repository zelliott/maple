The extremely poor prognosis of zzso zzso requires the investigation of other than standard therapies, zzso the application of zzso zzso In our study, we evaluated the effects of the zzso zzso zzso on different established zzso cell lines of rat and human origin and on zzso cultures of human zzso zzso We observed an efficient and zzso killing of all zzso cell cultures at low zzso of infectious particles zzso per zzso Southern zzso analysis of viral DNA amplification, zzso analysis of viral zzso expression and Western zzso analysis of the expression of viral structural zzso and zzso zzso proteins demonstrated the zzso of these viral zzso components in all of the zzso Moreover, all the zzso cells were zzso for the production of infectious zzso virus zzso The amount of virus production differed between a several fold increase of the input virus zzso in most of the zzso cultures up to zzso in one short-term zzso and in the rat zzso zzso cells lines and, more importantly, zzso cultures of human zzso were found to be highly susceptible target cells for zzso virus zzso zzso The formation of fully infectious progeny particles in infected zzso cells offers the chance for the induction of secondary rounds of infection resulting in an advanced zzso zzso These advantageous characteristics of zzso virus infection of zzso cells, combined with the known low toxicity of zzso virus in zzso cells, make zzso zzso a promising candidate for zzso zzso zzso
