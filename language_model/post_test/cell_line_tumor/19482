We hypothesized that differences among individuals in zzso zzso production by zzso zzso zzso cells might contribute to the development of Barrett's zzso We studied the effects of acid and zzso acids on the production of zzso oxygen species zzso in zzso zzso cell lines derived from zzso zzso disease patients with zzso and without zzso Barrett's esophagus and in a Barrett's zzso cell line zzso zzso were incubated with an zzso probe and exposed to zzso zzso neutral zzso acid zzso or zzso zzso acid zzso zzso were zzso in the presence and absence of zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso electron transport chain zzso zzso zzso acid medium induced zzso production in both zzso cell zzso however, only zzso blocked zzso production by zzso cells, whereas both zzso and zzso blocked zzso production by zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso medium and zzso zzso acid medium induced the production of zzso zzso prevented zzso production after exposure to zzso zzso whereas zzso production induced by zzso zzso acid medium was blocked by zzso These studies demonstrate that there are differences between zzso zzso cells and Barrett's zzso cells and between zzso zzso cells from zzso zzso disease patients with and without Barrett's esophagus in the mechanisms of zzso production induced by exposure to acid and zzso zzso
