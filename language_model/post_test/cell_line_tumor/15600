zzso is used routinely in the treatment of established bone zzso However, zzso has not yet been assessed in the prevention of zzso bone zzso and its precise mechanism of action in this disorder remains to be zzso In the present study, zzso or vehicle alone was administered zzso to nude mice either simultaneously or as post zzso injection of the human breast cancer zzso zzso zzso were used first to assess the presence of zzso bone zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that animals treated with zzso early, but not late, showed a slower progression of bone zzso and hind limb paralysis than did zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that only zzso of mice treated with zzso at the time of tumor cell zzso developed bone zzso as compared to over zzso ( zzso of mice receiving vehicle zzso We then analyzed the number of bone zzso and their volume at time of sacrifice by bone zzso In contrast to X-ray analysis, zzso analysis indicates that the number of zzso within bone was similar in zzso and zzso mice but that the zzso were significantly smaller and therefore, often not visible on zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is effective in reducing tumor burden in breast cancer zzso to bone and is most effective as a preventative agent when administered closest in time to zzso of tumor zzso Our data also suggest that zzso acts mainly by zzso the growth of established bone zzso zzso but has no effect on the zzso spread zzso
