zzso zzso zzso is a zzso bound zzso that zzso and zzso zzso such as zzso and substance P and is involved in the transition from zzso regulated zzso prostate cancer zzso to zzso zzso zzso are implicated in growth regulation of different cell types and function as zzso between the neuroendocrine and the immune zzso 

zzso zzso activity of the membrane bound zzso cell zzso zzso zzso production, and zzso as well as changes in cell zzso of zzso cells were evaluated after treatment with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso substance zzso and zzso media derived from a human neuroendocrine cell zzso 

zzso of zzso tumor cells with zzso resulted in a diminished zzso activity, induction of zzso outgrowth which was accompanied by the formation of zzso zzso typical for zzso cells, and an increased production and zzso of zzso zzso proliferation of zzso zzso cells was enhanced by the zzso coming along with an increased number of zzso and zzso zzso had an zzso effect on zzso but not on zzso zzso zzso P did not influence the growth of any of the cell types investigated, whereas zzso media exerted a slightly zzso effect on both cell zzso The activity of zzso zzso bound zzso was enhanced by zzso but was diminished by substance P and zzso zzso 

zzso and activity of zzso degrading zzso is regulated differently by zzso substances in PC cells and cells derived from the zzso zzso with zzso being a potent zzso of cellular differentiation and a potential target for zzso drug design in PC zzso
