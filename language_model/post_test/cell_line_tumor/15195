Breast cancer occur both in zzso and sporadic forms, and the later one comprises an overwhelming majority of breast cancer cases among zzso zzso and structural zzso involving zzso 8, with loss of short arm zzso and gain of long arm zzso are frequently observed in breast cancer cells and zzso In this study, we show that most of the human breast tumor cell lines examined display an over representation of zzso a zzso locus zzso is regionally mapped to, and consequently, a markedly elevated level of zzso zzso An increased zzso zzso level was also observed in a majority of clinical breast tumor samples zzso zzso zzso zzso suppression in zzso breast cancer cells not only significantly inhibit the in zzso zzso survival and in zzso zzso Further studies demonstrate that zzso physically interacts with a major survival zzso and its protein level affects zzso zzso Although loss of zzso function due to gene zzso zzso linked to occurrence of human zzso with features of premature aging and cancer zzso our studies provide the evidence that zzso of zzso due to gene amplification play a critical role in human breast tumor zzso
