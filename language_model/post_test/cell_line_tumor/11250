zzso modification of low molecular weight zzso zzso zzso is known to increase gene zzso efficiency of zzso zzso However, few studies have explored how the zzso zzso groups influence the properties of the modified zzso zzso mainly due to difficulties in obtaining well defined final product compositions and limitations in current chemical synthesis zzso The aim of this study was to modify zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso judiciously with different zzso functional groups and to investigate how zzso molecular structure and inclusion of hydrogen bonding properties in the zzso side groups as well as the zzso degree zzso of primary zzso groups of zzso modified with zzso zzso influence zzso gene zzso zzso The modified zzso were characterized for DNA binding ability, particle size, zzso potential, in zzso gene zzso efficiency and zzso in zzso human zzso cancer and zzso human liver zzso cell zzso The study shows that modified zzso zzso are able to zzso zzso DNA into zzso zzso of sizes zzso zzso whereas unmodified zzso complexes display larger particle sizes of 2 zzso zzso modification also increases the zzso potential of zzso zzso zzso modified zzso shows enhanced zzso efficiency over the unmodified zzso Higher zzso efficiency is obtained when zzso is modified with shorter zzso groups zzso as opposed to longer ones zzso and zzso An aromatic structured functional group zzso also enhances zzso efficiency more than an zzso functional group zzso An added zzso zzso group in the zzso functional group zzso does not enhance zzso efficiency over one without zzso zzso The study also demonstrates that modification degree greatly influences gene zzso and zzso substitution of primary zzso groups leads to significantly lower gene zzso zzso These findings provide insights to modification of zzso for development of effective and zzso zzso zzso
