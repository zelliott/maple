In zzso initiation of DNA replication requires the assembly of a zzso zzso complex zzso at the zzso We recently reported that a zzso zzso zzso origin recognition complex zzso zzso plays a crucial role in stabilizing zzso to zzso Here, we find that zzso is required for the zzso transition in human zzso In addition to binding to zzso zzso associates with zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrate that each zzso of zzso can bind to one zzso of zzso one zzso of zzso and two molecules of zzso Further, zzso directly interacts with the N zzso of zzso and the stability of zzso is dependent on its association with zzso zzso associates with zzso throughout the cell cycle, with zzso during zzso and zzso and with zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in the loss of interaction between zzso and zzso suggesting that increased levels of zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso away from zzso We propose that the dynamic association of zzso with zzso components zzso the assembly of its interacting partners on zzso and zzso DNA replication zzso
