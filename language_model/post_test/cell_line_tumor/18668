zzso zzso is a zzso analog with activity in zzso which requires zzso by zzso zzso zzso to allow formation of its active zzso zzso zzso but can be zzso by zzso zzso zzso membrane transport is also a mechanism of drug zzso In order to facilitate zzso zzso and prolong retention in the cell, zzso zzso were zzso zzso acid groups with a varying zzso chain length and number of double bonds were zzso at the zzso position on the sugar zzso of zzso The compounds were tested in two pairs of zzso resistant zzso cell lines zzso zzso and rat zzso and their resistant zzso zzso and zzso zzso and two pairs of cell lines with a resistance to zzso another zzso analog zzso zzso cancer zzso and zzso colon cancer zzso and their resistant zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have varying degrees of decreased zzso activity, while the mechanism for zzso is not yet zzso In the parent cell lines, zzso was more active, but in the resistant zzso several of the zzso were more active, while the degree of zzso zzso In zzso with a total zzso zzso all compounds were zzso zzso relation analysis showed that zzso derivatives with shorter zzso chains and more double bonds were more active in the parental and drug resistant zzso Further zzso studies were performed with the zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso of zzso partly and induced DNA synthesis zzso effectively in zzso and zzso cells, but the retention of zzso was much longer for zzso than for zzso In contrast to zzso zzso inhibited zzso synthesis for zzso after drug zzso In conclusion, zzso seems to be a promising zzso whose effects were different and longer lasting than for the parent zzso
