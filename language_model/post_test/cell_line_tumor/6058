Although zzso dependency is a zzso characteristic of tumor cells, it remains to be determined whether changes in sulfur zzso acid metabolism occur in cancer cells resistant to zzso zzso We compared zzso of sulfur zzso acid zzso zzso and cellular levels of sulfur zzso acids and their zzso between normal zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso ratio, an index of zzso potential, in zzso cells decreased to zzso relative to that in zzso cells, which may have resulted from zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso homocysteine zzso was zzso in zzso cells, suggesting that acquiring zzso resistance attenuated zzso and activated zzso from zzso to zzso zzso was similar, which is associated with a balance between the increased expressions of zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso Despite an zzso in zzso cellular zzso decreased in zzso cells, which was attributed to zzso of zzso into the medium and zzso of the zzso synthesis zzso zzso zzso cells were more sensitive to the zzso stress induced by zzso and zzso than zzso zzso In conclusion, our results suggest that regulating sulfur zzso acid metabolism may be a possible therapeutic target for zzso cancer zzso These results warrant further investigations to determine the role of sulfur zzso acid metabolism in acquiring zzso drug resistance in cancer cells using chemical and biological regulators involved in sulfur zzso acid zzso
