zzso zzso signaling plays a critical role in normal cellular zzso in normal zzso gastrointestinal development and zzso and in zzso and maintenance of the zzso zzso in a variety of human zzso zzso evidence further implicates the involvement of zzso signaling in zzso and zzso behavior of colon zzso However, zzso approaches to zzso the role of zzso signaling in zzso in general are zzso and data derived on zzso signaling in colon cancer is extremely zzso 

To identify unique downstream targets of the zzso zzso the zzso regulators of zzso zzso in the context of colon zzso we employed a small zzso inhibitor of both zzso and zzso zzso in two human colon cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso Cell cycle analysis demonstrated zzso of zzso cells at the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression profiling of zzso genes identified zzso zzso Genes zzso both common and unique to zzso and zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or by zzso identified zzso zzso and zzso zzso which play a role in the zzso checkpoint, as zzso genes at the zzso zzso Genes that determine further cell cycle progression at zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and genes that regulate passage of cells through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B2 zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso In addition, novel genes involved in stress response, DNA damage response, DNA replication and DNA repair were identified following zzso of zzso zzso 

This study identifies genes that are involved in zzso cellular proliferation in colon cancer cells, and following its zzso genes that regulate cell cycle progression and events downstream of the zzso zzso
