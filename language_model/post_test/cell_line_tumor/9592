zzso of target molecules in tumor cells by small interfering zzso zzso is a promising zzso zzso A major challenge of this approach is the loss of zzso activity of the zzso in zzso Our study aimed at investigating the influence of the serum compartment on the zzso activity of zzso directed against zzso zzso 1 zzso a zzso zzso zzso The data showed that zzso suppression of zzso expression effectively reduced the viable cell mass and increased zzso in several cancer cell zzso zzso of the zzso in human serum led to zzso of the zzso as well as loss of its zzso zzso and zzso zzso This loss of activity was prevented by zzso of zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that the zzso effect of zzso declines upon incubation in human zzso This loss of zzso activity can be prevented by zzso of their degradation by zzso zzso zzso This may have important implications for the development of a human therapeutic application of zzso
