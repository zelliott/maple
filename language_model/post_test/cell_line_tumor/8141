Natural latex does not fall into the category of materials known to be entirely zzso The purpose of this in zzso study was to test the hypothesis that there is no difference in the zzso between zzso of different colors and those from different zzso 

Different latex zzso zzso of different colors zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso were zzso The sample was divided into 7 groups of 24 zzso each: Group T zzso zzso natural latex zzso zzso Groups zzso U2, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso natural latex zzso and colored zzso zzso green, pink, yellow, red and zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed by using cell culture medium containing zzso cells zzso line) derived from human zzso zzso The zzso was evaluated by using the zzso test, which was employed at two different moments zzso and 24 zzso Data were compared by analysis of zzso zzso and zzso test ( zzso 

There was statistically significant difference ( zzso between Group T and all other groups zzso U2, zzso zzso zzso and zzso at 0 and 24 zzso No statistically significant difference ( zzso was found between Groups zzso and zzso zzso and zzso U2 and zzso U2 and zzso U2 and zzso U2 and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso at 0 and 24 zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso promoted less cell zzso compared to the zzso zzso regardless of their zzso
