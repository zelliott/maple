zzso specific zzso 1 zzso also known as zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that regulates the expression of many genes important in cancer progression and zzso It is present in various zzso complexes including those containing the zzso zzso zzso Indeed, zzso of zzso activity and or expression has been shown to zzso zzso signaling in breast cancer cells in zzso implicating this protein in the zzso of zzso zzso we describe experiments that zzso small zzso zzso zzso along with small interfering zzso to probe the role of zzso in breast cancer proliferation and in zzso gene zzso Surprisingly, whereas we have confirmed that zzso of zzso strongly zzso proliferation of breast cancer cells, we have determined that the zzso actions of zzso zzso are not impacted by zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso may be a useful therapeutic target in several types of breast zzso most notably, zzso of zzso may have utility in the treatment of zzso zzso for which there are minimal therapeutic zzso
