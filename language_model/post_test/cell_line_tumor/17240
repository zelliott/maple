Recent studies have implicated a possible role for zzso cells in regulating zzso cells zzso in zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that immature DC are rapidly eliminated by zzso cells in zzso via a zzso dependent on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells and/or zzso of TRAIL function during zzso with immature DC loaded with zzso or tumor zzso significantly enhanced T cell responses to these zzso and zzso tumor zzso These data suggested that zzso cell TRAIL might regulate responses to vaccination by controlling the survival of zzso zzso
