Recent zzso studies raise the possibility that individuals with occupational exposure to low frequency zzso zzso electromagnetic fields zzso are at increased risk of Alzheimer's disease zzso However, the mechanisms through which zzso may affect zzso pathology are zzso We here tested the hypothesis that the exposure to zzso may affect zzso zzso We examined the effect of exposure to zzso zzso 50 zzso zzso on zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso human zzso zzso precursor zzso We found that overnight exposure to zzso zzso a significant increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso without affecting cell zzso These findings show for the first time that exposure to zzso stimulates zzso zzso in zzso thus alluding to a potential link between zzso exposure and zzso processing in the zzso
