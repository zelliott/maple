zzso growth factor binding zzso zzso has both zzso and zzso effects on cell growth, which are frequently zzso Interestingly, the development of a more aggressive zzso in breast cancer cells zzso zzso positively with elevated expression of zzso and is often associated with zzso acid zzso zzso was previously demonstrated to interact directly with zzso X zzso zzso In this study we have shown that zzso also interacts with zzso and that both zzso interact with zzso acid zzso zzso To investigate whether the presence of zzso regulates breast cancer cell responsiveness to zzso we zzso the zzso expressed by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso (which express zzso zzso and showed that they become more sensitive to the zzso effects of zzso Similarly, in zzso cells expressing a reporter gene under the control of an zzso response element zzso depletion of zzso resulted in the induction of reporter gene expression in response to zzso In investigating possible mechanisms for zzso regulation of zzso we found that zzso blocked the formation of zzso zzso and disrupted the zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso has the potential to reduce the zzso zzso of target genes and zzso the zzso in zzso
