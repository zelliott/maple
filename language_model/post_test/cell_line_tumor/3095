A new method was developed to measure zzso zzso relaxation in zzso containing a focal area of zzso iron oxide zzso zzso cells in which the zzso zzso is too short to be accurately measured using regular zzso echo zzso zzso The proposed method zzso the relatively long zzso relaxation of zzso cells and acquires a series of spin echo images with the zzso echo shifted to sample the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments in zzso and rats with zzso tumors demonstrated that it can detect zzso zzso down to 1 zzso or zzso The measured zzso values were about zzso higher than those from the zzso TE zzso zzso The shorter the zzso the less the zzso deviated from the zzso zzso zzso Combined with the regular zzso zzso this technique is expected to provide zzso of highly concentrated zzso cells from direct cell zzso
