The zzso zzso signaling zzso regulates the development of many zzso in zzso and zzso of this zzso is widely observed in human zzso Although it is known that zzso signaling activates the expression of genes involved in cell growth, the precise role of the zzso zzso in cancer development is still zzso Here, we show that zzso activated zzso of zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso signaling pathway, inhibit the zzso of the tumor zzso protein zzso This zzso was also observed in the presence of zzso zzso or with the zzso of the zzso factors zzso and zzso downstream zzso of zzso indicating that this zzso is specific for the zzso zzso We also report that zzso zzso augment zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and promote zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso signaling induced the zzso of human zzso protein on zzso 166 and zzso which are zzso zzso sites of zzso zzso zzso enhanced the proliferation of mouse embryonic zzso zzso while inducing a zzso zzso Moreover, zzso partially inhibited zzso zzso and cell growth zzso in zzso zzso We also found that zzso of zzso is inhibited by zzso signaling in several human cancer cell zzso zzso the zzso zzso may be a powerful accelerator of zzso by zzso cell proliferation and zzso the zzso zzso barrier induced by zzso zzso
