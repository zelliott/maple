The zzso zzso zzso and zzso family of proteins is a group of zzso zzso involved in both zzso and pathological zzso zzso expression of the zzso (also known as zzso zzso zzso gene has been detected in clinical samples of the skeletal muscle cancer zzso with the highest expression found in the zzso zzso zzso Over zzso of zzso are characterized by a zzso zzso fusion zzso factor zzso In this study, we linked elevated zzso levels in zzso cells to zzso zzso We found reduced zzso levels in zzso cells following small interfering zzso zzso of zzso and increased zzso levels in C2 zzso following zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso zzso analyses confirmed that the zzso gene was a direct target for zzso zzso zzso through a zzso DNA sequence in the first zzso of the zzso zzso To determine the function of zzso we showed that zzso and zzso expression of zzso decreased survival and increased differentiation in zzso cells, zzso In addition, we found that zzso supplied zzso protein promoted zzso cell zzso migration and zzso zzso Taken together, data from this study have zzso provided a zzso basis for the zzso zzso in zzso cells, and zzso identified zzso as an zzso factor that contributes to the aggressive behavior of zzso cells, perhaps through a positive feedback zzso Thus, zzso may be an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in zzso
