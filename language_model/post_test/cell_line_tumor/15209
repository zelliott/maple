zzso is an zzso family member protein that zzso in zzso zzso It has zzso structure consisting of 60 zzso zzso and 80 zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso has the zzso activity for zzso zzso whereas zzso consists of multiple zzso with different functions such as targeting zzso to the zzso zzso zzso severing by zzso and even suppressing zzso zzso Despite the various important functions of zzso its zzso regulation has not been studied zzso zzso zzso factor has been shown to interact with zzso and regulate the zzso of another zzso severing zzso zzso In spite of zzso importance, and structural and functional similarities to zzso there is no study on the zzso regulation of zzso zzso In this study, we aimed to characterize zzso promoter and analyze the effects of zzso on zzso zzso We identified a zzso zzso zzso promoter including a critical zzso island and zzso boxes as an optimal promoter, and sequential deletion of zzso island and the zzso elements gradually decreased the zzso promoter zzso In addition, we showed zzso binding on the zzso promoter by zzso We found that zzso activated zzso promoter, and increased both zzso and protein levels of zzso in zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso treatment increasing zzso decreased zzso promoter zzso Since zzso severing is an important cellular mechanism of which malfunctions result in serious diseases such as zzso zzso Alzheimer's disease and cell cycle related disorders, identification of zzso zzso regulation is crucial in understanding the coordination of zzso severing activity by different proteins in the zzso
