We identified that the chemical linkage of the zzso drug zzso onto zzso a natural zzso precursor of the zzso zzso led to the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso mean diameter, with an original zzso zzso This unique zzso zzso zzso high drug zzso zzso decreased toxicity of the coupled zzso compound, zzso improved therapeutic response, zzso use of zzso zzso material, and zzso ease of preparation, all criteria that are not combined in the currently available zzso Cell culture viability tests and zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso displayed comparable zzso and zzso effects than the native zzso because of the high activity of zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso In zzso experiments have shown that the zzso zzso dramatically improved the zzso zzso compared with free zzso zzso the zzso lung tumors that did not respond to zzso treatment were found inhibited by zzso when treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pancreatic tumor zzso in mice decreased by zzso compared with the tumors in the zzso mice, which was significantly higher than the zzso reduction achieved by native zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a fivefold higher zzso dose than the free drug, and moreover, the zzso study has evidenced that zzso zzso did not cause any zzso zzso such as those induced by the free zzso zzso Taken together, these findings demonstrate that zzso zzso make tumor cells more sensitive to zzso and reduce the cardiac zzso thus providing a remarkable improvement in the drug's therapeutic zzso
