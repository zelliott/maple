The zzso zzso of the zzso family zzso zzso has been established as a poor zzso factor in zzso zzso zzso however, the family zzso which contribute to the zzso have not been zzso This study aimed to identify the zzso zzso contributing to cell growth using zzso interference in various zzso cell zzso zzso of Yes but not of zzso or zzso in zzso cells leads to cell growth zzso This zzso effect caused by Yes zzso mainly depends on zzso cell cycle arrest and partly the induction of zzso Also, the knockout of Yes zzso the zzso of zzso signaling and subsequently decreases the levels of zzso D necessary for zzso transition in the cell zzso In addition, Yes knockout has less effect on cell growth suppression in zzso zzso zzso cells compared to other zzso cells which express the zzso Overall, we conclude that Yes is a central zzso for zzso cell growth that is not shared with other zzso such as zzso
