zzso protein zzso is a zzso marker for diffuse large zzso zzso zzso where high expression of zzso is found in the zzso center zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression is low or absent in the activated zzso (ABC) zzso As compared with the zzso zzso patients with ABC zzso have a poorer prognosis after standard treatment, and ABC tumor cells have higher zzso zzso zzso we show that increased expression of the zzso target zzso zzso is correlated with reduced expression of zzso factor zzso and zzso in several zzso cell zzso Moreover, zzso shift zzso and zzso reporter zzso indicate that zzso can directly activate expression from the zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso (a zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso human zzso cell line or zzso in the chicken zzso zzso cell line causes reduced expression of zzso The zzso zzso also causes a decrease in zzso levels in zzso zzso Similarly, zzso of zzso which is known to zzso zzso leads to reduced expression of zzso in zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso expression is reduced in zzso cells after treatment with the zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso is induced by zzso treatment or expression of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso These results point to an zzso mechanism for zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso that increased zzso activity leads to increased zzso which results in decreased zzso and consequently reduced zzso zzso and zzso
