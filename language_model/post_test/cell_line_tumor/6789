zzso drugs are zzso agents that bind zzso and zzso Resistance to these drugs is a major clinical zzso One hypothesis is that the cellular composition of zzso zzso may predict the sensitivity of a tumor to zzso Reliable and sensitive methods for measuring zzso zzso levels in cells and zzso are needed to address this zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso have frequently relied upon zzso protein amounts from zzso zzso To determine whether this approach is zzso protein and zzso levels of zzso zzso from 12 human cancer cell lines were zzso This work focused on only zzso zzso because we had readily available zzso zzso for quantitative zzso The percentage of zzso zzso classes I, II, III, and zzso + zzso zzso and protein were zzso For zzso class I that comprises zzso of the zzso protein in 10 of the 12 cell lines, there was good agreement between zzso and protein zzso zzso between zzso and protein was also found for zzso class zzso For zzso classes zzso + zzso we observed higher protein levels compared to zzso zzso class II protein was found in only four cell lines and in very low zzso We conclude that quantitative Western zzso is a reliable method for measuring zzso zzso levels in human cancer cell zzso zzso protein amounts from zzso levels should be done with caution, since the correspondence is not zzso for all zzso zzso
