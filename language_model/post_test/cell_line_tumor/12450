zzso zzso C zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have been implicated in the effects of regulatory peptides on zzso We studied how zzso was activated by zzso following regulatory zzso or zzso zzso stimulation and we also investigated the effect of zzso zzso on proliferation in zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso receptors were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA synthesis was studied by measuring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were selectively inhibited with zzso and 200 zzso zzso their zzso was detected by zzso zzso and by zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso cascade zzso was detected with zzso zzso and inhibited with 20 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso These effects were inhibited by zzso but not by zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso in proliferation zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso caused zzso to membrane zzso of zzso and zzso zzso that was inhibited by zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso was prolonged following zzso and zzso but transient after zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all activated zzso while zzso expression was increased by only zzso and zzso but not by zzso each of these effects is inhibited by zzso In conclusion, our results provide evidence for zzso differential zzso zzso and growth regulation in zzso zzso Identification of the mechanisms by which these key signaling pathways are modulated could provide a basis for the development of novel therapeutic interventions to treat pancreatic zzso
