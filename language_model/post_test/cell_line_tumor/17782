Under zzso conditions, major zzso complex zzso I molecules are associated with zzso that are collectively referred to as the zzso class I zzso zzso zzso Very little is known about the genesis and molecular composition of the zzso zzso We developed a novel zzso mass zzso approach that yields an accurate definition of the nature and relative abundance of zzso peptides presented by zzso I zzso We identified 189 and 196 zzso zzso peptides from normal and zzso mouse zzso zzso By zzso our zzso data with global profiling of the zzso we reached two zzso The zzso repertoire of primary mouse zzso is biased toward peptides derived from highly abundant transcripts and is enriched in peptides derived from zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, we found that approximately zzso of zzso zzso peptides were zzso expressed on normal versus zzso zzso zzso half of those peptides are derived from molecules directly implicated in zzso transformation zzso components of the zzso zzso In most cases, zzso of zzso I peptides on cancer cells entailed zzso zzso Our results show that zzso analysis and sequencing of zzso zzso peptides yields unique insights into the genesis of the zzso repertoire in normal and zzso zzso
