The relationship between the structures of zzso on the surface of zzso cells, a human zzso cell line, and the cell behaviors was studied by using zzso and zzso to remove the terminal zzso or zzso zzso of surface zzso zzso The cell zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso vein zzso cell zzso as well as cell zzso migration and invasion were selected as the parameters of the cell zzso It was found that zzso zzso was not essential for the cell zzso to zzso but was important in the cell zzso to zzso and zzso cell invasion, and very crucial in the cell zzso to zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was probably participate in cell zzso to zzso zzso and zzso but not important in zzso migration and zzso The cell zzso to zzso zzso migration and invasion were inhibited by the zzso zzso of zzso Lewis X zzso but not by the zzso of zzso Lewis X zzso This result supports the finding that zzso zzso is more important than zzso zzso in the contribution to the zzso three cell zzso
