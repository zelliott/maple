The zzso zzso zzso possesses 3 zzso activities in zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso a protein zzso zzso and a more recently characterized zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso has been implicated in suppression of zzso in breast zzso cell lines, potential relevance of the zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso function has not been addressed in zzso To this end, zzso zzso and zzso analyses of zzso expressed zzso zzso proteins have identified zzso that disrupt the zzso zzso alone zzso to Ala, or zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso activities zzso zzso A, zzso zzso or all 3 activities simultaneously zzso zzso Although forced expression of zzso zzso suppressed spontaneous lung zzso of subcutaneous tumor zzso derived from the human melanoma cell line zzso no significant zzso zzso activity was obtained with the zzso zzso zzso A and zzso zzso The zzso F zzso which lacked both the zzso and zzso zzso while retaining the zzso zzso also exhibited compromised zzso zzso In contrast, each zzso retained the ability to suppress zzso and invasive characteristics of zzso cells in culture, indicating that the zzso zzso possesses an additional zzso zzso these zzso zzso These studies provide the first demonstration that the zzso zzso activity of zzso is necessary for zzso zzso function and further indicate zzso of the 3 zzso activities of the zzso on suppression of the zzso zzso
