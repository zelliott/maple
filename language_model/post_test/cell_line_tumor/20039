zzso zzso factors, such as zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso toward a regulatory zzso zzso characterized by the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we explored molecular mechanisms allowing zzso to zzso the zzso protein zzso in primary human zzso zzso zzso of full-length or deletion zzso of the zzso promoter provided evidence that zzso production is zzso dependent, activated downstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as being zzso zzso The involvement of zzso and zzso was shown by zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis, as well as decoy zzso scavenging both zzso and zzso in human zzso Furthermore, the production of zzso in zzso in response to zzso zzso cellular growth and proliferation of zzso breast cancer zzso We conclude that both zzso and zzso are needed to elicit zzso zzso expression in primary human zzso zzso zzso shapes the zzso zzso zzso to promote growth of zzso breast cancer zzso Our data point to a zzso zzso axis that might contribute to tumor zzso
