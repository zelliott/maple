Aurora zzso are key regulators of zzso progression and have also been implicated in zzso Small molecules that inhibit Aurora zzso have shown impressive zzso activity in zzso studies and are currently under clinical zzso In this study, our data show that suppression of Aurora activity with a specific inhibitor prevents the proliferation of breast cancer zzso zzso modeling studies indicate that the Aurora inhibitor suppresses Aurora activity by competitive displacement of zzso zzso the Aurora inhibitor causes the zzso of zzso cells, leading to profound zzso in the absence of zzso zzso Further studies show that the sensitivity of cancer cells to the Aurora inhibitor is independent of the zzso zzso In addition, the Aurora inhibitor acts zzso with the zzso zzso but not with the zzso in zzso cell proliferation and inducing zzso These results suggest that Aurora zzso might be effective in zzso zzso cancer cells and a combination of Aurora zzso with the zzso zzso is a promising approach for cancer zzso
