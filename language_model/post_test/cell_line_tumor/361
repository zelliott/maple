The aim of this study was to reveal the relationships between structure elements of zzso and their zzso zzso The human leukemia cell line zzso as a model of blast crisis of chronic zzso leukemia and a set of 18 different zzso from four zzso zzso were used for researching these zzso zzso between structure and zzso zzso and differentiation activities of zzso were estimated by zzso comparative analysis of selected zzso that differ in one structure zzso We found that C4 zzso and zzso double bonds are critical structure elements for zzso activity of zzso We also observed that the zzso of zzso groups in the B ring of the zzso zzso has an advantage over other zzso of B ring zzso zzso At the same time, zzso with a zzso B ring were more zzso In the A ring, zzso status of zzso is not critical for zzso activity of the zzso whereas the appearance of the zzso group in the zzso position of the zzso zzso significantly decreased the zzso zzso concentration required for 50% zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was associated with dramatically decreased zzso These data may help in the rational design of zzso zzso with improved zzso zzso
