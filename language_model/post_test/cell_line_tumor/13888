zzso zzso II zzso zzso is a dual function protein with both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Previous studies have implicated zzso as a zzso zzso however, our recent findings indicate that zzso II may act as a survival factor in various cell zzso The purpose of this study was to survey zzso II expression in normal tissue and spontaneous zzso of dogs and zzso by Western zzso and zzso zzso liver and adrenal zzso exhibited prominent expression of zzso II while other zzso including zzso zzso displayed limited expression and zzso zzso II zzso in normal zzso was zzso to the level of expression in all zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue and that showing benign zzso did not express zzso zzso However, zzso zzso of canine zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso strongly expressed zzso II in either a zzso cellular or combined zzso The pattern of expression was not related to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso complex or zzso except that two zzso canine zzso zzso showed prominent zzso II zzso Two canine zzso zzso cell lines showed prominent zzso zzso and when the zzso activity was zzso the cells became more sensitive to zzso cell zzso Thus, zzso II was significantly expressed in zzso zzso from dogs and cats and zzso of zzso II was similar to that reported in humans zzso The zzso effect of zzso II in canine zzso zzso cell lines was similar to that previously reported in humans zzso
