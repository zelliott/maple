We have previously demonstrated that prostate zzso cells exposed to zzso radiation zzso expressed more genes compared to zzso zzso To understand the role of zzso in regulation of zzso gene zzso we analyzed zzso expression in zzso zzso and zzso prostate cancer cells treated with zzso radiation and zzso radiation by zzso zzso zzso were studied in zzso normal prostate zzso cells by zzso zzso radiation significantly altered more zzso as compared to zzso zzso zzso of zzso cluster was observed only in the zzso positive zzso and zzso cells treated with zzso radiation and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso data by zzso target filter analysis revealed an inverse correlation between zzso cluster and several targets including zzso in zzso signaling zzso The base level expressions of these zzso were significantly different among the cell lines and did not predict the radiation zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso by zzso radiation in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells indicating that zzso zzso expression may not be regulated by zzso zzso Our data support the potential for using zzso radiation to induce molecular targets and zzso zzso may have a significant role in predicting zzso
