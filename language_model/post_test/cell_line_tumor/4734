Classical experimental design zzso that subjects, randomly separated into experimental and control groups, are independent and zzso zzso given to the experimental group ought to have no effect on the control group, which functions as a baseline to illustrate zzso otherwise would have zzso Any change in the control group is often labeled an zzso Examples of these types of anomalous phenomena can be found in zzso research, which often shows zzso unexpected and unexplained changes in control zzso In four previously reported experiments on anomalous healing using zzso with zzso on mice injected with lethal doses of zzso zzso zzso The Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, zzso code, zzso host strain, zzso a high percentage of both experimental and control mice exhibited an anomalous healing pattern, most often passing through stages of tumor zzso to full zzso zzso 

In order to explain tumor zzso of control animals, I zzso the formation of zzso zzso which can link zzso separate zzso zzso given to the experimental animals can result in an unintended treatment to the control animals, producing anomalous healing akin to zzso zzso 

A recently completed experiment at the zzso zzso campus of the Indiana University School of Medicine has produced a successful test of resonance zzso One group of mice zzso zzso 30) was injected with zzso zzso cells and randomly divided into a treated group zzso zzso zzso and zzso control group zzso zzso zzso A second group of zzso controls zzso zzso 25) was left zzso Mice from each group were zzso sacrificed to measure zzso values and zzso zzso 

As predicted by resonance theory, there were few differences between treated and zzso animals from the first group, but there were significant differences between these animals and the zzso zzso 

Some implications for zzso research and the way we normally zzso Type II errors will be zzso Researchers are invited to zzso past data in light of resonance zzso
