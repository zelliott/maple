zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso is a focus for study at zzso Up to now, its role and functions in zzso zzso were not fully zzso In this study, we investigated the expression of zzso in zzso zzso and the impact of its zzso on tumor zzso We found that the expression of zzso was decreased significantly in 158 cases of zzso zzso zzso as compared with their adjacent zzso counterparts, and its expression was also significantly decreased in various human zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso by specific zzso promoted the growth of normal liver cell lines, whereas zzso zzso inhibited the growth of zzso zzso cell lines in zzso and caused dramatic zzso of tumor growth in zzso by induction of cell cycle zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso zzso could zzso the expression of zzso A, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but zzso the expression of zzso zzso the results were inverse when zzso was zzso by specific zzso zzso we provided the evidence that zzso was a potential tumor zzso and might be used as a therapeutic target for zzso zzso
