zzso zzso zzso 5) has strong zzso effects on zzso proliferation and zzso It was reported that zzso can reduce zzso zzso resulting in clinically relevant zzso zzso To determine whether addition of a zzso zzso could improve the zzso zzso and zzso activities of zzso we genetically modified zzso with an zzso zzso zzso which is a zzso with high affinity for zzso and zzso zzso The fusion protein zzso was expressed in the zzso zzso system and the biological activity of zzso was assessed in zzso and in zzso The results showed that the zzso exhibited a more potent effect of zzso zzso cell proliferation and migration compared with that of traditional zzso zzso also displayed stronger zzso activity in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso also showed stronger zzso and zzso effects in zzso zzso mice compared with traditional zzso In conclusion, the biological activity of zzso can be further improved by the addition of a zzso zzso and the zzso may prove to be a promising novel candidate for cancer zzso
