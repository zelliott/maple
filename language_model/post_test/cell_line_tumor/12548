To study the effect of zzso zzso on the proliferation of human zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso in zzso 

zzso cells allocated in different groups were treated with different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso The zzso effect of zzso and its zzso and zzso relationship were detected with zzso the zzso rate and cell cycle were evaluated by flow zzso and the changes of zzso zzso expression in cells were measured using zzso zzso 

After being exposed to zzso the zzso cell proliferation was decreased in a zzso and zzso manner; cell zzso rate raised as the increasing concentration of zzso and acting time; cells retarded at zzso phase in the cell cycle zzso and the zzso zzso expression in cells zzso zzso 

zzso can zzso and zzso inhibit the proliferation of zzso cell by reducing zzso zzso ratio to produce a zzso phase arresting in cell zzso
