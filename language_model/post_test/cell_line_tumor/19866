zzso use of zzso such as zzso is associated with drug zzso which is correlated with the zzso of zzso zzso This latter process involves zzso of zzso receptors by G zzso receptors zzso zzso and subsequent zzso by zzso To explore these molecular mechanisms, zzso cell lines, zzso expressing the zzso zzso provide an ideal cellular zzso Unfortunately, there are two major zzso zzso these cells are zzso to zzso introduction, resulting in low zzso zzso zzso continuous zzso of zzso cells invariably leads to zzso drift of the cultures even after an zzso zzso So, these cells were dropped in favor of zzso expression systems, which are easier to zzso but whose relevance as adequate cellular model for studying zzso zzso regulation should be questioned, as recently demonstrated by zzso zzso Kim, zzso zzso von zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso zzso of zzso receptors in zzso zzso zzso zzso 25, zzso In this work, we describe a method, based on zzso cell sorting zzso to select and maintain a high proportion of zzso zzso cells (a zzso cell line zzso expressing human zzso zzso zzso expressing the zzso fused to green fluorescent protein zzso While in functional experiments, we were not able to observe a major effect in zzso zzso cells expressing zzso the enrichment by zzso with zzso resulted in a robust increase of zzso expression associated with strong zzso zzso Moreover, this method also allows to counteract the zzso drift and to maintain a zzso selection of zzso cells expressing zzso Thus, this approach provides a valuable tool for exploring zzso receptors zzso in zzso zzso
