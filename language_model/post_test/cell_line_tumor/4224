Small zzso proteins of the zzso family orchestrate the zzso zzso events required for cell zzso zzso zzso exchange factors zzso and zzso proteins zzso promote cycling of zzso zzso between the active zzso and the inactive zzso zzso We report that zzso a previously zzso zzso is predominantly expressed in zzso cells and has an essential role in the division of T zzso zzso of zzso in zzso delays cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso or expression of a zzso zzso zzso precocious zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as excessive zzso In relation to these zzso we show that zzso acts as a GAP for zzso and controls recruitment of zzso and zzso II to the plasma membrane of zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso of zzso which is crucial to maintain the zzso and shape of zzso In addition to its effects on cell shape, zzso of zzso in zzso also zzso zzso zzso
