In this study, we evaluated the ability of zzso zzso zzso to zzso peptides zzso harboring the zzso and nuclear import sequences zzso of zzso zzso protein to inhibit the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sensitize zzso and zzso human breast cancer zzso cells to the zzso effects of treatments that induce or do not induce zzso BC cells were treated with increasing zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso the zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or increasing doses of zzso zzso zzso Western zzso was used to evaluate zzso zzso The effect of treatment on cell cycle distribution was zzso Growth zzso was measured by the zzso zzso zzso of zzso was increased in zzso cells treated with zzso or zzso but not by zzso zzso cells exhibited zzso zzso following exposure to zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso caused cell cycle arrest in zzso phase for zzso zzso zzso caused zzso arrest in zzso cells and prolonged S phase in zzso zzso zzso caused an increase in cells in zzso phase for zzso and zzso zzso cells were zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells were zzso by zzso and inhibited by zzso and zzso Combining zzso with zzso zzso zzso amplified the zzso effect on zzso cells zzso to zzso but had no effect on the growth stimulation of zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso to zzso but had no effect on the growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso cells zzso to zzso We conclude that zzso zzso are promising zzso for zzso cancer therapies and that their zzso is dependent on zzso zzso zzso This general approach could potentially be extended to other zzso molecules that are associated with tumor growth and zzso
