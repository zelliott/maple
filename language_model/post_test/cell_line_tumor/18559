zzso of zzso zzso during DNA replication is frequently used for cell cycle zzso The flow zzso zzso zzso technique is conducive to high-resolution assessment of cell cycle zzso but requires continuous zzso treatment, which may have zzso or zzso zzso Here, we have examined the impact of zzso on the proliferation of zzso and zzso breast cancer cell lines and compared the observed effects with cell proliferation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells, previously described to be sensitive and insensitive to zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso DNA zzso were performed to identify zzso zzso in the zzso fraction and in cell cycle zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to identify potential induction of zzso by zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso and zzso cultures was reduced in different cell cycle zzso due to continuous treatment with 60, zzso and zzso zzso m zzso This effect, which was not found in zzso cultures, was dependent on exposure time zzso versus 48 zzso and was also zzso for zzso and zzso zzso application does not induce zzso or necrosis as revealed with the zzso zzso zzso We concluded that continuous zzso treatment did not affect cell zzso but essentially alters cell cycle progression in three out of four cell lines zzso zzso specific validation of the feasibility of the powerful zzso zzso technique is required and zzso
