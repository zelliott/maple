Adult zzso zzso zzso is a peripheral zzso zzso with dismal zzso and no optimal therapy has been zzso We tested the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso to develop a novel zzso for this zzso zzso In the presence of peripheral blood zzso cells zzso from healthy adult donors, zzso induced zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso against zzso zzso cell lines and primary tumor cells obtained from zzso zzso We next examined the zzso zzso against primary zzso cells in an zzso zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso by zzso zzso cells was generally lower than that zzso by zzso control zzso zzso However, a robust zzso activity was induced in some cases, which was comparable with that zzso by zzso zzso zzso It suggests that the zzso patients' zzso retain substantial zzso function, although the optimal conditions for zzso effect have not yet been zzso In addition, we also found a high expression of zzso zzso and zzso a hallmark of regulatory T cells, in zzso cells, indicating the possibility that zzso cells originated from regulatory T zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso expression in normal zzso along with zzso zzso by zzso of zzso T cells in zzso Our data suggest not only that the zzso zzso could be a suitable target for the novel zzso therapy for patients with zzso but also that zzso may induce effective tumor immunity by reducing the number of regulatory T zzso
