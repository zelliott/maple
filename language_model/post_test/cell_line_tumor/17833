Previous studies have identified that the expression of zzso is tissue specific and the protein has been found to be most abundant in liver and zzso However, the expression of zzso in human zzso zzso and its relationship to differentiation and transformation of zzso zzso have not been zzso In this study, the expression of zzso in human zzso zzso was examined by Northern and Western zzso zzso We found that zzso was significantly zzso in most of zzso zzso zzso compared with adjacent zzso zzso zzso at both zzso and protein zzso We looked into the possibility that this decreased expression of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso may play a role in the differentiation or zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the reduced expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso was correlated with the tumor differentiation status as graded by the zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso of zzso was not able to suppress the proliferation of human zzso cells and zzso in nude zzso These results suggest that zzso does not seem to act as a tumor zzso zzso however, it may useful as a zzso that will assist in the grading of the differentiation status of zzso zzso zzso
