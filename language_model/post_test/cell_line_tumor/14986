zzso occurring zzso zzso zzso from the marine sponge zzso zzso consisting of zzso containing polar zzso and zzso zzso chain zzso have been demonstrated to exert a wide range of biological activities, including a selective zzso against zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso zzso an analog of zzso with defined zzso chain length and molecular size, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso at zzso zzso that are too low to be zzso zzso zzso or generally zzso In the present study we show that zzso zzso zzso tumor cell growth and activates zzso zzso zzso was not toxic for normal lung zzso Furthermore, in zzso cells, zzso reduced the adverse zzso zzso effects of zzso Our results suggest that zzso or similar compounds might be considered as lead compounds to develop zzso therapeutic agents for at least certain types of lung zzso
