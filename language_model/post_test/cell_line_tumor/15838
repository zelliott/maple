Loss of zzso is frequently observed in zzso prostate cancer, resulting in the deregulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso signaling pathways that have been implicated in prostate zzso and progression to an advanced zzso The pathways of zzso and zzso zzso leading to the promotion and regulation of zzso zzso However, loss of zzso may permit zzso to progress prostate cancer to an advanced zzso In the present study, we investigated the involvement of zzso in zzso zzso When screening advanced zzso prostate cancer cell lines for zzso we observed a loss of expression in zzso and zzso cells whereas zzso expressed zzso zzso All three cell lines were positive for surface expression of zzso zzso of zzso induced a zzso to zzso like zzso change and inhibited zzso migration and proliferation in zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso enhanced the zzso migratory behavior of zzso zzso By Western zzso analysis, we observed that zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso in zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso but not zzso of zzso The zzso migration of zzso cells was through the zzso pathway, as confirmed by chemical zzso On the basis of these studies, we suggest that loss of zzso permits zzso functions in prostate cancer cells through the zzso zzso zzso zzso and downstream signaling zzso may provide an efficient approach for treating patients with advanced prostate cancer when hormone therapy fails to the stop the growth and zzso of zzso
