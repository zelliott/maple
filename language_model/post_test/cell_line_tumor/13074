It has been proposed in human zzso zzso zzso a minority subset of cancer cells within tumors able to initiate tumor growth, defined as cancer stem cells zzso Solid human primary zzso and its zzso zzso cancer zzso were collected from fresh surgical samples and subsequent zzso were established in zzso zzso combined zzso zzso zzso The resulting tumors were zzso into zzso suspensions and a zzso cell line zzso was newly established and analyzed by flow zzso Surface markers of zzso cells were zzso zzso and expression of stem cell and zzso genes was zzso zzso zzso molecules were investigated by zzso array zzso Finally, different numbers of zzso were implanted and their zzso properties were investigated in zzso zzso zzso injection of zzso in zzso mice induced tumors with developing progressive zzso dissemination and zzso zzso cells maintained a differentiated zzso and reproduced the full zzso and zzso zzso of their parental zzso zzso zzso lacked the expression of conventional zzso markers zzso and zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso but showed the expression of an important gastrointestinal development marker zzso and zzso that is essential in regulating the zzso activity of normal and zzso stem zzso In addition, zzso zzso high amounts of important zzso zzso These results provide a novel and extensive model in human zzso for studying the generation and maintenance of zzso zzso in zzso
