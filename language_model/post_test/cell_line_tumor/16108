The zzso zzso zzso is crucial for zzso bone zzso and might become a therapeutic target for zzso In this study, we raised zzso zzso zzso against three different zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso which are the zzso regions found in zzso dominant zzso type II patients and examined the effects of these zzso on the zzso zzso current induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using the zzso patch clamp technique and bone zzso activity in mouse zzso zzso dialysis of zzso with zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso application of zzso to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso These zzso also suppressed the zzso zzso current in zzso zzso zzso zzso however, zzso currents evoked by zzso stimulation and the inherent inwardly zzso zzso currents in mouse zzso were unaffected by these zzso Furthermore, zzso applied zzso and zzso also reduced bone zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that these zzso specifically block zzso in mouse zzso Thus, zzso zzso have potential promise for treatment of zzso
