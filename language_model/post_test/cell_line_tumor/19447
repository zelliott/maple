There are several limitations to the use of the classical zzso cell culture and the results obtained by means of zzso The two-dimensional architecture and the analysis of pure cell populations of individual cell lines are the most several zzso from the situation prevailing in zzso in zzso with inevitable consequences for the zzso traits displayed on the one hand, and for the zzso structure and expression on the other zzso Newer developments in cell culture methodology seek approaches to mimic the in zzso situation in the cell culture as closely as zzso zzso variety of such approaches can be noticed, ranging from relative simple three-dimensional conditions of zzso pure cell lines on collagen gels or in form of zzso tumor zzso More complex forms try to combine multiple cell types in a single zzso zzso of zzso cells and zzso zzso The most complex and most revealing among the three-dimensional culture arrangements is zzso the zzso skin culture, in which all the relevant skin cell types are combined in a zzso zzso with resulting marked similarity to the anatomical structure of normal human zzso Several crucial results were obtained zzso among others an intrinsic difference in the development of invasive zzso cell zzso and melanoma could be zzso Just another experimental direction aims at direct zzso transformation of normal human zzso and zzso using highly efficient zzso zzso Immediately after establishing of the zzso skin culture are such directly transformed primary cells transplanted on a nude mouse and the whole zzso process is then essentially followed in zzso This example illustrates finally the various possibilities of combination of in zzso and in zzso experimental zzso
