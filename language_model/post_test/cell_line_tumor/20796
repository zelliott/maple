Previous studies comparing the effects of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso and zzso have shown that these compounds selectively inhibit zzso and induce zzso zzso zzso zzso and assembly of mutually exclusive zzso complexes on the zzso zzso To determine whether the differential zzso regulation seen in zzso gene is unique or whether it is representative of the zzso effects of these two zzso zzso we have used zzso and zzso zzso analysis to compare the effects of zzso and zzso on gene expression on zzso zzso Gene array analysis confirmed by quantitative real-time zzso shows that zzso zzso the expression of a highly circumscribed group of genes involved in cell cycle progression and cell zzso In contrast, zzso appears to induce widespread zzso of many genes and does not zzso the expression of the same cohort as zzso These data show that the selective effects of zzso and zzso on the assembly of zzso complexes are not unique to the zzso gene and suggest that selective zzso of zzso can lead to significant changes in gene expression through the zzso of zzso factors including but not limited to zzso
