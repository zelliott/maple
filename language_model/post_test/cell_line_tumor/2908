zzso is the major structure component of zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso It has been demonstrated that zzso as the principal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can recognize zzso zzso and induce immune zzso In this study, we sought to clarify whether zzso zzso from the cell wall of zzso zzso zzso could induce immune responses in human zzso zzso (a human acute zzso leukemia cell line) and to determine the underlying zzso 

Human zzso zzso were challenged with zzso in zzso The zzso expression of zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso by real-time reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso were measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso release was determined by zzso fluorescent zzso Western zzso was used to analyze zzso zzso and zzso 

Exposure of zzso zzso to zzso led to increased gene expression and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso induced zzso release in a zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso failed to induce gene expression and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso whereas the zzso level of zzso was not zzso zzso zzso challenged with zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso blocked the zzso production of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso but no such effect was observed in zzso with zzso zzso zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso 

zzso may play a role in zzso of immune responses in human zzso cells through zzso not zzso
