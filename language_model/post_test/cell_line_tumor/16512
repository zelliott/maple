The purpose of this study was to determine whether zzso a zzso zzso might significantly enhance the zzso of zzso an zzso drug, in two human zzso cell zzso Human zzso zzso and zzso cells were incubated with zzso and zzso in a range of zzso either alone or in combination for 72 zzso zzso zzso comet zzso zzso method and optical zzso were used to assess cell zzso cell cycle, DNA damage, and zzso zzso zzso exerted an zzso effect on zzso and zzso cell zzso in a zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced proliferation of zzso zzso cancer cells zzso at 1 zzso whereas zzso demonstrated marked resistance to zzso zzso A significant zzso effect was obtained combining zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso with an arrest of cell cycle at S zzso Furthermore, an increase in frequency of DNA damage, zzso bodies, and zzso cells was observed when zzso and zzso cancer cells were treated simultaneously with both zzso Data show that in zzso combination produced a more potent zzso effect when compared with single zzso
