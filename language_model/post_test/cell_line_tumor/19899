The higher zzso of zzso zzso zzso in women during zzso years compared with men and the increased risk associated with the therapeutic use of zzso have suggested a zzso role exerted by these steroids in the development of zzso In the present study, we evaluated the potential of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to regulate the expression of diverse zzso target genes and the proliferation of human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells, which were used as a model zzso We have zzso that zzso cells are devoid of zzso receptors zzso whereas both zzso and zzso cells express a single zzso of zzso that was neither zzso zzso nor zzso into the nucleus upon treatment with zzso However, zzso G, and zzso were able either to induce the zzso activity of zzso promoter zzso including those lacking the zzso zzso or to increase zzso zzso A, and D1 zzso It is noteworthy that we have demonstrated that the G zzso zzso 30 zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso mediate both the zzso of zzso and the growth response to zzso G, and zzso in zzso cells zzso because these zzso effects were prevented by zzso zzso and using the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso Our findings provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms through which zzso may induce the progression of zzso
