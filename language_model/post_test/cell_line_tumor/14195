Parkinson's disease zzso is a zzso disease caused by both genetic and environmental zzso zzso is of particular interest in zzso since it is a major component of zzso bodies and zzso in the zzso gene were identified in familial zzso zzso stress and zzso dysfunction are implicated in the zzso of zzso but their interactions as well as their effect on zzso formation are not yet zzso We therefore examined the roles of zzso stress and zzso zzso on protein zzso induction in zzso and zzso differentiated zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso with wild type zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were exposed to zzso stress induced by zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso caused a zzso decrease in viability and induced protein zzso formation containing zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced significantly increased zzso zzso in cells expressing zzso zzso Exposure to zzso oxygen species zzso combined with zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso body formation and cell death of differentiated zzso cells zzso zzso can serve as a valuable model for zzso the molecular components that cause zzso in zzso as well as evaluating pharmacological zzso
