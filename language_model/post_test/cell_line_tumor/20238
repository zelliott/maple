The zzso zzso zzso zzso is often zzso in zzso in some cases, a significant correlation between the level of residual zzso in zzso tumors and patient survival has been zzso Furthermore, restoration of zzso expression in certain zzso cell lines results in reduced zzso Here we report that acute zzso expression in colon zzso cells results in cell zzso accompanied by zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 2 zzso and zzso of its zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso growth suppression is at least partially dependent on zzso and that zzso and type I collagen share similar effects on the zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso ratio is high in normal zzso and lower in the cancer zzso These findings reveal a novel molecular zzso linking zzso progression to zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation and zzso zzso and suggest that treatment regimens that induce zzso expression could be promising cancer zzso
