Local delivery of zzso drugs provides a high local concentration and decreases the zzso of side effects commonly observed with systemic zzso zzso systems are commonly used as a local drug delivery zzso In this study, we prepared a novel zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso for local delivery of zzso zzso to gain the benefits of the zzso activity of the zzso zzso and enhanced zzso zzso due to the zzso property of the zzso zzso To evaluate the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso were injected zzso into zzso zzso Cell cycle and zzso markers were examined to determine the mechanism of the zzso activity of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed excellent zzso activity in zzso inducing stronger cell cycle arrest and zzso in tumor tissue than the zzso zzso zzso These results were attributed to the synergistic effect of the zzso property of zzso with released zzso from the zzso zzso as the zzso and the enhanced zzso of zzso resulting from the zzso property of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso designed in this study has great potential as an effective zzso carrier of zzso
