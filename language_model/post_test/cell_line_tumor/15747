zzso evidence in the past few years has shown that zzso could serve functionally as zzso or zzso zzso zzso and regulate multiple cellular processes relevant to zzso and cancer zzso Both zzso and zzso two members of the zzso zzso family, are found to be zzso in several types of human tumors including zzso cancer, and have been implicated in cancer initiation and zzso In the present studies, we found that zzso expression greatly inhibited the proliferation potential of zzso zzso An examination of the predicted targets of zzso revealed zzso and zzso among the putative targets that are crucial for cell zzso A zzso sequence analysis indicated that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso for zzso target matching sequences and they are highly zzso across different zzso Using a zzso zzso we show that zzso expression significantly suppressed the zzso and zzso zzso activities, and the zzso effect was lost when the putative target sites for zzso were zzso zzso with these results, zzso expression of zzso reduced protein levels of zzso and zzso in cells, indicating zzso functionally regulates zzso and zzso zzso Similar to the effects of knocking down zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso effectively inhibited zzso induced zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso and blocked invasion of zzso cancer zzso Thus, zzso is a negative regulator of zzso and zzso and their cellular activities, and could inhibit proliferation and invasion of zzso cancer zzso
