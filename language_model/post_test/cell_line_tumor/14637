zzso is a novel tumor zzso gene that zzso to zzso a zzso region frequently associated with loss of zzso zzso in a number of zzso including zzso zzso zzso Its zzso zzso has been shown in the cell lines and primary tumor zzso of zzso zzso of zzso into zzso a cell line derived from zzso was effective to induce cell zzso control cell growth, and regulate the cell zzso Little is known about the zzso mechanisms controlling zzso gene zzso In this article, we describe the zzso gene structure and the zzso expression of zzso we found that zzso was expressed zzso in most of zzso cell zzso Using zzso rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends zzso we found that the zzso gene has several zzso start sites zzso due to the existence of alternatively spliced zzso and the specific zzso of zzso was located zzso zzso upstream of the translation start zzso We amend that Human zzso zzso containing zzso but not the zzso reported zzso To characterize the zzso promoter, transient zzso and/or zzso reporter zzso were carried out with the zzso including various lengths of the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso The results demonstrated that the zzso promoter is located at the region from zzso to zzso zzso and the optimal promoter is located at the region from zzso to zzso zzso upstream of the translation start zzso In zzso analysis suggested that the promoter region contained potential binding sites for zzso zzso zzso zzso and so zzso These results provide important clues to zzso the regulation of zzso gene expression and zzso Further studies are apparently required for the identification of the zzso factors, essential for zzso zzso which would lead to better understanding of the molecular mechanism of zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso
