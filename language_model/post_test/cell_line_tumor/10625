zzso can block access to zzso zzso Thus the precise zzso of zzso relative to zzso start sites and other factor binding sites is expected to be a critical component of zzso zzso Recently developed zzso approaches have allowed the rapid mapping of zzso positions over hundreds of zzso zzso of human zzso DNA, although these approaches have not yet been widely used to measure zzso changes associated with changes in zzso Here, we use custom zzso zzso to reveal changes in zzso positions and abundance that occur when zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to sites near target gene promoters in human zzso zzso The most striking change is an increase in measured zzso occupancy at sites spanning zzso zzso upstream and downstream of zzso start sites, which occurs one hour after addition of hormone, but is lost at 4 zzso zzso this increase was seen both on zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the human zzso zzso zzso factor (a zzso zzso was found to be important for increased occupancy upon hormone treatment and also for low zzso occupancy without zzso Most surprisingly, similar increases in zzso occupancy were also seen on both regulated and zzso promoters during differentiation of human zzso leukemia cells and upon zzso of human zzso zzso These results indicate that dramatic changes in zzso structure over zzso zzso of human promoters may occur zzso and in response to a variety of zzso and suggest novel models for zzso zzso
