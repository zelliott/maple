zzso is one of the most abundant zzso in zzso The effects of zzso on cholesterol synthesis and fatty acid zzso have been well zzso but the effect of zzso on fatty acid synthesis remains zzso Thus, we investigated the effect of zzso on fatty acid zzso zzso expressions in zzso zzso In zzso cells treated with 10 zzso zzso zzso and protein expressions of zzso as well as zzso activity, were significantly zzso The promoter region of zzso contains binding sites for the zzso factor called zzso regulated element binding protein 1 zzso zzso must be processed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso to be zzso We also investigated the effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso and subsequent zzso processing by zzso in zzso zzso zzso reduced the expression of zzso and the processing of zzso but did not change the expression of zzso zzso zzso is also a zzso factor for zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also significantly inhibited the expression of these zzso zzso Thus, zzso treatment of zzso cells decreased the expression of zzso genes such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso which is, at least in part, zzso through the zzso of zzso expression and subsequent zzso zzso zzso
