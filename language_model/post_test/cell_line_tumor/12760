Although circulating DNA zzso could be an attractive tool for early cancer zzso diagnosis, zzso monitoring or prediction of response to therapies, knowledge on its origin, form and rate of release is poor and often zzso Here, we describe an experimental system to systematically examine these zzso zzso mice were zzso with human zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso was analyzed by zzso with highly specific and sensitive primer sets at different times zzso We could discriminate zzso from normal zzso cells and from zzso and zzso tumor zzso cells by using zzso zzso or zzso zzso and by assessing the presence of the zzso zzso zzso The concentration of human zzso and zzso zzso increased significantly with tumor zzso zzso and differently from previous studies, low, constant level of mouse zzso was observed, thus zzso the study of zzso and zzso tumor derived zzso Finally, analysis of zzso fragmentation confirmed the predominance of zzso fragments among tumor zzso from mice with bigger zzso Higher zzso fragmentation was also observed in plasma samples from three zzso zzso patients in comparison to healthy zzso Our data confirm the predominance of zzso fragments in plasma from zzso animals and, as a consequence, of zzso as a source of zzso in particular for zzso zzso Altogether, our results suggest that zzso features vary during zzso tumor development and our experimental system might be a useful tool to follow such zzso
