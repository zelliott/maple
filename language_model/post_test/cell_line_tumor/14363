zzso zzso zzso receptors are known to regulate the release of soluble zzso precursor protein zzso produced by zzso zzso however, their signaling mechanisms remain to be zzso It has been reported that a zzso zzso activates nuclear factor zzso a zzso factor that has been shown to play an important role in the zzso disease brain, and that zzso zzso is regulated by zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated whether zzso zzso plays a role in zzso zzso zzso release enhancement and contributes to a changed zzso zzso entry zzso which was suggested to be involved in the zzso zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was confirmed by observing the zzso of the active zzso zzso of zzso to the nucleus by the zzso zzso zzso M zzso in zzso zzso cells expressing zzso receptors that are predominantly of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso release enhancement induced by zzso were inhibited by zzso zzso such as an zzso zzso inhibitor zzso an zzso alpha zzso inhibitor zzso a zzso inhibitor zzso the inhibitor of zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso zzso the novel zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and by an zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, both zzso zzso zzso and zzso release were antagonized by zzso zzso zzso or zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, treatment of cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso zzso These findings provide evidence for the involvement of zzso regulated by zzso in zzso zzso zzso release zzso
