Numerous zzso zzso exhibited poor response rates, high systemic zzso and zzso in human trials to treat zzso We identified the first zzso zzso vitamin D analog zzso by altering the zzso of zzso This study describes the therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of action of zzso in both in zzso and in zzso zzso 

zzso efficacy of zzso was evaluated in zzso cancer cell zzso zzso in nude mice and a zzso rat zzso cancer zzso zzso calcium levels of zzso or zzso treated animals were zzso zzso molecular zzso simulation and a cell based zzso reporter zzso revealed zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso treated tumors identified drug targets which were verified by zzso and zzso zzso of cellular zzso zzso was carried out by zzso A binding study with zzso zzso was zzso zzso reduced zzso cancer growth in zzso and zzso animal models without causing zzso or acute zzso zzso is a weak zzso zzso zzso zzso that disrupted the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and western zzso and zzso of zzso treated zzso tumors showed zzso of fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced cellular levels of zzso zzso in zzso cells and inhibited zzso zzso activity independently of zzso zzso 

zzso effects of zzso agent zzso provide a new approach to the design of zzso based zzso molecules and a rationale for developing zzso as a therapeutic agent for zzso zzso tumors by targeting zzso de zzso zzso
