To examine the effect of zzso acid B on the growth of human gastric cancer cell line, zzso and its possible mechanism of zzso 

Growth zzso by zzso acid B was analyzed using zzso zzso zzso cells were detected using zzso zzso zzso and confirmed by DNA fragmentation zzso Western zzso was used to detect the expression of zzso gene zzso zzso 3, and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso acid B inhibited the growth of zzso cells in a zzso and zzso manner by arresting the cells at zzso phase, which was accompanied with a decrease in the levels of zzso zzso cells treated with zzso acid B showed typical characteristics of zzso including zzso zzso and DNA zzso Moreover, treatment of zzso cells with zzso acid B was also associated with decreased levels of the zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso 

zzso acid B can dramatically suppress the zzso cell growth by inducing zzso after zzso phase zzso These findings are consistent with the possibility that zzso phase arrest is zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso The data also suggest that zzso acid B can trigger zzso by decreasing zzso levels and zzso zzso zzso
