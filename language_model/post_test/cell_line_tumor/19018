We have investigated the zzso between two zzso factors, zzso and zzso and their role in zzso of zzso cancer zzso We used one cervical cancer cell line zzso and two zzso cancer cell lines zzso and zzso as a zzso The three drugs decreased zzso and zzso content and induced zzso in zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells zzso induction correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso cells showed maximum zzso as zzso and zzso zzso remained stable in response to the three drugs, and only zzso could significantly induce zzso We found that zzso and zzso were functionally linked in zzso cancer cells, as zzso of zzso with zzso decreased zzso levels, and zzso of zzso activity using zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso of zzso active zzso zzso in zzso cells induced zzso sensitivity to zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso sensitivity to zzso and zzso but not zzso Finally, we found zzso zzso in zzso cells from multiple human zzso zzso tumors, suggesting that zzso may also regulate zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso these results highlight an intertwined role for specific zzso zzso and zzso in zzso of zzso cancer zzso
