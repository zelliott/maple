Heavy metals such as cadmium, lead and zzso are known to be zzso to developing zzso zzso which is an zzso zzso located in the maternal facing zzso of human zzso protects fetus from zzso by transferring compounds from zzso to maternal zzso The aim of this study was to clarify whether heavy metal compounds zzso zzso and zzso affect the expression and function of zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso was determined by zzso and zzso The functional activity of zzso was evaluated by measuring the zzso of two known zzso zzso fluorescent zzso and zzso food zzso zzso According to zzso zzso all compounds were zzso as expected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso and zzso suggesting zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso Because of high zzso the zzso potency of zzso was not zzso According to protein data these heavy metals did not affect zzso zzso protein zzso Also, the expression of zzso zzso or zzso zzso were not affected by heavy zzso In conclusion, although the studied metal zzso did not affect zzso or protein expression of zzso zzso inhibited its zzso Further studies to evaluate whether this leads to elevated zzso transfer of zzso zzso are zzso
