We isolated a novel inhibitor of zzso zzso from the flowers of zzso zzso zzso zzso and identified it as a zzso zzso zzso zzso by means of zzso or zzso and liquid zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso at the concentration of zzso zzso completely inhibited zzso zzso in cultured zzso melanoma zzso It is one of the most potent among known plant zzso of zzso zzso in cultured cells, being 50 times more potent than zzso which is used as an zzso zzso Its mechanism of action is considered to involve zzso of zzso factor zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso which would lead to a decrease of zzso and related zzso We confirmed that compound zzso decreased the protein levels of zzso and its related proteins in zzso melanoma zzso Further study revealed that a similar zzso zzso also suppressed the zzso zzso zzso of zzso melanoma zzso These results indicate that the zzso group may play an important role in the suppression of the zzso zzso by compound zzso
