zzso cancer is one of the most aggressive zzso and has a poor zzso Despite efforts made in multiple fields, there has been little success in improving the zzso survival rate of zzso This study was undertaken to investigate the effectiveness and feasibility of using zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso for treatment of pancreatic cancer zzso attempting to develop a new treatment for human pancreatic zzso 

zzso nude mice were zzso zzso in the right flank with the human pancreatic cancer cells, zzso Fourteen days after zzso 32 mice, bearing tumors of volume zzso zzso were randomly assigned to one of four groups, and given an zzso injection of: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alone; zzso zzso 10 zzso or zzso 10 zzso zzso loaded in zzso zzso On day 14 after administration, the tumors were excised to calculate the zzso rate of tumor growth and perform zzso zzso zzso cell zzso was detected by flow zzso and zzso was performed to evaluate the zzso expression levels of zzso and zzso 

zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso resulted in remarkable control of tumor zzso The tumor became zzso by day 14 after zzso The zzso results clearly confirmed that the tumor cells were zzso The percentage of zzso cells detected by flow zzso was higher in the zzso zzso group than in the other zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso expression level of zzso was zzso whereas zzso was zzso 

zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso may provide an effective approach for zzso chemotherapy in pancreatic zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso expression may be a key molecular zzso
