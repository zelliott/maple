zzso are the most effective zzso agents for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases even though some diseases, such as chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso are relatively zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanism of this zzso zzso remains zzso We show that a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso caused by impaired zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso toward nuclear factor zzso gene zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso interference resulted in reduced sensitivity to zzso suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso Loss of zzso did not reduce zzso nuclear zzso zzso binding to zzso response element zzso on DNA, or zzso DNA or gene induction but inhibited the association between zzso and zzso zzso becomes zzso after zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso enables zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso reduced zzso zzso and the ability to repress zzso gene expression becomes insensitive to zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, we show that zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso from patients with COPD is able to restore zzso zzso Thus, reduction of zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso in zzso zzso but not zzso gene zzso
