The zzso factor zzso associated with amongst others zzso is essential for maintenance of zzso and zzso of embryonic stem zzso zzso is highly expressed in zzso zzso zzso the stem cell component of zzso zzso germ cell tumors, referred to as germ cell cancer zzso In fact, zzso together with zzso is an zzso diagnostic tool for zzso in a clinical zzso Several studies support the hypothesis that zzso is a relevant zzso factor in various zzso and recently, zzso has been suggested as a putative therapeutic target for early stage zzso We demonstrate the presence of zzso amplification of zzso in an zzso cell line, zzso using array comparative zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso by targeted zzso provokes zzso cells towards zzso while zzso of zzso expression induced zzso with retained zzso zzso Mice zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso show a consistent zzso zzso in spite of loss of the expression of zzso and zzso with retained presence of zzso zzso No zzso amplification has been identified in primary pure and mixed zzso in zzso patient samples so zzso The data presented in this study are based on a single zzso cell line with a zzso amplification, with zzso as control zzso cell line, showing no profound induction of zzso upon zzso zzso The findings are of relevance to identify mechanisms involved in the zzso of zzso tumors, and support the model of zzso dependency of zzso which however, does not exclude induction of zzso This finding is likely related to the presence of wild type zzso in zzso resulting in expression of downstream target zzso amongst others zzso zzso and zzso associated to the unique sensitivity of zzso to DNA damaging zzso
