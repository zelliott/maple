G zzso zzso zzso zzso known as zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso C zzso is able to stimulate zzso and zzso of zzso and induce zzso of G zzso zzso However, detail mechanism of interaction between zzso and zzso and the effect of zzso on activity of zzso remain zzso zzso zzso zzso domain is a kind of functionally domain containing about 120 zzso zzso which exists on many protein molecules that involve in cellular signal zzso A zzso domain located in zzso zzso zzso to zzso may play a significant role in zzso interaction between zzso and zzso In present study, we revealed that zzso could associate with zzso domain of zzso in pull-down zzso in zzso zzso displayed binding of zzso to zzso in intact zzso cells after prolonged stimulation of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity indicated that the binding of the zzso domain of zzso to zzso beta 1 could zzso activity of zzso beta 1 zzso Thus, zzso may play a negative feedback regulatory role on zzso activity in interaction between zzso and zzso zzso
