To explore the effect of zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso on the drug sensitivity of zzso lung zzso cell zzso 

The experiments consisted of four groups including an zzso control group, an empty zzso group, an unrelated zzso group, and a zzso zzso zzso Every experiment was repeated five zzso Lung zzso cell line zzso was zzso with zzso formulated zzso 2000, and zzso protein and zzso of each group were determined by flow zzso zzso The zzso of zzso cells to zzso zzso was measured by zzso Cell zzso detection kit zzso V zzso was used to examine the drug induced zzso zzso 

The zzso protein and zzso positive expression rate in the zzso zzso group, the zzso control group, the empty zzso group and the unrelated zzso group were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Introduction of the sequence specific zzso into zzso positive zzso cells in zzso greatly reduced the cell surface expression of the zzso zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso zzso the zzso rate of zzso in combination with zzso targeting zzso was zzso zzso zzso but it was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso control, the empty zzso and the unrelated zzso groups, zzso There was a significant difference between zzso zzso group and other three groups zzso zzso zzso The zzso results showed the zzso rate of zzso combined with zzso was elevated as compared with the unrelated zzso group, the empty zzso group or the zzso control zzso 

zzso specific zzso was capable of enhancing the zzso of zzso cells to zzso
