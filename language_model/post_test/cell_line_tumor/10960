We investigated the effect of zzso zzso zzso on the zzso cells zzso and necrosis at different levels of linear energy transfer zzso to evaluate its zzso The human melanoma cell line zzso which bears zzso zzso gene status, was used, as well as the zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso We exposed these cells to zzso and to accelerated zzso zzso zzso Cellular sensitivities were determined by using zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell deaths were determined zzso by dual zzso zzso orange and zzso zzso using zzso zzso We discovered that zzso there was no significant difference in survival fraction between zzso cells and zzso cells zzso by zzso with greater than 32 zzso zzso zzso although zzso in the two kinds of cells increased in an zzso manner, zzso zzso zzso induced cell zzso efficiently in zzso relative to zzso cells with zzso or zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso the number of necrosis in zzso cells increased significantly zzso zzso zzso in comparison with zzso zzso These results indicate that in zzso zzso zzso induction is zzso dependent partly and zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in modulating cell death type, although there was no significant difference in cellular zzso Our observation in the study offers the potential application of zzso radiation combined with zzso in the management of human patients with zzso
