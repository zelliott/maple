Development of invasive cervical cancer upon infection by zzso human zzso zzso in humans is a zzso process in which some of the initially zzso zzso type of zzso zzso integrate randomly into the host cell zzso We show that zzso replication proteins E1 and zzso are capable of inducing zzso of the zzso locus where zzso origin has been zzso zzso analysis of the cells in which the replication from integrated zzso origin was induced showed zzso zzso and de zzso integration of the zzso containing and zzso cellular zzso These data suggest that zzso replication machinery is capable of inducing zzso changes of the host cell that may facilitate the formation of the zzso cancer zzso
