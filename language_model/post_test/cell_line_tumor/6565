zzso is a protein with proposed roles in cell division and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of human zzso have been described and their expression correlated with cancer zzso As zzso forms zzso in zzso it has been suggested that these zzso could interfere with wild type function by forming zzso Here we show that zzso and zzso can interact with wild type zzso but have reduced affinity for the partner protein of zzso zzso and thus do not zzso with the zzso passenger complex in zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso of zzso fluorescent protein zzso or zzso does not impede cell cycle zzso We also report that wild type zzso but not zzso or zzso can rescue cell proliferation inhibited by small interfering zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that, despite their ability to interact with wild type zzso neither of these zzso acts as its competitor during zzso nor has an essential zzso
