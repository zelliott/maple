The induction of zzso growth factor binding zzso zzso zzso by zzso B was investigated using human zzso cell line zzso we also documented the involvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in this zzso zzso B dramatically enhanced zzso zzso which peaked at a concentration of 40 zzso The amount of zzso zzso increased with time and zzso at 6 zzso Compared with the amounts of zzso zzso the induction ratios of zzso were much smaller, indicating that zzso zzso is regulated chiefly zzso The result of zzso treatment with zzso B and zzso inhibitor indicated that zzso do not affect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso was marked in the absence of zzso inhibitor but attenuated in its zzso zzso zzso appear to stimulate zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso inhibitor slightly increased the amount of zzso zzso zzso zzso However this induction ratio was smaller than that of zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso regulate zzso zzso both zzso and zzso In this study, we showed that zzso B zzso zzso levels in zzso cells and zzso contribute to this zzso
