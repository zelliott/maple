zzso imaging of zzso zzso zzso combined with the use of zzso zzso zzso permits direct observation of insulin packaged in zzso zzso trafficking of these zzso to the plasma zzso zzso fusion of zzso with the plasma zzso and eventually the retrieval of zzso by zzso Most such studies have been done in tumor cell lines, using either zzso methods or total internal zzso zzso Here we compared these methods by using zzso or zzso plus zzso zzso to study insulin zzso dynamics in zzso cells, normal mouse zzso and primary pancreatic beta zzso We found that most apparently zzso zzso did not fuse with the plasma membrane after zzso zzso that did fuse typically fused completely, but a few zzso zzso lingered at the zzso zzso recycling of zzso occurred only zzso Similar results were obtained with both zzso and total internal reflection zzso although each technique had advantages for particular aspects of the zzso life zzso We conclude that insulin zzso involves a prolonged interaction of zzso zzso with the plasma zzso and that the majority of zzso events occur by full, not zzso zzso
