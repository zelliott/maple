Aspirin exerts zzso effect partly through blocking tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study is to determine how specific zzso inhibitor zzso mediates zzso effect by zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso activity and zzso activity were detected by zzso reporter zzso and gel shift zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso was determined by Western zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso was used to suppress zzso zzso 

We showed that zzso inhibited zzso zzso cell transformation in a zzso manner in zzso zzso At a dose range zzso zzso that inhibited cell zzso zzso also inhibited zzso cell growth and zzso in 3 gastric cancer cells, independent of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso activity reversed the zzso effect on zzso activity by zzso and suppressed gastric cancer cell growth, indicating that the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso and cell growth was through interaction with zzso 

The zzso effect on zzso zzso contributes to the zzso effect of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso may have a therapeutic benefit against gastric zzso
