zzso zzso zzso zzso have fundamental roles in tumor zzso However, human clinical trials have shown little or no effect of zzso of their upstream signaling zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in advanced zzso To determine the molecular mechanism underlying the limited zzso effect, we cultured two human zzso zzso cell lines, zzso cells and zzso cells in the presence of a zzso inhibitor zzso for more than 4 weeks zzso zzso zzso zzso cells showed zzso cell shape with scattering zzso increase in zzso zzso loss of zzso zzso zzso stress fiber formation, and increased zzso In contrast, zzso cells showed scattered zzso without zzso and this treatment failed to increase the expression of zzso zzso A activity was increased in zzso zzso zzso In these cells, enhanced stress fiber formation and zzso were observed, both of which were inhibited by treatment with small interfering zzso for zzso A or an zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Our results suggest that long-term exposure of human zzso zzso cells to zzso increases cell zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
