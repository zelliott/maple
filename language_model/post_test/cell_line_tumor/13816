zzso zzso binds to the zzso tails of classical zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although zzso regulation of zzso zzso is thought to be important for adhesive junction zzso the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso In this paper, we identify a zzso motif in classical zzso consisting of three highly zzso zzso zzso that alternately serve as a zzso interface and an zzso zzso zzso of this motif resulted in a zzso zzso that was both zzso zzso and resistant to zzso In zzso cells, in which dynamic changes in zzso are important components of zzso and zzso a vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso defective in zzso assembled normally into zzso junctions but zzso suppressed cell migration in response to vascular zzso growth zzso These results reveal the zzso basis by which zzso zzso zzso and demonstrate that zzso zzso is crucial for zzso cell migration in response to an zzso growth zzso
