Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths zzso In the United States, only one in six lung cancer patients survives five years after zzso These statistics may improve if new therapeutic targets are zzso We previously reported that an zzso of fatty acid zzso very zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso is zzso in zzso zzso and that depleting zzso cells of zzso diminishes their zzso zzso To determine whether zzso expression was also increased in lung cancer, we studied tumor zzso sections and lung cancer cell zzso zzso analysis of normal human lung showed moderate zzso expression only in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, all of 69 different lung tumors tested, including zzso zzso cell, large cell, and small cell zzso had robustly elevated zzso zzso Western zzso analysis of lung cancer cell lines derived from these tumor types also had significantly increased zzso protein compared to normal zzso zzso zzso zzso the growth rate of lung cancer cell lines did not change zzso zzso However, knocking down zzso expression by zzso interference reduced cell growth rates in culture by zzso and the ability of tumor cells to form colonies in soft zzso suspension by zzso We also conducted studies to gain a better understanding of the zzso properties of human zzso zzso zzso was detected in many human zzso but the expression pattern differed somewhat from that of the zzso The zzso activated long- and very zzso saturated fatty acid zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso fatty acids to their respective zzso A zzso zzso human zzso protein was found in a zzso zzso compartment that partially zzso with zzso as determined by zzso zzso and zzso zzso From these studies, we conclude that zzso is a promising new therapeutic target in lung zzso
