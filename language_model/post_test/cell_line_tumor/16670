zzso of zzso differentiation by zzso Sonic zzso zzso signaling may be a mechanism through which zzso prostate cancer cells initiate changes in the bone zzso and promote zzso A hallmark of zzso differentiation is the formation of zzso whose zzso protein is type 1 zzso We investigated the formation of a collagen zzso by zzso cultured with prostate cancer cells, and its effects on interactions between prostate cancer cells and zzso 

In the presence of zzso zzso acid zzso a zzso in collagen zzso mouse zzso zzso in mixed cultures with human zzso prostate cancer cells or zzso cells modified to zzso zzso zzso zzso formed collagen zzso with distinct zzso zzso zzso AA increased the activity of alkaline zzso and the expression of the alkaline zzso gene zzso markers of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cultured with zzso or zzso zzso However, the zzso increase in zzso expression in zzso zzso cultured with zzso cells far exceeded the levels observed in zzso cells cultured with either zzso cells with AA or zzso cells without zzso zzso AA and zzso exert a synergistic effect on zzso zzso We determined whether the effect of AA on zzso zzso zzso differentiation was zzso by zzso zzso AA increased the expression of zzso and zzso target genes of the zzso pathway, in zzso zzso cultured with zzso cells to at least twice their levels without zzso The ability of AA to zzso zzso signaling and enhance alkaline zzso activity was blocked in zzso cells that expressed a dominant negative form of the zzso factor zzso The zzso increase in zzso signaling and zzso zzso differentiation was also inhibited by the specific collagen synthesis inhibitor zzso 

zzso zzso formed by zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso signaling between zzso prostate cancer cells and zzso zzso and zzso signaling exert a synergistic effect on zzso zzso a defining event in prostate zzso bone zzso zzso into zzso interactions among prostate cancer cells, zzso and zzso zzso proteins advance our understanding of mechanisms contributing to prostate cancer bone zzso
