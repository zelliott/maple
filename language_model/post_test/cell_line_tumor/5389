The zzso gene zzso encodes the tumor zzso protein zzso zzso The function of zzso has recently been implicated in the regulation of zzso zzso complex zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso was zzso However, precise mechanism of zzso zzso and functional interaction of zzso with zzso the product of zzso sclerosis 2 gene zzso which is a negative regulator of zzso are zzso Here we report that multiple zzso in zzso are evoked by zzso of zzso as well as by zzso zzso We found that zzso at zzso and zzso are differently regulated by zzso zzso Some unknown zzso downstream of zzso are thought to directly zzso zzso Interestingly, our results also suggest that the complex formation of zzso with zzso is modulated by zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is involved in a novel mechanism of signal zzso downstream of zzso
