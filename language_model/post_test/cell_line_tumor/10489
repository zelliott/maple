zzso zzso zzso dysfunction is known to induce intrinsic zzso of zzso Previously, we have shown that a combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso results in zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells via zzso expression of zzso zzso We now show that the combination zzso zzso significant zzso in zzso membrane potential and zzso damage to zzso and proteins selectively in zzso cells resulting in the release of zzso c from zzso and increase in zzso ratio stimulating intrinsic zzso of zzso besides enhancing the zzso death linked to zzso zzso These results highlight the role of zzso dysfunction in selective zzso by zzso besides zzso of zzso DNA repair processes and generation of zzso stress reported zzso
