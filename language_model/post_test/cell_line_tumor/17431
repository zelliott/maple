The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits a potent zzso zzso However, when administered in cancer patients, its blood clearance increases after repeated zzso whereas the volume of distribution remains constant, suggesting that the drug is able to induce its own zzso The aim of this work was to identify the zzso involved in S zzso metabolism and determine whether this zzso is an zzso zzso in human zzso in primary zzso Among a battery of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso only zzso zzso and zzso were able to generate zzso amounts of zzso of S zzso In primary zzso S zzso behaved as a zzso zzso producing an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to an extent similar to that of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso The levels of other zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and related activities were not affected by S zzso In primary zzso zzso of cells with S zzso or zzso produced a significant and similar increase of S zzso zzso consistent with the previous indications on the role of zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso are the major phase I zzso involved in the metabolism of S zzso and that this zzso is a potent zzso zzso able to stimulate its own metabolism in primary human zzso and zzso
