zzso syndrome zzso is a genetic disorder characterized zzso by increases in sister zzso exchanges zzso and numbers of zzso zzso is caused by zzso in the zzso DNA zzso gene and involves a greatly enhanced risk of developing the range of zzso seen in the general zzso With a mouse model for the disease, we set out to determine the relationship between zzso instability and zzso We used a novel zzso analysis to investigate a panel of eight cell lines developed from zzso tumors that appeared in zzso conditional knockout zzso First, the panel of cell lines was examined for zzso High numbers of zzso were zzso seen in members of the panel, and several lines produced zzso instability zzso zzso by high numbers of zzso structural aberrations zzso and zzso zzso zzso Second, to see if zzso zzso was responsible for the zzso zzso analysis was conducted on a tumor line harboring a functional zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was deleted in zzso and zzso as well as control zzso were cultured for 100 zzso By passage 100, six of nine zzso zzso had acquired high zzso Nine zzso zzso produced zzso more zzso than did nine control zzso Finally, zzso loss preceded the appearance of zzso suggesting that this loss provides a potential mechanism for the induction of instability in zzso zzso Such zzso or zzso is a universal feature of zzso but has an uncertain function in zzso Our results show that zzso gene zzso produces this instability, strengthening a role for zzso in the development of human zzso
