zzso is a selective and zzso inhibitor of the zzso zzso that shows potent zzso activity in zzso and in zzso against several human zzso of zzso No data are available on zzso activity against human pediatric zzso 

Ten zzso cell lines and suspensions of primary zzso cells from three patients were tested for sensitivity to zzso Colony formation, cell zzso cell cycle zzso and zzso were evaluated by a zzso zzso and by measuring zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso and zzso exposure and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed by the chick zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso Two mouse zzso models that mimic the growth and spread of zzso in humans were used to examine in zzso sensitivity of zzso to zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

zzso inhibited proliferation and colony formation of zzso cell lines in a zzso and zzso zzso The mean zzso concentration that caused 50% zzso of growth was zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso at 72 zzso zzso zzso cells were arrested at zzso and underwent zzso zzso percentage of zzso cells in four zzso cell lines treated with 20 zzso zzso for 24 hours ranged from zzso to zzso and zzso were activated by two- to fivefold with respect to zzso zzso Similar results were obtained for primary zzso cells exposed to zzso zzso inhibited zzso in zzso zzso by zzso medium from zzso cell lines, by zzso zzso and by primary zzso biopsy specimens zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso treated with biopsy specimens alone and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso treated with biopsy specimens plus zzso P zzso zzso In both mouse models, mice treated with zzso lived statistically significantly longer than control mice zzso survival time in the zzso model: zzso versus zzso days, zzso mean survival time in the zzso model: zzso versus zzso days, zzso 

zzso is an effective inhibitor of zzso cell growth and zzso These findings provide the rationale for further clinical investigation of zzso in pediatric zzso
