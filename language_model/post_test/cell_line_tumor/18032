zzso is a zzso protein with important functions in several zzso and pathological zzso such as embryonic development, host defense, and wound zzso zzso dominant zzso in the zzso gene cause zzso zzso while zzso of zzso promotes the invasive progression of a range of tumors, including those of the breast and the zzso zzso zzso consists of zzso tandem repeats of the zzso module zzso several of which have been isolated as discrete zzso zzso zzso We have expressed all seven human zzso using zzso DNA in zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that only the three zzso zzso zzso and zzso contain relatively zzso three-dimensional structures in solution, while others are mainly zzso of poorly structured zzso zzso The three-dimensional structures of zzso zzso and zzso contain a stable stack of two zzso in their zzso zzso but showed a more flexible zzso zzso Interestingly, of the zzso zzso zzso demonstrated potent growth zzso of a breast cancer cell line, while zzso was zzso zzso folded peptides were either zzso zzso or without zzso The functionally active and structurally zzso human zzso offers a unique opportunity for detailed zzso studies of these important zzso proteins as novel members of zzso growth zzso
