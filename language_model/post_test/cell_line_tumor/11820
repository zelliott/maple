The ubiquitous zzso zzso factor zzso plays central roles in immune and inflammatory responses and in zzso Complex zzso modifications of the zzso zzso zzso are a major aspect of the extremely flexible regulation of zzso zzso Although zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso have been well zzso zzso zzso has not yet been zzso We now report that, in response to zzso the zzso zzso of zzso is zzso on zzso 30 zzso by zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso substantially decreased the ability of zzso to bind to zzso elements and to drive gene zzso A model in which zzso zzso is placed into the crystal structure of zzso predicts new van der zzso contacts that stabilize zzso interactions and indirectly increase the affinity of zzso for zzso zzso was the only zzso zzso that zzso with zzso and its zzso increased zzso activity, whereas zzso zzso had the opposite zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso of the zzso genes that are zzso by the zzso zzso are similarly zzso by knocking zzso zzso Many zzso and zzso genes are among these, and zzso media from cells expressing the zzso zzso of zzso had much less zzso activity than media from cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso is zzso in many types of cancer, often to a striking degree, indicating that high levels of this zzso may promote zzso at least in part by zzso zzso gene zzso
