To develop novel zzso zzso models of zzso in severe combined zzso mice and to evaluate the in zzso zzso efficacy of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were developed by injecting zzso to zzso tumor cells from four zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso into the right zzso of severe combined zzso zzso Animals were then examined for zzso of zzso cell zzso time relationship, and zzso zzso zzso growth was monitored in zzso by serially zzso the zzso brains at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks zzso zzso acid treatment, administered at 600 zzso for 2 weeks via zzso zzso zzso was initiated 2 weeks after injection of zzso zzso cells, and treated and zzso animals were monitored for differences in zzso Changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso were also zzso 

zzso was maintained at zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso These zzso zzso displayed zzso features and zzso profiles zzso protein 2, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso similar to human zzso Animal survival time was zzso correlated with injected tumor cell zzso Treatment with zzso acid prolonged survival time in two zzso and zzso of the three models and was associated with induction of zzso zzso zzso of proliferation and zzso and enhancement of zzso and zzso 

We have developed zzso zzso models that closely zzso the biological features of human zzso and characterized their in zzso growth zzso zzso acid treatment of these zzso showed potent in zzso zzso zzso These zzso models should facilitate the understanding of zzso zzso and future zzso evaluation of new therapies against zzso
