zzso is an important factor for zzso which could act as a potential molecular target for tumor zzso The goal of this study was to explore a new method for visualizing the expression of zzso in lung zzso zzso cells by zzso zzso imaging zzso and gamma camera zzso 

The human zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequence of the zzso gene zzso that zzso binds to zzso were cloned with zzso serving as the reporter zzso The expression of zzso regulated by zzso in the fusion gene zzso was zzso the zzso primer zzso which could specifically bind to zzso and the zzso primer zzso not binding with zzso was zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso or zzso and additional cells were zzso with zzso and different zzso of zzso or zzso The cells were incubated with zzso zzso media for zzso zzso after zzso zzso gamma camera imaging, and zzso counting were subsequently conducted, and the correlation among zzso gamma camera imaging, and zzso counting was compared when zzso with zzso 

zzso gamma camera imaging, and radioactive counting showed that zzso zzso cells had significantly higher zzso of zzso compared to zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells decreased to approximately zzso compared to zzso cells, since zzso expression was suppressed by zzso zzso After zzso with zzso and various zzso of zzso zzso zzso gradually decreased with increasing zzso while zzso zzso remained roughly unchanged in the presence of zzso zzso with different amounts of zzso zzso was highly correlated with gamma camera imaging zzso and zzso counting zzso 

Based upon zzso reporter genes which mediate the zzso of the zzso both zzso and gamma camera imaging can zzso detect zzso expression in cells, which may provide a new way for the zzso of zzso zzso
