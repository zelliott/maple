zzso zzso cancer cells enhance their ability to migrate and invade through the zzso transition zzso resulting in cell seeding and zzso in the zzso cavity and onto adjacent organ zzso It has been speculated that zzso zzso such as those of the zzso filament, play a role in enhanced cell zzso however, direct evidence has not been zzso zzso we have directly measured zzso to zzso mechanical forces generated by zzso dynamics of zzso cancer zzso cells upon binding of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso formation of a focal zzso using real-time atomic force zzso zzso in a force zzso zzso The zzso surface chemistry through which zzso was immobilized on the zzso probe surfaces further enhanced the sensitivity of the force measurement by zzso zzso zzso cells, induced by transforming growth zzso generated larger focal zzso mechanical forces (17 and 41 zzso before and after zzso zzso with migration faster than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the forces transmitted through a single zzso zzso pair from zzso cells were shown to be sufficient to zzso the binding between zzso and zzso zzso on the cells, a result which is not observed on zzso zzso This implies that zzso cells, by generating forces strong enough to break the zzso zzso migrate and zzso beyond the zzso whereas zzso cancer cells are confined in the zzso without such force zzso These results demonstrate quantitative and direct evidence for the role of zzso dynamics in the enhanced zzso of zzso zzso cancer cells, providing a fundamental insight into the mechanism of zzso cancer zzso
