zzso DNA zzso is entirely dependent on nuclear genes for its zzso and zzso One of these genes is zzso which encodes the zzso DNA zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso To zzso zzso regulation, we performed zzso profiling across the zzso line panel (the zzso of the National Cancer Institute zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso expression varies widely across these cell lines with the highest levels in leukemia zzso zzso and melanoma zzso intermediate levels in breast zzso zzso zzso and colon zzso zzso zzso and lowest levels in zzso zzso zzso prostate zzso zzso and central nervous system cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses show that zzso expression is significantly correlated with the other zzso zzso genes including the zzso zzso zzso and demonstrate an overall zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We also find very high correlation between the expression of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso contains zzso zzso binding zzso and zzso zzso follows zzso zzso and zzso by zzso promoter zzso and zzso against zzso Our finding implicates zzso as a novel regulator of zzso and confirms its role as a master regulator of zzso and zzso zzso
