Here, we explore the therapeutic potential of zzso a zzso inhibitor that targets multiple zzso and zzso zzso zzso including members of the zzso zzso family, zzso and focal zzso zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso 

We examined the effects of zzso on zzso invasion, zzso zzso arrest, and zzso activity using a panel of 34 established human zzso cancer cell zzso zzso markers for response prediction were studied using gene expression zzso Multiple drug zzso index zzso zzso analysis was used to study the interactions with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso effects of zzso were seen in all zzso cancer cell lines tested, but varied significantly between individual cell lines with up to a 3 zzso difference in the zzso values zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited invasion, and induced cell zzso but less zzso zzso At a wide range of clinically achievable drug zzso additive and synergistic interactions were observed for zzso plus zzso zzso zzso values, zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso values, zzso zzso In this study, 24 out of 34 zzso representative zzso cancer cell lines were highly sensitive to zzso compared with only 8 out of 39 zzso representative breast cancer cell lines previously zzso Cell lines with high expression of Yes, zzso zzso zzso and 2, zzso zzso and zzso were particularly sensitive to zzso 

These data provide a clear biological rationale to test zzso as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy in patients with zzso zzso
