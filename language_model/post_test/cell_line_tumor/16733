zzso zzso zzso zzso have been reported to induce cell growth arrest, zzso and differentiation of tumor zzso The present study aimed to examine the effects of zzso A zzso one such zzso on the cell cycle, zzso and zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso 63 cells were treated with zzso at various zzso Then, cell growth and zzso were determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell cycling was assessed by flow zzso invasion zzso were performed with the zzso zzso Chamber zzso 

zzso zzso revealed that zzso significantly inhibited the growth of zzso cells in a concentration and time dependent zzso zzso treated cells demonstrated zzso changes indicative of zzso and zzso zzso revealed increased zzso of zzso cells after zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso arrested the cell cycle in zzso phase and zzso V positive zzso cells increased zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso cells was inhibited by zzso in a concentration dependent zzso 

Our findings demonstrate that zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso may thus have promise to become new therapeutic agents against zzso
