Breast cancer zzso is promoted by the small zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a zzso zzso exchange factor that activates zzso and zzso in zzso We previously reported that two zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso have different characteristics in binding and transport of small zzso To define the role of zzso in breast cancer, we tested the expression of zzso in breast tumors, and the role of each zzso zzso in zzso tumor growth, zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity in breast cancer zzso We show zzso zzso protein expression in breast cancer samples compared with normal breast zzso In addition, zzso survival zzso indicated that patients with high zzso expression in their tumors had worse clinical zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso in breast cancer cells decreased zzso in zzso tumor growth, and zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso promoted a zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso which provides a potential mechanism to define how zzso zzso of zzso promotes breast zzso This study demonstrates that elevated zzso expression in breast tumors zzso with poor survival, and that zzso plays a functional role in breast cancer zzso Taken together, these findings define zzso as a unique promoter of zzso and zzso activity and a novel therapeutic target in breast zzso 

This study defines a new mechanism to regulate the activities of zzso and zzso in breast cancer cells, and identifies zzso as a novel promoter of breast cancer zzso
