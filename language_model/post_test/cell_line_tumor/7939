zzso zzso is a serious food-borne bacterial pathogen in the developed zzso zzso is a major zzso and zzso zzso appears highly adapted to the gastrointestinal tract of zzso Several factors are important for chicken colonization and zzso including a taxis mechanism for environmental zzso To explore the mechanism of zzso in zzso zzso we constructed zzso with deletions of five putative zzso zzso zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Surprisingly, the deletions did not affect the zzso behavior of the zzso compared to that of the parental zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains displayed a zzso decrease in the ability to invade human zzso and chicken zzso cells, hence demonstrating that the corresponding proteins affect the host zzso zzso zzso zzso and chicken zzso were identified as new zzso of zzso zzso and we observed that chemical substances promoting tactic attraction are all known to support the growth of this zzso The zzso could be zzso as carbon sources and electron donors and zzso and we zzso observed a correlation between an zzso potency and its efficiency as an energy zzso The tactic attraction was inhibited by the respiratory zzso zzso zzso zzso and sodium zzso which significantly reduce energy production by zzso zzso These findings strongly indicate that energy taxis is the primary force in environmental navigation by zzso zzso and that this mechanism drives the zzso toward the optimal chemical conditions for energy generation and zzso
