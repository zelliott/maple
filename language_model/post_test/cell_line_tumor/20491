Despite the recent advances made in the treatment of multiple zzso the disease still remains zzso The zzso potential of zzso has previously been shown and is currently in phase III clinical trials for solid zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso can successfully target human multiple myeloma in zzso ex zzso and in zzso without affecting human zzso stem cell zzso zzso in a zzso model that partially zzso human multiple zzso 

Human myeloma cell lines and ex zzso tumor specimens were exposed to zzso and zzso and mechanisms of cell death were zzso zzso zzso cells were injected zzso to non-obese zzso combined immune deficient zzso mice and treated with live zzso zzso or dead virus zzso Multiple myeloma disease progression was evaluated via zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso zzso exposed to zzso were injected to zzso mice and zzso was zzso 

A total of six of seven myeloma cell lines and five of seven patient tumor specimens exposed to zzso showed significant in zzso zzso zzso response of multiple myeloma by zzso but not zzso was confirmed by comparison of total tumor weights zzso zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mice injected with zzso or zzso zzso maintained in zzso zzso differentiation showing a lack of viral effect on the stem cell zzso zzso zzso was zzso primarily by zzso of the zzso zzso 

The unique ability of zzso to selectively kill multiple myeloma while sparing zzso places it as a promising systemic multiple myeloma therapeutic for clinical zzso
