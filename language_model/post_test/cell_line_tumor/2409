zzso zzso is a zzso protein implicated in a wide range of cellular zzso including zzso and zzso processing, as well as in both cancer and neurological zzso However, little is currently known about zzso target genes and how they are zzso Here, we used zzso and promoter zzso to identify genes potentially regulated by zzso Among these zzso we detected a number that correlate with previously known functions of zzso and confirmed zzso occupancy at several of them by zzso We also detected changes in zzso levels of these target genes in cells where zzso levels were altered, indicative of both zzso and zzso Next, we used data from the zzso and zzso methods to determine whether specific sequences were enriched in DNA fragments bound by zzso This analysis suggested the existence of zzso response zzso and we show that zzso zzso indeed binds these sequences with specificity in zzso zzso however, zzso binds only zzso versions of the zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso regulates expression of specific target zzso likely via recognition of specific zzso DNA sequences located within their promoter zzso
