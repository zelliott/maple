zzso zzso of zzso peptides are proposed as interesting candidates for novel cancer therapies since they are capable of targeting a specific kind of zzso Here, we have zzso a zzso zzso zzso compound linked to the zzso zzso zzso In order to circumvent synthetic difficulties encountered when adding a zzso zzso zzso onto the zzso zzso zzso and to enhance the cellular zzso we zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso first zzso by zzso zzso acid to form the zzso zzso 3, before adding zzso to a zzso zzso zzso to form the zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 represents the first zzso zzso zzso zzso reported to zzso It shows moderate zzso against zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso
