In the present study, a series of zzso zzso were zzso and then evaluated in terms of their zzso activities against four human cancer cell lines, zzso lung cancer zzso zzso cancer zzso skin cancer zzso and colon cancer zzso as well as zzso activities against three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The title compounds were zzso by zzso zzso reaction of zzso cyanide or zzso cyanide with zzso zzso in good zzso Most of the compounds exhibited significant zzso activities against the growth of all cancer cell zzso zzso zzso was most active in zzso the growth of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells lines with zzso values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, followed by compounds zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso times greater zzso activity against zzso cells, whereas it showed similar potency against zzso cells to that of the standard zzso agent zzso zzso relationship study revealed that zzso groups at the zzso of zzso ring B were more favorable for improved zzso activity, whereas the presence of zzso groups was zzso compare to zzso zzso An optimal electron density on zzso ring A of zzso zzso was crucial for their zzso activities against human cancer cell lines used in the present zzso zzso zzso activity relationships were studied using zzso zzso a good correlation between calculated polar surface area zzso a zzso zzso and zzso activity was zzso Moreover, all compounds showed significant zzso activities against zzso zzso whereas compound zzso showed potent zzso against both zzso zzso and zzso zzso bacterial zzso
