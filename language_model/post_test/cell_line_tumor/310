In this study, we investigated the zzso activity of zzso zzso a novel synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited a variety of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and suppressed growth of various cancer cell zzso Among the cell lines zzso colon cancer cells, including zzso zzso and zzso were the cell types most sensitive to zzso zzso zzso of cancer cell growth was comparable to or stronger than that of zzso zzso acid zzso a well-known zzso inhibitor approved by the zzso to treat zzso T cell zzso In zzso cells, zzso increased the zzso of zzso zzso cell cycle arrest zzso arrest at low doses and zzso arrest at high zzso and induced zzso The cell cycle arrest and zzso induced by zzso might be zzso through zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso In addition, zzso inhibited zzso tumor growth in a human tumor zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso exerts an zzso activity in zzso and in zzso and is a promising therapeutic candidate to treat human zzso
