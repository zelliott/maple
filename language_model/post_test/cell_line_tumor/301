zzso potential of root extracts of zzso zzso zzso extract zzso zzso extract zzso zzso extract zzso and zzso extract zzso and its possible mechanism against zzso cancer cells has been zzso Cellular proliferation activities were zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso changes of cancer cells were observed under zzso microscope and cell cycle parameters were determined by flow zzso following zzso zzso zzso Treatment with the extracts at various doses of 1, 5, 10 and 25 zzso revealed that zzso zzso and zzso possessed zzso whereas CW did not have zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso showed strongest zzso effect zzso on zzso at 48 zzso following treatment, whereas CM and zzso showed zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited typical zzso changes of zzso zzso of flow zzso analysis clearly demonstrated that root extracts initiated zzso of zzso cells through cell cycle arrest at S phase, thus preventing cells from entering zzso zzso zzso of the study indicate that the root extracts of zzso zzso inhibit the proliferation of zzso cells via zzso and cell cycle disruption based zzso
