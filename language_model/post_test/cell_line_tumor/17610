zzso interaction contributes to local prostate tumor growth, zzso progression and distant zzso We have established in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso tumor models to evaluate the roles of zzso cells isolated from either zzso or normal bone, a site where prostate cancer cells frequently zzso in contributing to the growth and survival of human prostate cancer zzso We have evaluated extensively the effects of toxic gene therapy using zzso zzso human prostate cancer models both in zzso and in zzso In the in zzso zzso cell model, we assessed cancer cell growth and residual cellular proteins after targeting either prostate cancer zzso cells alone or both prostate cancer and bone zzso zzso In the in zzso animal model, we measured tumor volume and serum zzso zzso zzso in mice bearing zzso prostate tumors comprised of human prostate tumor cells and normal bone zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that: zzso The rate of human prostate cancer cell growth in zzso is accelerated by zzso with human and rat zzso or normal mouse bone zzso zzso cell zzso No growth stimulation was noted when zzso with a human prostate zzso cell zzso zzso zzso the growth of normal bone zzso cells using transgenic targeting with a bystander zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso plus the zzso zzso zzso or zzso markedly depressed the growth of zzso human prostate cancer cells in zzso and human prostate zzso normal bone zzso zzso tumors in zzso zzso By zzso both human prostate cancer and normal mouse bone zzso cells in zzso with an zzso zzso zzso (a zzso zzso zzso with the bystander zzso zzso under the control of a human zzso zzso zzso plus zzso we observed greater zzso of tumor cell growth than by targeting a single cell compartment with zzso (a zzso construct similar to zzso except that the zzso expression is under regulation by a full-length human zzso zzso These results, taken together, established a basic principle that zzso both tumor and its supporting zzso is more zzso than targeting a single cell compartment in the treatment of human prostate cancer bone zzso This principle can be applied to other clinical conditions of cancer growth where zzso contribute to the overall growth and survival potential of the zzso
