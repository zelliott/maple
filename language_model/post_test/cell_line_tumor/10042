The effect of zzso a membrane specific zzso zzso zzso (this paper uses the original term zzso for the formally designated zzso zzso zzso on its ability to enhance killing of zzso cancer zzso cell lines by human immune zzso cells was zzso In zzso efficacy of the zzso was also zzso 

The zzso was modified using zzso cells zzso with zzso III and the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The resulting zzso of the zzso segment zzso pattern enhances the zzso binding affinity to the zzso zzso on human immune zzso cells but does not alter the zzso binding zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso is inhibited in the presence of zzso blocking zzso This zzso of zzso enhances zzso zzso relative to the parent unmodified zzso using either zzso peripheral blood zzso or natural killer zzso cells and zzso zzso cells as zzso zzso cells are far more potent in zzso zzso than either freshly isolated zzso or zzso zzso zzso and automated fluorescent zzso have been used to show that both versions of zzso can induce zzso cellular zzso zzso by zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso did not mediate enhanced zzso This may be explained by the relatively low expression of zzso on cultured zzso In zzso studies show the efficacy of zzso zzso zzso zzso in significantly improving survival in a zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The greatly enhanced in zzso zzso activity of the zzso version of zzso is likely to be clinically zzso
