The zzso zzso factor of activated T zzso family of zzso factors plays a fundamental role in the zzso regulation of the immune zzso However, zzso are zzso zzso and recent evidence points to their important functions in human zzso cells and zzso Specifically, zzso has been shown to be active in human breast and colon zzso cells and to promote their invasion through zzso The mechanisms by which zzso promotes invasion have not been zzso To identify zzso target genes that induce zzso invasion, we have established stable breast cancer cell lines that zzso express zzso active zzso Gene expression profiling by zzso zzso of cells induced to express zzso revealed zzso of zzso zzso Increased zzso expression and activity induced zzso expression as well as zzso zzso zzso This induction was more prominent when zzso was activated by zzso zzso zzso and calcium zzso zzso and was blocked by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Breast cancer cells with elevated zzso expression showed increased invasion through zzso and this was reduced in cells treated with zzso zzso zzso loss of zzso protein expression using small interfering zzso led to a reduction in zzso zzso and reduced zzso Similarly, zzso invasion was reduced in cells in which zzso expression was reduced using specific zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso promotes breast cancer cell invasion through the induction of zzso and the synthesis of zzso
