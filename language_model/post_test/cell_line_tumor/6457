This study was designed to investigate the potential protective effect of a zzso extract of zzso zzso leaves on zzso light and zzso oxide zzso DNA zzso In addition, we investigated the growth zzso activity of this natural product against human melanoma cells zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified using a zzso zzso The extract was incubated with zzso DNA and, before irradiating the samples with zzso zzso zzso was zzso For analysis of DNA zzso breaks induced by zzso the experiments were performed by zzso the extract with zzso zzso In the study on zzso cell line, cell viability was measured using zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso a marker of membrane breakdown, was also zzso For the detection of zzso the evaluation of DNA fragmentation zzso zzso and zzso activity zzso were zzso The expression of heat shock protein 70 zzso was detected by Western zzso zzso Generation of zzso oxygen species was measured by using a fluorescent zzso 

The extract zzso the synergistic effect of the constituents zzso and zzso showed a protective effect on zzso DNA and selectively inhibited the growth of melanoma zzso But a novel finding was that zzso evoked by this natural product in zzso cells, appears to be zzso at least in part, via the zzso of zzso zzso which may be correlated with a zzso of zzso zzso 

These results confirm the promising biological properties of zzso zzso and encourage zzso investigations into its potential zzso zzso
