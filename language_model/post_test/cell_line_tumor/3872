zzso is a zzso zzso expressed by mature B zzso It zzso signal zzso by the zzso zzso and its zzso zzso Recent reports indicate that most human lung cancer cells and cell lines express zzso making it an important new therapeutic target for lung zzso The objective of our studies was to independently validate these results with the goal of testing the efficacy of our zzso zzso on lung cancer cell zzso As determined by quantitative real-time zzso analysis, we found that levels of zzso zzso in a panel of human lung cancer cell lines were 200 to zzso lower than those observed in the human zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso Using flow zzso with a panel of zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso we could not detect surface or zzso expression of zzso protein in a panel of lung cancer cell zzso In addition, the in zzso proliferation of the lung tumor cell lines was not affected by either zzso zzso or our highly potent zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso cells expressed high levels of zzso zzso and zzso and were sensitive to our zzso zzso zzso primary zzso cell lung zzso from more than 250 patient specimens did not express zzso levels of zzso protein as assessed by zzso We conclude that zzso is not expressed at measurable levels on the surface of lung cancer cells, and that these cells cannot be killed by zzso zzso
