Acute zzso leukemia zzso is sustained by the extensive proliferation of zzso stem and zzso cells, which give rise to the population of zzso blasts with defective differentiation and low zzso zzso We have recently shown that zzso of zzso a cell surface zzso present on zzso cells, with specific zzso zzso zzso zzso their zzso However, its mechanism has not been investigated zzso Here, using the zzso cell line as a model of zzso human zzso cells, and the zzso zzso to zzso zzso we show for the first time that zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso resulting in increased association with zzso zzso complexes and zzso of their zzso zzso Moreover, using a zzso zzso zzso we provide direct evidence that zzso is the main zzso of cell growth arrest by zzso zzso zzso also leads to zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cell lines and in primary zzso cells, suggesting that this process is general in zzso Taken together, our present results suggest that zzso is a new and efficient means to increase the expression of zzso in zzso zzso Considering that elevated expression of zzso is a factor of good prognosis in zzso these results provide a new basis for developing zzso therapy in zzso
