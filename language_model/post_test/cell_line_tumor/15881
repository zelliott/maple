zzso of rare cells often requires separation and detection with each procedure posing substantial zzso This paper presents a zzso zzso platform for both procedures via an zzso negative selection zzso The zzso zzso unique features include a zzso magnetic zzso to trap labeled cells in double zzso areas, drainage of fluid to substantially shorten detection time, and a zzso regions to capture target cells to facilitate a seamless zzso zzso zzso was conducted using zzso as target rare cells zzso with zzso zzso spiked into zzso zzso zzso zzso cells (labeled with zzso and zzso BD magnetic zzso Then, zzso cells zzso from healthy blood donors were mixed with zzso modeling rare cells, and tested in the zzso zzso show a zzso magnetic zzso effect of the zzso magnet substantially increased the zzso efficacy over that of a single zzso contributing to the depletion rate of zzso which reaches zzso zzso time is extensively shortened by depletion of zzso of zzso fluid in the collection zzso The average yield of detected zzso cells is zzso 60 zzso zzso over a wide range of rarity from zzso to zzso and this yield also holds for the zzso complex zzso zzso with zzso and BD zzso zzso revealed the average yield from the disk zzso is superior to that of zzso zzso and BD zzso zzso The advantages of zzso yield, roughly 30 zzso of operation, an acceptable level of cell loss, and potentially low cost system should aid in zzso of rare zzso
