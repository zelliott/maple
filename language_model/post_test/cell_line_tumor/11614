zzso zzso a major component of bee zzso has been associated with various diseases including arthritis, zzso and various zzso In this study, the zzso effects of zzso in zzso cells that were responsive to the zzso growth factor zzso were zzso 

zzso decreased the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein and significantly regulated zzso and tumor zzso We found that zzso of the zzso protein level is due to the shortened zzso by zzso zzso zzso specifically inhibited the zzso zzso expression by suppressing the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso It also blocked the zzso DNA binding activity of zzso and the zzso of the vascular zzso growth factor zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso reduced the binding of zzso to the zzso promoter zzso zzso The zzso effects of zzso were confirmed through a zzso plus zzso 

zzso specifically suppressed zzso zzso zzso and new blood vessel formation by zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may inhibit human cervical cancer progression and zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso
