zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were tested for suitability as a drug carrier characterized by low zzso sustained release, high cellular zzso and zzso targeted delivery of zzso zzso zzso drug content, zzso efficiency, and in zzso drug release were zzso When the feeding amount of zzso zzso was increased, the drug content increased, but loading efficiency zzso zzso zzso had a zzso shape, with a particle size of approximately zzso zzso In zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso were conducted to confirm the safety of the zzso zzso activity and zzso laser scanning zzso zzso were used to confirm the targeting efficiency of target zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso results clearly demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso were quickly taken up by the zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso was analyzed by flow zzso revealing zzso via zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso may be used as an effective zzso drug delivery system for zzso
