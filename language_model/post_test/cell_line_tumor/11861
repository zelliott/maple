zzso is a consequence of many biological events, during which cancer stem cells are shifted into a zzso zzso Among these events, invasion of prostate cancer cells into host zzso is possible to be assessed by means of an in zzso invasion model, and is thought to be coupled to altered expression of membrane zzso zzso functions of the factors regulating zzso during zzso are known to facilitate zzso of many types of zzso zzso zzso box 2) is a member of the zzso zzso factor family, which regulates zzso zzso growth and branching in zzso of zzso zzso However, the role of zzso in prostate cancer development remains to be zzso 

zzso expression in human prostate zzso and normal prostate zzso were examined by quantitative zzso and zzso zzso invasion zzso and a gene array analysis were performed using prostate cancer cell lines zzso with either control or zzso zzso 

In human prostate zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso but was expressed at lower levels in zzso zzso zzso with this, zzso zzso zzso cell growth and invasion in a zzso invasion zzso Gene zzso analysis revealed that many cell membrane proteins were zzso after zzso zzso 

Our data suggested that zzso zzso promotes the development of the zzso state in prostate cancer cells, presumably through zzso the expression of cell membrane zzso
