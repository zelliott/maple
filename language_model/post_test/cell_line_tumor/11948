Moving from the evidence that zzso of type 4 zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso proliferation and promotes differentiation of zzso zzso cell zzso we examined the expression and function of zzso receptors in zzso zzso zzso receptors were expressed in 46 of 60 human zzso zzso zzso varied in relation to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and was zzso related to tumor severity, zzso and zzso zzso receptors were also found in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines, where zzso zzso with the selective zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso and the zzso zzso without affecting the zzso protein zzso Sonic zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso reduced DNA synthesis and cell proliferation in all three cell zzso This effect was zzso by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso In in zzso experiments, repeated subcutaneous injections of zzso zzso reduced the growth of zzso and zzso cell zzso in nude zzso More zzso subcutaneous or zzso injections of zzso during the first week of life prevented the development of zzso in mice lacking one zzso zzso and zzso 1 d after zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso enhancers are promising drugs for the treatment of zzso
