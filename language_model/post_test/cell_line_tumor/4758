zzso as a zzso compound has been employed as an zzso generator and often used to investigate the role of zzso in the biological zzso Here, we investigated the in zzso effect of zzso on cell growth, cell cycle and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of cell growth was observed with zzso of about 60 zzso for 48 h using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not alter zzso zzso level and zzso activity, but increased the zzso zzso level and decreased zzso activity in zzso zzso DNA flow zzso analysis indicated that 50 and 100 zzso zzso significantly increased zzso phase cells as compared with those of zzso zzso Also, zzso induced zzso as evidenced by flow zzso detection of zzso DNA content, zzso V binding zzso and zzso zzso This zzso process was accompanied with the loss of zzso zzso potential zzso zzso decrease, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Pan zzso inhibitor zzso could significantly rescue zzso cells from zzso cell zzso But, the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso did not prevent zzso events in zzso zzso zzso Taken together, we have demonstrated that an zzso zzso zzso zzso the growth of zzso zzso cells via cell cycle arrest and zzso and suggest that the compound exhibits an zzso efficacy on these zzso
