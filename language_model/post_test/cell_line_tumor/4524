zzso changes in zzso 8 are commonly observed in breast cancer cell lines and zzso To fine map such zzso changes by comparative zzso zzso zzso a high resolution zzso zzso zzso 8 array that can detect single copy changes was developed using zzso DNA zzso amplified zzso zzso artificial zzso zzso The zzso array zzso resolved the two known amplified regions zzso and zzso of a breast cancer cell line zzso into nine separate regions including six zzso and three deleted regions, all of which were verified by Fluorescence in zzso zzso The extent of the zzso for each region was validated by zzso zzso was performed with a total of 8 breast cancer cell lines, and common regions of zzso zzso were identified by zzso zzso A zzso region zzso zzso and a zzso region zzso zzso in zzso were amplified in zzso cell zzso A global expression analysis was performed to evaluate expression changes associated with zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso (at zzso zzso amplified in zzso cell lines, showed highest expression in these cell zzso Further analysis by zzso using zzso from 30 breast tumors showed that zzso was zzso zzso fold in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is a zzso of a zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso involved in the zzso modification of zzso and exploring the biological consequence of its altered zzso may reveal novel pathways in zzso This article contains zzso zzso available at zzso
