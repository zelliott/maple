zzso and zzso formation of zzso zzso have been demonstrated to be involved in the zzso of Alzheimer's zzso However, the precise mechanism of zzso zzso is not completely zzso Previous studies suggest that binding of zzso to a number of targets have deleterious effects on cellular zzso In the present study we have shown for the first time that zzso zzso bound to a zzso zzso the zzso binding domain of the heavy chain of zzso protein zzso by the screening of a human brain zzso library expressed on zzso zzso This interaction may explain, in part, the loss of zzso zzso integrity, impairment of zzso transport and synaptic dysfunction observed previously in Alzheimer's zzso
