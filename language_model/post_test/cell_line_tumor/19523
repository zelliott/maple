In order to zzso the role of the zzso protein zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as the zzso zzso signaling pathway, in the response to chemotherapy, we have conducted a comparative study regarding the effects of zzso on these zzso zzso was determined to elicit the zzso of zzso cells in a zzso zzso Prior to cell death, both zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso and subsequently zzso almost zzso whereas zzso and zzso evidenced sustained zzso in response to the drug zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso both accelerated and enhanced zzso zzso and zzso zzso apparently exerted negative effect on zzso The zzso of zzso zzso by treatment of zzso or expression of zzso zzso such as zzso or zzso exerted a significant effect on the zzso of zzso We also observed that zzso and sustained zzso zzso were associated intimately with the zzso zzso Taken together, our results clearly suggest that the differential regulation of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling pathways are crucial in the context of zzso drug-induced zzso and this has compelled us to propose that the sustained zzso of zzso zzso may be generally involved in the zzso induced by zzso zzso drugs, including zzso and zzso
