Most patients with zzso zzso cancer zzso experience drug-resistant disease zzso Identification of new treatments is a high priority, and zzso studies in mouse models of zzso may zzso this zzso We previously developed methods for magnetic resonance imaging zzso for tumor detection and zzso in a transgenic mouse model of zzso The goal of this study was to determine whether three-dimensional zzso zzso molecular zzso zzso and fluorescent molecular imaging zzso could be effectively used for in zzso detection of zzso tumors and response to zzso zzso zzso zzso mice injected with fluorescent zzso were subjected to zzso and zzso zzso probe retention was identified in zzso by alignment of the zzso data sets, confirmed by ex zzso fluorescent imaging and correlated with zzso zzso Mice were treated with standard chemotherapy, and changes in fluorescent probe binding were detected by zzso and zzso zzso tumors were detected using zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso probe zzso and retention correlated strongly with tumor zzso zzso probe zzso was readily detected in tumors but correlated less strongly with tumor zzso zzso zzso associated with response to therapy was detected and zzso by serial zzso and zzso These results demonstrate the feasibility and sensitivity of zzso for detection and zzso of zzso zzso targets in zzso tumors and support the zzso utility of molecular imaging to assess functional response to therapy in mouse models of zzso
