To examine the clinical zzso of zzso 4, a promising second-generation zzso for the zzso treatment of zzso skin diseases, we studied the zzso and zzso cell lines, commonly used as surrogates for human zzso zzso and zzso zzso As revealed by zzso zzso extraction and zzso zzso zzso of zzso 4 into the two cell lines was linear with zzso 4 concentration and similar on a per cell basis but greater in zzso cells on a per mass zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso was linear at low zzso variations in the zzso for zzso measured by zzso supported differential zzso of zzso 4 in the two cell zzso As detected by zzso zzso zzso 4 localized to zzso and zzso zzso in both cell zzso zzso cells were much more sensitive to the lethal effects of zzso zzso therapy zzso zzso than were zzso cells, as measured by a zzso dye reduction zzso and more readily underwent zzso zzso In a search for molecular factors to explain the greater zzso of zzso cells, the fate of important zzso family members was zzso zzso cells were more sensitive to the induction of immediate zzso to zzso but the difference was insufficient to account fully for their greater zzso The zzso protein zzso was extensively zzso in a zzso and zzso manner in zzso but not in zzso cells exposed to zzso zzso Thus, the greater killing by zzso zzso in zzso compared with zzso cells correlated with greater zzso zzso and more strongly to the more extensive zzso zzso zzso zzso may offer therapeutic advantages in targeting inflammatory cells over normal zzso in the treatment of zzso skin diseases, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue reactions and zzso and it will be zzso to evaluate the role of zzso family zzso especially zzso in the therapeutic zzso
