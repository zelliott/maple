Human zzso studies suggest an association between zzso zzso activity and the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso In this study, zzso was selected to examine the zzso of zzso zzso activity, gene expression and zzso zzso formation in a human zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso The activity of zzso was determined by high performance liquid zzso zzso zzso for the amounts of zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso and zzso Human zzso zzso cell zzso and intact cells were used to examine the zzso activity, gene expression and zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrated that zzso activity percent of zzso in examined cells, gene expression zzso zzso and zzso zzso formation in human zzso zzso cells were inhibited and decreased by zzso in a zzso zzso The results also demonstrated that zzso decreased the apparent values of zzso and zzso from intact human zzso zzso cells zzso zzso Thus, zzso is an uncompetitive inhibitor of the zzso zzso
