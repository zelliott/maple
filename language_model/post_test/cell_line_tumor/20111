The repellent factor family of zzso molecules has been described as having a repulsive function in the developing nervous system on growing zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso Recent studies determined the effects of zzso molecules on the migratory and invasive potential of several types of tumor cells but also on zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso arthritis zzso zzso To zzso a potential therapeutic application we aimed at zzso of zzso showing the same functional ability as the full-length zzso but having the advantage of a smaller zzso zzso zzso proteins were expressed and analyzed by western zzso Their activity was defined by functional zzso such as migration zzso with zzso and melanoma zzso zzso zzso containing only zzso rich repeat domain 2 zzso the domain important for zzso binding and the minimal functional unit zzso zzso were both able to inhibit migration of zzso as effectively as zzso with all 4 zzso zzso our data showed that the ability of zzso to reduce the migratory activity of zzso cells from patients with zzso and melanoma cells can be zzso by small protein fragments derived from zzso zzso fragments may be helpful in therapeutic zzso however, further studies are necessary in order to zzso their activity in zzso
