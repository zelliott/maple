Although the zzso zzso II exhibits zzso and zzso activities, its molecular zzso in human multiple myeloma cells are poorly zzso To analyze the effects on signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso signaling and zzso zzso multiple myeloma cells were treated with zzso II and performed Western zzso zzso mobility gel shift zzso zzso zzso proliferation zzso cell cycle analysis and terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso zzso zzso II inhibited zzso zzso and enhanced the expression of zzso and zzso through zzso zzso activated zzso 2 zzso and zzso zzso II zzso the expression of zzso target genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso Also, zzso II enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso reversed the zzso zzso zzso zzso and also blocked the zzso of zzso and zzso suggesting involvement of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso II enhanced the zzso effects of clinically used drugs zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso II could be a potential therapeutic intervention agent alone or in combination with current drugs for multiple myeloma as a novel blocker of zzso signaling zzso at multiple levels, contributing to its zzso and zzso
