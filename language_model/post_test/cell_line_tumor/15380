zzso of the transforming growth factor zzso zzso signal zzso cascade is functionally linked to zzso In early zzso zzso acts as a tumor zzso by zzso tumor cell zzso whereas in late zzso it can act as a tumor promoter by stimulating tumor cell invasion and zzso zzso zzso zzso mediate zzso responses, but relatively little is known about the zzso complexes that are important for zzso transition and zzso In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that specific members of the zzso zzso factor family determine zzso signaling specificity in breast cancer cell zzso Using a zzso model of zzso zzso of zzso zzso human breast cancer cells, we identified the zzso zzso factor components zzso zzso zzso and zzso as essential factors for zzso invasion and found that various zzso and zzso zzso genes are zzso by these zzso In zzso proximity zzso zzso showed that zzso signaling not only zzso complexes between zzso and zzso in the nucleus but also complexes between zzso and zzso whereas complexes between zzso zzso and zzso could already be detected before zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso are required for zzso binding of zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso Together these results suggest that in particular formation of zzso complexes may reflect zzso of the zzso zzso invasion zzso
