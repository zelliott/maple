Recent zzso studies have suggested that obesity is associated with zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso and its zzso zzso contribute to tumor development by enhancing cell growth and zzso This study was design to investigate the prevalence of zzso and zzso in Middle Eastern zzso zzso cancer zzso and to analyze the role of zzso and the mechanisms under its action in zzso tissue sample and cell zzso 

The expression of zzso and zzso was examined by zzso in a tissue zzso of 156 zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells in response to zzso was assessed by zzso zzso and its zzso effects were determined by flow zzso Effect of zzso on zzso signaling zzso was further determined by western zzso 

In clinical samples, zzso zzso was seen in zzso zzso and was significantly associated with poor progression free survival zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso expression was associated with anti zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis using zzso cell lines showed that zzso zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso via zzso of zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso activity by zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Gene zzso of zzso with zzso zzso in zzso cells resulted in down regulation of zzso and its down stream zzso 

Our findings have potential clinical implication for zzso development and zzso
