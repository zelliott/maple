Using a zzso zzso screening strategy, we have previously identified 76 potent zzso of zzso responsiveness in zzso lung zzso The top hit isolated from this screen, zzso is a well-established component of the zzso zzso zzso Here, we performed a high-resolution zzso analysis to reveal the zzso zzso by which zzso depletion collaborates with zzso We find that zzso supports faithful zzso by contributing to the formation of a bipolar zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity as well as expression of the critical zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of additional members of the zzso complex zzso similar zzso suggesting that zzso machinery is intimately coupled to zzso function and thus zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor cells depleted of zzso display reduced zzso but the zzso defects that we observe are not evident in immortalized zzso These results demonstrate a critical connection between the zzso machinery and zzso and suggest that tumor cells have an enhanced dependency on these components for zzso zzso
