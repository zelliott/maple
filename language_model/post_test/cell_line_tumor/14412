The levels of General zzso Factor zzso zzso were examined during zzso brain development and in rat zzso zzso and transformed cell zzso The large zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are largely produced in zzso cell lines, yet only zzso zzso is observed in a number of differentiated tissue zzso zzso protein levels of the zzso zzso zzso and gamma zzso were significantly reduced when human zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines were zzso to differentiate with either zzso acid zzso or sodium zzso zzso zzso cells required zzso to induce a zzso zzso and loss of zzso zzso zzso and gamma zzso High levels of zzso zzso zzso and gamma and zzso factors were identified in extracts from human fetal and rat embryonic zzso zzso but not in human and rat adult brain zzso A high zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio was observed in the zzso zzso promoter of primary zzso zzso from zzso rat zzso suggesting that repressive zzso marks of zzso prevent zzso zzso from being transcribed in zzso We conclude that zzso zzso is associated with zzso cells during development, yet is zzso at the zzso level upon cellular zzso
