The poor selective zzso of zzso drugs lead to zzso adverse effects which compromise the clinical zzso Solid tumors recruit new blood vessels to support their growth, and zzso that are uniquely expressed on tumor cells and tumor zzso cells zzso can function as targets for zzso zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso zzso an important protein related to tumor growth and zzso is expressed on zzso tumor cells and is activated zzso Selective delivery could be achieved by targeting zzso as well as other zzso zzso In this regard, an zzso zzso zzso was used to prepare a zzso targeted zzso stabilized zzso zzso The binding and zzso distribution of zzso and a zzso zzso stabilized zzso zzso were examined using human zzso zzso zzso zzso was taken up by the cells in a zzso zzso temperature, and time dependent manner, ultimately accumulating in the zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher than that of zzso zzso The cellular zzso of zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso suggesting that their zzso was zzso via zzso or zzso zzso Furthermore, the efficient binding of zzso was observed on human zzso vein zzso cells zzso Based on these results, it would be expected that zzso may achieve direct tumor cell kill and indirect tumor cell kill via the destruction of the tumor zzso in zzso This strategy may have the potential for overcoming some major limitations in conventional chemotherapy in zzso
