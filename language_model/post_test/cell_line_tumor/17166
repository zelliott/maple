The human zzso zzso zzso gene contains an uninterrupted zzso repeat that is zzso in length in the general population zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso repeat encodes a zzso repeat in the zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso We previously reported that a zzso zzso gene was much more common in a cohort of men with prostate cancer zzso than in the general European American population zzso This suggested that a zzso repeat may have zzso zzso The goal of the present study was to directly test the hypothesis that a zzso repeat might uniquely affect zzso action in human prostate cancer zzso 

zzso cells, lacking zzso zzso were zzso zzso with an zzso expression zzso (with a zzso repeat ranging in length from 14 to 25) and an zzso reporter zzso zzso 

We found a significant effect of zzso repeat length on zzso protein levels per unit amount of DNA zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso indicating the need to express zzso data per unit amount of zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso more zzso activity per unit amount of zzso protein than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Thus, an zzso with a zzso repeat may mediate more zzso growth stimulation of zzso prostate zzso cells, and thereby increase the risk that prostate cancer cells develop more efficiently into a clinically significant zzso
