zzso zzso indicate that zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso in many human zzso Yet the relationship between zzso and human zzso cell zzso zzso remains zzso The aim of our study was to evaluate zzso expression in human zzso cell lines and its role in zzso of human zzso Among the human zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and normal zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso was found in zzso cells both at zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were constructed and transferred into zzso zzso zzso suppression of cellular proliferation was demonstrated in zzso zzso zzso whereas promotion was found in zzso sense zzso by zzso zzso despite the observation that zzso specific inhibitor zzso exhibited similar zzso among zzso cell lines by zzso zzso In comparison with parent cells and sense zzso significant suppression of zzso expression and zzso production and increase in zzso zzso were observed in zzso zzso zzso by Western zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis, zzso Furthermore, tumor growth and zzso of zzso zzso zzso in nude mice was significantly suppressed and the survival time of these mice was significantly zzso Our study demonstrates that zzso is zzso in zzso zzso cell line and plays an important role in zzso of the cells in zzso which implies that zzso may be a therapeutic target for zzso zzso and that suppression of zzso expression by zzso strategy may have potential utility in treatment of zzso zzso
