The expression of zzso interacting zzso zzso zzso and the de zzso expression of zzso are frequently involved in zzso transitions zzso under both normal and pathological zzso In the present study, we investigated the potential role of zzso in the regulation of zzso during the zzso associated with breast tumor cell migration and zzso zzso several breast tumor cell lines displaying various degrees of zzso we found zzso and zzso expression only in invasive cell zzso Also, using a model of cell migration with human zzso zzso cells, we showed that zzso is induced specifically in zzso migratory zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells increased their zzso expression both at the zzso and protein levels and enhanced their migratory abilities in zzso Chamber zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso strategies in zzso cells and zzso cells decreased zzso zzso We also showed that zzso zzso did not activate the zzso reporter system, suggesting that the zzso zzso is not implicated in the regulation of zzso by zzso Our results therefore zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso observed in the zzso associated with breast tumor cell migration, a zzso that may contribute to the zzso progression of breast zzso
