zzso resistant zzso cancer is difficult to zzso zzso that are effective zzso zzso have never exited clinical trials as zzso approved products due to side zzso It has been hypothesized that using a combination of zzso with a mixture of zzso zzso (each with different side zzso may lead to useful treatment zzso Because the experimental space for combination treatments can be large, this space may be zzso to explore using animal zzso Here we describe an in zzso system based on zzso and cell culture that can potentially be used to explore large experimental spaces zzso The zzso Cell Culture zzso zzso concept mimics the body's response using interconnected compartments that represent various zzso or zzso A zzso is based on the structure of an appropriate zzso based zzso zzso model and zzso the body's dynamic response to exposure to various drugs and zzso For this problem we have chosen a zzso with living cells representing the liver zzso bone zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso cancer zzso In proof of concept experiments we found in 24 h zzso zzso and 72 h treatments that the zzso system predicts combining the zzso zzso with zzso and zzso as zzso zzso will have greater efficacy than using zzso by itself or with either zzso zzso This combined strategy is selective in zzso zzso cell proliferation and may prove to be advantageous in zzso by specifically targeting zzso cancer with acceptable zzso This cell specific zzso was not observed in traditional zzso plate zzso By combining the zzso with a zzso model, appropriate drug doses and area under the curve exposure for in zzso trials can be zzso directly from the results obtained with this zzso This device and approach should be useful in screening potential zzso combinations to determine candidate treatments for zzso zzso zzso this approach may be useful for in zzso evaluation of human response to a wide range of zzso to zzso of chemicals or zzso
