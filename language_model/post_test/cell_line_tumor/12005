Comparing normal human zzso zzso cells to a panel of six representative zzso cell zzso zzso cell lines, we showed that while TRAIL zzso expression patterns were similar, zzso to soluble zzso zzso TRAIL fell into three zzso zzso zzso lines were sensitive, undergoing rapid and extensive zzso zzso and zzso cells were partially resistant and zzso cells, like normal zzso were zzso Both normal and zzso zzso cells underwent zzso via the same zzso zzso Rapid zzso zzso was a mechanism for evasion by some zzso zzso TRAIL resistance in zzso zzso cells was partially dependent on zzso and was zzso zzso by zzso whereas in normal cells, resistance was zzso by zzso zzso extensive killing of zzso cells could be induced using zzso TRAIL after prolonged exposure, with no damage to their zzso normal zzso cell zzso
