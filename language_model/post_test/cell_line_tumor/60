Resistance to zzso zzso zzso is a major problem in zzso zzso zzso zzso Most of the studies about resistance have focused on point zzso on zzso However, other types of resistance that do not imply zzso in zzso have been also zzso In the present report we aim to study the role of several zzso in IM resistance not associate to zzso zzso Therefore we used an experimental system of resistant cell lines generated by zzso with IM zzso Lama 84) as well as primary material from resistant and zzso patient without zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso and zzso signaling pathways are not implicated in the acquired resistance zzso However, zzso but not zzso is critical for the acquired resistance to zzso In fact, zzso activates zzso zzso in transient zzso in a dose dependent fashion through the zzso part of the zzso zzso Finally, we present zzso demonstrating how zzso zzso of zzso is a de zzso mechanism of resistance to zzso In summary our data support the use of therapeutic approaches based on zzso zzso which could be added to the therapeutic zzso to fight zzso especially when IM resistance develops secondary to zzso zzso
