zzso elicit high response rates in zzso zzso zzso but zzso in response duration is observed, with some patients achieving cure and others showing zzso disease or zzso Using a zzso targeted zzso screen, we discovered a gene regulatory circuit involving the nuclear factor zzso which characterizes aggressive disease and resistance to the zzso zzso zzso zzso in high-risk zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to inhibit the zzso of zzso zzso in mice and to zzso gene expression programs of biological relevance to zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso increased the sensitivity of human zzso B cells to zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso this effect could be zzso by in zzso treatment of zzso B cells with a small zzso inhibitor for BET zzso proteins zzso In zzso this work has identified zzso as a new zzso cooperating factor that autonomously drives aggressive zzso growth and zzso resistance in zzso This resistance mechanism is amenable to next-generation zzso therapy by BET zzso zzso thereby providing a new combination therapy rationale for high-risk zzso
