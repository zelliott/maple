zzso an inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso generates zzso depletion within the zzso and simultaneously increases zzso level in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso leads cells to cope with stressful conditions, including zzso stress, which affect the folding of newly zzso proteins and induce the zzso of unfolded zzso and eventually zzso via zzso of the unfolded protein response zzso In the present work, we analyzed the zzso changes in human zzso cells following acute treatment with zzso We highlighted a peculiar pattern of protein zzso marked by altered expression of zzso zzso and of proteins involved in zzso pathways or in cell zzso For specific zzso zzso the zzso zzso signature was compared by Western zzso to that resulting from the treatment of zzso cells with reducing agents or with zzso zzso to elicit zzso zzso stress by additional means and to reveal novel, potential targets of the unfolded protein response zzso
