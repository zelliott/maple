zzso is a zzso hormone whose zzso and zzso activity has been implicated in the development and progression of several zzso including brain zzso In human brain cancer, especially in zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso are zzso relative to normal zzso Until present, the potential of zzso zzso to exert zzso effects on zzso cells has not been zzso Using in zzso models, we investigated if zzso can express zzso if zzso can affect zzso and zzso potential of zzso cells, and if its action can be inhibited with specific zzso zzso zzso effects were compared with that induced by the zzso zzso regulator, zzso 

We found that zzso cell lines zzso and zzso express zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso amounts of zzso zzso Both lines also expressed and zzso zzso The zzso medium zzso of zzso and zzso 229 cultures as well as 200 zzso pure zzso or 50 zzso pure zzso zzso proliferation of human zzso vein zzso cells zzso at 24 h of zzso zzso effects of CM were zzso greater than that of pure growth zzso Furthermore, CM treatment of zzso for 24 h increased tube formation by zzso while zzso increased tube formation by zzso zzso and zzso by zzso at 8 zzso The zzso and zzso effects of both CM were blocked by zzso 1, a zzso zzso zzso and by zzso which zzso the zzso zzso The best zzso and zzso effects of zzso were obtained with 10 zzso and 25 zzso respectively, while for zzso the best growth and zzso zzso was observed at 5 zzso The combination of 5 zzso zzso and zzso at 25 zzso zzso zzso or at 10 zzso zzso of tube zzso produced superior effects compared with single agent zzso 

Our data provide the first evidence that zzso and zzso 229 human zzso cells express zzso zzso and might produce biologically active zzso which can stimulate tube formation and enhance proliferation of zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and growth effects of zzso on zzso cells, and that the pharmacological potential of this compound might be combined with drugs targeting the zzso zzso
