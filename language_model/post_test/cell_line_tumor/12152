In a screen for gene zzso changes in mouse zzso tumors, we identified a tumor with a small zzso zzso from a region that is zzso to a much larger locus amplified in human zzso at zzso zzso The mouse zzso contains only one known zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso a downstream zzso of the zzso signaling zzso recently identified in flies as a critical regulator of cellular proliferation and zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso of human zzso zzso zzso transition, suppression of zzso growth zzso zzso and zzso growth in soft zzso Together, these observations point to a potential zzso role for zzso in zzso human zzso and they suggest that this highly zzso signaling zzso identified in zzso regulates both cellular proliferation and zzso in zzso zzso zzso
