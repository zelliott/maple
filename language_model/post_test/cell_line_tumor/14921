The zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is known to have major roles in a wide range of cellular activities, including those involved in zzso zzso and zzso Here we identify an indispensable function of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso approach, we characterize zzso a zzso component of the zzso zzso class III zzso complex that zzso zzso as an interacting partner of zzso Upon zzso zzso activated zzso promotes zzso by binding and zzso zzso at zzso This results in the specific zzso of the zzso complex without affecting the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity increases zzso association, thus reducing nutritional zzso zzso zzso knockout of zzso function in mice also leads to impaired zzso as evidenced by reduced zzso zzso These results show that zzso acts as a prominent upstream regulator of zzso zzso and maintains a zzso balance between zzso and zzso
