zzso binding protein 1 zzso is a zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso using human breast cancer tissue zzso revealed that zzso of invasive zzso breast cancer cases have zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso in normal breast zzso To explore the functional impact of zzso in breast cancer, we examined zzso zzso regulation of known tumor zzso breast cancer zzso gene 1 zzso and zzso We found zzso was recruited to the promoter regions of zzso and zzso genes in breast cancer zzso zzso zzso loss was detected in 57% and zzso loss was detected in zzso of human invasive zzso breast zzso and correlated with zzso nuclear zzso in these zzso zzso zzso knock down of zzso restored zzso and zzso expression in breast cancer cell lines, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes in human breast zzso This study provides evidence that although genetic loss of zzso and zzso are zzso in breast cancer, they are zzso at the zzso level by zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso could be a potential zzso for breast cancer zzso
