zzso progression occurs through three major zzso zzso growth phase zzso confined to the zzso vertical growth phase zzso when the tumor has invaded into the zzso and zzso In this work, we used suppression zzso zzso zzso to investigate the molecular signature of melanoma zzso by comparing a group of zzso cell lines with an zzso cell line showing characteristics of early zzso zzso including expression of the zzso zzso zzso lack of zzso and low levels of zzso 

Two zzso zzso collections were zzso one zzso zzso by zzso the zzso cell line zzso zzso from a zzso pool from four zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the other zzso zzso by the reverse zzso zzso were zzso and zzso and expression validation was done by Northern zzso and zzso Gene zzso zzso and searches in large-scale melanoma expression studies were done for the genes zzso 

We identified zzso clones from the zzso library and zzso from the Met library, of which zzso and zzso respectively, match human zzso zzso representing 288 and 217 zzso zzso We confirmed the differential expression of all genes selected for zzso In the Met library, we found an enrichment of genes in the growth zzso zzso and zzso categories whereas in the zzso library, enriched categories were zzso zzso DNA zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of the genes from the zzso library map to zzso 1 against zzso of the ones from Met zzso 

This study identifies two populations of genes zzso expressed between melanoma cell lines from two tumor stages and suggests that these sets of genes represent profiles of less aggressive versus zzso zzso A search for expression profiles of melanoma in available expression study databases allowed us to point to a great potential of involvement in tumor progression for several of the genes identified zzso A few sequences obtained here may also contribute to extend zzso zzso or to the identification of novel zzso
