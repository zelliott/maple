The identification of tumor zzso remains a major objective in tumor zzso especially in pediatric zzso where solid tumors often do not express a single dominant zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Libraries zzso have been used in the discovery of zzso proteins by virtue of their ability to induce an zzso zzso To focus and accelerate this approach, we first identified candidate zzso by gene expression profiling data from clinical zzso specimens and then used an animal model to generate an zzso response to an engineered zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso were expressed as zzso proteins in a zzso system and screened for zzso recognition using serum from mice vaccinated with a zzso zzso vaccine engineered to express zzso and zzso with or without zzso zzso Through this zzso the never in zzso A zzso zzso zzso was identified as a zzso zzso zzso testing of serum from patients newly diagnosed with zzso showed specific zzso responses in two of 20 zzso Although zzso was not universally zzso it may serve as a tumor zzso for some zzso
