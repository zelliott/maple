In the past years we developed high-resolution screening platforms involving separation of zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso for a wide variety of biological targets with parallel mass zzso detection and zzso In the current research, we make a major step forward in the development of zzso zzso by zzso of zzso zzso binding and functional cellular zzso to evaluate zzso and zzso We demonstrate a new platform for high-resolution zzso profiling of lead compounds for functional activity and selectivity toward the human zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the large family of zzso G zzso zzso In this platform zzso chemistry, cell biology and pharmacology are zzso The methodology is based on zzso separation of zzso zzso by zzso coupled to high-resolution zzso onto zzso zzso well plates for complementary zzso The methodology was used for efficient and rapid zzso profiling of the drug zzso and three selective zzso lead zzso With this new platform zzso with zzso zzso in target selectivity profiles can be readily zzso Moreover, the parallel identification of zzso structures, with zzso zzso and zzso allowed identification of liable zzso zzso for further lead zzso and plays a central role in the zzso and in this zzso The methodology can be easily adapted for use with other zzso screening zzso The efficient combination of pharmacological zzso with zzso techniques by leveraging high-resolution zzso zzso as a linking technology will allow zzso of comprehensive zzso profiling in an early phase of the drug discovery zzso
