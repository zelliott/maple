zzso zzso is zzso in up to zzso of human breast zzso zzso and clinical studies suggest zzso between some zzso agents and the humanized zzso zzso zzso zzso This study investigated the effects of zzso and zzso on the repair of DNA damage in breast cancer cell zzso We examined the potential significance of zzso nuclear expression in DNA zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were treated with zzso and zzso zzso of DNA zzso zzso zzso and strand breaks, following incubation with zzso and zzso respectively, were zzso by the zzso gel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso were assessed by zzso The effects of zzso were measured in combination with these zzso Similar experiments were done using zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso and a construct lacking the nuclear zzso zzso zzso of breast cancer cell lines with zzso delayed the repair of zzso produced by zzso There were no effects on the repair of zzso zzso produced by zzso or repair of DNA strand breaks following zzso zzso zzso of zzso into zzso cells inhibited the repair of zzso zzso whereas zzso of a zzso construct lacking the nuclear zzso sequence did not affect DNA zzso These results indicate that zzso expression zzso the repair of specific DNA zzso produced by zzso The effect on zzso repair requires nuclear expression of zzso zzso the mechanisms of interaction between zzso agents and zzso zzso will inform the design of clinical trials and zzso the therapeutic effects of these zzso
