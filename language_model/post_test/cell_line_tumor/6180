Breast zzso cells have a specific pattern of expression for zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso has previously been characterized as a signature zzso for invasive breast zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is silenced in breast zzso cells and its zzso leads to decreased zzso of zzso zzso Such differences in zzso of native and zzso expressing zzso cells relate to an altered profile of zzso zzso Comparative zzso of total zzso to slides containing all known zzso by using locked zzso acid zzso zzso platform yielded a significantly altered profile of zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso After applying a threshold of change and a zzso of zzso the list of significantly altered zzso included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso changes were validated by real-time zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Except zzso and zzso the remaining six zzso have been observed in a variety of zzso The biological relevance of target zzso was predicted by using a zzso selection approach that allowed the identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as important targets of a subset of significantly altered zzso zzso zzso revealed that the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso transcripts were significantly decreased in zzso cells zzso with zzso These observations confirm targeting of specific zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso and suggest that the zzso zzso zzso is capable of initiating signal zzso from the cell surface to the nucleus resulting in the altered expression of a variety of genes involved in zzso and zzso The zzso in zzso and their target zzso also suggest indirect involvement of zzso in zzso zzso
