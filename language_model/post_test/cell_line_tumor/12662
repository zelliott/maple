In zzso cell zzso zzso the presence of higher zzso zzso with systematic zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified previously as one of the major zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed on natural killer zzso cells as an zzso zzso has a striking preference for internally zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso To clarify the functional role of zzso in zzso zzso we have investigated whether zzso expressed on zzso cells can zzso zzso cell zzso in a zzso zzso The binding activity of zzso cells to zzso fusion protein was specifically inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso for zzso zzso of zzso These observations showed that zzso fusion protein specifically bound to zzso expressed on zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso site of zzso on zzso cells was masked by zzso interactions with zzso zzso at the cell surface, but it could be unmasked by zzso treatment of the zzso zzso Following zzso treatment of zzso cells, zzso cell zzso against zzso cells with high zzso expression was significantly decreased relative to cells with low zzso zzso These findings indicate that such zzso cell zzso against zzso cells could be inhibited by the interaction between zzso on zzso cells and zzso on target zzso The results of the present study suggest that zzso expressed on zzso cells can zzso zzso cell zzso in a zzso manner and that zzso cells with zzso create favorable circumstance for their own survival and zzso
