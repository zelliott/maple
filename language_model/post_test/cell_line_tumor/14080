The zzso zzso zzso zzso is receiving increasing attention as a potential zzso agent in the treatment of zzso Previous studies have shown that this zzso zzso can arrest a number of different types of transformed cells in zzso and zzso the zzso zzso and zzso while zzso multiple zzso and zzso To more closely examine the responses of some of these cell cycle regulatory molecules to zzso we used zzso methods to zzso zzso D1 and zzso II behavior in zzso breast cancer zzso 

zzso zzso zzso effectively zzso zzso proliferation after a single application of zzso This growth zzso is accompanied by a striking zzso of zzso D1 and zzso II from the nucleus to the zzso and this effect persists for at least three days after drug zzso DNA synthesis is zzso inhibited by zzso but cells recover their ability to zzso DNA within 24 zzso Taking advantage of the zzso characteristics of zzso to follow its zzso and distribution suggests that these effects arise from a window of activity of a few hours immediately after drug addition, when zzso is concentrated in the zzso These effects occur in zzso zzso cells, and thus do not simply represent part of an zzso zzso 

It appears that zzso zzso of zzso can suppress breast cancer cell proliferation for extended lengths of time, and that this effect results from a relatively brief period of activity when the drug is concentrated in the zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso but a novel mechanism of action appears to involve zzso the trafficking of a number of molecules involved in cell cycle regulation and zzso The ability of zzso zzso of zzso to inhibit cell growth may be a useful feature for potential zzso zzso however, a narrow effective range for these effects may zzso
