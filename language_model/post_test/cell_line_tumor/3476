The complex of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that plays an important role in various zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso activity was found to associate with a number of neurodegenerative zzso To search for regulatory factors of zzso in the brain, we developed zzso affinity isolation using a zzso protein zzso the zzso 149 zzso acids of zzso The zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso (formerly known as zzso zzso 2) was identified by mass zzso from the zzso The association of zzso with zzso and zzso was demonstrated, and the zzso sites were delineated in zzso Furthermore, zzso displayed strong zzso toward the zzso zzso by zzso The zzso zzso is zzso from the zzso function of zzso because the zzso zzso of zzso displayed the similar zzso zzso activity as the zzso zzso Further characterization showed that zzso blocks the complex formation of zzso and zzso Together, these findings suggest that zzso acts as an inhibitor of zzso in the zzso
