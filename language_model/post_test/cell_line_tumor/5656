zzso protein 3 zzso promotes zzso by both zzso and zzso zzso We have previously reported that zzso of zzso zzso by zzso protein zzso enhances its nuclear zzso and is essential for its ability to interact with zzso X zzso and induce zzso in cultured prostate cancer zzso Using specific chemical zzso and small interfering zzso we demonstrate that preventing zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso enhanced the zzso potential of zzso We mapped potential zzso zzso sites in zzso to zzso and zzso and identified that zzso zzso and zzso zzso to a comparable zzso In contrast, zzso was far more zzso zzso inducing due to inability to undergo zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso small interfering zzso also limits the ability of high doses of zzso inhibitor to induce zzso These effects can be reversed by the addition of zzso zzso zzso suggesting zzso regulation of cell survival and zzso by zzso and zzso These studies reveal zzso zzso of zzso that both positively and zzso regulate its zzso zzso zzso such intrinsic regulation of zzso action may enhance the development of potential cancer zzso
