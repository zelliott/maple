zzso is a humanized zzso zzso zzso targeted against the pan B cell marker zzso It is frequently used to treat a variety of B cell zzso and zzso associated zzso such as zzso zzso disorder zzso The response rate of zzso treatment is zzso but the exact in zzso mechanism of action is not yet fully zzso although zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and direct induction of zzso have been suggested as zzso zzso zzso may affect different types of zzso through different zzso As zzso cell lines zzso are well-established in zzso models of zzso we investigated the effect of zzso on these cells using a custom built automated laser zzso fluorescent zzso We found that zzso alone was not effective at inducing cell death of zzso B zzso The zzso was effective in the zzso zzso zzso could induce zzso zzso zzso but it was more effective in the presence of zzso fresh human plasma compared to zzso human zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso zzso is required for effective zzso zzso killing of zzso B zzso zzso and monitoring of serum complement levels and in zzso killing efficacy of zzso cells of zzso patients might help to predict resistant cases to zzso zzso On the other hand our results suggest a possibility that zzso should be combined only with zzso drugs that spare zzso function when treating zzso zzso
