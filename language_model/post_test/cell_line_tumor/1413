A series of zzso derivatives based on a previously published lead zzso zzso 1 and bearing various zzso and zzso zzso on the zzso ring were prepared as novel zzso zzso zzso zzso The compounds were evaluated for their abilities to inhibit nuclear zzso their in zzso zzso activities, and in zzso zzso zzso Based on these activities, zzso and zzso zzso were selected for further zzso In zzso zzso zzso studies showed that both compounds exhibit an overall lower clearance rate, an increased zzso and higher zzso after intravenous and oral administration than zzso 1 under the conditions zzso The improved zzso behavior of these two compounds also correlated with superior in zzso zzso activity in an zzso zzso zzso
