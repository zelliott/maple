zzso is biologically relevant for its zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso which derive from the parental colon zzso zzso cell line, are accordingly very zzso They have been reported to be specifically different only in zzso membrane zzso which is associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso characterized by zzso studies and zzso zzso combined with robust zzso and zzso zzso With the latter we address the potential of overall characterization for zzso zzso discrimination and gain molecular insights into zzso differential zzso Due to their strong zzso zzso and zzso show similar mean zzso zzso which look zzso at zzso Interestingly, their rather zzso zzso zzso zzso besides changes in protein and zzso zzso very specific changes in zzso zzso involving zzso ring zzso zzso zzso zzso discriminating zzso from zzso is ultimately achieved based on principal component zzso Because zzso zzso are associated with the same zzso marker, changes in proteins support zzso interactions with regulatory zzso More importantly, changes observed in zzso which are indicative of zzso binding zzso suggest zzso zzso as participating precursor zzso of different transport mechanisms that lead to zzso differential expression and associated zzso zzso Besides zzso we have used zzso zzso combined with zzso analysis within an zzso tumor system for zzso zzso zzso discrimination, and zzso to our knowledge, the first overall zzso monitoring with insights into zzso differential zzso This might well prove to be useful for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
