zzso of zzso 17 is the most prevalent genetic zzso identified in zzso zzso and zzso zzso gain has zzso significance in zzso In this report, we have combined zzso comparative zzso zzso zzso and gene expression analysis to investigate gene copy number changes and its impact on the gene expression level as well as their association with prognosis genes located on zzso 17 in zzso zzso We observed differential gains of zzso 17 between zzso zzso and zzso zzso We found that zzso mapping to zzso which was frequently gained in zzso tumors and not changed in zzso tumors, showed strong correlations between expression level and copy zzso Furthermore, the increase of zzso gene expression is associated with good outcome in patients with zzso of all zzso zzso also enhances the zzso prediction when combined with other current zzso factors in zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso copy number zzso with its expression level and that its high expression associates with good prognosis suggesting a possible role of this gene in the biology of favorable outcome zzso This article contains zzso zzso available at zzso
