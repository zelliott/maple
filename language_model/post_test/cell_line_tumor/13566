zzso DNA zzso has been implicated in the development of zzso zzso zzso Our aim was to clarify its molecular mechanism and to identify useful zzso by screening for DNA zzso in zzso zzso zzso island amplification coupled with zzso island zzso zzso analysis was carried out to screen for zzso genes in primary zzso specimens zzso B virus zzso zzso zzso 4; zzso C virus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to analyze the zzso of selected genes and long zzso nuclear element zzso in zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso and zzso liver tissue zzso zzso 50) from zzso patients and in zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis identified zzso zzso and 259 genes that were zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Among these zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was significantly higher in zzso tissue than in zzso liver zzso irrespective of the zzso virus zzso zzso zzso was also prevalent in zzso and correlated positively with zzso and zzso zzso zzso operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that zzso of the four genes and zzso strongly zzso between zzso tissue and zzso liver zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso and zzso may contribute to a common zzso mechanism in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso could be useful zzso for the detection of zzso
