zzso zzso are a new class of small zzso zzso that zzso regulate the expression of target zzso zzso Many of these target zzso transcripts are involved in zzso differentiation and zzso processes commonly altered during zzso Recent work has shown a global decrease of mature zzso expression in human zzso However, it is unclear whether this global repression of zzso reflects the zzso state of tumors or zzso contributes to the transformed zzso Here we show that global repression of zzso maturation promotes cellular transformation and zzso Cancer cells expressing short hairpin zzso zzso targeting three different components of the zzso processing machinery showed a substantial decrease in zzso zzso levels and a more pronounced transformed zzso In animals, zzso zzso cells formed tumors with accelerated zzso These tumors were more invasive than control tumors, suggesting that global zzso loss enhances zzso Furthermore, conditional deletion of zzso enhanced tumor development in a zzso mouse model of lung zzso Overall, these studies indicate that zzso of global zzso processing promotes zzso
