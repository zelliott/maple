zzso in zzso metabolism and in the zzso composition of cellular zzso are linked to the pathology of numerous diseases including zzso However, the influence of zzso expression on cellular zzso profile is currently zzso In this work we analyzed changes in zzso profiles that are induced in the course of zzso zzso premature zzso As a model system we used zzso breast cancer cells with zzso expression of zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso gene array data showed zzso zzso in the zzso of many zzso involved in zzso zzso several of which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso LDL and zzso could be confirmed by quantitative zzso zzso A study of the zzso and zzso profiles, obtained by high performance liquid zzso coupled to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso changes in numerous zzso species, including zzso zzso The most prominent changes were found in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a general trend towards shortened zzso zzso chains in zzso and a significant trend to more saturated zzso chains in the class of zzso Additionally, the cellular cholesterol content was elevated and accumulated in zzso in zzso zzso These changes were accompanied by increased membrane zzso In zzso loss of membrane potential along with altered zzso distribution was zzso In conclusion, we present a comprehensive overview of altered cholesterol and zzso patterns in zzso showing that predominantly zzso lipids are affected and zzso species less susceptible to zzso are zzso
