Down syndrome is the most common genetic disorder and is characterized by three copies of zzso zzso zzso of zzso 1 zzso is located close to the Down syndrome critical region zzso part of zzso zzso and its product functions as an zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso protein stability is regulated by several inflammatory signaling factors, though the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely zzso Here, we report that zzso interacts with the zzso zzso factor, signal zzso and zzso of zzso 2 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased levels of zzso zzso zzso in zzso were blocked by a zzso zzso indicating that zzso regulates zzso degradation via the zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso enhanced zzso zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso appeared to be zzso relevant, as treatment of cells with zzso reduced zzso levels through the zzso of zzso and zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso influences diverse cellular processes linked to zzso by zzso affecting zzso protein zzso
