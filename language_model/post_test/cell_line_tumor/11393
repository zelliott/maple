zzso cancer cells zzso a variety of zzso zzso including zzso and zzso However, factors regulating the expression of zzso genes for gastric cancer remain largely zzso We investigated the role of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso factor in expression of the zzso factor zzso The genes associated with zzso induced by zzso were screened using zzso zzso technology in two gastric cancer cell lines zzso and zzso First, zzso zzso and protein were confirmed to be zzso Then, expression of zzso zzso and zzso were further estimated by Western zzso zzso A role for zzso in zzso zzso of zzso was determined by zzso of zzso with zzso zzso and a zzso immune zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in cells treated with zzso in a zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso was increased more by zzso treatment and inhibited by zzso with an zzso 1/2 inhibitor zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso enhanced the binding activity of zzso to the zzso promoter in control cells, but not in the zzso zzso zzso We confirmed the functional role of zzso zzso in zzso of the zzso promoter by the reporter gene zzso zzso of zzso also decreased in zzso cell zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso the zzso induction of zzso expression through zzso which thus might serve as a promising target for gastric cancer zzso
