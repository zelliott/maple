We have established human zzso zzso acute zzso leukemia cell lines that retain a dependency on zzso zzso for survival and zzso Eight hours following removal from adherent cell contact zzso cells undergo a decrease in zzso zzso potential and an increase in zzso V zzso zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso enhanced the appearance of zzso cells within 8 hours following removal of zzso cells from zzso zzso zzso enhancement of zzso was dose dependent and did not occur with irreversible zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also enhanced zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells (but not zzso zzso removed from zzso zzso zzso zzso exposure zzso 18 zzso to zzso culminated in zzso in a panel of zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso cell lines in the presence or absence of zzso zzso as well as in 2 zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso zzso cells made deficient in zzso by zzso interference exhibited no resistance to zzso signals and actually showed increased zzso sensitivity to zzso These collective results suggest that a zzso acid zzso inhibitor of zzso can promote zzso and that at least some types of zzso pathways in zzso ALL do not require zzso
