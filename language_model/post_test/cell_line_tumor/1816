zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified as a zzso zzso for a variety of human zzso We investigated the clinical significance of zzso expression and its functional role in zzso zzso cancer zzso 

zzso expression was evaluated by zzso in 62 patients with zzso We assessed the correlation of zzso expression with clinical zzso In zzso experiment was performed for zzso with zzso using zzso to evaluate its role in cell survival, zzso and invasion in zzso zzso 

zzso was predominantly expressed on the cell membrane in the majority of zzso samples zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly correlated with advanced stage zzso Patients with zzso expression had shorter zzso survival among all the patients zzso and in particular among patients with advanced stages zzso When zzso expression was inhibited by zzso in zzso cells zzso and zzso there was a significant decrease of cell proliferation and invasion as well as increase of zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso expression may play an important role in tumor progression into advanced stage with poor prognosis in zzso and zzso of zzso on tumor cells may be a therapeutic target in those zzso
