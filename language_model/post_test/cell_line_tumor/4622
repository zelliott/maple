Previously, zzso cells have been reported to kill the opportunistic zzso pathogen zzso zzso through a zzso zzso however, the zzso and signaling involved are zzso In this report we sought to identify the signaling pathways activated and required for direct zzso killing of zzso In this study, using the zzso cell line zzso and primary peripheral blood zzso cells, it is demonstrated that zzso cells kill zzso zzso and that the killing is accompanied by the zzso of zzso We demonstrate that zzso of either the zzso zzso zzso a pharmacological zzso or the zzso zzso zzso small interfering zzso zzso of zzso significantly inhibited the killing of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was activated in a zzso fashion and was required for zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso release from zzso cells can be detected by 4 h after contact of the zzso cells with zzso zzso and that the release of zzso is blocked by pharmacological zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso zzso is rooted in the inability to zzso zzso zzso toward the zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso signaling is activated and required for the killing of zzso zzso by primary zzso zzso Taken together, these data identify a zzso zzso zzso that is used by zzso cells during the direct killing of zzso zzso and demonstrate that the zzso is essential in the formation and zzso of the zzso zzso
