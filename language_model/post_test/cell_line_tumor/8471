A series of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been prepared by the reaction of a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso with various zzso These compounds were characterized using standard zzso and zzso zzso The compounds were evaluated against the zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains of zzso zzso The zzso compounds show enhanced activity compared to the zzso compounds against this zzso zzso 5 displays the most promising activity against the zzso zzso zzso 5 and 6 are effective at zzso zzso formation perhaps due to an increased number of zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso compounds also inhibit zzso formation, albeit to a lesser degree compared to the zzso zzso The compounds were also screened against the zzso strain of zzso zzso and here the zzso compounds show a slightly higher zzso growth zzso compared to the zzso zzso The zzso compounds were also found to be more zzso compared to the zzso zzso zzso 6 displays good zzso against zzso zzso cancer zzso
