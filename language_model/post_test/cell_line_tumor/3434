zzso is an essential zzso acid in cancer cells and is required for the growth of many other cell zzso zzso activity is positively correlated with zzso in zzso and with growth rate in normal zzso In the present work, zzso zzso zzso cells, and their zzso zzso cells, expressing zzso zzso zzso were zzso for zzso induced by zzso and hydrogen zzso It is shown that zzso zzso zzso cells, expressing zzso zzso for zzso contain lower levels of zzso than normal zzso zzso In addition, zzso cells contain a higher number of zzso cells and are more sensitive to both zzso and hydrogen zzso toxicity than normal zzso Taken together, these results provide insights into the role of zzso in zzso by demonstrating that the expression of zzso zzso for zzso alters zzso and zzso zzso zzso
