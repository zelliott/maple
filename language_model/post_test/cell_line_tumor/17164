zzso zzso are known to have zzso properties of the skin and the zzso The proliferation of zzso zzso cells zzso is closely related to the progression of liver zzso in chronic liver zzso We investigated the zzso effect of zzso zzso the major potential zzso component of zzso zzso on the proliferation of zzso The aim of this study was to clarify the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

A cultured human zzso zzso cell line zzso was used for this zzso The cells were zzso by zzso growth factor zzso in the presence or absence of zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso The zzso expressions of collagen zzso and zzso were evaluated by a quantitative reverse zzso chain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso was performed by zzso 

zzso inhibited the zzso zzso and collagen zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso binding to its zzso in a zzso zzso 

zzso has an zzso effect on zzso proliferation of zzso and the blocking of zzso binding to its zzso may be the mechanism behind this zzso
