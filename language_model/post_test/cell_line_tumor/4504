zzso is expressed at high levels in zzso cells and in multiple invasive zzso Like its family member zzso zzso is thought to be zzso unfolded but does not readily form zzso The function of zzso is unknown, but we have found that it interacts strongly with the zzso zzso zzso zzso altering its interaction with G zzso As a first step in determining its role, we have characterized its zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis, and native gel zzso We found that when its expressed in zzso coli and zzso zzso appears zzso on zzso under zzso conditions, but under native conditions, it appears as zzso of varying zzso We followed the zzso association by labeling the protein with zzso and following the zzso loss in zzso zzso resulting from zzso zzso We also performed zzso zzso analysis at increasing zzso of zzso zzso and found zzso zzso zzso of zzso a strong zzso binding partner whose cellular expression is correlated with zzso results in disruption of zzso zzso Similarly, its binding to zzso zzso promotes the zzso zzso When we zzso express zzso or zzso zzso protein into cells, the protein appears zzso Our studies show that even though zzso zzso form zzso when binding partners are present, as in cells, it zzso to a zzso to bind these partners, which in turn may modify protein function and zzso
