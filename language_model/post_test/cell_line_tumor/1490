In this study, zzso generation 5 zzso zzso were used as templates or zzso to zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with different gold zzso zzso zzso ratios with the assistance of sodium zzso reduction zzso Following a zzso zzso reaction to transform the zzso terminal zzso to zzso groups, a series of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso with terminal zzso groups were zzso The formed zzso zzso zzso before and after zzso reaction were characterized using different zzso We showed that the optical property and the size of the zzso zzso were greatly affected by the metal zzso At the constant total metal zzso zzso ratio, the size of the zzso zzso decreased with the gold zzso The formed zzso zzso zzso were stable at different pH zzso zzso and temperature zzso zzso X-ray zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso of the zzso zzso was dependent on both the gold content and the surface zzso With the increase of gold content in the zzso zzso their X-ray zzso intensity was significantly zzso At a given metal zzso the X-ray zzso intensity of the zzso zzso was enhanced after zzso zzso zzso showed that after zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso was significantly zzso With the zzso particle size and optical property, metal zzso X-ray zzso zzso and improved zzso after zzso these zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso should have a promising potential for CT imaging and other biomedical zzso
