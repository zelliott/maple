zzso zzso a major component of green tea zzso zzso has been reported to zzso zzso activity in breast cancer cells thereby increasing cellular zzso and zzso cellular zzso However, the major concerns with zzso are their zzso and stability under zzso zzso In the present study, we show that treatments with zzso and a novel zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the proliferation of human breast cancer zzso and zzso cells but not normal control zzso zzso Furthermore, both zzso and zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso the zzso zzso of zzso through zzso mechanisms in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso expression was found to be because of zzso promoter zzso and zzso zzso zzso at least partially through zzso of DNA zzso and zzso zzso activities, zzso In addition, we also observed that zzso and zzso can zzso zzso structures of the zzso promoter by decreasing the level of zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso zzso that facilitated the binding of many zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso to the zzso regulatory zzso zzso of zzso and zzso by using zzso reversed the zzso zzso zzso expression and associated cellular zzso differently in zzso and zzso breast cancer zzso zzso our data provide new insights into breast cancer prevention through zzso zzso of zzso by using zzso a more stable form of zzso as a novel zzso zzso
