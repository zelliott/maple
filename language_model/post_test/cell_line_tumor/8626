The use of the type 2 diabetics drug zzso has been correlated with enhanced zzso survival in zzso zzso The literature has speculated that this enhancement is due to the high concentration of zzso directly causing cancer cell zzso However, this explanation does not fit with clinical data reporting that the women exposed to constant zzso zzso of zzso as present in the treatment of diabetes, respond better to zzso zzso our aim was to examine whether zzso zzso of zzso alone could bring about cancer cell death and whether zzso zzso could increase the zzso effect of commonly used zzso in zzso and zzso cell lines and primary cultured cancer cells isolated from the zzso fluid of patients with advanced zzso zzso Our results in cell lines demonstrate that no significant loss of viability or change in cell cycle was observed with zzso zzso alone; however, we observed zzso with zzso zzso in combination with chemotherapy at zzso where the chemotherapy alone produced no loss in zzso We demonstrate that previous exposure and maintenance of zzso in conjunction with zzso produces a synergistic enhancement in zzso of zzso and zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, in 5 zzso of the 11 zzso cancer primary cultures, zzso zzso improved the zzso response to zzso but not zzso or zzso In conclusion, we present data that support the need for a clinical study to evaluate the zzso maintenance or prescription of currently approved doses of zzso during the zzso treatment of zzso zzso
