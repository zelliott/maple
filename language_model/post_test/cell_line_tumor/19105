zzso zzso zzso gene 1) has been previously found to be zzso in human esophagus zzso zzso expression of green fluorescent protein zzso zzso showed plasma membrane zzso Treatment of esophagus cancer cell line zzso with zzso fusion protein and zzso of zzso in NEC cells can significantly reduce the in zzso proliferation rate of NEC zzso Treatment of established NEC tumors in the nude mice with zzso fusion protein leads to decreased tumor weight and zzso zzso of zzso in NEC cells can also inhibit tumor formation in nude zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso of zzso in NEC cells results in zzso phase zzso Our findings indicate that zzso may be a candidate tumor zzso gene for zzso cancer zzso involved in zzso zzso Since zzso gene significantly suppresses the growth of NEC cells both in zzso and in zzso its loss may contribute to the causation and progression of the zzso in zzso county, which is a high zzso area of zzso in zzso
