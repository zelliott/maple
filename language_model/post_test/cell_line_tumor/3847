Long Interspersed zzso zzso zzso are biologically active zzso that are capable of autonomous replication using their own reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso of the normally zzso zzso has been implicated in cancer cell zzso However, at present, little is known about the expression of zzso zzso activity or the molecular changes that are associated with zzso activity in the development of breast zzso Here, we report that zzso activity is widespread in breast cancer zzso The expression of zzso protein decreased markedly in breast cancer cells after treatment with the zzso drug, zzso While the majority of cells showed a significant reduction in zzso zzso of zzso was also accompanied by zzso differences in zzso zzso cells displayed zzso zzso extensions that zzso tightly to their zzso while a large fraction of the zzso cells that we studied formed long zzso zzso These zzso changes were zzso upon zzso of zzso zzso confirming their dependence on zzso zzso We also carried out gene expression profiling with zzso and determined the genes that were zzso expressed during the process of cellular zzso Genes involved in zzso cell migration, and invasive activity were zzso in zzso zzso zzso genes involved in cell projection, formation of zzso zzso and zzso junctions were significantly zzso in zzso zzso zzso examination of the zzso expression of these genes in additional cell lines yielded close correlation between their differential expression and the degree of cellular zzso Our study demonstrates that the zzso of zzso zzso can reduce the rate of proliferation and promote differentiation of breast cancer zzso Together, these results provide a direct functional link between the expression of zzso zzso and the development of breast zzso
