Human zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that can be expressed either as membrane bound zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso expression by tumor cells constitutes an efficient way to escape from zzso immune zzso The zzso role of zzso on zzso cell zzso is well zzso however, that of the zzso zzso zzso by tumor is poorly zzso Our results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso by zzso melanoma cells is able to protect them from natural killer leukemia cell line zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso by zzso zzso demonstrates that the zzso of zzso zzso activity resulted from an impairment of zzso zzso reorganization and zzso zzso polarization toward zzso target zzso This study also indicates that zzso soluble zzso remains evenly distributed in the zzso of zzso zzso to zzso cells, suggesting that zzso does not require to zzso toward zzso cell to induce efficient zzso These results highlight the zzso mechanisms zzso through zzso leading to tumor escape from zzso cell zzso
