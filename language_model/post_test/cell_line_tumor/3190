The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of zzso zzso a novel zzso compared with other zzso agents in zzso models of human primary and secondary brain zzso zzso and zzso analyses were performed on rats and mice to determine passage across the zzso barrier and organ distribution of zzso Mice bearing zzso human tumors zzso or zzso glioblastoma, zzso melanoma, or zzso zzso lung cancer zzso were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (or zzso 100 zzso or control zzso zzso zzso volume was measured to assess zzso zzso zzso crossed the zzso barrier in both rat and mouse models, leading to zzso relevant zzso in the brain with a long zzso zzso exhibited significant zzso activity in both the zzso and zzso models of human glioblastoma, while zzso showed a limited effect in the zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited the growth of tumors from zzso zzso models zzso melanoma and zzso zzso and zzso zzso implanted in the brains of nude mice, in contrast to zzso or zzso zzso has free access to the zzso zzso demonstrated significant zzso activity in zzso models of both zzso and zzso zzso compared with zzso or zzso underlining the value of further research evaluating zzso in the treatment of brain zzso zzso is currently being investigated in a broad phase II clinical trial program, including patients with glioblastoma, zzso breast cancer, and zzso
