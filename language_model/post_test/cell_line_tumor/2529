Nuclear zzso zzso has been implicated in tumor cell proliferation and survival and in tumor zzso We sought to evaluate the effects of zzso an inhibitor of zzso on a zzso model of zzso zzso 

For zzso studies, zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso were treated with various doses of zzso zzso zzso zzso was established zzso by tail vein injection of zzso cells into zzso mice, which were then treated with 50 zzso of zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso 

zzso suppressed zzso zzso and proliferation of all zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso treatment resulted in a significant decrease in zzso tumor zzso zzso tumors had decreased zzso activity and an associated significant decrease in tumor cell proliferation and an increase in tumor cell zzso as well as a decrease in tumor vascular zzso growth factor levels and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso suppressed zzso growth, with treated tumors showing a decrease in zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso may be a viable option for the treatment of zzso that works via zzso the zzso zzso
