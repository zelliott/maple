zzso plays an important role in zzso and zzso by controlling either zzso cell zzso or zzso zzso of target gene zzso In many types of zzso nuclear zzso of zzso has been zzso Our data indicate that during melanoma progression an increased dependency on the zzso function of zzso takes zzso zzso of zzso in zzso melanoma cell lines efficiently zzso zzso zzso zzso migration and invasion in zzso and zzso skin reconstructs and decreases zzso In addition, subcutaneous melanoma growth in zzso mice was almost completely inhibited by an zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the survival of benign zzso and primary melanoma cell lines was less affected by zzso zzso However, enhanced expression of zzso in primary melanoma cell lines increased invasive capacity in zzso and tumor growth in the zzso mouse zzso These data suggest that zzso is an essential survival factor for zzso melanoma cells, whereas it is zzso for the survival of benign zzso and primary, zzso melanoma zzso Furthermore, zzso increases zzso of primary melanoma cell zzso The differential requirements for zzso signaling in aggressive melanoma versus benign zzso cells make zzso a possible new target in melanoma zzso
