zzso and its zzso are zzso zzso that selectively bind to a variety of zzso zzso Although these compounds are widely used as pharmacological tools for zzso zzso the zzso properties of these zzso structures are largely zzso We have evaluated the zzso effects of zzso and related symmetrical zzso differing in zzso chain length between the inner zzso against a panel of cell zzso zzso caused cell death only at high zzso zzso whereas its pharmacological action is exerted at zzso zzso zzso the spacing between the inner nitrogen atoms resulted in a zzso increase in zzso In particular, an elevated zzso is associated to a zzso chain length of 12 units dividing the inner zzso functions zzso zzso zzso zzso were the most sensitive cells, followed by zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso cells were much more zzso zzso and related compounds zzso zzso zzso the first zzso of zzso zzso even at zzso zzso Further, zzso and compound 5 caused a limited zzso of zzso zzso suggesting that interference in zzso metabolism is not a primary mechanism of zzso zzso and its zzso bound to DNA with a higher affinity than zzso but the correlation with their toxic effect was zzso The highly toxic compound 5 killed the cells in the absence of zzso zzso and caused an increase in zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso 5 was directly oxidized by cell zzso producing hydrogen zzso and its toxic effect was partially subdued by the zzso of its zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and by the zzso zzso suggesting that compound 5 can act at different cellular levels and lead to zzso zzso
