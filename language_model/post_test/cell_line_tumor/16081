In zzso cells, zzso active zzso genes are zzso in the early S phase, and the silent zzso genes in the late S phase, though mechanisms of this timing remain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a DNA binding protein and component of the pol I zzso machinery, is considered to be responsible for the loose zzso structure of the active zzso Here we question whether such structure alone can ensure early replication of zzso We investigate this problem on the model of zzso the tandem zzso of zzso DNA sequence with high affinity for zzso introduced into human zzso Such zzso are not zzso yet efficiently bind zzso and mimic the zzso structure of active zzso In our study, a human derived stable cell line containing one zzso on the zzso 10 was zzso zzso with zzso and zzso which allowed us to observe in zzso the growth of zzso resulted from their zzso We found that replication of zzso is not restricted to the early S phase, but continues in the late S phase at a significant zzso These results were confirmed in the experiments with incorporation of zzso analog zzso and zzso zzso zzso Similar results were obtained with another cell line containing zzso on the zzso zzso Our data indicate that the specific loose structure of zzso produced by the architect protein zzso is not sufficient for the early zzso
