Drugs containing an zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso constitute some of the most powerful zzso They suppress tumor growth mainly by zzso into DNA and zzso of zzso II, and are suspected to generate free zzso leading to DNA strand zzso We established a novel strategy for obtaining new highly zzso derivatives of zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and an appropriate zzso as starting materials, we obtained a wide range of zzso structures by zzso zzso Several of these derivatives showed stronger zzso and zzso activity than zzso In particular, compound 6 was highly effective on the zzso tumor cell line, but did not show any zzso on normal zzso In addition to this favorable feature, compound 6 revealed interesting binding properties to a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and reversed the zzso zzso of zzso cells, thus making this compound a promising potential zzso zzso
