The mechanisms underlying the zzso of the zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso large cell zzso are not completely zzso Here we show using an integrated zzso and zzso strategy that zzso zzso a zzso shift toward zzso zzso increased zzso production, and biomass zzso The zzso shift is zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso at zzso resulting in decreased zzso zzso Small zzso zzso of zzso or expression of zzso zzso zzso leads to reversal of the zzso switch with increased zzso zzso and reduced zzso production zzso with increased cell death, decreased colony formation, and reduced tumor growth in an in zzso zzso zzso This study provides comprehensive profiling of the zzso and zzso consequences of zzso expression and reveals a novel role of zzso in the regulation of multiple components of cellular zzso Our studies show that zzso is a novel zzso of zzso and plays a critical role in zzso the zzso shift toward biomass production and zzso
