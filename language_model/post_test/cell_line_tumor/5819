To detect zzso zzso content in serum from the patients with gastric zzso and cell culture medium of gastric zzso cell lines, and determine the effects of zzso zzso on proliferation of gastric zzso zzso 

zzso was employed to determine zzso content in serum and zzso and zzso to detect the proliferation of gastric zzso zzso 

The zzso level of zzso was obviously decreased in serum form gastric zzso compared with healthy individuals ( zzso and zzso correlated with the tumor size of gastric zzso ( zzso The zzso content was lower in zzso from gastric zzso cells than that in zzso cells ( zzso After the zzso of zzso zzso the concentration of zzso was increased in zzso from zzso ( zzso The proliferation of zzso and zzso could be inhibited by zzso zzso ( zzso 

zzso expression of zzso type decreased in gastric zzso cells, and inhibited the proliferation of gastric zzso zzso zzso protein might be employed as a good marker or target for the early diagnosis, biological and gene therapy of gastric zzso
