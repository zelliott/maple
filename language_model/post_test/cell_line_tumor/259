zzso fatty acids zzso are crucial for proper functioning of cell zzso particularly in zzso zzso important zzso include zzso acid zzso series) and zzso acid zzso series) which can be formed from their respective dietary essential zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso hormones are thought to zzso zzso synthesis in humans but whether they regulate zzso status in brain and/or in neural zzso is zzso In human zzso zzso cells, we compared the effect of zzso testosterone, and zzso on zzso zzso zzso were incubated with zzso and/or LA 7 zzso in combination with zzso testosterone, or zzso at 10 zzso without zzso The fatty acid composition was determined by gas zzso and the zzso expression of genes involved in zzso metabolism by real-time zzso zzso affected both the zzso and the zzso zzso conversion, the zzso zzso zzso being more sensitive to the zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso increased while testosterone decreased the zzso zzso zzso content zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso expression of the zzso zzso and zzso these two events being strongly zzso zzso did not affect the zzso zzso The positive effect of zzso was blocked by the zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that steroids have differential effects on zzso synthesis and that their mode of action could involve the zzso of the zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso These results help our understanding of the regulation of brain zzso metabolism by steroid zzso
