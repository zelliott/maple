A class of putative Ras zzso called Ras association domain family zzso represents zzso zzso that were shown to be important in zzso zzso zzso a member of this family, exists in two zzso zzso known as zzso and zzso Both of them are involved in distinct cellular pathways triggered by Ras and zzso zzso Here we describe the crystal structure of Ras in complex with the Ras binding domain zzso of zzso All Ras zzso share a common zzso in their zzso creating an interface with the switch I region of zzso whereas zzso zzso reveals additional structural elements forming a unique Ras switch II binding zzso zzso the contact area of zzso is extended as compared with other Ras zzso We demonstrate that the enlarged interface provides a rationale for an exceptionally long lifetime of the zzso This is a specific attribute characterizing the zzso function of zzso as zzso in contrast to classical zzso zzso such as zzso zzso or zzso which are known to form highly dynamic short-lived complexes with zzso
