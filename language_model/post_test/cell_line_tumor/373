zzso one of zzso zzso family members, is involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression and DNA damage zzso In this study, we found that zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso through physical interaction and zzso During zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso whereas its protein level was kept at zzso level, suggesting that zzso might rapidly degrade in response to zzso zzso and in zzso pull-down experiments demonstrated that zzso interacts with zzso zzso reporter zzso and zzso experiments revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with these results, zzso activity of zzso was blocked by zzso Additionally, zzso decreased the stability of zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to inhibit zzso function, indicating that zzso activity of zzso is required for zzso zzso of zzso Indeed, in zzso zzso reaction showed that zzso portion of zzso is zzso by zzso In accordance with these zzso knocking down of zzso increased the stability of zzso and promoted zzso zzso in association with zzso of zzso zzso our present findings suggest that zzso plays an important role in the regulation of cell fate determination in response to DNA damage through the zzso of zzso
