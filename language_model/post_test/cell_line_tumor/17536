zzso emphasis is being placed on combination chemotherapy of cancer using zzso agents and naturally occurring zzso agents, having different mechanisms of action with zzso zzso In this regard, here we assessed whether a cancer preventive agent zzso zzso the therapeutic potential of zzso zzso zzso or zzso the zzso drugs, in both zzso and zzso human breast zzso zzso and zzso cells, zzso When tested alone, each of the four agents showed growth zzso in both the cell lines in a zzso and a zzso zzso Based on their growth zzso effects, several combinations of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso were next assessed for their zzso additive and/or zzso efficacy towards cell growth zzso and zzso zzso The strongest synergistic effects for cell growth zzso zzso index zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso were evident at a zzso dose of 100 zzso plus 25 zzso zzso in both the cell zzso Most of the zzso for other combinations of these three drugs with zzso also suggested strong synergistic effects for cell growth zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso In quantitative zzso studies, combination of zzso with zzso resulted in much stronger zzso death compared to each agent alone in both cell zzso In case of zzso combination with zzso it showed no additional zzso effect in either cell zzso Similarly, zzso plus zzso combination showed stronger zzso effect only in zzso zzso Together, these results suggest a possible zzso between zzso and conventional zzso agents for breast cancer treatment, and warrant further in zzso studies in zzso breast cancer zzso
