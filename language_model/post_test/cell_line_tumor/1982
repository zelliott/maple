The zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso a zzso member of the basic zzso family of zzso factors, plays a significant role in zzso aromatic hydrocarbon zzso zzso In the upper zzso tract of humans, tobacco smoke, a source of zzso activates the zzso leading to increased expression of zzso and zzso which zzso proteins that convert zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cause a rapid decrease in levels of zzso an zzso client zzso and thereby block zzso induction of zzso and zzso The main objective of this study was to determine whether zzso a zzso preparation, suppressed zzso induction of zzso and zzso and inhibited DNA zzso formation and zzso We also investigated whether zzso one of multiple zzso antioxidants in zzso had similar zzso zzso Treatment of cell lines derived from oral zzso zzso and skin zzso with zzso zzso a zzso zzso induced zzso and zzso transcription, resulting in enhanced levels of message and zzso Both zzso and zzso suppressed these effects of zzso zzso both zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso activity and caused a rapid reduction in zzso zzso The formation of zzso DNA zzso and zzso was also inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso these results show that zzso and zzso inhibit zzso zzso leading to reduced levels of zzso suppression of zzso induction of zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity can help explain the zzso activity of herbs such as zzso which contain this zzso zzso
