zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso plays a major role in cancer zzso However, the underlying mechanism is still zzso We report here that zzso zzso zzso (also known as zzso or zzso a target of zzso protein zzso acts as a strong zzso of zzso by directly interacting with zzso for zzso of target zzso including those for zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor A zzso zzso D, zzso and zzso in zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso is recruited to the target gene promoters upon induction and mediates zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso marks at the promoter, which involves its zzso zzso Interestingly, we found that zzso is also critical for zzso recruitment of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in prostate cancer tumors, and its zzso zzso with zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso expression is strongly induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso and zzso via zzso and plays a crucial role in tumor zzso These results identify zzso to be a key zzso regulator of zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso loop for zzso zzso zzso and emphasize the important roles played by zzso in cancer cell proliferation and survival and tumor zzso
