zzso and adjacent zzso zzso pose significant challenges to the DNA replication zzso Little is known about how replication zzso through these regions in human zzso Using single zzso analysis of zzso DNA zzso we delineate the replication zzso origin distribution, termination site location, and fork rate and zzso specific zzso of individual human zzso in two embryonic stem zzso cell lines and two primary zzso cell zzso We observe that replication can initiate within human zzso repeats but was most frequently accomplished by zzso originating in the zzso No major delay or pausing in fork progression was detected that might lead to zzso zzso In addition, zzso from different zzso from the same cell type displayed zzso replication programs rather than a universal zzso zzso although there was some variation in the replication program of the same zzso in different cell types, the basic features of the program of a specific zzso end appear to be zzso
