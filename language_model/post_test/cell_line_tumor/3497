In this study we confirmed the ability of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to counteract or even suppress the zzso zzso growth of zzso prostate cancer cells zzso Since the cellular mechanisms zzso this effect are not well zzso we investigated the activity of zzso also in combination with zzso or with zzso zzso zzso on the expression of genes zzso zzso zzso which may contribute to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso In addition, experiments aimed to evaluate the action of the analogue on zzso were zzso 

Gene expression was evaluated by zzso and Western zzso on cells treated with LA zzso or zzso zzso alone or combined with zzso M zzso or zzso M zzso The occurrence of zzso following treatment with LA zzso zzso or zzso zzso alone or combined with zzso M zzso was assessed by DNA fragmentation zzso 

Both the zzso and protein of the zzso gene zzso were induced zzso by zzso after zzso zzso LA decreased zzso zzso zzso while it did not unequivocally affect protein zzso The analogue always reduced zzso both zzso and protein levels obtained under zzso zzso The zzso and protein of the zzso gene zzso were zzso by zzso zzso while LA generally induced zzso protein but not its zzso LA zzso zzso activity, even increasing zzso protein levels over the zzso zzso zzso and protein were enhanced by zzso zzso but zzso by LA zzso Once more, the zzso effect was antagonized by zzso sometimes reducing zzso content below the zzso CA produced the most similar effects to those triggered by zzso The hormonal treatment did not induce any DNA zzso 

In spite of gene zzso zzso was not observed under LA treatment, in agreement with the lack of a cell growth effect when the analogue was used zzso Nevertheless, the observed changes in gene expression may be directly or indirectly involved in the zzso effect of LA on zzso zzso
