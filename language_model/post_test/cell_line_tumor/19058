The zzso zzso virus zzso encodes two zzso of zzso membrane protein 2 zzso zzso and zzso which are expressed during zzso in B zzso The function of zzso is largely unknown, whereas zzso blocks zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso and induction of zzso zzso infection, thereby promoting zzso zzso zzso experiments on zzso in zzso B cells and the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells suggest that zzso interferes with the function of zzso but the role of zzso in the presence of functional zzso has not been zzso Here, zzso zzso or both were zzso in zzso zzso cells to study the function of zzso The zzso of zzso increased the magnitude of zzso switching from its zzso to its zzso form upon zzso zzso as indicated by a zzso zzso and expression of zzso zzso genes and significantly increased production of transforming zzso compared to zzso zzso control cells or zzso zzso Moreover, zzso lowered the degree of zzso zzso required to induce zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso with zzso as demonstrated by zzso and zzso and restored calcium zzso upon zzso zzso a signaling process inhibited by zzso Thus, our findings suggest that zzso zzso regulates the function of zzso in preventing the switch from zzso to zzso zzso zzso
