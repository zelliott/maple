The effect of zzso stress induced by the zzso association was examined in zzso cells, a human zzso zzso cell zzso Our results show that zzso enhances zzso zzso zzso leading to the formation of zzso zzso oxygen species (as shown by zzso 123 zzso The incubation of cells in the presence of both zzso and zzso a zzso zzso resulted in a strong decrease of cell survival, reinforcing the role of zzso as the main zzso agent killing zzso zzso This cell death was not zzso Indeed, neither zzso and zzso were processed and only a weak zzso c release was zzso Moreover, we observed only zzso of cells with zzso zzso In zzso cells, DNA fragmentation was observed without any sign of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The cell demise by zzso is consistent with a zzso cell death confirmed by both zzso profile of zzso zzso labeled cells and by light zzso zzso Finally, we showed that a single zzso administration of the association of zzso and zzso is able to inhibit the growth of zzso cells by about zzso (in both zzso size and zzso in an zzso mice zzso Taken together, these results reinforced our previous claims about a potential application of the zzso association in cancer zzso
