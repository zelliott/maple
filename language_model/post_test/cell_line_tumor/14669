Both natural and synthetic cannabinoids have been shown to suppress the growth of tumor cells in culture and in animal models by affecting key signaling pathways including zzso a pivotal step in tumor growth, invasion, and zzso In our search for zzso zzso agents devoid of psychoactive side effects, we zzso and evaluated the zzso effects of a novel series of zzso zzso Among these, two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were selected based on their zzso activity and lack of binding affinity for zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso migration, and zzso tube formation of zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso effect of the compounds on cell proliferation was more selective in zzso cells than in breast cancer cells zzso and zzso zzso We also noted effective zzso of zzso new blood vessel formation by the compounds in the in zzso chick zzso membrane zzso zzso Furthermore, both zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso production and zzso zzso activity in cancer zzso Additionally, zzso or zzso strongly inhibited breast cancer zzso zzso and tumor zzso Together, these results suggest that novel synthetic zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibit tumor growth by targeting zzso zzso signaling in zzso cells and suppressing zzso production and cancer cell zzso
