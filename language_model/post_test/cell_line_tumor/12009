Recently, we were able to show that zzso zzso gastric cancer zzso patients have a significantly better survival after the complete zzso of their tumor compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to zzso an immune response towards a type 1 zzso profile and zzso type 1 zzso responses are associated with protection from tumor challenge and zzso tumor zzso zzso we hypothesized that the improved survival in zzso zzso patients may be secondary to the induction of a zzso type 1 T cell zzso To characterize the zzso immune response in zzso patients we analyzed zzso zzso zzso isolated from primary zzso The zzso T cell population contained 50% zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso zzso The number of B cells zzso P zzso zzso was significantly increased and the number of T cells zzso P zzso zzso significantly decreased in zzso compared to diffuse type of zzso Four tumor cell lines were established from primary zzso and three from zzso zzso zzso T cell cultures were established from isolated zzso from four zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso patients and tested for zzso zzso zzso Eight of ten T cell cultures derived from zzso zzso patients zzso both zzso and zzso after zzso with zzso tumor zzso The only zzso zzso line expressing a dominant zzso response was derived from an zzso zzso zzso
