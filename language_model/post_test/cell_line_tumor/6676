zzso zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso or zzso is a protein that works closely with zzso in regulating the metabolism of zzso Some of the zzso products of zzso are known to play active roles in the function of cancer cells, including breast cancer zzso The current study investigated the expression of zzso in clinical breast cancer and the zzso impact of zzso and zzso in patients with breast zzso A cohort of breast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with normal background zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso transcripts were determined using zzso and quantitative zzso zzso of the transcripts were zzso against clinical and pathological zzso Breast zzso zzso had significantly higher levels of zzso transcript compared with normal zzso zzso zzso zzso The transcript was seen at significantly higher levels in zzso positive zzso than that in zzso negative zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso significance was assessed using both a zzso index and clinical zzso Value of zzso was first demonstrated when using the Nottingham zzso Index zzso as an zzso in that patients with predicted poor prognosis had significantly higher levels of zzso than patients with good prognosis zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, patients who died of breast zzso causes had significant higher levels of zzso than those patients who remained disease free, following a median 10-year zzso A survival analysis has shown that high levels of zzso were significantly correlated with overall survival zzso survival zzso month zzso zzso months, in zzso from patients with high and low levels of zzso P zzso zzso The same disadvantage of high levels of zzso was also seen with zzso survival zzso months zzso zzso months, P zzso zzso Analysis of zzso together with zzso transcript did not enhance the significance of the zzso However, when zzso was considered together with zzso it improved the zzso power for both overall and zzso survival zzso month zzso zzso months, P zzso zzso for overall survival and zzso months zzso zzso months for zzso survival, P zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso expression was zzso in human breast cancer, particularly in aggressive zzso Furthermore, zzso had a significant zzso value in patients with breast zzso This identifies zzso as a potential therapeutic target in breast zzso
