In this study we examined zzso and zzso expression of zzso zzso receptors zzso on cells of a zzso zzso cell line, zzso zzso zzso expression was found both at zzso and protein zzso zzso protein was predominantly located zzso zzso positive zzso zzso and only in minority of zzso cells zzso positive zzso zzso on plasma zzso as revealed by zzso Cell zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression both at zzso (up to 24 zzso and protein levels (up to zzso zzso zzso expressed on zzso cells was functionally active as its zzso with zzso zzso zzso and 1 zzso triggered zzso of zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso triggering of zzso zzso is suggested since truncated zzso which does not bind to zzso was zzso zzso we have shown for the first time that cells of zzso cell line zzso express functionally active zzso which triggers zzso via zzso zzso and which could be zzso by zzso zzso The data may be relevant for better understanding of the role of zzso and their zzso zzso zzso in regulation of inflammatory and immune zzso
