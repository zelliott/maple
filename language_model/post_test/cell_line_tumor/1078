Our previous studies have shown that, contrary to many other human pancreatic zzso cell lines, zzso cells are resistant to the zzso effect of the tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso also called zzso zzso In our in zzso studies, the combination of zzso and protein synthesis zzso zzso but not zzso alone, was, however, effective in inducing zzso in zzso zzso In the present study, we examined the effect of zzso with zzso on the growth of zzso cells in zzso and in zzso 

Mice with zzso transplanted zzso cells were treated either with zzso zzso zzso or a combination of both zzso + zzso for 14 zzso After 14 days, the size and weight of the tumors were registered and the zzso of the tumor cells were determined by the zzso zzso In zzso the effect of combination treatment on zzso was assessed by zzso zzso and zzso was assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso 3, and zzso proteins were determined by Western zzso 

No toxic side effects were observed in either zzso The tumor volume was significantly smaller and the zzso ratio was higher in the TRAIL + Gen group than in the other 2 zzso The zzso effect was associated with the zzso zzso zzso partially inhibited zzso by TRAIL + zzso 

These results indicate that the combination of zzso with zzso presents a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of pancreatic zzso Further detail investigations are needed, however, to verify the mechanisms of this combination zzso
