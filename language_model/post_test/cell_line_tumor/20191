To investigate the effect of zzso A zzso on the growth and zzso in human lung zzso cell line zzso zzso 

Human lung zzso zzso cells were cultured in zzso in the presence of zzso and the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso A, and the growth curve was obtained by zzso exclusion zzso and cell zzso zzso was assessed using zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso and cell cycle was detected by flow zzso zzso The proteins of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected by Western zzso 

zzso growth reduction was observed in the zzso cells following treatment with zzso or the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso The combined treatment with zzso caused the highest zzso of cell zzso The zzso rate of zzso cells treated with zzso or zzso for 24 hours was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, but a significantly higher zzso rate was zzso zzso zzso was induced by combined treatment with zzso and zzso In contrast with the control group, the cell cycle was markedly arrested at zzso phase in the zzso and zzso group zzso zzso zzso The Western zzso analysis demonstrated that treatment with zzso led to a synergistic increase of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and reduced the expression of zzso 

zzso or zzso alone can inhibit the cell growth and induce zzso and the combination of zzso and zzso exerts a synergistic effect on the growth and zzso in lung zzso zzso
