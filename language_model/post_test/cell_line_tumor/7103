zzso zzso a new zzso zzso acid zzso is a potent inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso the de zzso synthesis of zzso zzso is considered to be an excellent target for cancer zzso In the present study we investigated the zzso effects of zzso alone and in combination with zzso zzso in zzso human zzso leukemia zzso In growth zzso experiments zzso yielded an zzso of 30 zzso colony formation was inhibited at an zzso of 20 zzso as determined by a soft zzso zzso Exposure of the cells to 75 and 100 zzso zzso for 24 hours was shown to significantly decrease zzso zzso zzso and zzso pools, whereas zzso concentration increased, as determined by zzso The combination of zzso with zzso yielded more than additive zzso effects both in growth zzso zzso and in soft zzso zzso We could show zzso zzso the cells with 75 and 100 zzso zzso and subsequent exposure to zzso zzso levels increased by zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso might offer an additional option for the treatment of leukemia and thus be further investigated in zzso and in zzso
