To develop an efficient zzso interference system using zzso particles displaying the zzso growth factor zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso plasmids were constructed by gene clone zzso The modified helper zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to package zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso was used to zzso the zzso of the progeny virus zzso zzso DNA was extracted and analyzed by zzso gel zzso to evaluate the percentage of the zzso zzso The expression level of the reporter gene enhanced green zzso protein zzso was determined by zzso zzso particles packaging zzso into zzso The level of zzso gene expression in cells zzso zzso particles packaging zzso was examined by Western zzso zzso zzso was used to enhance the gene zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso were successfully zzso zzso zzso can be packaged zzso After the cells were infected by zzso displaying zzso particles in the presence of zzso the expression of the target gene zzso or zzso was substantially zzso 

zzso zzso particles are efficient zzso delivery zzso in the presence of zzso
