The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso commonly occurs in zzso and is a crucial event in zzso zzso zzso leukemia zzso is characterized by a zzso zzso zzso zzso that generates the zzso fusion zzso The zzso zzso is activated by zzso zzso protein and mediates the zzso in zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso activates the zzso zzso is not completely zzso In the present study, we found that zzso zzso domain zzso repeat protein zzso 1 and 2 zzso and zzso were depleted in zzso zzso We investigated the interaction between zzso and zzso in zzso cell lines and zzso zzso cells from zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and depletion of zzso induced the expression of zzso and zzso which zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso resulting in inhibited proliferation of zzso zzso The reduction of zzso and zzso expression by short interfering zzso in zzso cells weakened the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso treatment with the zzso zzso zzso and depletion of zzso induced zzso and zzso expression and inhibited colony formation of zzso zzso cells, whereas depletion of zzso and zzso weakened the zzso of colony formation activity by the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso and continuously activates zzso zzso and zzso via zzso on zzso resulting in the proliferation of zzso zzso
