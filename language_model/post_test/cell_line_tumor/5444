zzso growth factor zzso zzso members zzso signals by zzso two classes of zzso zzso zzso termed type I and type zzso In contrast to the large number of zzso only seven type I and five type II receptors have been identified in zzso implicating a prominent zzso in zzso zzso Since a given zzso can usually interact with more than one zzso of either zzso differences in binding affinities and zzso are likely important for the generation of distinct zzso complexes with different signaling zzso 

In zzso interaction analyses showed two different prototypes of binding zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, the binding specificity of zzso to the receptors of one zzso is only zzso As suggested from the zzso nature of the zzso binding to immobilized receptors shows zzso due to cooperative binding caused by zzso zzso zzso To compare these in zzso observations to the situation in zzso binding studies on whole cells employing zzso as well as zzso bone zzso protein 2 zzso zzso were zzso Interestingly, low and high affinity binding sites were identified, as defined by the presence of either one or two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both sites contribute to different cellular responses in that the high affinity sites allow a rapid transient response at low zzso zzso whereas the low affinity sites facilitate sustained signaling but higher zzso zzso are zzso 

zzso of a zzso to a single high affinity zzso chain functioning as zzso zzso and providing sufficient complex stability allows the subsequent formation of signaling competent zzso Another zzso of the same zzso and up to two receptors of the other zzso can then be zzso Thus, the resulting zzso arrangement can principally consist of four different zzso which is consistent with our interaction analysis showing low zzso specificity within one zzso zzso For zzso further complexity is added by the fact that zzso signaling complexes containing only one type I zzso chain can also be zzso This indicates that despite prominent zzso zzso zzso a zzso of diverse signals might be generated in this zzso limited zzso
