The basic zzso zzso zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso are expressed during first zzso human zzso zzso We determined the zzso potential of each of these factors in zzso by measuring changes in the zzso gene activity using absolute zzso by real-time quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso after transient zzso In these zzso zzso was found to zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso showed the presence of two zzso in the zzso zzso which showed increased activity after zzso zzso Each of these zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso The zzso zzso data fit with the spatial expression pattern of zzso and zzso since they are expressed in zzso zzso This expression pattern, as well as the present zzso results, might suggest the presence of a zzso differentiation cascade during first zzso human zzso zzso
