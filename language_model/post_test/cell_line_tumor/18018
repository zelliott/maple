To establish a human zzso zzso mouse model via zzso transplantation of human zzso cells expressing green fluorescent protein zzso 

zzso human zzso zzso zzso cells (2 zzso zzso in exponential phase of growth were zzso zzso in nude mice, and the generated tumor zzso were collected and transplanted below the capsule of the left zzso of 6 nude zzso The growth of the tumors was observed in zzso using a zzso zzso The nude mice were sacrificed 4 weeks after transplantation to assess the tumor growth and zzso 

The tumors showed progressive growth at the zzso sites in all zzso Two weeks after the zzso green fluorescent mass was observed at the left zzso angle, and the mass increased thereafter and invaded or zzso to the zzso zzso zzso liver, zzso and the pelvic zzso zzso with a zzso rate as much as zzso 

The nude mouse model bearing zzso human zzso zzso expressing zzso has been successfully zzso
