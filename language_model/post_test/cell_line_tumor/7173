Although zzso has been implicated in zzso zzso development, little is known about its role in advanced zzso zzso This study aims to assess the effect of zzso zzso on the stability of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were zzso in carotid arteries of zzso E zzso mice zzso by placement of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso by intravenous injection of an zzso zzso 5 weeks after zzso Two weeks after zzso zzso were analyzed zzso with regard to plaque zzso and composition or by real-time zzso chain zzso No difference in plaque size was detected between zzso In the zzso group, zzso of zzso displayed a vulnerable zzso or even zzso zzso as compared with only zzso in the controls zzso In agreement, zzso zzso reduced zzso collagen by zzso ( zzso and zzso ratio by zzso ( zzso Although zzso did not affect the expression of collagen zzso zzso it was found to enhance the zzso activity of vascular smooth muscle cells in zzso suggesting that the low collagen content is attributable to zzso degradation rather than to decreased zzso 

zzso zzso zzso markedly decreases zzso collagen content and cap zzso leading to a vulnerable plaque zzso
