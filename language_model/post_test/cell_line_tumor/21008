In this study, we investigated the diagnostic value of serum death decoy zzso 3 zzso for systemic lupus zzso zzso The possible zzso role of zzso in zzso was also zzso zzso zzso levels of 90 zzso patients, 11 patients with rheumatic conditions and 123 healthy controls were determined by zzso In all, zzso of the zzso patients, zzso of patients with rheumatic conditions and zzso of the normal healthy individuals presented elevated serum zzso zzso A higher percentage of zzso zzso patients, compared with zzso zzso patients, showed zzso high serum zzso levels, a surrogate marker of zzso immune zzso To determine the cause and effect relationship of zzso expression and a zzso status, we studied young zzso transgenic zzso mice, whose zzso was driven by an zzso zzso These mice had zzso overproduction and zzso serum zzso levels, signs of dominant zzso immune zzso To determine possible zzso zzso roles of zzso the zzso bone zzso of zzso zzso mice was transplanted into lethally zzso zzso zzso female zzso The recipients developed an zzso zzso They presented zzso and zzso zzso along with zzso and liver pathology compatible with that of zzso In total, zzso of zzso bone zzso mice, compared with zzso of zzso bone zzso mice, perished within 12 months after the zzso Our results showed that serum zzso could serve as an additional zzso for zzso diagnosis and that zzso zzso from cells of zzso origin was zzso zzso in zzso
