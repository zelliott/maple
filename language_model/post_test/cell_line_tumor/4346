A series of novel zzso of zzso zzso and their corresponding zzso derivatives were prepared, and their structures were confirmed by different zzso and zzso zzso The derivatives were prepared by a sequential synthetic strategy including substitution at zzso position of zzso ring by various zzso and zzso zzso followed by zzso with zzso and finally zzso by zzso zzso The derivatives were tested for their zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso and the results revealed that among the zzso compounds, zzso derivatives zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited the highest activity with zzso value of zzso zzso The results indicate that the zzso zzso plays a vital role in exerting zzso zzso
