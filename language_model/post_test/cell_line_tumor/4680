Many cancer cells are characterized by increased zzso and decreased zzso even under zzso zzso The molecular mechanisms underlying this zzso zzso are zzso Here we show that zzso factor 1 zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso and zzso consumption in zzso zzso cells lacking the von zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso mediates these effects by zzso zzso activity via two zzso First, zzso binds to and activates zzso of the zzso zzso which encodes a zzso of zzso zzso zzso Second, zzso promotes zzso zzso degradation of zzso We demonstrate that zzso of the gene zzso the zzso zzso is zzso dependent and that loss of zzso expression is a major factor contributing to reduced zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso
