The purpose of this work was to explore the role of zzso zzso of zzso pathways in zzso cancer by examining the DNA zzso and expression status of four zzso genes in primary zzso zzso and cancer cell lines and to correlate those findings with the zzso features of zzso cancer zzso 

zzso DNA was isolated from 15 zzso cancer cell lines, 80 primary zzso cancer zzso and 4 normal zzso specimens using zzso zzso The zzso status of the DNA was evaluated using combined zzso restriction analysis, gene expression was evaluated using reverse zzso and zzso zzso was evaluated using zzso zzso 

Of the four zzso genes zzso expression of zzso was absent in six zzso cancer cell zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region of zzso was detected in cells not expressing zzso Treating zzso cells with zzso restored gene zzso confirming the role of zzso in zzso the zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso to be zzso in cells not expressing zzso indicating that zzso zzso is also involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was detected in 15 of 80 zzso cancer zzso zzso but in none of the normal zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was observed significantly more often in clear zzso zzso zzso than in other tumor types zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso zzso a survival advantage to tumor cells by enabling them to escape zzso The role for zzso zzso in human zzso zzso may be particularly important for zzso zzso with the clear cell zzso
