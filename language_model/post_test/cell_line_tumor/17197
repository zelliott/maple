The zzso and zzso of specific targeted zzso expression systems are important strategies for clinical research into gene therapy and DNA zzso due to safety zzso In this study, we introduced 3' untranslated regions and zzso control modifications and direct tandem or zzso zzso design strategies into a number of specific zzso zzso expression zzso The experiments were performed in parallel using both in zzso and in zzso zzso expression zzso In zzso studies were carried out using gene gun delivery of test zzso into mouse skin zzso A combination of specific cell lines and fresh cell zzso were used for in zzso and ex zzso zzso expression zzso zzso The results from these comparative experiments demonstrated that a number of molecular biology zzso can be readily adapted to define and significantly enhance the level zzso duration of zzso expression for a group of clinically relevant zzso zzso with very similar effects for both in zzso and in zzso test zzso This zzso zzso expression system may offer a favorable means for improving the efficiency of zzso gene therapy and DNA vaccines in future clinical zzso
