zzso zzso zzso receptors function as zzso zzso channels, where zzso binding leads to opening of a zzso zzso pore permeable to both zzso and zzso Based on evidence that zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso release from liver, these studies evaluate whether zzso receptors are expressed by zzso and contribute to zzso calcium signaling and zzso zzso Studies were performed in isolated zzso from rats and mice and zzso cells from humans and zzso zzso and protein for both zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso of intact liver revealed zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso In whole cell patch clamp studies, exposure to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso caused a rapid increase in membrane zzso zzso Similarly, with zzso fluorescence, zzso induced an increase in zzso zzso zzso receptors are likely involved because the calcium response to zzso was inhibited by zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso each increased zzso zzso Exposure to zzso decreased cellular zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso increased in zzso liver zzso 

These studies provide evidence that zzso receptors are functionally important in zzso zzso and zzso zzso are regulated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and may constitute a mechanism for zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso
