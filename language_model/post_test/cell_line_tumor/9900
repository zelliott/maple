zzso cancer is the 5th leading cause of cancer related deaths in zzso zzso survival rates for early stage disease are greater than zzso however most women are diagnosed in advanced stage with 5 year survival less than zzso zzso means for early detection and reliable patient monitoring are needed to increase zzso 

zzso mass zzso zzso we sought to zzso an unanswered zzso research question regarding ability to determine tumor burden zzso by an zzso cancer zzso protein emanating directly from the tumor zzso Since aggressive zzso zzso zzso zzso account for most zzso a zzso model using human zzso zzso zzso cancer cells was established to model progression to zzso zzso Using a method for low molecular weight protein enrichment, followed by liquid zzso and mass zzso analysis, a zzso zzso sequence of zzso was identified in zzso from mice with zzso experimental zzso zzso zzso expression was documented in cancer zzso as well as from zzso cancer patient zzso zzso study revealed that serum zzso concentration is directly related to tumor burden predictions from an inverse zzso zzso analysis of data obtained from a zzso zzso capture zzso and zzso zzso optical zzso The result from the animal model was confirmed in human clinical material as zzso was found to be significantly elevated in the zzso from women with advanced stage zzso cancer compared to those with early stage zzso 

zzso is expressed in zzso and other cancer zzso but has not been documented previously in zzso cancer disease zzso zzso is found in serum in zzso that correlate with experimental tumor burden and with clinical disease zzso The data signify that zzso may prove useful in detecting and/or monitoring zzso cancer, when used in concert with other zzso
