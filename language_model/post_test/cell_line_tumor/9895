zzso the impact of zzso zzso on target proteins is challenging because of their different regulatory effects at the zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we applied a novel protein zzso zzso zzso technology to systematically monitor for target protein levels after zzso zzso of 319 zzso into breast cancer zzso We identified 21 zzso that zzso the zzso zzso zzso as validated by western zzso and quantitative real zzso and by demonstrating the zzso of zzso cell zzso Five potent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were confirmed to directly target zzso in zzso region reporter zzso The gene expression signature that they zzso highly overlapped with that of a small interfering zzso against zzso and across all the signatures tested, was most closely associated with the repression of known zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso showed higher levels of expression in zzso as compared with zzso clinical zzso In zzso we present systematic and direct functional evidence of zzso zzso zzso signaling in breast cancer, and demonstrate the zzso zzso technology as a novel, powerful technique in determining the relative impact of various zzso on key target proteins and associated cellular processes and zzso
