To discover new molecular targets for cancer therapy and diagnosis, we surveyed signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso zzso because zzso zzso of zzso is associated with a wide variety of human zzso 

We investigated the zzso genes in zzso cells with zzso zzso analysis and found that zzso zzso zzso was induced on stimulation of the cells with leukemia zzso zzso We examined the expression of zzso in several types of cancer cells by real-time quantitative zzso To examine the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso reporter construct together with zzso active zzso zzso or zzso zzso expression zzso and zzso promoter activity was zzso The expression of zzso and activated zzso in 88 colon cancer zzso and 17 normal colon zzso was examined with zzso zzso 

In zzso cells and zzso colon cancer cells, zzso expression increased on stimulation of the cells with zzso zzso zzso promoter activity in zzso cells was dependent on the zzso of zzso zzso breast cancer cells and zzso colon cancer cells expressed zzso a high level of zzso Treatment of these cells with zzso zzso or zzso which inhibited zzso zzso resulted in reduction of the zzso zzso We found a correlation between the expression of zzso and activated zzso ( zzso in the colon cancer zzso 

zzso is a novel zzso zzso Its expression is enhanced with the zzso of zzso in colon cancer zzso zzso may be a potential candidate for a tumor marker of various kinds of zzso
