We constructed an zzso zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso promoter was replaced by a human zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was inserted into the zzso loop of the fiber zzso domain to increase the zzso efficiency of this zzso for tumor cell zzso We also inserted the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene driven by the zzso into the zzso region of the zzso zzso The in zzso zzso effect of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso was greater than that of a zzso zzso or that of the zzso zzso alone in zzso melanoma cell lines at low zzso of zzso zzso injection of low doses of the zzso zzso into zzso human melanoma cell lines followed by the zzso injection of zzso led to a greater degree of tumor zzso in zzso than did the zzso injection of the same dose of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso therapeutic zzso unit and a zzso targeted fiber protein offers a potent therapeutic combination for the gene therapy of zzso
