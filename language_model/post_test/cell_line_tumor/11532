zzso zzso zzso zzso are generally zzso to conventional therapy and salvage treatment with zzso zzso In addition to zzso effects, zzso zzso has recently shown its strong zzso activity as an zzso agent or in combination with zzso in zzso melanoma zzso In this study, the effects of zzso zzso or zzso combination on zzso PA cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso tumor model were zzso zzso combination zzso inhibited zzso invasion and induced zzso of these PA cell lines in zzso zzso combination treatment with zzso and zzso produced synergistic zzso activity and enhanced the survival rate of zzso zzso tumor models without increasing systemic side zzso In addition, zzso induced cell cycle arrest, increased DNA damage, zzso the expression of zzso B, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as elevated zzso 8 and 9 zzso The decreased expression of zzso zzso and zzso alone with zzso c release from zzso into the zzso was also observed in the zzso combination zzso The increase in cell zzso due to combination with zzso was rescued by zzso These data suggest that zzso may enhance the efficacy of zzso via triggering both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso combination of zzso and zzso may provide a novel regimen for invasive zzso zzso to standard therapy and zzso
