More than half of human genes use alternative zzso and zzso zzso to generate zzso transcripts that differ in the lengths of their 3' untranslated regions zzso thus altering the zzso fate of the message and likely the protein zzso The extent of 3' zzso variation across zzso and the functional role of zzso remain poorly zzso We developed a sequencing method called zzso to zzso map the 3' ends of the zzso of diverse human zzso and zzso transformation zzso We found that cell zzso gene expression is accomplished by two complementary zzso zzso genes tend to have single 3' zzso whereas a majority of zzso transcribed genes generate multiple 3' zzso During transformation and zzso zzso genes change their zzso abundance levels, while zzso genes mostly change 3' zzso zzso ratios to achieve tissue zzso However, both regulation programs target genes that function in the same pathways and processes that characterize the new cell zzso Instead of finding global shifts in 3' zzso length during transformation and zzso we identify zzso groups of zzso genes that change their 3' zzso zzso these changes in 3' zzso length are largely independent from changes in zzso zzso Finally, zzso usage of zzso sites appears to be a mechanism for changing the landscape zzso by zzso expressed zzso
