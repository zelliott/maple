In zzso states, the zzso zzso rapidly degrades zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso although the mechanism of delivery from the zzso to zzso zzso is poorly zzso Here we demonstrate key roles of zzso an zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso anchored to the zzso zzso in the targeting of zzso for zzso zzso 

Using zzso we observed associations of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to bind zzso zzso zzso of zzso truncated zzso molecules in zzso cells showed an zzso region outside zzso and a zzso region found in zzso were required for zzso and zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of dominant negative zzso demonstrated that the zzso activity of zzso was essential for zzso degradation of zzso but not for zzso zzso However, zzso activity did not appear to affect the N zzso of zzso which may be zzso before zzso 

These data suggest that zzso and zzso play critical roles in the zzso delivery of zzso to zzso and formation of a zzso zzso zzso degradation appears to selectively target zzso molecules with large zzso zzso
