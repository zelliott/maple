zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be involved in a variety of zzso process, such as tumor cell zzso zzso blocking of cellular immune mechanisms, and zzso zzso zzso zzso has been a potential target for zzso zzso In this study, we developed a specific zzso that can target zzso zzso and then zzso the zzso with new zzso resulting in triggering of zzso activity selectively in cancer cells that express the zzso The zzso induction of the zzso expression was caused via a highly accurate and specific zzso replacement through zzso reaction with the targeted zzso in the zzso zzso zzso with the specific zzso replacement, the zzso efficiently reduced expression level of the targeted zzso zzso in the zzso zzso the zzso could selectively deliver activity of suicide zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso into cancer cells expressing the zzso zzso and thereby specifically retarded the survival of these cells with zzso zzso These suggest that the zzso zzso zzso zzso could be a powerful genetic agent for specific cancer gene zzso
