We established the novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which have a high potential of liver zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso which have a high potential of zzso zzso derived from low zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso lines, zzso To clarify the molecular mechanisms of cancer zzso and of the different levels of gene expression in a variety of zzso zzso in pancreatic cancer, we performed a broad analysis of differential gene expression analysis between parental cell lines and zzso zzso In comparison with the parental cell lines, 65 and 36 genes were zzso and zzso in highly zzso zzso On the other hand, 43 and 45 genes were zzso and zzso in highly zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and zzso and zzso were zzso in both zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed 22 genes zzso liver, zzso zzso zzso and zzso parental cell zzso These genes might be targeted genes separating those two major zzso forms after zzso A greater number of cell line samples and more genes will have to be zzso in future studies in order to understand the involvement of genes in cancer zzso more zzso However, these results will help to clarify the molecular mechanisms of pancreatic cancer zzso
