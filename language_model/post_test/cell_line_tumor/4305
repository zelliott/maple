zzso zzso based on zzso zzso determination has been widely applied to cellular imaging in recent zzso However, quantitative imaging of the zzso nucleus has been challenging due to the lack of zzso optical zzso methods for zzso cells, as well as the inability to accurately count the absolute copy numbers of zzso in highly dense zzso Here we report a reflected zzso zzso zzso method capable of imaging inside the zzso nucleus with superior zzso ratio as well as molecular counting with zzso zzso Using reflected zzso zzso zzso we zzso the spatial organization of zzso by zzso zzso II zzso zzso molecules and zzso their global extent of zzso inside the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis that zzso on the blinking zzso of specific organic zzso showed that the majority zzso of the zzso zzso originate from single zzso II zzso and no significant zzso between zzso II molecules was detected within the length scale of the reported diameter of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso II molecules equally labeled by two zzso distinct zzso confirmed the primarily zzso distribution, arguing against a prevalent existence of zzso factories in the zzso nucleus as previously zzso The methods developed in our study pave the way for quantitative mapping and zzso characterization of key zzso species deep inside zzso zzso
