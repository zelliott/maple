zzso is a zzso zzso that has been implicated in lung zzso and lung cancer therapeutic zzso Full zzso of zzso requires two zzso events, but only one site of zzso zzso has been evaluated thus far in clinical zzso lung cancer zzso zzso which has resulted in conflicting results regarding the zzso significance of zzso zzso in zzso In this study, we sought to determine whether evaluation of zzso zzso at zzso would improve zzso zzso 

zzso zzso against zzso and zzso were validated and used in an zzso analysis of tissue zzso slides containing zzso specimens zzso zzso zzso and surrounding lung tissue specimens zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of either zzso or zzso was positive in most zzso zzso but was detected rarely in surrounding normal zzso When zzso zzso was defined by using both sites of zzso zzso zzso was specific for zzso tumors versus surrounding tissue zzso v zzso P zzso zzso was higher in zzso than in zzso cell zzso zzso v zzso P zzso zzso and was associated with shorter overall survival for all stages of disease zzso P zzso zzso In zzso zzso increased zzso of zzso alone was a poor zzso factor for stage I patients or for tumors zzso 5 zzso zzso P zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso 

These results suggest that monitoring zzso of zzso at zzso improves the assessment of zzso zzso and show that zzso zzso is a poor zzso factor for all stages of zzso
