zzso zzso zzso early gene 1) plays a significant role in regulating cell proliferation and zzso in various cell zzso Previous studies have shown a close relationship between the expression level of zzso and various zzso including breast, zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso In this study, we zzso the gene expression of zzso in zzso pancreatic cancer cell line by a zzso zzso system and investigated its potential as a therapeutic target for pancreatic zzso The results showed that zzso zzso of zzso gene inhibited human pancreatic cancer zzso cell proliferation and caused the cell cycle arrest at the zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso showed significant zzso of colony formation and cancer cell growth in 3-D culture zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso gene significantly slowed the growth of zzso zzso in nude zzso Taken together, these data provided evidence that zzso of zzso gene by a zzso zzso system led to suppressed human pancreatic cancer cell growth and might therefore be a feasible approach in the clinical management of pancreatic zzso
