Ewing zzso zzso is the second most common solid bone and soft tissue zzso in children and young adults with low cure rates indicating the need to identify further zzso zzso The importance of zzso in the zzso of key tumor zzso genes including zzso has begun to be appreciated in context of cancer development, prognosis and zzso However there is lack of similar broad based studies in zzso The objective of this study was to analyze zzso zzso and assess its clinical significance in zzso 

The zzso of zzso was determined 31 zzso tumor samples and 4 zzso cell zzso zzso cell lines were also treated with zzso agent zzso to ascertain its effect on zzso zzso expression was studied in 12 zzso zzso The association between zzso zzso clinical parameters and outcome was also zzso 

zzso of zzso was observed in zzso zzso tumors and in 3/4 zzso cell zzso A significant correlation of zzso to reduced expression of zzso was observed in 12 zzso tumors analyzed zzso zzso zzso and in all cell zzso zzso patients with zzso zzso had worse prognosis compared to the zzso group zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso resulted in the zzso of the zzso form of zzso in two zzso cell zzso
