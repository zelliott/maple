The aim of this study was to determine whether the exposure to either single or multiple zzso zzso radiation zzso could induce zzso stress in cell zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso cells to either a single frequency zzso alone or zzso zzso or multiple zzso zzso and zzso were conducted at specific zzso rate zzso values of zzso for zzso During the exposure period, the temperature in the exposure chamber was maintained zzso zzso levels of zzso oxygen species zzso the zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso and the ratio of zzso zzso zzso showed no statistically significant zzso as the result of either single or multiple zzso radiation zzso In contrast, zzso zzso cells, used as a positive control, showed evident changes in all measured biological zzso These results indicate that single or multiple zzso radiation exposure did not elicit zzso stress in zzso cells under our exposure zzso
