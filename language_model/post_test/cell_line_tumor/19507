zzso is a potential zzso drug with many biological zzso However, the zzso of zzso seriously limits its clinical zzso This study was to investigate the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso and its therapeutic efficacy on the formation of zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso was prepared with conventional rotary evaporation zzso zzso mice zzso with zzso zzso cells zzso at the anterior right zzso for twelve days were given zzso injection with zzso zzso at zzso zzso (based on zzso at different time zzso Then the levels of zzso in the zzso tumor zzso and normal zzso were tested by high pressure liquid zzso zzso Various zzso of zzso zzso were zzso given to zzso mice to determine the optimal zzso The zzso mice were treated zzso with 100 zzso zzso zzso once a day for 14 zzso The formation of zzso zzso increase of body weight, survival time and zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso cells in zzso were detected by flow zzso 

zzso zzso was a zzso particle with zzso drug content zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso effectively zzso in tumor zzso and its zzso period was 4 zzso zzso zzso inhibited the formation of zzso zzso of zzso zzso model in a zzso zzso Moreover, 100 zzso zzso zzso significantly enhanced the zzso of cancer cells in zzso inhibited the increase of body weight, reduced zzso zzso zzso and prolonged the survival time of zzso mice compared with PBS zzso 

zzso zzso can effectively accumulate in tumor zzso and inhibit the formation of zzso zzso thus it might be used as a potential zzso drug which deserves future zzso
