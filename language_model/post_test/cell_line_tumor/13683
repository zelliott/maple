zzso growth factor zzso zzso is often zzso in zzso lung cancer zzso zzso agents, including zzso zzso zzso are considered to be effective when a zzso zzso zzso is zzso However, inherent and acquired zzso are major problems of zzso zzso In this study, we performed zzso zzso by using small interfering zzso in zzso cell lines to examine the significance of targeting zzso for zzso zzso 

We treated 13 zzso cell lines, including 8 zzso zzso and 5 zzso wild type by using zzso or small interfering zzso against zzso zzso Three cell lines zzso zzso and zzso were zzso established with acquired resistance to zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect was determined by using an zzso inner salt zzso or colony formation zzso The protein expression was evaluated by using Western zzso 

All 13 cell lines expressed zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein expression in zzso The cell viability was suppressed by zzso in 6 of 8 zzso cell lines zzso zzso of control zzso including zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but were not zzso Of note, zzso zzso and zzso zzso was deleted in zzso and zzso was amplified in zzso It was not suppressed in any of the zzso zzso cells except in the zzso in which zzso is zzso which indicates its zzso 

Analysis of the results indicated that zzso can be a therapeutic target in zzso with zzso zzso In contrast, targeting zzso is not appropriate for tumors in which zzso is not zzso even if zzso is zzso
