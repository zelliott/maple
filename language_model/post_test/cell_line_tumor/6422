To investigate the reversal effect of zzso and zzso on zzso resistance zzso human breast cancer cells zzso and its underlying zzso 

After establishing the resistance cell lines of human breast cancer on zzso zzso the effects of the drugs on the toxicity of zzso cells and the reversal effect of zzso on zzso were determined by zzso zzso The cells were divided into seven groups zzso zzso B: zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + 0 zzso zzso zzso + 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso + 6 zzso zzso The zzso levels of zzso and zzso in these treated cells were also determined by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso the protein levels of zzso and zzso in these treated cells were also determined by Western zzso zzso 

Compared with the zzso control, the zzso effects was obviously increased by combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with the vehicle control, zzso zzso zzso and protein levels of zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso and protein levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso has reversal effect on zzso in zzso cells, it's possible mechanism might be related to reduce the protein expression of zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso
