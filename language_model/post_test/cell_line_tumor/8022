zzso zzso was zzso in a variety of zzso and was closely correlated with zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso was shown to induce zzso in many cancer zzso However, the mechanism of zzso on induction of cancer cells zzso is poorly zzso This study was designed to characterize the global gene expression profiles before and after treatment of human leukemia cell line zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso were used to observe the effect of zzso on the zzso of zzso cells and normal human peripheral blood zzso cells zzso zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and Western zzso were used to detect the difference of gene and protein expressions of zzso cells after incubation of the cells with zzso The results showed that zzso could induce zzso zzso in zzso and zzso manners but spared zzso zzso analysis showed that after incubation with zzso for 9 zzso 310 genes were zzso and 313 genes were zzso These genes regulate the growth, differentiation and survival of zzso Among these zzso zzso was zzso by zzso and zzso was zzso by zzso It was concluded that zzso has zzso zzso and zzso effects on zzso cells in zzso and zzso manners, with weak zzso effects on zzso at the same zzso The mechanism of zzso selectively inducing zzso and zzso growth may be ascribed to the changes of zzso genes and zzso zzso
