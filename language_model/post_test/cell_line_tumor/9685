Upon searching for zzso zzso sequences associated with the transformed to normal zzso zzso of zzso rat zzso cells, we identified zzso zzso restrict protein in zzso as a novel rat zzso Here we report on the identification and functional characterization of the complete sequence zzso the rat zzso zzso The cloned zzso presented a zzso zzso zzso frame zzso a zzso zzso acids zzso sequence containing a zzso zzso complex zzso zzso virus and zinc zzso domain in its zzso region and zzso motifs in its zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that the rat zzso displays a high level of identity with the equivalent gene zzso from other zzso Among rat zzso zzso expression is more pronounced in brain zzso We show that zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso cells suppresses zzso independence in zzso and zzso in zzso altering their zzso nature towards a more benign zzso zzso zzso may be zzso as a novel tumor zzso zzso with possible relevance for zzso zzso
