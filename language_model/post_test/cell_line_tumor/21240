Bone is one of the main retention zzso for uranium zzso and lead zzso The clinical effects of U or zzso poisoning are well zzso acute and chronic zzso impair bone zzso However, only few studies dealt with the cellular and molecular mechanisms of their zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate acute zzso of U and zzso and their zzso effects on rat and human zzso the cells responsible for bone zzso The most likely species of the zzso in contact with cells after blood contamination were selected for cell zzso zzso showed that the zzso effect of U and zzso is highly dependent on their zzso Thus, zzso was zzso when left free in the exposure medium or when zzso with zzso zzso or zzso but not when zzso with zzso or zzso under an zzso zzso U was zzso whatever its zzso but differences in sensitivity were observed as a function of zzso zzso growth recovery could be obtained after exposure to low doses of U or zzso except for some zzso complexes which had irreversible effects whatever the zzso The zzso of two markers of bone formation and zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso was observed after exposure to zzso doses or zzso species of U or zzso while their zzso was observed after toxic exposure to both zzso This work provides new elements to better understand the complex mechanisms of U and zzso toxicity to zzso Our results also illustrate the importance of a strictly controlled zzso of the metals in zzso zzso
