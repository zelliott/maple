We aimed to zzso a possible mechanism of action by investigating the effects of zzso zzso on cell cycle arrest and zzso in zzso cancer cells zzso cells and zzso zzso 

The zzso cancer cells were treated with varying zzso of zzso (1 zzso 5 zzso and 10 zzso for 24 zzso The effects of zzso on cell cycle, zzso zzso zzso potential and zzso related proteins were examined by flow zzso assessment and zzso 

zzso induced zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso in zzso cancer cells zzso cells and zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso associated X zzso was zzso and zzso (B cell zzso zzso was zzso after zzso treatment in both cells in a zzso zzso zzso caused increased loss of zzso zzso zzso and induced zzso zzso from zzso into zzso and zzso 3 zzso in both zzso cancer cells in a zzso zzso 

zzso induced zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso in both zzso cancer cells via zzso zzso zzso
