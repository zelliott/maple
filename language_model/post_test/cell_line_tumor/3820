The potential contribution of zzso zzso cells zzso in the presentation of tumor cell zzso remains zzso and some controversies exist with regard to the ability of zzso to zzso zzso particulate zzso and zzso them to zzso class zzso T zzso In this study, we show that human zzso although inefficient in the zzso of cell membrane fragments by zzso can efficiently acquire membrane patches and associated molecules from cancer cells of different zzso The transfer of membrane patches to zzso occurred in a very short time and required zzso zzso zzso transfer also included intact zzso complexes, and the acquired zzso could be efficiently recognized on zzso by zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso isolated from human colon cancer zzso displayed a strong surface expression of zzso cell zzso zzso indicating that the exchange of zzso zzso between zzso and tumor cells also can occur in zzso These data demonstrate that zzso are well suited to acquire membrane patches from zzso tumor cells by a zzso zzso mechanism that closely resembles zzso This phenomenon may allow zzso to zzso present tumor zzso zzso despite limited properties of zzso
