zzso steps during cellular zzso are the induction of zzso zzso and subsequent DNA zzso finally leading to the formation of zzso of zzso We have examined the zzso and local distribution of this zzso fragmentation within different zzso zzso For the induction of zzso zzso cells were treated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso (a zzso I zzso The zzso origin of the fragments was zzso by Southern zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In these experiments we observed similar zzso patterns of the fragmented DNA, indicating a random and zzso zzso of the nuclear zzso However, zzso with a zzso probe revealed that, in contrast to the other zzso zzso regions, the zzso zzso was not zzso into zzso fragments despite our observation that the zzso DNA in zzso cells is zzso in zzso We determined just a minor zzso of the zzso repeats early during zzso These observations suggest that zzso zzso is excluded from zzso zzso during zzso
