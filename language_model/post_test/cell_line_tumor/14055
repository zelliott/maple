To determine if five zzso zzso a class of naturally occurring compounds from zzso zzso zzso zzso have the activities to reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance zzso 

The zzso of four zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso toward zzso zzso and zzso in the presence or absence of one of the zzso zzso were determined by a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso in the four zzso cell lines was determined by incubation of cells with zzso (2 zzso in the presence or absence of one of the zzso zzso by a zzso zzso The interaction of the five zzso zzso with zzso was zzso by their zzso of zzso zzso labeling of zzso 

Among the five zzso while zzso A and B, and zzso A demonstrated strong and comparable activities to reverse the drug resistance and the zzso drug zzso in four zzso cell lines, zzso A and B showed very limited zzso The poor activities of zzso A and B are possibly caused by the zzso groups on the zzso ring, because the activities of the molecules resumed when the zzso group was zzso to form a zzso Further studies demonstrated that these compounds physically zzso with zzso 

zzso A and B, and zzso A are potent zzso inhibitor and is of potential for future clinical zzso
