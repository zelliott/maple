zzso zzso zzso a stable and water soluble zzso zzso agent, was shown to be toxic to cancer cells with zzso around 10 zzso zzso We tested zzso for its potential zzso activities and found it inhibited cancer cell growth with zzso in the zzso range for the majority of cancer cells tested, with the exception of zzso cells, for which the zzso is in the zzso zzso This unique selectivity of zzso to zzso cells can potentially be exploited for zzso zzso Although the underlying mechanisms for the apparent zzso specificity remain to be zzso our analysis indicates that zzso significantly reduces cell zzso and zzso cell proliferation at the zzso zzso zzso treatment also triggers induction of zzso and zzso at the protein levels, suggesting the zzso of DNA damage zzso However, zzso zzso growth zzso does not require the zzso zzso since zzso zzso cell pairs display the same zzso These properties of zzso favor its candidacy for evaluation as a new zzso agent, particularly for zzso
