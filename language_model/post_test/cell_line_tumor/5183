The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso and breast tumors triggers an zzso response that suppresses tumor growth by developing tumor zzso but culminates in zzso zzso when zzso immune cells recognize zzso zzso We identified zzso as a novel zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso and provide evidence that zzso might represent a novel important tumor zzso in zzso zzso Strong zzso protein expression was observed in zzso of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso compared with zzso of zzso zzso and no zzso was observed in zzso zzso or zzso High zzso protein levels correlated with attenuated zzso target gene expression in these solid tumors, and zzso zzso in tumor cell lines reduced zzso zzso zzso This effect was because of both zzso of hypoxic protein zzso and suppression of the zzso activity of zzso zzso is known for its tendency to zzso usually associated with a lower pathological stage and higher survival zzso We provide evidence that zzso protein strongly accumulates in zzso zzso the zzso response to tumor zzso and may become of diagnostic importance as novel zzso tumor zzso
