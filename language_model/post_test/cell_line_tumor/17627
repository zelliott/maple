A novel zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso has been zzso The system, which falls under the zzso platform technology developed at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of a zzso solution zzso neutralized with zzso zzso that is liquid at room temperature but gels when heated to body zzso We propose to use this zzso zzso for the sustained release of zzso at tumor zzso sites in order to prevent local tumor zzso The in zzso release profiles demonstrated controlled delivery over 1 zzso The initial drug loading substantially affected the zzso Local delivery of zzso from the zzso injected zzso was investigated using zzso tumors implanted zzso on zzso zzso These experiments showed that one zzso injection of the zzso zzso containing zzso was as zzso as four intravenous injections of zzso in zzso the growth of zzso cancer cells in mice, but in a less toxic zzso Further zzso analysis revealed that while the proportion of zzso areas was similar for the zzso and the zzso tumors, a disparity between zzso inflammatory cell populations may suggest differing zzso zzso
