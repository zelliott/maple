The bacterial zzso sensing zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso is produced by the opportunistic pathogen zzso zzso and controls expression of zzso factors associated with life threatening infections in immune compromised zzso zzso has also demonstrated zzso activity, yet its ability to enhance zzso of zzso zzso compromises further consideration as a potential zzso zzso In search of zzso zzso that selectively inhibit cancer cell growth, a library of zzso zzso zzso has been prepared by zzso synthesis and evaluated for cancer growth zzso and zzso sensing zzso Comparative zzso analysis demonstrates that both zzso and zzso signaling systems require long zzso side chains with a zzso substitution for maximum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as a lead compound with strong cancer growth zzso activity that zzso zzso of zzso signaling pathways in a zzso zzso reporter zzso
