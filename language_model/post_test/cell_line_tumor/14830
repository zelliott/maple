zzso zzso have been successfully used to determine relative abundance of key proteins in various zzso and other zzso We have previously showed liver zzso genes between the zzso pancreatic cancer line zzso and its parental line zzso In this study, we searched for potential markers for zzso progression using zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso were used to analysis the different zzso between zzso and zzso zzso A standard zzso zzso value was used to determine zzso expressed proteins and Western zzso analysis further confirmed the zzso zzso zzso revealed that 40 proteins were zzso altered more than zzso between the selected zzso and its parental zzso 14 of the proteins were zzso and 26 were zzso Most of the zzso proteins zzso play a role in tumor signal zzso while a number of zzso proteins zzso function in cell zzso this might be crucial for pancreatic cancer zzso Four zzso proteins were validated by western zzso in the cell zzso Interestingly, the zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso were further confirmed in the culture zzso by western zzso These zzso data are valuable for understanding pancreatic cancer zzso and searching for potential markers of zzso zzso
