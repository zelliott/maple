An elevated serum level of zzso protein is found in acute zzso leukemia zzso and predicts a poor treatment outcome in zzso zzso To investigate the potential pathological link between the elevated serum level of this protein and poor zzso we examined the zzso effects of zzso zzso protein on the in zzso growth and survival of primary cultured zzso cells at zzso equivalent to the levels found in the serum of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein promoted the in zzso growth and survival of zzso cells and this activity was associated with the zzso production and zzso of the zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso signaling zzso zzso specific to zzso signaling pathways inhibited the zzso and zzso activity of zzso These findings indicate the novel biological action of zzso zzso and its association with poor zzso and suggest an important role for zzso zzso in the zzso progression of leukemia and a potential therapeutic target for these zzso
