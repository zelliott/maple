There is strong evidence that zzso zzso causes zzso stress and zzso zzso dysfunction in the zzso of Alzheimer's zzso zzso zzso factor A zzso has multiple roles in the maintenance of zzso To study the protective roles of zzso against zzso zzso we established zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and exposed them to 10 zzso zzso for 24 zzso We found that zzso zzso attenuated zzso cell viability damage and zzso In addition, zzso zzso significantly suppressed the increase in excess zzso oxygen species and reversed the reduction in zzso c zzso activity and zzso production induced by zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso which has no functional domain for stimulating zzso zzso but can still maintain the zzso zzso formation and zzso copy number, also exhibited protective effects against zzso zzso in zzso zzso Together, our data suggest that zzso zzso protects zzso against zzso zzso damage in zzso zzso These beneficial effects may be attributable to the roles of zzso in maintaining zzso zzso formation and zzso copy zzso
