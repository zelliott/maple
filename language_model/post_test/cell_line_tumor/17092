In this study, the role of zzso fatty acids in the regulation of zzso protein zzso gene expression was investigated using the following model culture system: zzso zzso cells expressing the zzso protein zzso driven by different segments of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso but not zzso acid zzso zzso zzso induced a significant increase in medium zzso intensity zzso determined by zzso cell sorting zzso The induction of zzso promoter was zzso showing zzso activity between 24 and 48 h after zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso was dependent on fatty acid zzso with maximum zzso at 200 zzso Northern zzso analysis confirmed the zzso data in zzso cells incubated with zzso Furthermore, this treatment increased the zzso zzso zzso zzso levels and the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso promoter activity was inhibited by zzso with zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso stimulates the expression of zzso via zzso zzso
