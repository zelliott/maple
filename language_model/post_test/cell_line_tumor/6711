zzso zzso and zzso expressed zzso are highly related heat shock zzso zzso expression levels and zzso zzso of these proteins has been suggested as a potential marker in certain zzso The aim of our study was to work out a reliable, zzso detection of the zzso zzso protein and enabling discrimination between zzso and zzso proteins in zzso human zzso We tested the effect of several zzso procedures and zzso retrieval on the effectiveness of the zzso detection in zzso cells cultured in zzso and in liver of rats subjected to heat zzso For cells grown in zzso specific zzso zzso was obtained with all zzso zzso However, samples fixed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso required zzso zzso In liver tissue embedded in zzso regardless the zzso used, positive zzso zzso could be visible only if zzso retrieval was zzso We applied this procedure for detection of zzso in routine sections of breast and lung zzso fixed with zzso zzso and found that the application of zzso zzso retrieval significantly enhanced the zzso zzso and reduced background zzso This procedure enabled also the differential detection of zzso and zzso in routine zzso zzso
