Gene expression profiles that are anchored to zzso zzso may lead to the identification of signatures that predict zzso or zzso The study presented here describes the analysis of DNA zzso in the human zzso zzso cell line after exposure to zzso a zzso zzso of zzso A validated zzso zzso mass zzso zzso is reported for the detection and zzso of zzso zzso the principal DNA zzso of zzso Limits of zzso based on a zzso ratio of zzso are determined to zzso to approximately 27 zzso of zzso injected zzso The zzso has been used to measure the zzso levels of the zzso in the human zzso zzso cell line as a function of dose zzso zzso and zzso zzso and time zzso 6, and 27 zzso after exposure to zzso The levels of zzso zzso in the cells, ranging from 18 to 500 zzso in zzso zzso were then correlated to cell zzso induced zzso at the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and gene expression profiling through zzso zzso Cell cultures were evaluated for toxicity by growth curve zzso zzso zzso were performed on the zzso and zzso zzso and gene expression profiles were generated by analyses using zzso zzso In the zzso zzso analysis, as the zzso concentration increased, there was an increase in zzso zzso indicating a direct correlation to zzso dosing level and zzso occurring at these two zzso zzso analysis of the gene expression data determined that a total of zzso genes exhibited statistically significant changes in expression after treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso Among the genes identified, zzso were zzso whereas 5 genes that had functions in cell survival and cell growth and, zzso could be indicators of zzso were zzso relative to zzso The results demonstrate the value of zzso gene expression patterns to zzso zzso such as DNA zzso levels, zzso and zzso
