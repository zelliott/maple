The zzso protein of zzso B virus is involved in deregulation of cell cycle and development of zzso zzso Since zzso also plays an important role in cell proliferation and tumor development, we studied its regulation by zzso in a human zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso and zzso resulted in increased stability of zzso zzso zzso blocked the zzso of zzso through a direct interaction with the F box region of zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso We suggest that sustained presence of zzso combined with zzso activity inherent to zzso may be associated with cell cycle deregulation and zzso
