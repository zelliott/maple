Invasion and proliferation in zzso require the cooperation of tumor cell and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is increasingly recognized as a major contributor to signaling pathways that zzso invasion and zzso Here we show that zzso zzso of the zzso family reduce invasion of zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso and we show that zzso signaling plays an important role in zzso these zzso zzso improved survival in zzso mice in which a substantial decrease in blood vessel density was seen in treated zzso In addition, zzso blocked migration of zzso cells, suggesting that zzso zzso therapy with zzso zzso in zzso not only zzso invasion of tumor cells, but blocks migration of zzso cells, which is also required for tumor zzso Overall, our findings suggest that zzso zzso of zzso offers a novel treatment paradigm to target 2 of the most important interacting cellular compartments in zzso models of zzso
