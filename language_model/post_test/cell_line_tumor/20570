Human zzso zzso type 1 zzso is a zzso zzso that has long been known to play critical roles in zzso synthesis and more recently in zzso zzso zzso showing a dual function that promotes breast cancer cell zzso Previously, we reported the first observation of the influence of the zzso on zzso zzso gene zzso Here, we demonstrate the impact of zzso expression on the breast cancer cell zzso and investigate its role in cell zzso 

zzso was zzso zzso in zzso cells and the zzso of the generated cells zzso zzso zzso zzso was compared to that of the wild type zzso zzso zzso study was performed using two-dimensional gel zzso followed by mass zzso analysis of zzso expressed protein zzso zzso zzso quantitative real-time zzso zzso was used to investigate the zzso of individual zzso The effect of zzso on zzso cell migration was verified by a zzso zzso 

zzso data demonstrate that the expression of more than 59 proteins is modulated following zzso zzso zzso regulates the expression of important genes and proteins that are relevant to cell growth control, such as zzso and zzso interacting protein zzso and zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso which are zzso and zzso in zzso cells, zzso zzso data reveal that zzso increases the zzso levels of zzso receptors zzso alpha and beta by zzso and zzso respectively, while decreasing that of the zzso zzso by zzso Interestingly, zzso increases the zzso transcript (by zzso zzso and the protein expression of the zzso zzso gene zzso and the expression of the two zzso are closely zzso We have further shown that zzso expression is associated with an increase of zzso cell zzso 

In addition to the regulation of important zzso we have demonstrated for the first time that zzso increases breast cancer cell migration, in spite of its positive regulation of the zzso gene zzso This is also correlated to its stimulation of breast cancer cell growth, further confirming its targeting in zzso positive breast zzso The novel findings in this study suggest several directions for future research on the contribution of zzso to breast cancer progression and related zzso
