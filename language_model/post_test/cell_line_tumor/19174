The zzso of human tumors based on molecular criteria offers tremendous clinical zzso however, discerning critical and zzso zzso on a large scale will also require robust experimental models reflective of tumor zzso zzso Here, we describe a comprehensive zzso analysis of 101 melanoma short-term cultures and cell zzso Using an zzso approach designed to enrich for putative zzso events, we show that cultured melanoma cells zzso the spectrum of significant zzso zzso present in primary zzso When zzso according to these zzso zzso cluster into zzso suggestive of distinct zzso zzso zzso gene expression data suggests novel candidate zzso genes linked to zzso copy gains and losses, including both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso tumor zzso mechanisms associated with zzso 10 zzso Finally, zzso zzso data show that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may zzso sensitivity to zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso defined cell culture collections therefore offer a rich framework for systematic functional studies in melanoma and other zzso
