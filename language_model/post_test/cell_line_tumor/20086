zzso zzso is a zzso protein that zzso the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels are decreased in many different cancer types and it has been proposed that this protein could be used as a zzso factor in breast zzso Here, using publicly available DNA zzso zzso zzso analysis of gene zzso libraries and zzso analysis, we determined that zzso zzso is present in normal breast cells and its levels are significantly decreased in all breast cancer zzso In addition, by zzso we found that zzso expression is higher in normal breast tissue and benign zzso than in zzso zzso Among these, lower grade tumors showed increased zzso expression compared to higher grade zzso zzso these data indicate that zzso protein levels would provide a better negative correlation with breast cancer zzso than zzso transcript zzso In mice, we found that zzso zzso and protein expression is also diminished in zzso zzso Interestingly, a strong positive association of zzso expression and zzso differentiation was identified in normal and tumor zzso In fact, zzso expression is highly increased during zzso showing good correlation with various zzso differentiation zzso zzso expression was also induced in zzso zzso cells treated with zzso hormones, mainly by zzso through zzso zzso The effect of this hormone was highly dependent on zzso differentiation status, as zzso was unable to elicit a similar response in zzso or zzso zzso zzso In zzso these studies show that zzso expression is strongly linked to the zzso differentiation program in human and mice, suggesting that this protein might play specific and relevant roles in the normal physiology of the zzso
