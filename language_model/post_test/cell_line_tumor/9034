Our goal in these analyses was to use zzso features from a test set of primary breast tumors to build an integrated zzso landscape model that makes relevant hypothetical predictions about the biological and/or clinical behavior of zzso breast zzso We interrogated zzso data from benign breast zzso zzso triple negative, and zzso tumors to identify 685 zzso expressed zzso 102 alternatively spliced zzso and zzso genes that expressed single zzso sequence zzso zzso that were associated with the zzso tumors in our survey zzso These features were integrated into a zzso landscape model that identified 12 highly interconnected zzso zzso each of which represents a cellular processes zzso that appears to define the zzso architecture of the zzso tumors in our test zzso The zzso of the model was confirmed by the observation that several key pathways were enriched in zzso zzso breast zzso The ability of this model to make relevant predictions about the biology of breast cancer cells was established by the observation that zzso signaling was linked to zzso sensitivity in zzso and strongly associated with risk of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso clinical trial zzso Additional zzso from the zzso zzso model, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were linked to response to zzso and zzso in zzso and/or risk of zzso in the zzso zzso These data indicate that an integrated zzso landscape model derived from a test set of zzso breast tumors has potential for predicting outcome and for identifying novel potential therapeutic strategies for this breast cancer zzso
