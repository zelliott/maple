To explore the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso in gallbladder zzso and to identify whether depletion of zzso by zzso could zzso proliferation and migration of gallbladder zzso 

zzso was zzso into cells of the gallbladder zzso cell line zzso using a zzso zzso The effect of zzso on the zzso migration, invasion and cell cycle of zzso cells was studied using in zzso zzso for cell zzso colony formation, wound healing and cell zzso The expression of zzso and zzso was detected by real-time zzso chain reaction and Western zzso The effect of zzso on the proliferation of zzso cells in zzso was investigated by zzso experiments in nude zzso 

zzso zzso reduced the expression of zzso in cultured zzso The expression of the zzso protein increased along with the zzso of zzso although no significant difference was found in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso significantly increased the proportion of cells in the S phase and significantly decreased the proportion of cells in the zzso zzso No significant difference in the frequency of cells in the zzso phase was zzso The results from the cell zzso colony formation and wound healing zzso revealed that zzso zzso markedly inhibited the proliferation and migration of zzso cells in zzso Additionally, zzso experiments showed that suppression of zzso significantly decreased the weights of the tumors zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso g in the control and zzso groups vs zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso g in the zzso and zzso zzso 

The expression of zzso in zzso cells was inhibited following zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene inhibited zzso migration and zzso of zzso cells by mechanisms dependent on enhanced expression of the zzso zzso
