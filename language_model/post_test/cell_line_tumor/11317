zzso of zzso has been reported from about zzso of prostate zzso The clinical significance of this zzso and the zzso zzso zzso driving the deletion remain to be zzso We have mapped the zzso deletion locus using zzso array analysis and performed zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis to search for associations between zzso zzso prostate cancer zzso and patient prognosis in a tissue zzso containing more than zzso prostate zzso zzso array analysis of 72 prostate zzso revealed a small deletion at zzso in 14 zzso of the zzso including the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso FISH analysis using zzso zzso revealed deletions in zzso and zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso deletions were linked to adverse features of prostate cancer, including advanced stage zzso zzso zzso high zzso grade zzso zzso zzso and early zzso recurrence zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso deletions were linked to zzso zzso and to zzso deletions zzso zzso zzso zzso A subset analysis of zzso zzso revealed that zzso deletions occurred independently from zzso deletions zzso zzso zzso identifying zzso with zzso deletion as a distinct molecular subset of zzso zzso zzso expression analysis confirmed that all zzso genes were down regulated by the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso resulted in decreased zzso capabilities, corroborating a zzso zzso function for all three zzso In zzso our data show that deletion of zzso defines a distinct and aggressive molecular subset of zzso prostate zzso which is possibly driven by zzso of multiple zzso zzso
