In recent years, much progress has been made in the treatment of multiple zzso However, a major limitation of existing zzso drugs is the eventual emergence of zzso zzso the development of novel agents with new mechanisms of action is zzso Here, we describe the activity and mechanism of action of zzso zzso a novel zzso agent, in multiple myeloma zzso 

The zzso activity of zzso was assessed using zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines, and primary myeloma zzso Cell cycle distribution, zzso zzso c release, and zzso inner membrane zzso were zzso by flow zzso gene expression analysis was carried out using zzso Low zzso zzso and expression of zzso and zzso family of proteins was assessed by western zzso zzso 

zzso induced zzso in ex zzso myeloma cells and in myeloma cell zzso Death zzso genes were zzso in both zzso and zzso cell lines, which displayed the highest and lowest zzso responses, respectively, following treatment with zzso The largest increase was detected for the death zzso 5 zzso zzso and zzso of both cell lines with zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso was shown to be zzso dependent, with independent zzso of zzso and intrinsic zzso zzso A zzso decrease in expression of zzso preceded zzso of other zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell death in multiple myeloma zzso Thus, zzso represents a promising agent, with a distinct mechanism of action, for the treatment of this zzso
