Treatment of zzso and acquired liver disease is one of the main issues in the field of gene zzso zzso zzso zzso have several potential advantages over alternative zzso We have constructed a zzso zzso zzso zzso that expresses the human zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso is involved in the clearance of zzso zzso in the zzso This zzso is deficient in zzso disease, a zzso inherited disorder in humans characterized by chronic severe zzso zzso high plasma zzso zzso zzso rats suffer from the same zzso and are used as an animal model of this zzso We have treated juvenile zzso rats by single intravenous injection with the zzso zzso Over 1 year after treatment with the highest dose (5 zzso zzso zzso zzso we observed a stable reduction of zzso levels to near normal levels and normal zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso in contrast to zzso zzso In zzso zzso showed expression of the therapeutic gene in more than zzso of liver zzso zzso Thus, we demonstrate stable and complete clinical zzso of a zzso zzso liver disease in an animal model, after systemic administration of a therapeutic zzso zzso
