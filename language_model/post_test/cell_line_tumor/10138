zzso continues to be one of the major causes of mortality from prostate zzso Because human zzso cell lines zzso more readily from zzso sites than from zzso sites, to identify zzso tumor zzso we used zzso imaging to compare the in zzso zzso zzso and zzso characteristics of a human prostate cancer zzso implanted zzso in the prostate or zzso in the zzso zzso was detected in these zzso by placing an enhanced green zzso protein optical reporter under the control of a zzso response zzso A zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso and metabolism provided a characterization of environments that are zzso for zzso to zzso We found that zzso tumors, which zzso more easily, were characterized by higher vascular volume, zzso and total zzso and a more zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso deposits in the zzso zzso as well as cancer cells in zzso fluid were found to be zzso explaining, in part, the zzso nature of zzso zzso These results also provide the basis for clinically zzso zzso imaging markers for predicting zzso risk in prostate zzso
