Recently, we could show that the focal zzso protein zzso zzso is expressed in human prostate zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso In this study we show that zzso enhanced the progression of existing zzso in zzso by breeding transgenic mice with zzso zzso expression and zzso mice zzso zzso of mouse zzso Double transgenic zzso mice showed a significant increase in poorly differentiated zzso and distant zzso as compared with control zzso zzso Additional studies on primary zzso cells generated from both transgenic backgrounds confirmed the connection regarding zzso zzso and increased zzso and zzso of zzso zzso One zzso of zzso invasion was found to be the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso Both in zzso and in zzso experiments revealed that zzso expression zzso zzso with zzso zzso followed by a zzso of zzso zzso of zzso using small interfering zzso zzso resulted in a zzso zzso of zzso whereas strong nuclear zzso of zzso was observed in zzso zzso cells leading to enhanced zzso of the zzso target gene zzso zzso In conclusion, the present results indicate that zzso enhances the progression of zzso through zzso of zzso expression and that zzso could function as a marker for aggressive zzso in the zzso
