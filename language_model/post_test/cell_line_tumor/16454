The E6 proteins from high-risk alpha human zzso zzso types zzso zzso are characterized by the presence of a zzso motif through which they interact with a number of cellular zzso zzso zzso and cooperate in their zzso The ability of these E6 proteins to bind to zzso domain proteins zzso with the zzso potential of the zzso The E6 proteins of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso do not zzso a zzso zzso We found that the zzso domain protein zzso is zzso zzso in primary human zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso The zzso levels of the known zzso E6 zzso protein targets zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not changed by zzso zzso zzso protein levels of zzso were observed in cell extracts from zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso E6 but not in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso E6 also zzso zzso of zzso but with a much lower efficiency than zzso zzso In healthy human skin, zzso expression is localized in zzso zzso zzso In zzso skin cultures, the zzso expression of zzso was absent in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso cell zzso of the skin, zzso was not zzso whereas in zzso cell zzso expression was located in differentiated zzso Short hairpin zzso zzso of zzso led to an zzso of differentiation and an increase in the proliferation capacity in zzso These results identified zzso as the first zzso domain protein controlled by zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso
