zzso 16 zzso zzso zzso is a cell surface zzso that plays a role in promoting cancer cell growth in zzso zzso The aims of this study were to examine zzso 16 expression in a large number of zzso tract zzso and precursors and to determine whether zzso 16 zzso is correlated with patient zzso zzso zzso were constructed using surgical zzso zzso and included pancreatic zzso normal, 29 zzso 200 pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso normal, 104 zzso 95 zzso zzso 35 zzso zzso zzso gastric zzso normal, 8 zzso 119 gastric zzso 62 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso normal, 17 zzso 39 zzso zzso zzso zzso 16 was detected in zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso gastric zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 16 was seen in a subset of the zzso On zzso analysis, zzso zzso 16 in pancreatic zzso zzso was strongly associated with poor survival zzso zzso zzso independent of other prognosis zzso A similar trend was observed for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 16 in zzso zzso was significantly correlated zzso zzso zzso with a better patient outcome, when compared with zzso zzso zzso Using Western zzso analysis, we found zzso 16 expression in 3 of 6 pancreatic zzso zzso and 1 of 2 zzso zzso cell zzso We conclude that most of the zzso tract zzso and a subset of their precursors express zzso zzso zzso 16 expression is an independent predictor of poor outcome in pancreatic zzso zzso and potentially in zzso zzso and gastric zzso We propose that zzso 16 may function as a zzso marker and therapeutic target in the zzso
