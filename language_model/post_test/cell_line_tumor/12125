The primary purpose of this research is to investigate whether exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is associated with induction of zzso oxygen species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell death in human zzso and zzso breast cancer zzso zzso indicated that zzso and zzso induced zzso and zzso increases in zzso response and zzso formation in both zzso and zzso zzso At zzso zzso both zzso and zzso induced decreases in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso cells where zzso cells were more resistant to zzso reduction in zzso zzso than zzso zzso Further investigation indicated that three specific zzso zzso completely blocked zzso decreases in zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso These results imply that decreases in zzso zzso in zzso cells may be, in part, due to depletion of zzso zzso pool zzso by zzso zzso through formation of DNA strand zzso Overall, the extent of zzso response, zzso formation, and zzso zzso generated in zzso and zzso cells was greater for zzso than for zzso In addition, the zzso induced by zzso and zzso in both zzso and zzso cells was completely blocked by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This evidence suggests the involvement of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso the induction of cell death by zzso and zzso Further, antagonism was observed between zzso and zzso for effects on zzso response and zzso formation in zzso and zzso zzso zzso was also observed between zzso and zzso in the induction of zzso depletion at lower concentration zzso zzso in zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso In conclusions, results from our investigation suggest that zzso formation induced by zzso is a significant zzso factor in zzso the DNA damage and cell death in human breast cancer zzso The data also suggests that the status of zzso zzso alpha may play a role in modulating the zzso zzso DNA damage and cell death in human breast cancer zzso
