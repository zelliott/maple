zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso and zzso which is selectively expressed in tumor zzso and on the surface of some tumor zzso Some studies showed that zzso the zzso peptides to zzso drugs yielded compounds with increased efficiency against tumors and lowered toxicity to normal zzso The melanoma zzso zzso gene zzso is a novel zzso gene that exhibits potent zzso activity without damaging normal zzso To enhance the zzso effect, we inserted a zzso zzso into the wild type zzso between zzso and zzso to form a zzso zzso named zzso then expressed zzso in zzso zzso zzso we describe the expression and zzso of zzso We detected the zzso of zzso activity, tumor zzso potent zzso effect, and zzso inducing exploited by zzso in tumor cells, and also compared these zzso with zzso The data showed that zzso had more potent tumor targeting and zzso effects than zzso
