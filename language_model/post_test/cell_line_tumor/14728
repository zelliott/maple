Gene therapy and zzso therapy are two kinds of important therapeutic strategies for treating zzso zzso In order to explore the combined effects of gene therapy and zzso on tumor cells, zzso gene was zzso into the tumor model zzso cells using zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso The zzso zzso cells were then zzso by light from a LED source and the survival rate was investigated 18 h after zzso zzso was analyzed by a flow zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and the active zzso expression was measured using flow zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The result from the flow zzso showed that the level of the activated zzso significantly increased up to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The survival rate 18 h after gene zzso alone and zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso However, the survival rate of the zzso zzso cells 18 h after LED exposure significantly decreased to zzso under the light energy of 4 zzso zzso rate 18 h after the combination of gene zzso and zzso increased up to zzso Our findings demonstrated that zzso could significantly enhance the zzso efficiency of zzso gene in the zzso zzso LED zzso could effectively kill the treated zzso cells and induce zzso suggesting zzso zzso zzso as an efficient gene carrier and a novel zzso The combination of gene therapy and zzso using zzso as a zzso can be developed for treating zzso zzso
