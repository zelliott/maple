Human zzso C virus zzso does not replicate in mouse zzso The underlying mechanisms are largely zzso In this study, we took advantage of a series of direct and unique molecular strategies and dissected the zzso life cycle in human zzso zzso cells and mouse zzso zzso zzso We showed that zzso entry was restricted in zzso cells and was not rescued by expression of human zzso zzso We also showed that zzso zzso replication was impaired in zzso zzso In contrast, we showed that the zzso zzso translation activity and zzso production in zzso cells were either comparable to, or even slightly higher than those in zzso zzso Thus, we conclude that entry and zzso replication are the two major zzso restrictions in mouse zzso These studies provide new insights into zzso interaction with mouse cells and new clues for zzso strategies for development of zzso mouse zzso
