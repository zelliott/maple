zzso a toxic zzso with major health concerns, elicits zzso of heat shock protein 70 zzso in rat zzso zzso cells, together with evidence of detachment of viable cells from the growth zzso 

To determine if this cell detachment was linked to zzso and the impact of this on measurement of zzso zzso 

zzso cells were exposed to sodium zzso and detached and attached cells were taken for assessment of cell zzso zzso of zzso and expression of zzso 

Exposure to sodium zzso led to loss of viable cells from the zzso associated with zzso in zzso but not zzso zzso zzso of zzso of a similar magnitude was demonstrated in both cell zzso Exposure of cells to cadmium zzso a toxic metal, also of major environmental concern and believed to act by an zzso stress zzso produced very little release of viable cells from the culture zzso was not associated with zzso but did elicit a modest zzso of zzso in both cell zzso 

Exposure of zzso cells to sodium zzso elicits zzso a form of zzso zzso and assessment of the level of zzso zzso in such cells should take account of the detached cell zzso Further, the data suggest that this phenomenon is selective to sodium zzso rather than to another toxic element that shares a similar mechanism of zzso
