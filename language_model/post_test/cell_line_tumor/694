zzso in pediatric brain tumor growth is thought to be the net result of signaling through various protein zzso networks driving cell zzso Defining new targets for treatment of human zzso without a zzso knowledge on zzso cell signaling activity, remains zzso zzso Here, we introduce zzso profiling using zzso zzso zzso as a new concept for target zzso Comprehensive zzso zzso activity profiles were identified in 29 pediatric brain tumors using the zzso zzso profiling zzso Previously reported activity of zzso growth factor zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso in pediatric brain tumors could be appreciated in our array zzso zzso corresponding with zzso consensus sequences for zzso family zzso showed remarkably high levels of zzso compared with normal tissue zzso zzso activity was confirmed applying zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso family zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced substantial tumor cell death in nine pediatric brain tumor cell lines but not in control cell zzso Thus, this study describes a new zzso technique to generate clinically relevant zzso zzso activity profiles as has been shown here for pediatric brain zzso In the era of a rapidly increasing number of zzso zzso this approach will enable us to rapidly identify new potential targets in a broad range of human zzso
