Type 2 diabetes is a zzso disorder characterized by the inability of zzso to zzso enough insulin to maintain zzso zzso zzso cells zzso insulin in response to zzso and other zzso but high passage zzso zzso cells lose their ability to zzso insulin in response to zzso We hypothesized that metabolism of zzso and lipids were defective in zzso zzso cells causing impaired zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso cells had no first phase and impaired second phase zzso indicative of global functional zzso This was coupled with a markedly reduced zzso content at zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were higher at zzso zzso but zzso content failed to increase with zzso zzso zzso cells had decreased zzso zzso zzso This was accompanied by reduced expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells represent an important model of beta cells which, as passage numbers increased lost first phase but retained partial second phase zzso similar to patients early in type 2 diabetes zzso We believe a number of gene expression changes occurred to produce this zzso with emphasis on zzso and zzso two genes that have been implicated in maintenance of zzso zzso
