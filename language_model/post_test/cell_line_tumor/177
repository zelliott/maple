To study the expression and clinical significance of zzso zzso domain zzso in cervical cancer and the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor on the proliferation and zzso of cervical cancer cell zzso 

Western zzso was used to detect the expression of zzso in the zzso of 40 cervical zzso and 21 normal zzso and its relationship with clinical features of cervical cancer was also zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cervical cells was determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell cycles and zzso and index of proliferation were detected by flow zzso zzso The expression of zzso in zzso and zzso cells incubated with zzso was detected by western zzso 

The expression level of zzso in cervical zzso was significantly higher than that of normal cervical zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso expression was higher in cervical zzso with high grade, zzso zzso involvement and zzso invasion than that with zzso grade zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso without zzso zzso involvement zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso and no zzso invasion zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso respectively (all P zzso zzso The expression of zzso in cervical zzso was higher than that of zzso cell cancer zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso After zzso and zzso cells were incubated with zzso zzso expression was significantly lower than that in control zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso inhibited the proliferation and prompted the zzso of zzso and zzso cells was depended on its zzso and zzso 

zzso may play a key role in the occurrence and progress of cervical zzso The mechanism of zzso inhibited the proliferation and prompted the zzso of zzso and zzso cells may be due to decreased the formation of zzso
