Vitamin D from the diet or zzso in the skin upon zzso zzso is converted in the zzso into the active zzso zzso zzso D 3 zzso zzso 3, zzso a zzso hormone with wide regulatory zzso The classical model of zzso action implies the zzso of the vitamin D zzso which binds specific DNA sequences in its target genes and zzso their zzso zzso We have recently shown that zzso zzso 3 zzso the expression of the zzso gene coding for a zzso zzso that is involved in zzso zzso zzso mediates the effects of zzso zzso 3 on a subset of target genes and affects the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso Novel data indicate that zzso zzso 3 has an unanticipated wide regulatory action on the expression of genes coding for zzso zzso of the zzso C zzso domain and zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso decreases the expression of zzso and zzso two zzso targeting zzso zzso This may explain the zzso of this zzso factor found in zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso 3 exerts an ample regulatory effect on the expression of zzso zzso involved in zzso regulation that may mediate its actions on gene zzso and cell zzso
