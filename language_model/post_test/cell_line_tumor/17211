With the aim of discovering potent and selective zzso zzso zzso we zzso and evaluated a series of zzso based zzso zzso with additional zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso As a result of this effort, we found that replacement of the zzso zzso with zzso resulted in the discovery of a series of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso endowed with improved zzso and/or cellular activity relative to zzso When zzso to zzso rats orally at zzso zzso achieved zzso higher liver and plasma exposure in comparison to that detected with zzso
