zzso imaging enables zzso monitoring of tumor growth, zzso and drug treatment response, and it has become an important tool to promote biological studies in recent zzso In this study, we zzso evaluated the in zzso zzso and zzso effects of zzso on liver cancer based on the optical molecular imaging systems including zzso zzso zzso zzso molecular imaging zzso and zzso molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and green fluorescent protein zzso dual labeled human zzso zzso cells zzso zzso were used to establish the subcutaneous and zzso liver tumor zzso After the tumor cells were implanted zzso days, zzso (5 zzso was administered through an intravenous tail vein injection for continuous 14 zzso The computer zzso zzso zzso and zzso were carried out for the subcutaneous tumor zzso zzso was executed for the zzso tumor zzso The zzso data showed that tumor vessel formation and the zzso zzso of subcutaneous tumor in the zzso treatment group was significantly inhibited compared to the control zzso The zzso data exhibited the obvious tumor zzso day 8 zzso The zzso detected the tumor suppression effects of zzso as early as day 4 zzso and measured the tumor zzso The above data confirmed the effects of zzso on zzso and tumor suppression on liver zzso Our system combined zzso zzso and zzso to offer more comprehensive information about the effects of zzso on the suppression of vessel and tumor zzso zzso molecular imaging system enabled the zzso and reliable assessment of zzso drug efficacy on liver zzso
