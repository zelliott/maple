zzso 4 and 5, and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso were designed by structural modification of lead compound zzso These compounds were tested on six tumor cell lines to determine the role of the zzso ring and the zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso Our results show that 4 and 5 have dramatically reduced zzso due to the loss of the zzso zzso of lead compound zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation of almost all cancer cell lines tested, even though they lack the zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was selectively zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso relationship zzso studies with these compounds revealed the importance of the zzso zzso zzso on the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso were obtained in good yields by a zzso zzso reaction carried out under zzso zzso using commercially available zzso zzso zzso or zzso acids and zzso zzso
