zzso cancer is not only a major public health and economically burden for the patients but also a major clinical impact for Thai zzso The zzso aim was to study the zzso effect of zzso zzso one of the cheap, safe and widely used zzso in zzso on the human zzso cancer zzso 

zzso of zzso at various zzso on the growth, zzso migration, and invasion of the human zzso cancer cell line were assessed in zzso 

zzso at the zzso of 5, 10, 20 and 30 zzso could directly and significantly inhibit the growth, zzso migration, and invasion of the human zzso cancer cells in a zzso manner The 50% zzso concentration zzso value for cell viability was zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso effects on migration, invasion and zzso properties of the cancer cells were dramatically observed at the zzso of zzso or zzso 10, zzso or zzso 20 and zzso or zzso 30 zzso zzso 

zzso has an zzso effect on the human zzso cancer cells by zzso their growth, zzso migration, and invasion zzso This implies the high possibility that the zzso may apply the results to use it zzso before, during and after the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in addition to its conventional usage by oral and zzso zzso
