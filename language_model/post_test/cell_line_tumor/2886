The zzso family is important in modulating sensitivity to zzso drugs in many zzso including zzso The zzso zzso zzso is a potent small zzso inhibitor of the zzso proteins zzso In this report, we examined whether zzso is effective in killing melanoma cells in combination with the zzso inhibitor zzso and further evaluated the mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso and zzso V zzso zzso showed that zzso alone exhibited little zzso yet it displayed strong synergistic zzso when combined with zzso In addition, the detection of zzso zzso indicated that the combination treatment zzso induced zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis revealed that this combination treatment induced expression of the zzso protein zzso and zzso degradation of the zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso of zzso expression significantly increased sensitivity to zzso in these cells, and knocking down zzso expression protected the cells from zzso induced by the combination zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso combined with zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso In zzso this study indicates promising therapeutic potential of targeting zzso zzso family members in treating melanoma, and it zzso rational molecular approaches that target zzso defenses when developing cancer zzso
