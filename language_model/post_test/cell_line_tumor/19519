zzso therapy zzso is a new treatment choice for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso developed in zzso This study was to investigate the zzso effect of zzso zzso on human zzso zzso cancer cell line zzso 

After an incubation with 30 zzso zzso for different time, the fluorescent image and zzso location of zzso in zzso cells were observed under a fluorescent microscope and laser scanning zzso microscope zzso After being treated with different doses zzso zzso of zzso and zzso with different optical doses zzso zzso of laser, the survival rate of zzso cells was measured by zzso zzso zzso of cell death during zzso was determined by zzso zzso double zzso technique and analyzed by flow zzso 

Red zzso appeared shortly after administration of zzso and localized in zzso zzso zzso intensity reached the peak after 3 zzso High zzso of zzso alone had zzso to zzso cells, while laser zzso alone had no effect on cell zzso Survival rate of zzso cells was gradually decreased along with the increase of zzso concentration and laser dose, but such a trend diminished when zzso concentration reached 40 zzso After treatment of zzso the dead cells were predominantly necrosis zzso 

zzso has a zzso effect on zzso zzso
