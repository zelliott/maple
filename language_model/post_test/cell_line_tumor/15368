The majority of zzso melanoma cell types are able to produce zzso and the degree of zzso synthesis in various types of cultured cell line zzso In this study, we evaluated three types of cultured cell line, zzso zzso and zzso with differing zzso production zzso The level was greatest in the zzso cells, lower in the zzso cells and lowest in the zzso zzso In addition, a positive correlation between zzso production and zzso activity was zzso The molecular masses of zzso from zzso and zzso cells were marginally lower than those from zzso zzso zzso inhibitor treatment on zzso cells caused decreases in the molecular mass of zzso its activity and zzso zzso An zzso zzso using zzso indicated that the immature zzso zzso were associated with a type of zzso zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso was also detected in zzso and zzso zzso The results indicated that the immature zzso of zzso has a critical effect on the zzso ability of melanoma zzso
