It has been suggested that zzso T cells specifically traffic to the tumor site, where they effect tumor zzso To test whether zzso zzso T cells specifically home to zzso we assessed the trafficking of zzso zzso cells to large, zzso tumors that express or do not express the target zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso T cells with zzso and vaccination with an altered zzso zzso caused zzso of zzso tumors zzso but not zzso tumors zzso zzso implanted on opposing zzso of the same zzso Surprisingly, we found approximately equal and very large numbers of zzso T cells zzso of all zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso We also found evidence of massive zzso and proliferation of activated zzso zzso cells in a variety of peripheral zzso including zzso zzso liver, zzso and zzso but not peripheral zzso Most importantly, evidence for T cell function, as measured by production of zzso release of zzso and zzso of zzso in target cells, was confined to zzso zzso We thus conclude that zzso T zzso destruction of tumor is the result of specific T cell triggering at the tumor zzso The ability to induce ubiquitous zzso and specific tumor destruction may be important in the case of zzso zzso tumor zzso
