zzso D1 is an important cell cycle regulatory zzso which is a functional target of zzso in the regulation of cell growth of prostate cancer zzso But the zzso of these two factors interacting with each other is zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso were treated with zzso inhibitor zzso zzso level of zzso zzso D1 and other protein was examined by Western zzso 

zzso doses of zzso expressing human zzso were added to zzso cells zzso but there were no significantly difference on expressions of zzso and zzso zzso We found that the protein expressions of zzso D1 zzso were all reduced through high expression of zzso which is zzso However, there is no change for zzso D1 zzso expression in zzso with zzso zzso zzso The protein expression of zzso D1 were all reduced three days after infection by adding zzso expressing human zzso to zzso carrying zzso zzso zzso compared to negative control, which is zzso However, there is no change for zzso D1 expression in zzso with zzso zzso treated by zzso 

We found that forced expression of zzso inhibited proliferation of prostate cancer cells through zzso of zzso D1 zzso And zzso regulates zzso D1 expression by zzso zzso in zzso zzso
