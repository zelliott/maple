zzso has zzso activity in a broad spectrum of human cancer zzso However, the therapeutic effect of the zzso human zzso protein on human gallbladder zzso has rarely been zzso In this study, we used a human gallbladder zzso cell line zzso to explore the effect of zzso zzso zzso gene therapy on zzso zzso We show that zzso treatment of zzso cells in zzso conspicuously induced zzso of zzso zzso We also demonstrate that the in zzso treatment of zzso zzso zzso nude mice zzso injected with zzso significantly suppressed zzso zzso To further explore the mechanism that zzso zzso in tumor cell zzso we examined molecules and pathways involved in zzso regulation and found that zzso induced the zzso of zzso gene zzso and the release of zzso zzso which subsequently activated zzso zzso and zzso to induce zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exerted potent zzso activity via stimulating zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso has the potential to serve as a tool for targeted gene therapy in the treatment of gallbladder zzso
