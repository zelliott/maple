DNA zzso zzso zzso is a major mechanism for repairing DNA zzso zzso breaks in zzso zzso Here, we characterize the interaction between two key components of the zzso machinery, the zzso zzso and the DNA zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso interacts with DNA zzso IV via its tandem zzso domain and that this interaction is enhanced in the presence of zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of DNA zzso IV encompassing the first zzso motif are necessary for zzso We show that zzso needs to be in its zzso form to bind DNA zzso IV and that the zzso tail of zzso which mediates binding to zzso is zzso for DNA zzso IV zzso Although the interaction between zzso and DNA zzso zzso occurs in the absence of zzso the presence of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso enhances complex zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso zzso activity causes zzso of zzso from zzso at the DNA zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso activity also results in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso our findings provide novel information on the zzso interactions that regulate zzso in zzso
