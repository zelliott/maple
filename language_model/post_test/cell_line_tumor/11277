Fourteen zzso zzso with different zzso at the zzso position were zzso through zzso reactions by using zzso or zzso acid as zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the synthesis of such a class of compounds based on zzso reactions zzso by zzso organic zzso The potential to zzso zzso zzso species zzso and the ability to inhibit cancer cell growth were then zzso Among the zzso compounds, zzso 15 was the most promising free radical scavenger, while zzso 20 was shown to have a wider spectrum of action on the cancer cells zzso These results highlight zzso zzso as lead compounds for obtaining new free radical zzso and zzso zzso
