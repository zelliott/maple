zzso growth factor zzso nuclear protein 1 zzso is a novel zzso which is localized at zzso zzso where frequent abnormalities in zzso cell leukemia zzso zzso The present study investigated the effects of zzso zzso or zzso on the viability and gene expression of various tumor cell zzso zzso was designed to knock down zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and western zzso were performed to assess gene zzso the cell counting zzso zzso zzso was used to detect cell zzso and zzso and flow zzso zzso were used to determine gene zzso zzso was widely expressed in various cell zzso In addition, zzso zzso was able to knock down zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly promoted tumor cell zzso which may be associated with the zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso promoted a number of cell lines to the S phase of the cell zzso zzso promotes cell proliferation and significantly reduces zzso and zzso zzso
