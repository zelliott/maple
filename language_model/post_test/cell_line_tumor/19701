zzso cancer almost exclusively zzso to skeletal sites, indicating that the bone provides a favorable zzso for its zzso and zzso A natural yet zzso factor in bone that could facilitate tumor zzso is elevated zzso calcium zzso The present study found that elevated zzso zzso zzso enhanced proliferation of skeletal zzso prostate cell lines zzso and zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso prostate cell line zzso The zzso effect of elevated zzso was associated with higher expression of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso that is the zzso zzso sensor for zzso zzso of the zzso via zzso interference reduced cell proliferation in zzso and zzso progression in zzso zzso signaling in zzso cells was evaluated by measuring the elevated zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso induced by either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso stabilized expression of zzso zzso a protein required for cell cycle zzso Furthermore, elevated zzso triggered zzso of the zzso signaling zzso and enhanced zzso cell zzso Both zzso toxin (a zzso zzso and zzso (an inhibitor of zzso zzso reduced cell zzso These data suggest that elevated zzso following increased bone zzso could facilitate zzso zzso of prostate cancer via the zzso and the zzso signaling zzso Taken together, zzso is a candidate zzso of prostate cancer bone zzso
