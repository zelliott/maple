zzso cancer cells increase zzso consumption and metabolism via zzso producing large quantities of zzso Recent work has shown that zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso which are composed of a zzso unit zzso and an accessory zzso zzso zzso the functional zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in zzso cancer zzso Because zzso zzso is a hallmark of zzso cancer, we examined whether increases in zzso expression were linked to zzso expression in zzso a highly zzso breast cancer cell zzso zzso zzso and protein expression were increased in zzso cells compared with cells derived from normal zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso in the plasma membrane and in membrane zzso shed from the cell zzso Small interfering zzso zzso of zzso impaired the maturation and trafficking of zzso to the cell surface, resulting in zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso also resulted in fewer membrane zzso and decreased migration of zzso cells in zzso zzso of zzso resulted in loss of zzso in the plasma membrane and zzso of the zzso in zzso These studies establish for the first time that increased expression of zzso in zzso cancer cells is coupled to the zzso of zzso The synergistic activities of the zzso complex could facilitate migration of tumor cells by zzso zzso induction and zzso zzso and zzso zzso These data provide a molecular link between two hallmarks of zzso zzso the zzso switch and increased expression of zzso
