zzso D zzso gene expression is increased in several neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease zzso and multiple zzso We previously showed that transgenic mice that zzso human zzso show a better resistance against zzso or zzso zzso zzso Here, we identified several nuclear factors from the zzso of control and zzso mice which bind a zzso of the zzso zzso promoter in zzso Of interest, we detected zzso E zzso Human zzso consists of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso representing a greater and a lower risk for zzso zzso zzso Our results show that zzso is located in the nucleus and on the zzso promoter in human zzso and zzso cells zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso significantly inhibited the zzso promoter activity in zzso cells zzso zzso cultured under normal or different stress conditions while zzso zzso by zzso had a converse zzso zzso with these results, we also demonstrated by zzso zzso that zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso bind the zzso zzso Moreover, using the Allen Brain zzso in zzso zzso database, we observed an inverse correlation between zzso and zzso zzso expression during development and in several regions of the mouse brain, notably in the cortex, zzso zzso zzso and zzso This negative correlation was also observed for zzso layers zzso based on a new zzso zzso of the Mouse zzso zzso These findings reveal a new function for zzso by regulating zzso gene zzso
