Abstract Human zzso zzso repeats zzso differentiation zzso and tissue breakdown during the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso steroid hormones regulates these sequential zzso zzso zzso While zzso replacement therapy is adopted for zzso dysfunction of zzso including zzso impairment of zzso no obvious effective results are zzso zzso zzso zzso regulated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in gene zzso zzso in cells cultured with zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of only about zzso of expressed genes is changed twofold or more compared with zzso control zzso Numerous previous works have demonstrated that zzso affect cell zzso in a variety of types of zzso To date, several zzso are in phase I or phase II clinical trials as zzso zzso However, no reports have been found that zzso is useful for zzso in human zzso Recently, we reported that zzso could induce the expression of differentiation marker zzso zzso change and functional zzso in both human zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this review, we zzso the effect of zzso against the human zzso zzso indicating the possibility that zzso can be used not only as an zzso drug, but also as a zzso zzso based on a new zzso
