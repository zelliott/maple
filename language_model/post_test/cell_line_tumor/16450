zzso zzso innate zzso defense by blocking induction of type I zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso was shown to block zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso regulatory factor 3 zzso in response to virus zzso Here, we sought to identify cellular factors involved in innate zzso signaling targeted by zzso zzso zzso with previous studies, infection with the zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso prevented zzso of zzso in response to infection with zzso virus, a strong zzso of the zzso zzso gene I zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso of innate zzso zzso Using a combination of zzso and zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso associates with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but that, rather unexpectedly, zzso zzso did not bind to the closely related zzso zzso 1 zzso The zzso interaction was highly zzso among zzso from different zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso with zzso but not with zzso located on the outer membrane of zzso zzso zzso bound the zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso and blocked its zzso activity and its ability to zzso zzso without undergoing zzso Together, our data identify zzso as a novel target of zzso zzso zzso of zzso seems to zzso zzso in an inactive zzso Considering the important functions of zzso in innate zzso immunity and other cellular zzso the zzso interaction likely plays a crucial role in zzso zzso
