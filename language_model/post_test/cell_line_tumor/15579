The problems addressed here comprised zzso possible differences in zzso properties of strongly versus zzso zzso rat prostate cancer cells, with zzso and zzso as examples, zzso zzso quantitative description of the responses of the zzso cells to direct current zzso electric fields zzso of zzso strength zzso zzso and zzso zzso and time dependency of the zzso responses to the zzso These issues were studied by application of statistical and zzso analyses of the zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso cells responded strongly to the applied zzso by zzso towards the zzso On the other hand, the zzso response of the zzso cells was weak and towards the zzso Further studies of the zzso cell zzso in zzso of increasing strength showed that their response consisted of two zzso zzso zzso fields zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of the zzso zzso without the cells showing a clear tendency to move along the applied zzso zzso fields zzso zzso made the zzso movement oriented with respect to the direction of the applied field, without further changing the zzso zzso The results also showed that the cells do not perform a directed movement zzso after switching on a zzso of 3 zzso approximately 30 zzso lapsed before the cells were able to fully follow the direction of the applied zzso zzso zzso bases and zzso significance of the results obtained are zzso
