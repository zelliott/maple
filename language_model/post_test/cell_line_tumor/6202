zzso zzso are small zzso zzso that take part in diverse biological processes by suppressing target gene zzso zzso expression of zzso has been reported in many types of human zzso zzso is a standard zzso treatment for patients with zzso However, the resistance of zzso cells to radiation limits the success of this zzso In this study, we found that zzso expression was zzso in response to zzso radiation zzso in zzso cells, which suggested that zzso could be involved in the response of zzso cells to zzso We showed that a zzso inhibitor enhanced zzso zzso cell growth arrest and increased the level of zzso which was probably caused by zzso of the zzso arrest induced by zzso Further research demonstrated that the zzso inhibitor induced the zzso of zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso inhibitor can increase zzso growth arrest and zzso in zzso zzso cells, at least in part by zzso zzso arrest, and that zzso is a potential target of zzso
