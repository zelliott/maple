zzso zzso B virus zzso infection is a major cause of chronic liver diseases, which frequently results in zzso zzso fibrosis, and ultimately zzso zzso zzso Recent studies have shown the zzso of zzso signaling in zzso Here, we provide zzso that zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso increases the protein stability of zzso zzso which are key zzso factors of the zzso signaling pathway, and nucleus zzso of zzso through direct protein interaction of zzso and zzso This functional zzso of zzso protein by zzso increases the zzso zzso gene zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso infection might induce zzso zzso by modulating zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso
