The human zzso zzso zzso is one of the most common zzso tumors zzso The mechanisms of liver cell zzso transformation are still zzso The zzso zzso are identified in up to zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso suggesting a potential role of zzso in the zzso of liver zzso To define the biological role of the stabilized zzso in liver cell growth and zzso we examined the effect of zzso zzso on an immortalized zzso zzso cell line, zzso A cell line that zzso expresses zzso zzso was zzso The cell zzso zzso and cell transformation of this cell line were zzso Our data indicate that the stabilized zzso enhances zzso zzso suppresses zzso zzso cell zzso and causes weak zzso cell zzso The stabilized zzso cells did not develop tumor in zzso zzso The target zzso zzso and zzso zzso were activated by zzso in the zzso Our study suggests that zzso zzso can promote cell proliferation and cell survival ability, but the stabilized zzso alone is insufficient for completely zzso zzso
