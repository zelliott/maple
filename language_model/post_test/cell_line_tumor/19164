Because zzso complex and zzso function are zzso we hypothesized zzso would influence zzso zzso We addressed this in zzso by studying the effects of chronic and acute zzso zzso on zzso zzso For acute exposure experiments, zzso were isolated from zzso cells and zzso for electron transport chain zzso zzso function and zzso production in buffers containing up to zzso zzso For chronic exposure experiments, zzso cells were maintained for at least two weeks in medium containing up to zzso zzso following which we zzso cells or their zzso for zzso zzso activities, zzso zzso protein levels, zzso stress, calcium levels, and zzso DNA zzso The ability of the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso to modify zzso zzso effects was zzso Acute and chronic zzso similarly affected complex I zzso at high zzso and IV zzso at high zzso zzso zzso zzso did not alter the effects of chronic zzso exposure on zzso zzso and complex zzso We detected a lower zzso zzso production rate with acute exposure, and an increased zzso zzso production rate with chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso affect zzso some of these effects are directly zzso and acute and chronic effects may zzso
