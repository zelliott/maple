zzso zzso is frequently attributed to oral zzso Although the zzso mechanisms are not well zzso interaction between zzso and zzso is thought to be important for zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso zzso were characterized following interaction with zzso zzso zzso Exposure of zzso to zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of the zzso cell zzso markers zzso zzso zzso and zzso while zzso markers zzso and zzso which are typically present at low levels in mature zzso were zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso was zzso for DC differentiation in the absence of released zzso Furthermore, neither the filtered culture medium of zzso zzso nor the zzso zzso deficient in zzso zzso activity, was able to induce the differentiation of zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso rapidly undergo zzso differentiation through interaction with the bacterial surface zzso zzso and that this response may be the initial step in zzso zzso by oral zzso
