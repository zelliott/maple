Details about the parameters of kinetic systems are crucial for progress in both medical and industrial research, including drug development, clinical diagnosis and biotechnology zzso Such details must be collected by a series of kinetic experiments and zzso The correct design of the experiment is essential to collecting data suitable for analysis, zzso and zzso the correct zzso We have developed a systematic and zzso zzso method and sets of rules for the design of zzso kinetic zzso Our method selects the optimum design to collect data suitable for accurate zzso and analysis and zzso the error in the parameters zzso The rules select features of the design such as the zzso range and the number of zzso We show here that this method can be directly applied to the study of other important kinetic systems, including drug zzso zzso zzso microbial culture and cell transport zzso It is possible to reduce the errors in the estimated parameters and, most importantly, increase the efficiency and zzso by reducing the necessary amount of experiments and data points zzso
