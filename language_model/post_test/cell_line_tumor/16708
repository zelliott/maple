The complexity of zzso actions mainly relies to the presence of different identified receptors zzso zzso their zzso and zzso and their discrete cellular zzso Depending on the zzso of the zzso that mediates zzso effects, nuclear and zzso actions have been zzso The latter can trigger a number of signaling events leading also to zzso zzso In an attempt to clarify the nature of the zzso involved in the membrane initiated effect of zzso on gene zzso we performed a whole zzso analysis of breast cancer cell lines with different zzso profiles zzso zzso zzso zzso A pharmacological approach was conducted with the use of zzso zzso or zzso zzso in the absence or presence of a specific zzso or zzso zzso Our results clearly show that in addition to the zzso zzso and/or zzso that mainly mediate the zzso effect of zzso there is a specific zzso signature zzso in zzso and zzso zzso suggesting the presence of an unidentified membrane zzso element zzso Analysis of its signature and zzso zzso revealed that important cell function such as zzso zzso regulation, and growth factor signaling are associated with zzso
