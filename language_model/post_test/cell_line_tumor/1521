The zzso tumor 1 zzso zzso zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso and promotes their zzso zzso However, little is known about the molecular allies that help it mediate its zzso functions in zzso zzso 

The authors used short interfering zzso zzso to suppress zzso expression in zzso zzso cells and evaluated the effect of this on zzso cell zzso Gene expression analysis was then used to identify the candidate genes that were altered as a result of zzso zzso One candidate target, zzso was then selected for further investigation into its role by suppressing its expression using zzso zzso followed by proliferation and invasion zzso 

zzso levels were reliably and zzso suppressed by zzso zzso This resulted in a significant decrease in cellular zzso zzso analyses identified the gene products that were consistently zzso zzso and zzso (11) with zzso zzso Of these, zzso expression was consistently suppressed across the 3 different zzso cell lines studied and was found on further investigation to significantly impact zzso cell zzso 

Although zzso expression in zzso has not been described zzso we conclude that the possible zzso of zzso zzso by zzso promotes cellular zzso of the most characteristic and challenging aspects of zzso tumor zzso Further studies are needed to clarify the nature of this regulation and its impact, as zzso could represent a novel target for zzso zzso
