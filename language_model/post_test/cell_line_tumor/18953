Resistance to zzso is a hallmark of cancer zzso We report here that zzso a zzso component of zzso zzso zzso is required for protection of multiple types of cancer cells from zzso Furthermore, using zzso zzso cells as a model system, we have investigated the signaling zzso through which zzso contributes to zzso zzso Loss of zzso markedly increases the level of zzso and promotes zzso zzso to zzso resulting in zzso of the intrinsic zzso zzso zzso of zzso completely blocked zzso induced by the loss of zzso Thus, zzso contributes to zzso resistance through suppression of zzso zzso zzso suppresses zzso not only zzso but also zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso of zzso family zzso and zzso zzso with this, zzso zzso zzso of zzso a key signal for turnover of zzso is suppressed by the removal of zzso Our results demonstrate a strong dependence of multiple types of zzso cancer cells on zzso and provide new insights into the molecular mechanism by which cancer cells are protected from zzso
