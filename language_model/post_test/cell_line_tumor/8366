Given that zzso is zzso expressed in zzso and mature zzso and external zzso cells of zzso are thought to be zzso of zzso we investigated if zzso played a role in the development of zzso zzso expression analysis of 29 zzso demonstrated significant zzso of zzso in 21 zzso tumors by at least zzso with 11 of them exhibiting greater than zzso reduced level compared to normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso inhibited cell zzso Using zzso and expression zzso zzso carrier family 16, member 1 zzso was identified as a candidate target of zzso zzso of zzso resulted in zzso of zzso at both transcript and protein zzso zzso zzso with 3' untranslated region of zzso cloned downstream of the zzso gene showed reduced zzso activity in the presence of zzso providing strong evidence that zzso is a direct regulator of zzso zzso analysis further revealed that zzso transcript was elevated in 26 zzso of 29 tumors zzso zzso of zzso by zzso induced cell death in zzso zzso zzso functions to zzso zzso acid during zzso zzso We speculated that zzso of zzso function resulted in a decrease of zzso pH to a lethal zzso In conclusion, our study demonstrates that zzso deregulation is common in zzso and restoration of its function zzso cell zzso suggesting that zzso may act as a growth zzso Our findings also raise the possibility that the zzso zzso may represent a novel therapeutic target for treatment of zzso zzso
