Survival of zzso in the environment depends on their ability to recognize and eliminate potential zzso This work is aimed to compare the innate defense mechanisms of two closely related earthworm species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso that inhabit substantially different ecological zzso While zzso zzso lives in a zzso and manure, zzso zzso can be found in the litter layer in zzso zzso the influence of zzso zzso on the immune response of both species was zzso zzso a reliable method to discern between zzso zzso and zzso zzso based on zzso zzso for zzso c zzso I zzso and stringent zzso conditions was zzso zzso to analyze the zzso profile in both earthworm species, the activity and expression of zzso pattern recognition protein zzso and zzso proteins with zzso function, zzso and zzso have been zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed only slight differences in the expression and activity, zzso expression as well as the zzso activity was considerably higher in zzso zzso as compared to zzso zzso The expression of zzso in zzso zzso was not affected upon the challenge with zzso zzso suggesting more substantial changes in the regulation of the gene zzso zzso DNA analyses revealed significantly higher level of zzso zzso using universal primer zzso in zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso It can be hypothesized that zzso zzso colonizing zzso as a new habitat acquired an evolutionary selection advantage resulting in a higher expression of zzso zzso
