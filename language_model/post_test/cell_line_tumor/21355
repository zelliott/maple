zzso zzso is commonly used in the diagnosis and evaluation of zzso stroke because of the rapid decrease observed in the apparent diffusion zzso zzso of tissue water following zzso Although this observation has been clinically useful for many years, the zzso mechanisms underlying the reduction of tissue zzso are still zzso To help zzso these mechanisms, we have employed a novel three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell culture system that enables cells to be grown to high density and studied via zzso and zzso By zzso contrast media into the zzso signals from zzso water and zzso water are zzso resolved and can be investigated zzso zzso zzso carried out on zzso zzso zzso cell cultures indicate that zzso cellular swelling results in an increase in the zzso of zzso water from zzso zzso to approximately zzso zzso zzso time zzso 25 zzso
