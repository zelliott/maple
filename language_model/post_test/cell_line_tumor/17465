zzso is a zzso tumor consisting of N zzso and S zzso zzso We report that more zzso and zzso N cells express higher levels of zzso zzso zzso than less zzso more adherent S zzso zzso one of the two major zzso partners of zzso is equally expressed in N and S cell zzso zzso treatment zzso zzso in N cells, but only zzso activates zzso in S zzso zzso of the second partner, insulin zzso zzso zzso is cell type zzso S cells exclusively express zzso that zzso sustained zzso by zzso In contrast, N cells express zzso that is zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso treatment results in strong zzso of zzso and zzso in N cells and zzso of both pathways is required for zzso zzso Only zzso zzso of zzso zzso is required for tumor edge zzso in N and S cells, with stimulation of focal zzso zzso zzso and zzso This detailed understanding of the zzso zzso of N and S cells provides the background needed to target and disrupt specific zzso signaling pathways in an attempt to develop more effective zzso
