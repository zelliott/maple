zzso is a synthetic small zzso compound zzso against human cancer cells and active zzso the lifespan of leukemia zzso In the present study, we further investigated the mechanisms of its zzso action and found that zzso inhibited zzso zzso through interacting with the zzso binding sites on zzso disrupted zzso arrangement and caused cell cycle arrest at zzso phase in cancer zzso zzso also inhibited the zzso zzso of cancer cells and showed zzso against human cervical cancer cells of zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation and migration of zzso and disrupted the zzso zzso tube zzso in zzso and rat zzso ring zzso Given orally, zzso inhibited zzso in zzso implanted zzso plugs in zzso zzso its zzso values against the zzso cell zzso were approximately zzso lower than those against the cancer zzso It was found orally zzso in mice and showed a good oral zzso zzso in zzso zzso permeated through the human zzso zzso cell zzso suggesting oral availability in zzso zzso absorbed zzso distributed readily into the zzso zzso tumors in nude mice in which the tumor tissue levels of zzso were found oral zzso zzso showed in zzso activities against human zzso zzso and zzso tumors in nude zzso Most interestingly, the combination of zzso plus zzso zzso prolonged the zzso of mice zzso with zzso leukemia zzso Thus, zzso is a novel orally active zzso zzso agent with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
