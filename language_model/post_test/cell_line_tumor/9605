zzso a class of membrane zzso are major players in zzso the mechanical force across the plasma zzso We previously reported that zzso of zzso zzso zzso imposed a growth zzso effect on the zzso zzso cell line zzso through zzso zzso of zzso zzso In this study, we further determined the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso expression induced by zzso zzso zzso We report zzso that zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso through a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso activates the zzso promoter through the zzso sites and makes more zzso factor zzso recruited to the zzso zzso promoter zzso In addition, it makes the zzso value of zzso proteins increased across some parts of the zzso zzso especially in the promoter zzso The zzso zzso zzso which possesses intrinsic zzso zzso was found to be involved in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso these findings presented the mechanisms by which zzso zzso induced the elevated zzso expression in zzso cancer zzso
