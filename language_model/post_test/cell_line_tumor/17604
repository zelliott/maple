Human tissue factor zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso inhibitor that zzso the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso involved in tumor zzso invasion, and zzso To directly assess its role in tumor growth and zzso in zzso we zzso zzso zzso zzso cells expressing either fully active zzso human zzso zzso or inactive zzso zzso zzso and examined their ability to form tumors and zzso in zzso mice in comparison to zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso tumors grew 2 to 3 times larger than zzso zzso zzso zzso was confined to the lung and was observed in zzso of mice treated with either zzso or zzso cells, whereas only zzso of mice treated with zzso cells developed lung zzso zzso quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso analyses of each tumor group revealed 3- to zzso lower levels of zzso vascular zzso growth factor gene expression in zzso tumors in relation to either zzso or zzso zzso Comparative tumor gene expression analysis revealed that several human genes implicated in zzso invasion, zzso zzso and zzso had significantly altered levels of expression in zzso zzso Our collective data demonstrate that zzso of zzso zzso by a highly zzso tumor cell markedly zzso its growth and zzso in zzso by regulating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
