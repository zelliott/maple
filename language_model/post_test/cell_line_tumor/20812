Breast cancer resistance to the zzso tamoxifen zzso and zzso is accompanied by zzso in both zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso effective zzso of both pathways may be necessary to block proliferation of zzso breast cancer zzso In this study, we examined the effects of zzso a dietary plant zzso with potential zzso properties, on zzso zzso zzso breast cancer cells and two zzso zzso with acquired resistance to either zzso or zzso We found that zzso can function as both an zzso and an zzso in a zzso zzso At low zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso zzso cell growth but had no effect on the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, at high zzso zzso zzso the drug inhibited growth of zzso cells and the zzso zzso and the combination of zzso with either zzso or zzso showed zzso zzso effects on both zzso and zzso breast cancer zzso To further zzso the molecular mechanism of zzso as either an zzso or an zzso effects of the drug on zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, mobility, stability, and zzso interactions were zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso activity by promoting interaction between zzso and its zzso amplified in breast zzso However, higher doses zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso mobility (as determined by zzso recovery after zzso zzso zzso zzso and amplified in breast zzso expression levels, and inhibited multiple protein zzso including zzso protein zzso A, zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso these results show that zzso can function as both an zzso and a protein zzso inhibitor with activity against breast cancer cells with acquired resistance to zzso or zzso We conclude that zzso through its ability to target both zzso and zzso zzso holds promise as a new therapeutic agent against zzso breast zzso
