The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and significance of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the development of prostate cancer zzso zzso was performed on zzso sections with rabbit zzso against zzso and zzso in 40 zzso 40 benign zzso zzso zzso and 10 normal prostate specimens for this zzso zzso real-time zzso chain reaction zzso was applied for zzso expression of zzso and zzso while zzso zzso were used to ascertain the best working concentration of the zzso inhibitor zzso The effect of zzso treatment on expression of zzso in zzso cells was studied using Western zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was in zzso zzso differences in expression was noted among zzso zzso and normal issues ( zzso zzso expression zzso correlated with zzso expression in zzso tissue ( zzso zzso could significantly block zzso expression and the proliferation of zzso cells ( zzso while increasing zzso levels ( zzso zzso of zzso could decrease the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso the expression of zzso may lead to zzso cell death and zzso of zzso The results suggest that zzso of zzso may have therapeutic potential for zzso in the zzso
