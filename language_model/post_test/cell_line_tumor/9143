Studies were conducted to determine whether gene expression profiles following a single dose of radiation would yield equivalent profiles following zzso radiation in different tumor cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells were exposed to a total radiation dose of 10 zzso administered as a single dose zzso or by daily zzso zzso of 5 zzso 2 zzso Following radiation treatment, zzso was isolated at 1, 4, 10, and 24 h and processed for zzso zzso zzso To determine the influence of the tumor zzso on gene zzso one cell type zzso was evaluated growing as a solid tumor in zzso nude mice for both radiation zzso zzso zzso cluster map analysis showed significant differences in gene expression profiles between zzso and zzso treatments for cells treated in zzso with zzso yielding a more robust induction compared with zzso Several genes were uniquely zzso by zzso treatment, including multiple zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells grown in zzso exhibited a completely different set of genes induced by both zzso and zzso compared with the same cells exposed in zzso The results of the study clearly show distinct differences in the molecular response of cells between zzso and zzso radiation zzso and show that the tumor zzso can significantly influence the pattern of gene expression after radiation zzso
