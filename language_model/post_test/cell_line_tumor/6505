zzso in the zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso have been implicated in playing a major role in the progression of zzso but little is known about the zzso relationship between decreases in zzso concentration and the key events in zzso and there is no information about how such decreases affect different zzso zzso zzso probe X-ray zzso was used to determine changes in element zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in nucleus, zzso and zzso in zzso cells undergoing zzso zzso In all zzso the initial stages of zzso were characterized by decreases in zzso and zzso The largest decreases in these elements were in the zzso and occurred before the release of zzso zzso zzso decreases in zzso and zzso also preceded zzso changes in the zzso In the later stages of zzso the zzso continued to decrease, whereas that of zzso began to increase toward control levels and was accompanied by an increase in zzso In the nucleus, these increases coincided with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso The zzso was the compartment least affected and the pattern of change of zzso was similar to those in other zzso but the decrease in zzso was not significant until after active zzso was zzso Our results support the concept that zzso cell shrinkage occurs early in zzso and demonstrate that changes in the zzso zzso of K and zzso zzso zzso changes in the cell compartments zzso
