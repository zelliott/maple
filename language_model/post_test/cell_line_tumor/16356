zzso studies by zzso zzso are increasingly employed for a variety of biomedical zzso A very standardized zzso zzso zzso protocol is generally employed for data zzso associated with zzso statistical zzso Even if targeted approaches have been proposed to zzso zzso from such experiments, zzso is often made difficult by the high degree of overlap characterizing zzso H zzso zzso of biological zzso zzso zzso presents a high potential for accurately measuring zzso in complex samples, as it offers a much higher discrimination between zzso zzso We have recently proposed an original approach relying on the zzso H zzso zzso pulse zzso zzso for fast quantitative analysis of complex zzso zzso Here, the first application of the quantitative zzso H zzso zzso experiment to a real zzso study is zzso Absolute zzso zzso are determined for different breast cancer cell line zzso by a standard addition zzso The protocol is characterized by high zzso performances zzso better than zzso excellent zzso even if it is affected by relatively long acquisition zzso (15 zzso to 1 h per zzso It is applied to three different cell lines, expressing different hormonal and zzso zzso zzso The absolute zzso of 15 zzso are determined, revealing significant differences between cell zzso The zzso zzso measured are in good agreement with previous studies regarding zzso profile changes of breast zzso While providing a high degree of discrimination, this methodology offers a powerful tool for the determination of relevant zzso
