zzso regulates diverse signaling pathways involving cell zzso the cell cycle, and zzso zzso is known to zzso activate a number of zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso promotes zzso in human lung zzso zzso cells, a role for zzso in this process is zzso Here, we report that zzso promotes zzso in zzso cells by a mechanism involving zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso proved effective at protecting cells from the lethal effects of zzso To understand which zzso zzso may be involved, a number of zzso target proteins were zzso including the zzso factor, zzso and the zzso regulatory proteins zzso and zzso zzso cells exhibited zzso levels of zzso zzso in nuclear zzso revealing that active zzso is present in these zzso zzso was found to inhibit zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso of zzso is not likely involved in zzso zzso zzso did not promote zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso promoted zzso of zzso and induced zzso of active zzso from the nucleus to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso of zzso were consistent with the observed changes in zzso status of zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso promoted zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso has been shown recently to promote zzso These results suggest that zzso may participate in zzso zzso in zzso cells by a mechanism involving zzso
