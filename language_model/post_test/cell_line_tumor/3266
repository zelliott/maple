To investigate the biological effects of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso in human zzso zzso cell line, and to explore new method of differentiation induction gene therapy for zzso 

A zzso expression zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso fused with green fluorescent protein zzso zzso zzso was zzso into human zzso zzso cell line by zzso The expression of zzso gene and their proteins were detected by fluorescent real-time monitoring, in zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso soft zzso colony formation and other methods were used to measure the effects of zzso zzso expression on cell cycle zzso zzso and growth features of the zzso zzso zzso 

The expressions of zzso zzso and its protein were markedly increased in zzso cells upon stable zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso changes in these cells were also observed, including the formation of abundant, zzso and thin zzso processes and a reduction of zzso Cell proliferation rate and its zzso on soft zzso were markedly zzso In addition, cell cycle analysis revealed a percentage decrease of cell populations at zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso gene could significantly suppress the growth of zzso zzso zzso cells along with an induction of zzso These results imply that forced zzso of zzso gene may provide a new strategy for zzso zzso
