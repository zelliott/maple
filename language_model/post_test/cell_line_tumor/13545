zzso 2 zzso is a small zzso protein and its elevated expression has been observed in pancreatic as well as other cancer zzso zzso has been reported to promote resistance to drug-induced zzso enhance invasion through its physical association with zzso zzso and promote in zzso tumor zzso zzso was found to be commonly expressed in patient zzso samples and its pattern of zzso zzso intensified with increasing severity in high-grade precursor zzso zzso of zzso in two pancreatic zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso with high zzso expression significantly reduced attachment, invasion, and zzso growth in zzso but not proliferation or zzso zzso of zzso in two pancreatic zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso with high expression significantly reduced attachment, invasion, and zzso growth in zzso In contrast, zzso zzso in zzso with low zzso zzso significantly increased invasion, attachment, and enhanced tumor zzso zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso cells increased their sensitivity to zzso in zzso and in zzso when zzso was zzso Furthermore, zzso promotes expression of zzso and zzso which contribute to enhanced zzso These overall results demonstrate that zzso plays an important role in the zzso progression of pancreatic zzso zzso and is a potential therapeutic target for this zzso
