We have previously reported on the use of Bay zzso strategies in combination with zzso zzso systems for up regulating bone formation in three-dimensional zzso zzso Here we report on the analysis of Bay activity following its release from our zzso scaffolds over the culture period imposed in our tissue engineering protocol using zzso zzso in combination with whole cell patch clamping zzso Bay was released continually from scaffolds within the zzso range required for zzso activity zzso zzso zzso clamping allowed for the effects of Bay released from scaffolds to be monitored directly with respect to zzso zzso A characteristic shift in the zzso zzso relationship of zzso zzso currents was observed in rat zzso zzso zzso cells patched in a solution with Bay released from scaffolds following 14 and 28 days zzso with statistically significant differences observed in peak currents compared to zzso zzso An increase in the magnitude of the peak inward currents was also zzso The zzso response of zzso in the presence of Bay released from scaffolds demonstrates that the released Bay is stable and maintains its zzso following culture of up to 28 zzso
