zzso is one of the most successful drugs for the treatment of cancer because of its ability to target zzso block cell cycle progression at zzso and induce zzso Despite the success of zzso the development of drug resistance zzso its clinical zzso zzso we report that zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer cells exhibit defective zzso response to zzso even at high zzso that are sufficient to trigger zzso This zzso zzso zzso is independent of zzso zzso We have found that zzso the zzso regulator and inhibitor of zzso zzso is zzso in these zzso cancer zzso zzso fails to induce zzso levels and zzso zzso in these cells, in contrast to their parental zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso is able to restore the zzso response of the resistant cells to zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso expression of zzso zzso abrogates the zzso zzso response in zzso cancer zzso We have also found that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso is unable to restore the zzso zzso response in the resistant zzso Our results show the importance of zzso for the zzso response in the context of zzso resistance and provide novel insights into the mechanisms of zzso arrest and zzso induced by zzso zzso
