Two zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso were established and characterized previously in our zzso Because enhanced sensitivity to zzso zzso and decreased expression of zzso zzso zzso protein were observed in these lines, we hypothesized that zzso may be a zzso of zzso associated with zzso DNA zzso I zzso zzso We used the zzso system to induce expression of zzso in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso interference to knock down zzso expression in human zzso zzso zzso cells in order to identify any correlations between zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso showed zzso zzso and statistically significant more resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso than parental zzso cells zzso zzso zzso but there was less resistance to zzso than to zzso zzso of zzso expression with small interfering zzso in zzso cells zzso increased sensitivity to zzso and zzso compared with mock zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso expression zzso with zzso cell death and zzso zzso zzso There were no differences in protein levels and zzso activity of zzso I between zzso and zzso cells from the zzso and small interfering zzso zzso zzso Resistance to zzso coincided with decreased amounts of zzso DNA breaks generated by zzso in zzso cells and vice versa in zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso can zzso zzso of zzso zzso I zzso
