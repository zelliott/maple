zzso a zzso protein was found zzso in the zzso zzso resistance zzso gastric cancer cell line zzso over its parental zzso cells in our previous zzso zzso The present study explored the role and mechanism of zzso in the development of zzso in gastric zzso We constructed the zzso plasmids zzso containing the full open reading frame of zzso and a zzso affinity zzso zzso of zzso by gene zzso was able to zzso drug resistance to zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso zzso zzso zzso increased sensitivity to zzso The zzso concentration of zzso in zzso cells decreased in zzso zzso cells and increased in zzso zzso cells, indicating that zzso had a direct or indirect function on pumping the drug out of zzso zzso of zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso partially reversed the zzso zzso in zzso cell, suggesting that regulation of zzso might be one of the mechanisms of zzso zzso The further study of the interaction protein of zzso may be helpful for understanding the mechanisms of zzso in gastric cancer and developing possible strategies to treat gastric zzso
