zzso zzso zzso cassette zzso of the A zzso is localized to the limiting membrane of zzso bodies, zzso for assembly and storage of pulmonary zzso in zzso zzso type II cells zzso It zzso zzso zzso into zzso bodies and absence of zzso function zzso zzso body zzso zzso of the zzso gene lead to fatal zzso zzso zzso and chronic zzso lung disease zzso of zzso zzso zzso can result in either functional defects of the correctly localized zzso or zzso defects where zzso zzso remains in the zzso zzso zzso 

Human zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso expressing zzso zzso or one of the three zzso zzso forms, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso or zzso zzso properties were analyzed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso of fluorescent zzso lipids into zzso bodies was used as a functional zzso zzso stress and zzso signaling were examined through zzso based analyses of zzso zzso zzso or zzso analyses of zzso zzso zzso V surface zzso and determination of the zzso zzso zzso 

We demonstrate that two zzso zzso which affect zzso protein zzso and lead to partial zzso or complete zzso retention of zzso in the zzso zzso can elevate zzso stress and zzso to it and induce zzso markers in the cultured lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in a functional zzso of the properly localized zzso had no effect on zzso stress and zzso zzso 

Our data suggest that expression of partially or completely zzso localized zzso zzso proteins can increase the zzso cell death of the affected cells, which are factors that might contribute to the zzso of genetic zzso
