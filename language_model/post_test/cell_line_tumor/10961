zzso of zzso with zzso and zzso laser zzso could result in zzso effects with a spatial confinement of less than 50 zzso Therefore absorbing zzso could be used to create controlled cellular zzso We describe a combination of laser zzso with zzso which changes the plasma membrane zzso We demonstrate that the system enables molecules to penetrate zzso cell zzso zzso light at zzso zzso is used to irradiate zzso of zzso gold, which are delivered by zzso to the plasma membrane of the Hodgkin's disease cell line zzso and/or the human zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso After zzso membrane zzso is evaluated by zzso zzso and flow zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The fraction of zzso zzso and then zzso cells is affected by the laser zzso the gold zzso and the membrane protein of the different cell lines to which the zzso are zzso Furthermore, a dependence on particle size is found for these interactions in the different cell zzso The results suggest that after zzso this method could be used for gene zzso and gene zzso
