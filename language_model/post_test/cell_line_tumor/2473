Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso using commercially available zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The chemical structures, compositions and molecular weights of the zzso were confirmed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were then prepared, and they showed average diameters in the range of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso ratios of zzso The in zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that three zzso zzso zzso were able to sensitize the resistant zzso tumor zzso The zzso zzso zzso was then selected for an in zzso zzso efficacy zzso The tumor volumes in nude mice bearing zzso resistant zzso zzso treated with this zzso zzso were significantly less than the control group treated with zzso It was demonstrated that three zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso activity in the resistant zzso cells via at least three zzso events: 1) zzso of zzso of zzso 2) decrease of membrane zzso and 3) a loss of zzso membrane potential and subsequent decrease of zzso levels at the concentration of zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso Considering other favorable zzso such as sustained zzso release in zzso zzso time in zzso and increased zzso concentration in the zzso of zzso and zzso in mice, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso system could have important clinical implications for delivery of zzso and treatment of the resistant zzso zzso
