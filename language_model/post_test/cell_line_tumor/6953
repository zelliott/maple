zzso oxygen species generated by zzso are zzso remedy for tumor zzso Eleven zzso derivatives of zzso p zzso with different zzso at the fused zzso ring and various zzso replacing the zzso group were evaluated as zzso with special emphasis on zzso zzso The studied zzso absorb light within a tissue transparency window zzso zzso and possess high zzso at prolonged light zzso The most active derivatives are zzso more zzso toward zzso and zzso cells than the clinically used zzso zzso due to the zzso that improve zzso zzso zzso ratio of zzso and provide efficient zzso zzso oxygen generation zzso yields of zzso The zzso zzso selective zzso targeting to zzso zzso zzso apparatus, and zzso or provide mixed zzso droplets and zzso apparatus zzso in cancer zzso zzso droplets and zzso apparatus are critically sensitive to zzso zzso The average lethal dose of zzso zzso oxygen per volume unit of cell was estimated to be zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of tissue sections of zzso mice revealed the features of tissue distribution of selected zzso and, in particular, their ability to accumulate in tumor zzso and surrounding zzso zzso Considering the short-range action of zzso zzso these properties of zzso are prerequisite to efficient zzso zzso zzso
