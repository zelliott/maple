In order to investigate the mechanism of zzso resistance, a zzso human gastric cancer cell line was zzso zzso to the exposure of the zzso gastric cancer cell line to equal zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso for 6 months, a zzso cell line was established zzso To determine the molecular mechanism of zzso resistance in zzso cells, zzso expressed genes zzso were investigated between zzso and zzso by zzso control zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso Eleven zzso were successfully identified and zzso Among them, zzso zzso protein 1 zzso and zzso zzso protein 27 zzso were markedly increased in zzso zzso In addition, western zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso gene 1 zzso which was observed to selectively activate zzso and zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso The results suggested that the zzso expression of zzso and zzso is involved in zzso resistance in gastric cancer zzso
