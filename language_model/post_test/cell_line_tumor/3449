We have investigated growth and zzso of zzso zzso in mice upon conditional zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso rat zzso cells were zzso with a zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso under the control of a zzso expression promoter zzso zzso and implanted in the brain of zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging analysis showed a significant decrease in tumor growth 14 days after zzso when zzso was expressed compared to zzso This size difference disappeared after 20 zzso However, after 20 days, tumor and zzso cells zzso were higher in the zzso group and consequently zzso was decreased whereas tumor cells were similarly associated with blood vessels at the tumor zzso zzso coverage was not different between the two groups but a higher amount of zzso not associated with vessels was found in the zzso expressing zzso This zzso that conditional expression of inhibitor of zzso zzso activity in zzso implanted in the brain of zzso mice can be achieved zzso and that zzso are major players in zzso development and in zzso zzso
