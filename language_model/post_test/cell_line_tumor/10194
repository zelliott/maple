The zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator gene zzso is coordinated by zzso and zzso zzso elements that influence its zzso zzso The promoter apparently lacks sequences to drive cell zzso zzso We previously identified a number of zzso elements that were associated with zzso I hypersensitive sites zzso and bound the zzso nuclear factor 1 zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we demonstrated the likely involvement of zzso in the regulation of zzso expression in zzso Here we investigate zzso in zzso 16 and zzso of the zzso zzso which are evident in zzso and pancreatic cell lines, and determine the zzso factors that interact with these zzso Of particular interest were factors known to interact with zzso in coordinated expression of genes in the gastrointestinal zzso We demonstrate that though sequences within these zzso bind zzso zzso and zzso in zzso only zzso show a robust in zzso zzso These data contribute to our understanding of the complexity of zzso zzso regulatory zzso
