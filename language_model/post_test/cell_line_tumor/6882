The identification of tumor zzso genes has classically depended on their zzso within zzso regions of loss of zzso According to zzso two-hit hypothesis, the remaining zzso is lost, either genetically or, more recently identified, through zzso zzso To date, retrospective analyses have determined promoter zzso as a common alternative zzso in cancer cells to silence zzso zzso Here we report an application of restriction landmark zzso scanning that allows for DNA zzso profiling along a region of zzso loss of zzso at zzso zzso This approach resulted in the identification of a tumor zzso zzso zzso which is frequently lost in human zzso We demonstrate that zzso is expressed in normal lung airway zzso cells and zzso zzso and silenced in the majority of head and neck zzso cell zzso and zzso lung zzso zzso zzso is known to regulate zzso cell transition into zzso cells, a property that has been shown to be deficient in zzso We further demonstrate that zzso expression of zzso in cells that have silenced the zzso zzso locus resulted in a reduction of tumor properties in zzso and in zzso
