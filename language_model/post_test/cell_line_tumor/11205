We have refined the technique for zzso and zzso cultures of primary zzso zzso cancer zzso cells derived from solid tumors and zzso Both protocols involve a simple yet rapid method for the growth and propagation of zzso tumor and zzso cells in a zzso culture medium without the addition of growth zzso Isolation of tumor zzso cells involves the mechanical disruption of the tumor tissue with the help of a cell zzso while zzso zzso cells are mixed with growth medium and placed directly into culture with very little zzso We further describe a partial zzso method to eliminate zzso contamination from primary zzso cells derived from solid zzso These methods allow for the direct application of many zzso zzso and functional analyses within a few weeks of initial isolation, with the added potential of retrospective analyses of zzso cells and zzso Thus, we have included steps for long-term zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso isolation of zzso cells can be completed within 1 zzso and primary cells are further expanded in culture for several zzso
