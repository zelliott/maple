zzso B5 is a candidate zzso zzso but its zzso activity has also been zzso Its function may be affected by protein zzso The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between zzso B5 and zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cancer zzso We also zzso the zzso significance of zzso B5 expression in patients with zzso zzso of zzso B5 was identified in a zzso zzso cell line using two-dimensional gel zzso zzso and zzso laser zzso zzso zzso zzso The specific interaction and zzso of zzso B5 with zzso were confirmed by zzso and zzso zzso Western zzso analysis and zzso revealed significant positive correlations between levels of zzso B5 and zzso in human colon cancer cell lines and in the blood of patients with zzso zzso expression of zzso B5 in 377 patients with zzso was significantly associated with serum zzso zzso grade, stage, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso invasion, and zzso zzso Strong expression of zzso B5 was also associated with a reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Together, these findings describe a relationship between zzso B5 and zzso expression in zzso Strong expression of zzso B5 was associated with a worse prognosis in patients with zzso and its expression may correlate with zzso levels in zzso
