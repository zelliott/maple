zzso by which zzso zzso amplification zzso aggressive zzso zzso are poorly zzso Here, we show using zzso models that high zzso expression promotes cell zzso and zzso zzso tumors, which zzso aggressive zzso features of zzso primary human zzso Using zzso analysis, we identified cell migration and zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso as zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso was most consistently and robustly diminished in zzso cell lines and primary human tumors with high zzso expression zzso zzso 101, P zzso zzso zzso stable zzso expression significantly attenuated in zzso transformation and zzso properties of high zzso zzso cells without altering cell zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso was consistently accompanied by increased zzso levels and reduced cell migration and invasion in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso of zzso and zzso partner Max and correlated diminished zzso zzso II occupancy zzso decrease, P zzso zzso with increased zzso binding at a core zzso zzso zzso gene and/or gel shift zzso confirmed direct repression of zzso zzso by zzso and also identified zzso a zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso as a zzso in zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate the zzso network targets zzso via multiple mechanisms in zzso zzso and highlight a novel critical role for zzso in zzso aggressive zzso zzso
