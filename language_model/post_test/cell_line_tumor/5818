zzso oxygen species are involved in tumor progression but how they function is not well zzso In this study, we investigated and compared the effects of hydrogen zzso on the survival, zzso zzso of zzso stress, and zzso zzso gene expression on human gastric zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The cell lines were exposed to hydrogen zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso The surviving cells were detected by zzso zzso zzso The zzso stress was analyzed by an zzso stress marker, zzso zzso under zzso zzso The effect of zzso stress on the zzso behavior, zzso activity, and zzso zzso gene expressions of the cell lines were determined, respectively, by zzso zzso activity zzso and quantitative real-time zzso chain zzso 

Exposure of the gastric cancer cells to zzso stress resulted in zzso and zzso decrease in the survival of the cell zzso While zzso cells had zzso stress, increased zzso with no zzso activity, and increased zzso zzso expression following hydrogen zzso exposure, zzso cells showed none, with internal zzso stress zzso prior to hydrogen zzso zzso 

The two gastric cancer cell lines responded differently to zzso stress conditions, and unlike in zzso cells, zzso zzso gene expression was shown to be affected by external hydrogen zzso in zzso zzso
