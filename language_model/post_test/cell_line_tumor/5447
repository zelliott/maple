zzso role in pancreatic zzso zzso has not been zzso Recently it was suggested that zzso zzso controls expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates expression of zzso the rate limiting zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso the development and proliferation of pancreatic zzso zzso zzso is essential for the development of new zzso 

zzso target genes in the pancreatic zzso zzso cell line zzso were identified by zzso interference and zzso expression zzso zzso expressions of selected target genes in zzso were evaluated by zzso 

158 zzso zzso target genes were identified in zzso cells, among them zzso and zzso that were zzso regulated by zzso An inverse relation of zzso to zzso protein expression was observed for 15 out of 22 zzso zzso Nine zzso displayed low zzso zzso and six zzso high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed high zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) or low zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) zzso Nine of twelve zzso zzso zzso showed zzso expression with no relation to zzso 

A number of genes with potential importance for PET zzso have been zzso zzso zzso regulated the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso In zzso with these findings zzso showed an inverse relation to zzso expression in a subset of zzso which may affect growth control by the zzso zzso zzso
