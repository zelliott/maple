The strategy developed aims to favor the vascular effect of zzso therapy zzso by targeting tumor zzso This approach is considered by zzso a zzso zzso to an zzso targeting zzso zzso We previously demonstrated that this new zzso zzso which binds to zzso zzso zzso was a much more potent zzso compared to the zzso zzso in human zzso vein zzso cells zzso expressing zzso due to the zzso of the zzso zzso To argue the involvement of zzso in the zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso breast cancer cells were used, strongly zzso zzso zzso and we evidenced a significant decrease of the zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso of zzso In mice zzso zzso with zzso human zzso zzso cells, we demonstrated that only the zzso zzso allowed a selective zzso in zzso cells lining tumor zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso plasma and tumor levels could not prevent the recognition of the zzso by zzso The vascular effect induced by the zzso zzso was characterized by a reduction in tumor blood flow around 50% during zzso In zzso the zzso efficiency with the zzso zzso induced a statistically significant tumor growth delay compared to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso involves zzso and this targeting strategy favors the vascular effect of zzso in zzso
