High zzso zzso zzso activity has recently been used to identify zzso cell zzso in many cancer zzso zzso we hypothesized that a zzso of cells with cancer stem cells zzso properties could be identified in established human zzso cell lines based on high zzso zzso We previously showed that a zzso of cells with high zzso activity were present in 4 selected human zzso cell lines, of which a significantly higher zzso activity was present in the zzso cell line that was originally derived from a highly aggressive primary human zzso Using a zzso model in which zzso cells were grown in zzso mice, we identified a highly zzso zzso of zzso cells based on their high zzso zzso zzso with high zzso activity zzso zzso from the zzso zzso were much less zzso averaging zzso of the entire tumor population, compared to those isolated directly from the zzso cell zzso zzso cells from the zzso were enriched with greater zzso compared to their counterparts with low zzso activity zzso zzso generating new tumors with as few as 100 cells in zzso The highly zzso zzso cells illustrated the stem cell characteristics of zzso the ability to produce differentiated progeny and increased expression of stem cell marker genes zzso zzso and zzso The isolation of zzso zzso by their high zzso activity may provide new insight into the study of zzso cells and may potentially have therapeutic implications for human zzso
