zzso zzso is highly expressed in several human zzso including zzso zzso Thus, a selective zzso inhibitor could be useful as an zzso agent for a range of zzso In the present study, we investigated the zzso effect and zzso induction of zzso a highly selective zzso zzso on human zzso cancer cells in zzso and in zzso 

We examined the zzso of zzso against three human zzso cancer cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso and performed quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction to measure the zzso expression of zzso and zzso 

zzso showed significant zzso only to zzso cells, which expressed the greatest level of zzso zzso and the lowest level of zzso zzso among the three cell zzso zzso also increased the zzso zzso expression in zzso cells in zzso We also found that zzso suppressed tumor growth and induced zzso expression and cell zzso in a zzso tumor zzso mouse zzso 

zzso exhibited zzso activity and induced zzso expression in zzso cancer cells and might be useful for the clinical treatment and prevention of zzso cancer, especially in poorly differentiated zzso cancer with high zzso and low zzso zzso
