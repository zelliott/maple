zzso zzso zzso zzso is locally aggressive and challenging to zzso zzso zzso particularly in zzso models of zzso We describe imaging of zzso zzso activity, typically elevated in locally aggressive tumors, as a novel method for tracking zzso zzso Mice bearing human zzso subcutaneous flank zzso tumors were zzso with zzso an optical imaging agent of zzso zzso zzso zzso The relative contribution of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso signal was estimated using zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso cell lines and compared to zzso zzso zzso expression data from human zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cell mass tracking with zzso signal was evaluated using zzso zzso zzso and compared to zzso signal using zzso zzso zzso zzso yielded a robust tumor signal in zzso subcutaneous zzso primarily resulting from zzso zzso of zzso demonstrated not only by zzso data on zzso cell lines but also by zzso expression data from zzso human patient zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor signal was robust and durable indicating feasibility of zzso cell mass tracking of zzso zzso zzso imaging of zzso zzso zzso activity is useful for tracking zzso tumor cell mass zzso zzso zzso cell mass tracking of zzso labeled tumor is zzso
