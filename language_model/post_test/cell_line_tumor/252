zzso is the most frequently zzso gene in acute zzso leukemia zzso with internal tandem zzso zzso accounting for up to zzso of its zzso To analyze the impact of individual zzso on the expression profile of immature zzso cells, we have established zzso cell lines expressing nine different zzso isolated from zzso patients and subjected them to whole zzso expression profiling and zzso zzso Our data indicate that in comparison to the controls, zzso zzso cells exhibit less mature expression profiles resembling early zzso zzso Moreover, our results suggest that there exist biological differences among individual zzso zzso
