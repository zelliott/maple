Global profiling of zzso has proven to be a great challenge due to the relatively low zzso of protein zzso and poor zzso efficiency in mass zzso zzso zzso relevant, zzso research relies on the efficient zzso enrichment from complex zzso zzso metal affinity zzso and titanium dioxide zzso can greatly assist selective zzso zzso However, the complexity of zzso enriched samples is often still high, suggesting that further separation of enriched zzso is zzso We have developed a pH zzso zzso technique for enhanced zzso identification in conjunction with titanium dioxide zzso Using this process, we demonstrated its superiority to the traditional zzso strategies for differential protein zzso Our technique generated a highly specific separation of zzso by an applied pH zzso between zzso and zzso The most efficient zzso range for high-resolution zzso separation was between zzso zzso and zzso zzso separation of multiply zzso peptides was primarily achieved using zzso ranges greater than pH zzso Investigation of zzso sequences identified in each pH fraction indicated that zzso with zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso including zzso acid, zzso acid, and other zzso zzso were zzso zzso at higher pH zzso
