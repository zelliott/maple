zzso syndrome is a premature aging disorder characterized by cancer predisposition that is caused by loss of the zzso syndrome protein zzso zzso DNA repair zzso zzso zzso is an environmental zzso and zzso that is associated with respiratory zzso and zzso several forms of DNA damage, including zzso that interfere with DNA zzso Based on the evidence that zzso protein zzso repair of stalled and collapsed replication zzso we hypothesized that zzso functions in the cellular response to and recovery from zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we report that human cells deficient in zzso protein are hypersensitive to zzso zzso and exhibit a delayed reduction in DNA breaks and stalled replication zzso indicated by zzso zzso during recovery from zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso from the zzso into zzso zzso in zzso cells, and these zzso zzso with zzso zzso indicating zzso responds to zzso DNA zzso As further evidence that zzso triggers stalled DNA zzso we observed zzso treatment induced an zzso of cells in zzso that exhibited high levels of zzso zzso zzso these data demonstrate a novel role for zzso protein in cellular protection against the environmental zzso zzso and further provide evidence that zzso zzso DNA zzso stress which has implications for aging and zzso
