Human zzso is unique among the A zzso and zzso domain zzso family because of the zzso binding motif zzso zzso within its zzso zzso zzso zzso has been reported to bind to zzso in an zzso manner, but the biological significance of the interaction between zzso and zzso is zzso To characterize the effects of zzso on zzso cell zzso and migration and zzso the potential zzso zzso cells which express zzso zzso zzso were zzso with human zzso zzso zzso zzso led to enhanced cell zzso and decreased migration on zzso which were suppressed by zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso not only increased the cell surface expression of zzso zzso but also resulted in a more clustered zzso of zzso on cell surface, while the zzso zzso remained zzso zzso results from zzso and zzso indicated that zzso and zzso zzso did not interact directly in zzso zzso We found that zzso expression decreased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso against zzso enhanced the expression of zzso on cell zzso By using a zzso pulmonary zzso model, we revealed that zzso of zzso significantly reduced the number of zzso zzso on the zzso Taken together, this study reveals for the first time that zzso could drive zzso zzso expression on cell surface via zzso of zzso zzso This presents a novel mechanism by which zzso regulates zzso zzso and zzso
