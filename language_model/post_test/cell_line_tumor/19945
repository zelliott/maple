We analyzed zzso in two individuals characterized by impaired zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso usually associated with normal zzso Full zzso sequencing and zzso analysis confirmed the previously identified silent zzso zzso in zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso now termed zzso as well as an additional novel zzso change in zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso cells of the entire zzso gene of zzso carrying either both or only the zzso change resulted in about zzso reduced levels of zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso These data demonstrate profound effects of a silent zzso on expression and function of zzso resulting in impaired drug zzso zzso The zzso single zzso zzso in zzso 6 was present zzso in two individuals out of 308 zzso corresponding to an zzso frequency of zzso zzso for this zzso thus improves zzso correlation for zzso and may help to predict adverse drug treatment zzso
