zzso differentiation and LDL zzso play a pivotal role in early zzso We thus questioned possible mechanisms for oxidized LDL zzso zzso differentiation in zzso Mouse zzso zzso cells, that were isolated 1, 2, or 3 days after zzso zzso injection, gradually exhibited the characteristic zzso zzso along with the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso mechanisms involved in zzso differentiation were further investigated in zzso using the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso cells incubated with zzso in the presence of as low as 1 zzso of zzso differentiated into zzso as evidenced by zzso zzso and functional zzso zzso of zzso differentiation was selective to zzso (and not native zzso was dependent on the extent of LDL zzso and required zzso zzso by the zzso These effects of zzso could be attributed to its major zzso zzso and zzso Finally, the stimulation of zzso differentiation to zzso by zzso was shown to require the zzso since blocking the binding to the zzso abolished zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso We thus conclude that zzso zzso zzso differentiation to zzso in zzso and this phenomenon involves zzso of the zzso
