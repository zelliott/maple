Signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso is a zzso factor that plays a crucial role in zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso induction of the human zzso zzso gene in zzso We showed earlier that zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by the recruitment of the zzso zzso We had also observed a physical interaction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in an zzso manner that leads to zzso zzso In this study, we sought to zzso the mechanism by which zzso controls zzso zzso zzso Here, we mapped the interacting zzso of both zzso and zzso and found that the zzso domain of zzso is necessary for zzso zzso zzso repression, whereas the zzso zzso domain of zzso is required for zzso zzso Interestingly, over expression of zzso in zzso cells leads to significantly reduced amounts of nuclear zzso after zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso resulted in zzso of total and zzso zzso in the zzso We have found that zzso zzso also interferes with the responsiveness of the zzso zzso target gene expression to zzso as confirmed by real-time zzso zzso Together, our study reveals the novel functional consequences of zzso zzso interaction on zzso distribution of zzso
