zzso a naturally zzso zzso is found in leaves and fruits of plants as a defensive agent against zzso bacteria and zzso zzso we investigated zzso toxicity in zzso and in zzso and assessed its protective and the therapeutic effects on a typical animal model of breast zzso The study conducted in three series of experiments to obtain zzso zzso effects on cell viability of zzso zzso cells, zzso in zzso toxicity of zzso and zzso the protective and therapeutic effects of zzso on animal model of breast zzso zzso significantly suppressed proliferation of mouse zzso zzso cells both in zzso and in zzso ( zzso Under the dosing zzso 5 zzso zzso has been chosen for assessing its protective and therapeutic effects in mice breast zzso zzso take rate in the zzso group was zero compared with a zzso rate in its respective control group ( zzso The average tumor size and weight were significantly lower in zzso animals than its respective control ones ( zzso zzso zzso protein expression increased in breast tumor by zzso compared with its respective control group ( zzso zzso zzso protein expression found to be lower in zzso animals ( zzso zzso and zzso parameters greatly decreased in zzso mice ( zzso Data provide evidence that zzso exerts a significant zzso and zzso effects on an animal model of breast cancer through zzso zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso These findings reveal a new therapeutic potential for zzso in zzso
