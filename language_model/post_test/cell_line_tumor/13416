zzso zzso is a crucial component of the zzso zzso zzso which prompted investigations into its biological role in zzso We have previously shown that zzso is zzso in breast cancer zzso zzso worse overall survival in zzso zzso negative zzso Here, we used zzso and zzso zzso zzso growth conditions and a breast cancer zzso mouse model to assess the impact of zzso on breast cancer stem cell zzso propagation and invasion in zzso and tumor growth in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso breast cancer cells reduced cell invasion by zzso zzso zzso accompanied by a zzso change to a rounded cell zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We observed a reduction of the pool of zzso and zzso high breast cancer stem cells by zzso and zzso respectively, and a reduction by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells caused an induction of zzso to zzso regulators, as well as a fivefold increased zzso activity, a zzso enrichment for zzso stem cells, and a zzso enhanced zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we show that zzso regulates breast cancer stem cells partly through zzso and the zzso zzso zzso serial dilution transplantation of the zzso cells expressing zzso and zzso zzso depleted of zzso in zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso may be relevant for the reduced zzso of breast cancer zzso These data could serve as a benchmark for development of zzso therapies in breast zzso
