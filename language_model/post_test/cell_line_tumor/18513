zzso zzso zzso a novel synthetic zzso has recently been demonstrated by us to inhibit the in zzso growth of human zzso cells, and this effect was associated with decreased expression of cell zzso zzso These results, taken together with previous in zzso and clinical studies with zzso suggest that this agent may be useful in the zzso and therapy of zzso and possibly other human zzso In the present study, we further examined the molecular effects of zzso on the zzso human zzso cell line, focusing on the expression of nuclear zzso receptors and the cell cycle inhibitor protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analyses indicated that these cells express zzso acid receptors zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso X receptors zzso alpha and zzso and zzso zzso receptors zzso gamma zzso Treatment with zzso caused a rapid induction within 3 h of zzso zzso and the related zzso but there was no significant change in the levels of the zzso or proteins for zzso alpha and zzso zzso alpha and zzso and zzso There was also a rapid increase in zzso zzso and protein in zzso cells treated with zzso and this induction occurred via a zzso zzso In transient zzso reporter zzso we zzso the zzso acid response zzso zzso zzso reporter gene into zzso cells together with a zzso expression zzso zzso expression markedly zzso zzso activity (up to about zzso after the addition of zzso However, zzso activity in the presence of zzso was only about zzso higher than that in the absence of zzso when cells were zzso with zzso alpha and gamma or zzso These findings suggest that the growth zzso effects of zzso are zzso at least in part through zzso and that both zzso and zzso play critical roles in the molecular mechanisms of growth zzso induced by zzso
