Human zzso leukemia virus type I zzso is an zzso agent of adult zzso leukemia and zzso zzso zzso Previous analyses of tax transgenic mice suggested that protection of peripheral zzso from zzso zzso by zzso zzso Tax was relevant to the onset of zzso zzso Here, we show the high level expression of cellular zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso expression by a zzso zzso interference system rendered zzso zzso zzso sensitive to zzso zzso zzso expressed Tax by using a conditional zzso zzso system also inhibited zzso zzso by zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso Tax zzso zzso which cannot activate zzso while another zzso zzso which cannot activate zzso did not, suppressed zzso zzso by inducing zzso zzso Furthermore, expression of the dominant negative zzso of either zzso or zzso canceled not only zzso expression but also zzso activity against zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso however, did not decrease the expression of zzso in zzso zzso Taken together, Tax zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso expression in zzso cells, and zzso activity plays an essential role in the zzso of zzso
