zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso acid inhibitor of the zzso zzso that was developed as a therapeutic agent for zzso Here, we investigated the effects of zzso on the growth of human zzso zzso cancer zzso Although the drug did not stimulate significant increases in levels of zzso it inhibited cell growth in a zzso fashion and zzso the growth zzso effects of zzso in zzso These effects were associated with zzso of zzso and zzso and suppression of zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso also inhibited zzso of the zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso In zzso studies with zzso tumors growing in nude mice demonstrated that zzso (1 zzso did not inhibit tumor growth when it was delivered as a single agent, although it reduced tumor zzso density and inhibited expression of zzso and zzso However, combination therapy with zzso plus zzso produced synergistic tumor growth zzso associated with strong suppression of tumor cell zzso Together, our results demonstrate that zzso has significant zzso activity in aggressive zzso cancer cells, which is best exploited within the context of combination zzso
