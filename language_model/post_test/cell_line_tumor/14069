The rising zzso of zzso zzso zzso in western countries, along with the poor prognosis offered by zzso treatment zzso makes novel therapies for this disease zzso zzso zzso zzso viruses zzso are zzso viruses that are highly effective in the treatment of a wide variety of experimental models of human zzso This study seeks to investigate the effectiveness of zzso zzso viruses in the treatment of primary zzso cell zzso Sixteen commercially available human zzso cell lines were zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso engineered to selectively replicate within cancer zzso Cell lines were tested for viral sensitivity to zzso and their ability to support viral replication using standard zzso and viral replication zzso Eleven of 16 cell lines were moderately to highly sensitive to zzso viral zzso zzso cell lines additionally demonstrated the ability to support viral replication in zzso with as high as zzso amplification of the administered viral dose zzso zzso is zzso to, and efficiently replicates zzso zzso cell lines in zzso From these data, we suggest that zzso zzso therapy may have a role in the treatment of zzso and in zzso studies are zzso
