In this study, we first report the zzso effect of zzso extract from zzso zzso zzso zzso bodies in the human liver cancer cell line zzso Treatment with zzso decreased the cancer invasion of zzso cells in a zzso zzso This effect was strongly associated with a zzso decrease in either the level or activity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and an increase in the expression of zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso activated and zzso zzso in both its zzso activity and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso also inhibited the zzso zzso reporter gene expression of zzso and zzso and the invasion of cancer zzso zzso also exhibited an zzso effect on zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso Further investigation revealed that zzso zzso of cancer cell growth and invasion was also evident in a nude mice zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and may provide a molecular basis for drug development using zzso as an zzso agent in the prevention and treatment of zzso
