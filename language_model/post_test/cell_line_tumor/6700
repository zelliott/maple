In breast zzso zzso zzso zzso levels are highly correlated with response to zzso zzso We sought to define mechanisms of zzso zzso signaling in a solid breast tumor model using gene expression zzso zzso zzso human breast cancer cells were grown as zzso in zzso nude mice under four conditions: 1) zzso for 8 zzso zzso 2) without E for 8 zzso zzso 3) E for 7 zzso followed by 1 zzso of E withdrawal zzso or 4) E for 8 zzso plus tamoxifen for the last zzso zzso genes were defined as those that differed significantly between control and E and/or between E and zzso or control and zzso These protocols generated 188 in zzso zzso genes that showed two major patterns of zzso zzso zzso returned to zzso states after zzso zzso I zzso zzso did not zzso II zzso In addition, more than zzso of class zzso genes also failed to reverse in response to zzso These genes may be interesting for the study of zzso zzso A subset of in zzso zzso genes appears on lists of clinical zzso zzso zzso These may be useful therapeutic targets or markers of E zzso zzso of in zzso zzso genes with those regulated in identical cells in zzso after 6 and 24 h of E treatment demonstrate only zzso zzso This indicates the extent to which gene expression profiles are uniquely dependent on zzso times and the cellular zzso
