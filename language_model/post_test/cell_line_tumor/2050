zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso is a common zzso mechanism in chronic zzso zzso Since zzso proteins have been zzso identified as zzso partners of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in these diseases, a role for the zzso in zzso transformation has been zzso In this study, we addressed the functional role of zzso targeted zzso zzso zzso First, zzso zzso was not routinely found for all zzso fusion proteins zzso Second, targeting of zzso zzso to the zzso by creating artificial zzso fusion zzso with the zzso targeting domain of zzso failed to enhance the zzso transforming potential in both zzso and zzso cells, although zzso signal zzso pathways were initiated at the zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso of zzso activated zzso zzso does not contribute to disease zzso in chronic zzso zzso
