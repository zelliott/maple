zzso is an important second zzso that has diverse cellular and biological zzso It is a specific and potent zzso of zzso and zzso of cell zzso In zzso zzso generally developed due to zzso zzso zzso In zzso treatment strategies of zzso few components have the capability to increases zzso zzso zzso in zzso production by zzso and pharmacological zzso therefore will give additive effect in leukemia zzso 

Here, we show that zzso D zzso zzso zzso a pure herbal compound isolated from zzso zzso could effectively zzso zzso in a dose and time zzso manner both in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells being nontoxic to normal zzso and control zzso zzso zzso potentially augment zzso production in these zzso zzso of zzso zzso acted on zzso group of proteins and significantly increased zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso proves their cooperative action on zzso cell zzso zzso the cause of zzso production, we found zzso of neutral zzso and showed zzso 2 zzso 2) is a critical zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso 2 by zzso and inhibitor of zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso generation and zzso of zzso and zzso whereas zzso of zzso was moderately regulated in zzso zzso Also, both by zzso of zzso 2 and/or blocking by zzso protects these cells from zzso death and suppressed zzso whereas zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso did not have any zzso Additionally, zzso effectively induced zzso in freshly isolated zzso from patients and the potent cell killing activity was through zzso and zzso zzso 

Our results demonstrate that zzso enhance the zzso zzso by zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso and induced zzso in both zzso and zzso cells along with primary cells derived from leukemia zzso Taken together, this pure herbal compound zzso may consider as a potential alternative tool with additive effects in conjunction with traditional zzso treatment, thereby accelerate the process of conventional drug zzso
