zzso zzso zzso is a major cellular carbon source for fatty acid synthesis during zzso or when zzso zzso is zzso Yet, a zzso understanding of what determines reductive metabolism is zzso Here we identify several cellular conditions where the zzso ratio is changed due to an altered zzso to zzso conversion, and demonstrate that reductive zzso metabolism is initiated in response to zzso that result in an increase in the zzso zzso Thus, targeting reductive zzso conversion for a therapeutic benefit might require distinct zzso of zzso zzso rather than targeting the upstream zzso which only indirectly affects the zzso
