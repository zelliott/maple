The zzso protein zzso is important in the control of cell proliferation and zzso Its activity is controlled by zzso zzso on several zzso and zzso zzso When zzso is zzso it zzso proliferation by preventing passage through the G zzso S phase zzso zzso zzso promotes cell cycle zzso The role of zzso zzso in the control of zzso is largely unknown, although several zzso stimuli result in zzso of zzso It may be that zzso of specific zzso acids signals zzso zzso cell cycle zzso Using zzso acid zzso we have generated 15 single zzso site zzso of zzso to alter zzso to zzso acid to mimic the zzso zzso By calcium zzso zzso zzso plasmids were introduced into zzso zzso cells, and zzso was induced using zzso zzso was measured by zzso detection of zzso DNA and by zzso to assess zzso zzso of zzso Our results show that only zzso of zzso to zzso acid zzso blocked zzso by zzso whereas other sites tested had little zzso In zzso zzso and zzso cells, the zzso zzso also blocked zzso induced by the zzso zzso zzso by zzso In addition, we show that zzso zzso is zzso on zzso when cells are undergoing zzso Thus, our data indicates that zzso of zzso of zzso is required for cells to undergo zzso
