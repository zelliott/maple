zzso expression is unusually regulated in zzso zzso zzso It is not expressed in poorly cohesive zzso surface zzso zzso target cells, but is expressed in cohesive zzso zzso and in highly zzso zzso tumors where it is membrane zzso presumably in zzso zzso zzso expression is subsequently zzso or its function is zzso in late-stage invasive zzso Here, we observed that increased zzso expression in zzso zzso cells was associated with increased zzso promoter activity, increased zzso junction formation, decreased zzso zzso zzso activity, and the generation of cohesive zzso in basement membrane gel zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso in immortalized zzso cells initiated zzso junction formation, decreased zzso activity, decreased the zzso migration that is a characteristic of zzso cells that have been maintained in zzso culture, and induced the formation of cohesive zzso in basement membrane zzso zzso forced expression of a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells disrupted zzso zzso increased zzso cell migration, and prevented zzso zzso without altering zzso zzso zzso in addition to suppressing late-stage tumor zzso zzso zzso junctions may also contribute to the initial emergence of a cohesive zzso zzso that is a hallmark of differentiated zzso zzso zzso
