Poor prognosis in zzso clear cell zzso is associated with the expression of a defined set of proteins including zzso zzso and zzso zzso a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso are currently being investigated for the treatment and prevention of zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso on zzso clear cell zzso zzso cells in zzso and in zzso and zzso the mechanism of drug zzso Changes in zzso gene expression were determined by real-time zzso and an zzso zzso was performed to determine effects on cell zzso Finally, a zzso tumor model was constructed to evaluate the effects of zzso on cell proliferation and zzso in zzso According to our experimental results, zzso is an important protein in zzso zzso inhibited zzso cell zzso and the zzso rate was approximately zzso to 50% after treatment with 10 zzso zzso for 48 zzso In the zzso studies, zzso treatment resulted in a significant growth zzso Furthermore, the mice treated with zzso survived significantly longer compared to the control zzso In conclusion, zzso has zzso effects in zzso and in zzso Further confirmation of the zzso effects of statins in future studies will increase the scope for zzso zzso
