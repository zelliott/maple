The novel synthetic zzso zzso shows potent zzso activity in a range of different cancer cell lines and now serves as a zzso for development of new zzso related molecules zzso The purpose of this study was to examine the effect and cellular targets of zzso in the human zzso melanoma cell lines zzso and zzso We showed that treatment with zzso led to cell cycle arrest and induced zzso through both the zzso and intrinsic pathways zzso 8, -9 and zzso zzso in both cell zzso Interestingly, zzso was induced independently of zzso in zzso cells, and appeared partially zzso in the zzso zzso Additionally, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso D protein zzso following zzso treatment, suggests involvement of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Combination of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso a TRAIL death zzso zzso resulted in synergistic reduction of viable cells, along with increased zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso has a strong zzso effect alone and in combination with zzso in melanoma cell zzso
