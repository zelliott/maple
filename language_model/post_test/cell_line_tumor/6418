The zzso zzso zzso is a member of the B7 family of zzso which regulate the zzso immune response through zzso zzso Recently, zzso has been reported to be a negative regulator of the immune response in patients with several zzso zzso However, few reports have investigated the clinical significance of zzso expression in patients with gastric zzso In the present study, we analyzed zzso expression and the relationship between its expression and zzso factors including prognosis in gastric zzso 

zzso expression in gastric cancer cell lines and clinical gastric cancer specimens was initially assessed with the reverse zzso chain reaction zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso expression in 120 zzso specimens from gastric cancer patients were evaluated by zzso zzso 

zzso expression was identified in the gastric cancer cell lines and clinical tumor zzso by zzso zzso expression was high in zzso zzso of zzso tumor zzso zzso expression significantly correlated with tumor stage zzso zzso zzso The zzso survival rate was significantly lower in patients with high zzso expression than in those with low zzso expression zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso expression was an independent zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso expression showed that zzso expression was zzso correlated with the number of tumor zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso marker related to the zzso immune response, and its zzso may be a molecular target for controlling tumor progression in patients with gastric zzso
