We report the application of quantitative mass zzso to identify plasma membrane proteins zzso expressed in melanoma cells with high zzso low zzso zzso Using stable isotope labeling with zzso acids in culture zzso coupled with zzso tandem mass zzso we identified zzso protein 1 zzso as one such zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso is not only a surface marker for cells with higher zzso potential, but also functionally involved in enhancing tumor zzso zzso of zzso also zzso with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which block zzso family zzso zzso blocked scattered growth of zzso cells in zzso zzso culture, suggesting that zzso might function through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso This hypothesis was further supported by zzso studies of zzso Whereas zzso zzso enhances zzso zzso point zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso growth in zzso culture and in zzso zzso activities of zzso In addition, the zzso zzso also eliminated enhanced zzso zzso Thus, this work provides molecular mechanisms for the zzso functions of zzso
