zzso have provided an abundant and effective source of zzso for the treatment of zzso Here we describe the characterization of a novel plant zzso zzso with in zzso activity in the zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso and zzso mode of zzso zzso was previously identified from zzso leaves as the toxic principle responsible for zzso zzso necrosis and zzso in zzso zzso Here we used a zzso mouse model to confirm that zzso has a similar zzso for the zzso zzso zzso Further in zzso studies in a panel of human breast cancer cell lines show that zzso selectively zzso a zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso zzso in sensitive zzso The latter is dependent on expression of the zzso protein zzso zzso is a sensor of zzso integrity, and there is evidence that zzso acts as a zzso zzso Due to the unique structure of the compound, zzso could represent a novel class of zzso agent with potential specificity for breast zzso
