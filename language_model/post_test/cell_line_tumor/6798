We recently demonstrated that the pattern recognition receptors zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in mouse zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Here we report the zzso of zzso the zzso for bacterial zzso and its distinctive zzso during experimental zzso zzso from normal zzso mice and those with zzso sodium zzso zzso colitis were zzso Each gut was divided into seven segments zzso small zzso zzso zzso and colon zzso zzso and zzso cells and zzso units were collected by scraping and zzso treatment, zzso Northern zzso showed that zzso zzso was zzso expressed in the zzso of the zzso colon in normal zzso zzso capture zzso coupled to reverse zzso zzso confirmed this zzso zzso protein expression reflected zzso zzso as evidenced by Western zzso In mice with acute zzso inflammation occurred mainly in the zzso zzso Interestingly, while zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in the inflamed zzso zzso was zzso at both the zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso expression was more evident during chronic zzso Additional in zzso studies using a mouse cell line, zzso showed that gamma zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso cells, mainly in the zzso zzso zzso express zzso zzso expression is zzso in zzso during acute and chronic zzso zzso in contrast to the expression of zzso zzso and zzso The mechanism governing zzso regulation may therefore differ from that controlling other zzso Finally, zzso may be involved in zzso zzso zzso
