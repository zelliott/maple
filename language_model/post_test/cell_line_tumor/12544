zzso are attractive zzso for gene therapy because of their stability in zzso and the possibility of production at high zzso Despite exciting zzso data with various approaches, there are only a few examples of clear efficacy in clinical zzso zzso gene delivery to target cells remains the key variable determining efficacy and thus enhanced zzso methods are zzso 

We found that heated serum could enhance zzso 5 zzso gene delivery up to zzso A new zzso interaction was found between fiber zzso and serum zzso but this was not responsible for the observed zzso Instead, we found that heating caused the calcium and zzso present in the serum mix to zzso and this was responsible for enhanced gene zzso This finding could have relevance for designing zzso experiments with zzso since calcium and zzso are present in many zzso To translate this into an approach potentially testable in patients, we used calcium zzso in zzso zzso zzso both of which are clinically approved, to increase zzso gene transfer up to zzso in zzso Gene transfer was increased with or without heating and in a manner independent from the zzso zzso In zzso in mouse studies, gene delivery was increased zzso zzso 12- and zzso to tumors, zzso heart and liver and did not result in increased zzso zzso zzso zzso efficacy of a replication competent virus was also increased zzso 

In zzso zzso gene transfer and zzso efficacy can be enhanced by calcium zzso in zzso zzso zzso
