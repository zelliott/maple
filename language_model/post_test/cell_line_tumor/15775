zzso zzso also called zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed on the surface of tumor cells and stimulates adjacent zzso or tumor cells to produce zzso zzso zzso It has been shown that zzso plays an important role in growth, development, cell zzso and tumor zzso zzso zzso are a class of short zzso zzso coding zzso of zzso zzso zzso that function as zzso regulators of gene expression by zzso to their target zzso and thereby mediate zzso of target zzso or zzso zzso In this study, zzso one of the zzso family members, was investigated for its effect on the growth and zzso of the mouse melanoma cell line zzso We have shown that zzso can suppress the expression of zzso in zzso cells and also provided evidence that this suppression could result in the indirect suppression of zzso The ability of zzso cells zzso with zzso to invade or migrate was significantly zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso cells displayed an zzso of both cellular proliferation and colony zzso Furthermore, it was shown that the zzso of zzso in zzso cells could reduce lung zzso Taken together, the present study identifies zzso as a tumor zzso that zzso cancer cell proliferation and migration as well as tumor zzso in mouse melanoma zzso
