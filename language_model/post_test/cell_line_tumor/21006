zzso cells are zzso cells spread along the zzso zzso Their principal function is to promote the zzso of zzso However, little is known about other functions that these cells may play, since they are difficult to study as a whole zzso organ due to their diffuse zzso It is known that the zzso zzso barrier is actively involved in the host defense against pathogen zzso Here we applied gene expression profiling to characterize the response of the human zzso zzso cell line to zzso and pathological stimuli zzso by fatty acids zzso zzso and zzso zzso We observed that these cells participate in an innate immune reaction to pathogens through the expression of zzso factors zzso zzso and 3 and zzso that we could validate by molecular and zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso has been recently found zzso in the inflamed zzso of patients affected by inflammatory zzso zzso This is very important because modifications of zzso cells during zzso inflammation have been so far considered as secondary effects of the inflammatory status rather than due to direct zzso cell zzso As expected, zzso exposure zzso zzso genes and the production of zzso but it does not enhance the expression of zzso zzso The present observations zzso a new aspect of the cross talk between immune and zzso system and suggest zzso cells as important contributors of inflammatory processes occurring in the gut in response to pathogen exposure and direct enhancers of the inflammatory status associated with human inflammatory zzso zzso
