zzso zzso strains harboring the zzso zzso island zzso have been associated with more severe gastric disease in infected zzso The zzso zzso encodes a type IV zzso zzso system required for zzso zzso into host cells as well as induction of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso genes sharing sequence similarity with zzso components from other bacteria are essential for zzso zzso zzso Other zzso zzso genes are also essential for zzso zzso but lack of zzso or structural similarity with genes in existing databases has precluded a functional assignment for the zzso zzso We have studied the role of one such zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and determined zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso is membrane associated and zzso with predicted inner and outer membrane zzso zzso components that are essential for zzso zzso as well as putative accessory zzso zzso and zzso experiments revealed specific interactions with zzso and zzso suggesting zzso is a new component of the zzso zzso outer membrane zzso Finally, lack of zzso lowers zzso zzso levels, further indicating zzso makes a zzso with this zzso
