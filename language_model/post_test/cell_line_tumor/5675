zzso DNA zzso is zzso associated with zzso gene expression and zzso zzso Here we describe a method for rapid and sensitive detection of zzso DNA zzso without the need for zzso conversion, zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso DNA is first specifically recognized by an zzso zzso zzso and zzso labeled by a zzso zzso labeled, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The formed zzso of zzso DNA can be efficiently focused and separated from the DNA zzso secondary zzso by zzso zzso zzso The free fluorescent dye zzso with the zzso However, by taking advantage of online zzso zzso polarization detection zzso the target zzso can be distinguished and accurately measured from the overlapped dye without further zzso The developed method is highly sensitive with a zzso of zzso zzso and is highly specific for the detection of zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso is rapid zzso zzso for one zzso and only zzso less than zzso zzso of zzso zzso The method was validated by examining human cell lines treated by zzso inhibitor zzso at low doses (10 zzso zzso Because of its sensitivity and speed, our method will be zzso for rapid zzso evaluation and for the study of zzso and zzso zzso
