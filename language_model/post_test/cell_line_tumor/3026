zzso zzso has been found to have zzso properties against a variety of zzso through different zzso However, clinical trials involving systemic administration of zzso have been hampered by secondary toxicity and the short zzso of zzso in the zzso In order to circumvent these limitations, we have developed an zzso viral zzso zzso zzso approach to deliver zzso to zzso In this study, we tested the efficacy of zzso local delivery of zzso for the treatment of zzso in zzso zzso zzso is an ideal candidate for zzso zzso treatment because target cell zzso and, therefore, zzso delivery can be contained within the zzso environment, thereby minimizing systemic zzso We report here that zzso cell lines exhibit zzso responses to zzso consistent with previous studies on a variety of tumor cell zzso zzso injection of zzso resulted in efficient retinal infection and sustained zzso production in the eye with minimal systemic zzso zzso spread outside of the eye was not zzso Using our zzso zzso model of zzso we found that zzso injection of zzso had a potent zzso effect in zzso These data suggest that zzso delivery of zzso may provide a complementary approach to systemic chemotherapy which is the standard of care for zzso around the zzso
