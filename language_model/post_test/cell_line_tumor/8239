To establish if zzso zzso regulation region zzso is zzso in gastric cancer and its influence in gastric zzso 

The zzso islands in zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso Express zzso zzso The region from zzso to zzso zzso (the zzso initiation site of zzso was designated as zzso that contained 19 zzso sites was chosen for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The gastric cancer cell line zzso was treated with zzso zzso 1 zzso for 3 zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in treated zzso cells was measured through zzso clone zzso and their zzso expression was measured by quantitative zzso The cell cycle and zzso were observed with flow zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso double zzso The prevalence of zzso zzso zzso was investigated in 170 gastric cancer tissue samples and the adjacent normal zzso by zzso The correlation of zzso zzso zzso with zzso expression or with patients' clinical features was zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso was observed in zzso cells and a subset of gastric cancer zzso zzso zzso while no zzso amplification products were observed in any normal zzso by zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was correlated zzso with zzso expression zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso zzso was not related to the gastric cancer patients' clinical features, such as sex, age of zzso clinical stage, zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells was almost converted to zzso after zzso treatment, which increased zzso expression zzso zzso zzso times; zzso zzso 3) and zzso rate zzso zzso zzso times; P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso is present in a subset of gastric zzso and correlated zzso with zzso zzso This may be an early event in gastric zzso and a new treatment zzso
