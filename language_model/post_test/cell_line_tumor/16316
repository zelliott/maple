In recent years, our knowledge on zzso receptors zzso has been modified profoundly with the identification and the deciphering of the role of its protein zzso as well zzso the deeper insight of its molecular zzso zzso characteristics associated with its zzso shuttling zzso Also, significant progress has been made concerning its zzso and associated final zzso degradation zzso These advances could lead in the near future to the design and the synthesis of novel zzso zzso Recently, a number of zzso peptides acting as specific zzso zzso have been identified and extensively studied with respect to their zzso zzso Among them, zzso a synthetic analog of the zzso sequence of zzso has been shown to exert zzso effects by interacting in the close vicinity of its hinge region zzso zzso zzso this sequence appears as the epicenter of a number of zzso modifications as well as of the recruitment of zzso suggesting that it would play a key role in zzso zzso Here, we provide evidence that zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso breast cancer cells by an zzso membrane zzso triggering major zzso signaling zzso Finally, zzso zzso the zzso of breast zzso cancer tumor zzso without apparent zzso suggesting that it could represent a new attractive tool for the development of future promising therapeutic approaches, and providing a novel insight to zzso regulation of cell zzso
