To study expression of proteins previously connected to zzso response in zzso cancer patients, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso after zzso in colon cancer cells to gain standing ground for further studies of pathways and zzso 

Three colon cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso with one origin were radiated with zzso zzso was determined with cell cycle, survival fraction at 5 zzso zzso and zzso analysis and protein expression by Western zzso 

Following zzso zzso showed no cell cycle arrest, and low zzso and zzso whilst zzso showed high zzso and zzso zzso had moderate zzso After zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased in zzso and the zzso factor zzso increased in zzso 

The cell lines seem to have evolved different protein patterns regarding the studied proteins and partly therefore developed different resistance mechanisms, less zzso for zzso and continued proliferation for zzso after zzso
