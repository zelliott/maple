zzso protein zzso zzso plays an essential role in restraining tumor progression as it may zzso by itself or within zzso complexes, many proteins zzso zzso zzso involved in cell growth and zzso This study takes advantage of the recent finding that zzso may repress the zzso zzso zzso Thus, we investigated whether zzso zzso may zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso levels (a zzso target zzso and the role of zzso in this regulation, in order to consider zzso as a tool for novel zzso zzso zzso 

The regulation of zzso expression by zzso was evaluated by using zzso zzso with zzso reporter zzso after zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Relative zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were assessed by zzso zzso zzso following zzso zzso while zzso protein levels were evaluated by western zzso 

zzso zzso in tumor cells zzso zzso zzso levels and zzso promoter zzso The zzso zzso was partly depending on zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso could induce zzso protein degradation that was prevented by cell treatment with zzso inhibitor zzso The zzso degradation was dependent on zzso zzso activity and independent of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These results suggest that zzso might be a target of zzso at least in part, through regulation of zzso zzso These findings support the function of zzso as tumor zzso and zzso a role for zzso as zzso tool in tumor therapy zzso
