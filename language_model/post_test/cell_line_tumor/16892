zzso of zzso is crucial for monitoring treatment effects in zzso research and should be based on zzso data rather than conventional zzso zzso to obtain optimal zzso However, data assessment is greatly complicated in the case of zzso zzso This paper presents an automated method to follow zzso zzso zzso and visually over time in zzso zzso data of zzso 

This novel approach is based on a previously published approach to zzso locate zzso structures of interest in the data and present them in a standardized manner zzso et zzso zzso Image zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we extend this framework by presenting a highly accurate way to automatically measure the volumes of individual bones and demonstrate the technique by following the effect of zzso in the zzso of a mouse over zzso Besides presenting quantitative results, we also give a zzso of the measured volume to be able to investigate the performance of the method zzso In addition, we describe an approach to measure and zzso cortical bone zzso which allows assessing local effects of zzso and bone zzso The presented techniques are fully automated and therefore allow obtaining objective results, which are independent of human observer performance zzso In addition, the time typically required to analyze zzso data is greatly zzso 

zzso of the approaches was performed using zzso follow-up zzso of 15 mice zzso with induced bone zzso in the right zzso All animals were scanned three times: at zzso after 3 and zzso For each zzso our method was used to locate the zzso and measure the bone zzso To assess the performance of the automated method, bone volume zzso were also done by two human zzso A quantitative comparison of the results of the automated method with the human observers showed that there is a high correlation between the observers zzso between the first observer and the presented method zzso and also between the second observer and the presented method zzso In addition, zzso plots revealed excellent agreement between the observers and the automated method zzso bone volume zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis yielded no significant difference zzso between the manual and the automated bone zzso and thus the method yields optimum zzso This could also be confirmed zzso based on the zzso representations of the bone zzso The performance of the bone thickness zzso was assessed zzso 

We come to the conclusion that the presented method allows to measure and zzso local bone volume and thickness in zzso data in an accurate and robust manner, proving that the automated tool is a fast and user friendly alternative to manual zzso
