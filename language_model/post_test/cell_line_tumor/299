zzso trials have indicated that cancer cells with high zzso activity exhibit decreased sensitivity to zzso zzso Moreover, recent research has proved that a specific inhibitor of zzso II, which is a key zzso zzso may enhance the activity of zzso zzso The purpose of this study is to further investigate the effect and mechanisms of zzso II on zzso of colon cancer cells to zzso 

The expression of zzso II gene was down regulated by zzso interference in colon cancer cell line zzso then the zzso value of zzso to zzso cells was carried out by zzso zzso zzso and the protein expression of zzso II and zzso zzso by Western zzso analysis Meanwhile, cell zzso and zzso membrane potential were assessed by flow zzso zzso activity was also determined by its zzso color zzso 

zzso of the zzso II gene of zzso cells resulted in decreased zzso value of zzso and increased zzso rate, zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso II of zzso cells induced loss of zzso membrane potential, zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest targeting zzso II has a potential role in the combination zzso treatments of colon zzso
