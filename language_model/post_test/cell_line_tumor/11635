We reported that iron influx drives the zzso expression of the zzso zzso precursor protein zzso which has a role in iron zzso This is via a classic release of zzso interaction of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso controls the zzso zzso the zzso and zzso of the iron storage zzso zzso Here, we identified thirteen potent zzso translation zzso that acted selectively towards the uniquely configured zzso element zzso zzso stem loop in the zzso untranslated region zzso of zzso zzso These agents were zzso less zzso of zzso sequences of the related prion protein zzso zzso Western zzso confirmed that the zzso small zzso in the series selectively reduced neural zzso production in zzso cells at zzso zzso without affecting viability or the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso reduced the production of toxic zzso in zzso zzso cells to a greater extent than other well tolerated zzso zzso translation blockers, including zzso that were shown to limit zzso burden in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso binding zzso demonstrated that zzso operated by preventing zzso from binding to the zzso in zzso zzso while maintaining zzso interaction with the zzso zzso zzso stem zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso translation driven by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso did not indirectly change iron zzso in zzso cells suggesting a direct interaction with the zzso zzso These studies provide key data to develop small molecules that selectively reduce neural zzso and zzso production at zzso lower zzso than related previously characterized translation zzso Our data evidenced a novel therapeutic strategy of potential impact for people with zzso of the zzso gene on zzso 21, which is a zzso long associated with Down syndrome zzso that can also cause familial Alzheimer's zzso
