The zzso protein zzso stimulates zzso progression through both zzso and zzso zzso zzso activities of zzso include stimulation of zzso regulation of cell death and increased cell zzso and invasion, but the exact molecular mechanisms by which zzso zzso exerts these effects are incompletely zzso The aim of the present study was to characterize zzso signal zzso mechanisms and to identify zzso target zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso activates the zzso factor zzso in a subset of human cancer cell lines through induction of zzso and subsequent degradation of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso induced a sustained zzso of the zzso zzso zzso whereas no increased activity of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso was zzso zzso analyses identified 136 genes as being significantly regulated by zzso treatment, and potentially interesting zzso gene products include zzso zzso zzso and zzso Increased expression of zzso and zzso was validated using zzso Western zzso and functional zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of these target genes was dependent on zzso of the zzso zzso In conclusion, these findings contribute to the understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse biological functions of zzso zzso and provide further evidence of how zzso may stimulate zzso zzso
