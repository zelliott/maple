Nuclear zzso zzso activated in multiple myeloma zzso cells by zzso cues, zzso resistance to zzso The zzso zzso zzso targets zzso However, its therapeutic potential in zzso is not zzso 

We explored the effects of zzso on zzso cells in the context of the bone zzso zzso 

zzso inhibited growth of zzso cells lines, including drug-resistant cell lines, and primary cells in a zzso zzso zzso overcame the zzso effects of zzso zzso and zzso growth factor I, whereas the zzso of zzso cells to bone zzso zzso cells partially protected zzso cells against zzso zzso In addition, zzso blocked zzso zzso from bone zzso zzso cells triggered by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is both zzso and zzso zzso rapidly induced zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso and zzso zzso rapidly zzso cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and direct targeting of cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso protein using small interfering zzso zzso inhibited zzso cell growth and lowered the zzso concentration required for growth zzso An additive effect and zzso were observed when zzso was combined with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso has multifaceted zzso effects toward both zzso cells and the bone zzso zzso Our data support the clinical development of zzso in zzso zzso
