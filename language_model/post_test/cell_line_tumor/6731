Many zzso zzso including proteins with long zzso or zzso zzso cause human zzso zzso proteins may also be present in the tissue of zzso diseases as a result of zzso of the primary zzso zzso repeat zzso We have generated a zzso model expressing green fluorescent protein zzso to 37 zzso that zzso both toxicity and inclusion formation in various zzso Surprisingly, we show that this zzso protein with a zzso expansion can also protect against zzso zzso which can be explained by induction of zzso zzso A zzso response was also seen in an zzso muscular zzso mouse model expressing an authentic zzso zzso We also show that long zzso can protect against a zzso stimulus or the toxicity caused by the long zzso zzso Thus, zzso of an zzso protein without any normal functions can result in both zzso and protective effects in cell culture and in zzso
