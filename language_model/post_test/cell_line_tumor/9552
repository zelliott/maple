New drugs are urgently needed for improved therapy for zzso 

zzso novel compounds were evaluated in two melanoma and one normal skin cell lines to identify potential lead compounds with high potency and zzso zzso of action for the best compound were also zzso 

Three potent lead structures zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified, with zzso having both excellent potency and high selectivity when compared with zzso a drug used extensively in clinical trials for zzso zzso the effect of the lead compound showed that it induced DNA degradation consistent with zzso cell zzso 

The lead structure represents a novel class of compounds that can be further zzso for potential drug to treat advanced zzso
