Heat shock protein 90 zzso is required for structural folding and maintenance of zzso integrity of various zzso including several associated with cellular zzso Recent studies utilizing zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso demonstrated an zzso effect in solid zzso To test whether zzso could be targeted in multiple myeloma zzso patients, we first investigated expression of zzso by zzso and flow zzso analysis in a myeloma cell line zzso and primary myeloma zzso Following demonstration of zzso expression in myeloma cells, archival samples of 32 zzso patients were zzso by zzso zzso zzso cells in all patients showed strong zzso expression of zzso in all samples and zzso also demonstrated concurrent nuclear zzso Treatment of zzso and primary zzso cells with zzso resulted in significantly increased zzso compared to zzso control zzso Analysis of zzso zzso family proteins and zzso in zzso cells incubated with zzso revealed zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, although a low concentration of zzso resulted in no cell death, a combination of zzso and zzso treatment revealed a synergistic zzso effect on the zzso cell zzso These data suggest that targeted zzso of zzso may prove to be a valid and innovative strategy for the development of future therapeutic options for zzso zzso
