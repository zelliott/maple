To observe the zzso effects of zzso zzso and investigate the relationship between zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso in zzso cancer zzso 

Thirty zzso mice zzso models with human stomach cancer cell zzso were established and divided randomly into 3 groups of 10 zzso zzso one zzso zzso inhibitor belonging to zzso zzso drugs (a series of zzso zzso known as zzso and zzso one selective zzso inhibitor zzso as zzso were orally administered to mice of treatment zzso zzso was used to examine the expression of zzso zzso and zzso density zzso zzso was detected by using zzso zzso 

zzso in zzso and zzso groups were significantly smaller than those in control group from the second week after drug administration ( zzso In treatment group, the cell proliferation index was lower ( zzso and zzso index was higher ( zzso than those in control zzso Compared with the controls, zzso density was reduced ( zzso and expression of zzso on tumor cells was weakened ( zzso in treatment zzso 

zzso zzso have zzso effects on gastric zzso They play important roles in zzso and zzso or zzso of stomach zzso The zzso effects of zzso zzso may include inducing zzso suppressing zzso reducing zzso and weakening zzso
