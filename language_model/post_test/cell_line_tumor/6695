zzso of zzso and substitution of a zzso for the zzso zzso at the zzso of zzso zzso has resulted in improved zzso and tumor targeting of its zzso zzso Yet, these peptides are very susceptible to in zzso zzso due to the similarity of zzso zzso to zzso zzso The goal of this work was to develop zzso zzso containing both a sugar zzso and a zzso prosthetic group on which a zzso or zzso can be zzso zzso synthesis and subsequent modifications delivered an zzso standard of the target zzso zzso zzso and the corresponding tin precursor zzso zzso zzso displaced zzso from zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso rat pancreatic tumor cell zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso retained affinity to zzso zzso was zzso to zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso yields, zzso From a zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso cells, the maximum specific zzso zzso from zzso was zzso zzso zzso of input dose compared to zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso Over a 4 h period, the extent of zzso of zzso and zzso was similar in this cell zzso In zzso zzso zzso subcutaneous zzso the zzso of zzso at zzso 1 and 4 h was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In comparison, these values for zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Both in zzso and in zzso zzso studies did not suggest the severance of the zzso along with its zzso from the zzso Taken together, although zzso maintained affinity to zzso its tumor zzso both in zzso and in zzso was substantially lower than that of zzso suggesting other factors such as net charge and overall geometry of the zzso may be zzso
