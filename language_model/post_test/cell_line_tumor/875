As previously demonstrated, the synthetic zzso acid derivatives mediate zzso properties in a variety of human cancer zzso In the present study, the effects of the synthetic derivatives of zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso on the proliferation of zzso human colon cancer cells were zzso Whereas zzso and zzso had no effect on the growth of cells in the concentration ranges we have tested, zzso and zzso completely inhibited cell zzso while zzso and zzso showed weak zzso zzso zzso zzso of cell cycle parameters and zzso by flow zzso showed that the synthetic zzso acid derivatives produced the arrest of cell cycle progression at the zzso phase and ensuing increase of zzso zzso which resulted in the induction of zzso The induction of zzso was confirmed by observation of zzso of zzso zzso and DNA zzso Furthermore, Western zzso analysis showed decreased expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A, zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the synthetic zzso acid derivatives markedly induced the level of zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Furthermore, the exposure of cells to the synthetic zzso acid derivatives resulted in a decrease in the level of zzso and enhanced binding between zzso and zzso Based on these data, these synthetic zzso acid derivatives may serve as potential lead compounds in the treatment of colon zzso
