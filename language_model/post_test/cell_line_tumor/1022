zzso is a newly established acute zzso leukemia zzso cell line from a zzso patient clinically resistant to both zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso The line was initially derived as a zzso zzso zzso strain that underwent zzso zzso and, following zzso treatment, as a zzso similar immortalized zzso zzso was associated with broadened zzso sensitivity but not growth zzso in contrast to three previously derived zzso zzso Both the zzso strain and line had shortened zzso and low zzso activity, while the line had higher expression of many genes associated with zzso zzso The zzso was zzso the unique zzso was observed in zzso zzso zzso cells at previous zzso on zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain zzso This was associated with a zzso and sharpening of the zzso maturation response compared to zzso zzso cells, which corresponded to the zzso zzso by zzso of a zzso zzso reporter zzso in zzso zzso zzso also zzso relative resistance to zzso zzso at zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso limited zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso will be useful for further assessing molecular elements involved in zzso progression and drug zzso
