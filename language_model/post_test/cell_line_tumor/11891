zzso of the zzso gene occur as frequent events in several human zzso Replacement of zzso zzso zzso gene has been shown to induce suppression of zzso of human zzso cells in nude mice and zzso zzso transcripts have been observed in a variety of human solid zzso In the presence study, we performed a zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso analysis to identify zzso zzso transcripts in 6 gastric cancer cell zzso In addition to the zzso zzso transcript, zzso transcripts with various number and lengths were observed in all of the cell lines zzso zzso analysis confirmed that different types of truncated transcripts included zzso zzso insertions of zzso 5 sequences between zzso and combinations of zzso Most of these transcripts lacked zzso 5 in which translation initiation zzso is zzso zzso transcripts with partial zzso zzso resulting from zzso of cryptic zzso sites, were also observed in 5 cell zzso Additionally, zzso zzso patterns, indicative of additional downstream processing, were observed in several cancer zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso transcripts in gastric cancer cell lines resulted from faulty zzso including zzso zzso selection of cryptic zzso site and additional downstream zzso zzso
