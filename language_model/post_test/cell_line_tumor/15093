zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso is considered to be a promising zzso agent because its active form TRAIL zzso is able to induce zzso in different tumor cell lines while sparing normal zzso However, TRAIL zzso possesses a short zzso and low stability, which turns out to be a major obstacle for the development of clinical zzso In our present study, we constructed a zzso TRAIL zzso by genetic fusion of zzso domain zzso of human collagen zzso or its zzso domain zzso to zzso of TRAIL via a flexible zzso and then zzso the fusion proteins using a zzso zzso approach, namely a combination of dilution and gel zzso zzso As a result, both zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso coli as inclusion bodies, and they exhibited zzso to zzso efficiently by conventional zzso zzso we applied a modified zzso zzso approach to zzso fusion zzso More than zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso protein activity was recovered during the zzso zzso approach, and their stability was also increased zzso Also, size exclusion zzso showed zzso zzso was a zzso while zzso zzso However, both of them exerted good zzso activity on zzso zzso
