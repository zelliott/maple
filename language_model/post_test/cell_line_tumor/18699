The zzso factor signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso 3 is activated through the zzso family of zzso and by binding of growth factors to the zzso growth factor zzso zzso It plays an essential role in embryonic development and assumes specialized tasks in many differentiated zzso zzso activated zzso has been found in tumor cell lines and primary tumors and plays a crucial role in tumor cell survival and zzso To inhibit the zzso action of zzso in tumor cells, we have selected short zzso so-called zzso zzso which specifically interact with defined functional zzso of this zzso zzso The zzso zzso were selected from a zzso library of high complexity by an adaptation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically interacting with the zzso zzso domain caused zzso of DNA binding activity and suppression of zzso by zzso in zzso zzso Similarly, a zzso zzso selected for its ability to recognize the zzso DNA binding domain inhibited DNA binding and zzso by zzso following zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso were expressed in bacteria as fusion proteins with a protein zzso domain and introduced into human myeloma zzso This resulted in zzso growth zzso zzso of zzso zzso and induction of zzso The zzso of zzso functions through the interaction with zzso zzso zzso the transformed zzso and could become useful in targeted tumor zzso
