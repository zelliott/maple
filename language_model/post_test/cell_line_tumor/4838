zzso has been shown to zzso disease related symptoms and to prolong overall survival in pancreatic zzso resistance to zzso is commonly observed in this zzso entity and has been linked to increased expression of zzso zzso We therefore investigated if and to what extend zzso of zzso by specific zzso zzso might enhance zzso effects in human pancreatic zzso zzso zzso was zzso into the pancreatic cancer cell line zzso C alone and 72 zzso before zzso with different zzso of zzso Total protein and zzso were extracted for zzso analysis and quantitative zzso chain zzso zzso cancer zzso in male nude mice were treated zzso with zzso alone, zzso and control zzso or zzso and zzso for 21 zzso Combination of both methods lead to a synergistic induction of zzso at otherwise ineffective zzso of zzso zzso growth suppression was also zzso by the combined treatment with zzso and zzso in zzso and lead to increased zzso zzso In contrast, zzso human zzso zzso showed only minor responses to this zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso zzso enhances chemotherapy sensitivity in human pancreatic cancer cells in zzso and might lead to improved therapy responses in advanced stages of this zzso
