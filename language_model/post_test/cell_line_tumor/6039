Since clinical application of conventional cancer therapies is usually limited by drug resistance and toxic side effects, combination of zzso agents with gene therapy appears as an attractive therapeutic strategy to overcome these zzso Being selectively expressed in tumor zzso zzso is a promising target for the development of zzso strategies aimed at eliminating tumor cells while sparing normal zzso In this work, we achieved substantial protein zzso in a number of human cell lines, zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells which zzso zzso after treatment with zzso zzso which was associated with a significant reduction of cell zzso when compared to treatment with control zzso Interestingly, when the zzso approach was combined with a zzso agent, an enhancement of the therapeutic effect was zzso Treatment with zzso zzso resulted in high levels of zzso zzso zzso and an enhancement of this effect was observed when zzso zzso was combined with zzso In addition, we showed that for zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso contributes to the zzso of cell resistance to zzso Overall, we demonstrate that the combination of a zzso zzso strategy with zzso agents constitutes a valuable approach for cancer zzso
