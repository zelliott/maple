The efficacy of zzso therapy zzso for zzso zzso is increased when zzso is combined with zzso zzso zzso a form of differentiation therapy zzso Here, we describe an underlying mechanism for this zzso zzso agents are known to zzso zzso proteins zzso powerful regulators of cellular zzso In subcutaneous zzso tumors in mice, zzso with zzso D induced the expression of zzso zzso and of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso responsible for the conversion of zzso acid zzso into zzso IX zzso the principal zzso zzso during zzso To further investigate this apparent link between zzso and zzso two cell lines zzso and zzso were exposed to zzso agents, and levels of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso agents, or zzso of zzso expression zzso increased zzso and zzso levels in zzso Focusing on approximately 1,300 zzso of upstream zzso gene promoter, we tested the ability of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to bind to zzso gene sequences zzso mobility shift zzso zzso zzso and to affect zzso activity zzso zzso Multiple zzso consensus binding sites were identified (15 for zzso 18 for zzso Individual zzso representing each site bound to zzso with characteristic affinities zzso moderate, or zzso but when sites were zzso in the context of the native promoter, zzso activity was reduced nearly equally for strong or weak zzso Cooperative interactions between regularly spaced zzso sites seem critical for zzso zzso regulation by differentiation zzso These results provide a zzso rationale for zzso combination therapy for zzso
