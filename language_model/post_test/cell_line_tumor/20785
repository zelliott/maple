We have already reported that zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling is an important zzso in regulating radiation sensitivity and DNA zzso break zzso repair of human tumor zzso In the present study, we investigated the effect of zzso on zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso repair in zzso zzso cell lung cancer cell lines zzso and zzso Treatment of cells with the specific zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso survival between zzso and zzso and enhanced radiation sensitivity of both cell lines zzso As indicated by zzso cell sorting analysis zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment or zzso with zzso interfering zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso but not of zzso zzso However, in either zzso zzso or zzso zzso cells, zzso and/or zzso did not enhance zzso zzso zzso and zzso following zzso zzso of cells with zzso or zzso with zzso strongly inhibited zzso zzso of zzso at zzso and zzso as well as repair of zzso as measured by the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments showed a complex formation of activated zzso and zzso supporting the assumption that zzso plays an important regulatory role in the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso Thus, targeting of zzso enhances radiation sensitivity of lung cancer cell lines zzso and zzso most likely through specific zzso of zzso zzso repair but not through enhancement of zzso zzso
