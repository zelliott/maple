zzso zzso is a zzso to a zzso zzso zzso for both the vascular zzso growth factor zzso family and zzso zzso family zzso zzso plays versatile roles in zzso zzso guidance, cell survival, migration, and zzso zzso contains three distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We report here the identification of two novel soluble human zzso zzso which we named zzso and zzso These soluble zzso zzso were generated by alternative zzso of the zzso zzso a common regulatory mechanism occurring in cell surface zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso contain zzso and zzso zzso but no c domain, and the rest of the zzso zzso Additionally, zzso is missing 48 zzso acids within the zzso of the zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are expressed in human zzso and normal zzso These molecules are capable of binding to zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and zzso proteins inhibit zzso zzso breast cancer cell zzso These results indicate the multiple levels of regulation in zzso function and suggest that these two novel zzso zzso are useful zzso for zzso cellular zzso
