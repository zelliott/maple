To investigate the effects of zzso and zzso representatives of the zzso and specific zzso zzso zzso and selective zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso respectively, on body weight, zzso behavior, locomotor activity and tumor growth of human pancreatic zzso zzso in nude zzso 

A subcutaneous zzso model of human pancreatic cancer cell line zzso was established in nude zzso The zzso mice were randomly divided into zzso group (10 zzso per zzso zzso group (10 zzso per day) and control group (an equivalent normal saline zzso (7 mice in each zzso zzso of all drugs were administered orally, once a day for 42 zzso zzso volume and body weight were measured zzso Food intake was recorded once a zzso zzso activity was detected weekly using an open field test zzso 

Compared to the zzso zzso significantly increased food intake from d 14 to 42 and attenuated the rate of weight loss from d 28 to 42 zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Compared to the control group, food intake was significantly suppressed from d 21 to 42 and weight loss was promoted from d 35 to 42 in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was a significant difference in body weight of the mice after removal of tumors among the three zzso The body weight of mice was the heaviest zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso ) zzso zzso P zzso zzso The behavioral test on d 7 showed that the horizontal and vertical activities were significantly increased in the zzso group compared with the zzso and control groups zzso zzso ) zzso zzso P zzso zzso These effects disappeared in the zzso and zzso groups during 2-6 zzso The grooming activity was higher in the zzso group than in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso ) zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in the second zzso There was no significant difference in tumor volume and tumor weight of the three zzso 

zzso and zzso have no effect on the growth of pancreatic zzso However, zzso can significantly increase food intake and improve nutrition compared with zzso in a pancreatic cancer mouse zzso
