The zzso zzso zzso activates the zzso zzso and thereby promotes zzso reorganization of the zzso zzso also contributes to zzso communication through association with zzso Although functional zzso of zzso is implicated in cellular zzso the role of the zzso interaction in zzso has been zzso A soluble zzso zzso zzso has now been shown to bind to zzso zzso zzso but not to zzso zzso melanoma zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso which prevents zzso processing, restored the ability of zzso derived from these cells to bind zzso in zzso indicating that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso binding in zzso zzso zzso inhibited the migration of zzso cells but not that of zzso zzso However, a zzso zzso that zzso with zzso on both zzso and zzso cells inhibited the migration of both cell types zzso zzso binding induced zzso degradation of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso reduced the level of zzso zzso of focal zzso zzso and this effect was reversed by zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso binds to and thereby zzso zzso on adjacent cells, resulting in zzso of cell zzso Resistance to this zzso mechanism may contribute to the highly zzso potential of zzso zzso
