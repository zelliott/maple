zzso cells release several factors that can help the progression of the tumor by directly supporting tumor growth and/or suppressing host zzso zzso Here, we report that human primary breast tumor cells not only express elevated levels of heat shock protein 27 zzso at the zzso level but also release extremely high levels of zzso compared with the same patients' serum zzso levels, predicting an acutely increased concentration of soluble zzso in the human breast tumor zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso levels in the zzso can be extremely elevated as evidenced by high soluble zzso levels in patients' tumor zzso zzso Because increasing numbers of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso correlate to patients' clinical outcomes and we have previously reported the zzso activity of soluble zzso here, we tested for any specific effects of soluble zzso on human zzso to zzso zzso We demonstrate that soluble zzso causes the differentiation of zzso to zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We detected the presence of zzso with similar zzso in breast cancer zzso zzso zzso induce severe zzso in T zzso Moreover, these zzso lose zzso activity but become extremely zzso inducing significant zzso a process that is critically important for tumor zzso Thus, our data demonstrate a novel immune escape and tumor zzso mechanism zzso by soluble zzso that may be operative in human breast zzso
