The expression of zzso has been reported to be significantly zzso in zzso zzso We showed here that zzso of zzso in zzso cancer cells dramatically increased cell zzso and inhibited cell zzso migration and invasion as well as tumor growth and zzso zzso zzso We subsequently identified that small zzso Ran was a target gene of zzso Furthermore, Ran restoration partially zzso the tumor zzso effects of zzso and increased zzso zzso Taken together, our findings suggest that zzso may act as novel tumor zzso in zzso cancer through zzso the expression of Ran and zzso
