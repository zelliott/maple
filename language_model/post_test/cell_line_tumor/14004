zzso and zzso zzso degradation are key events in zzso zzso and factors regulating zzso interactions and zzso composition are potential targets for the development of novel zzso zzso Here, we examine the expression of zzso a zzso zzso with zzso properties, in brain zzso Using quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso high, equivalent expression of zzso was found in normal whole brain, cerebral cortex, frontal zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression in 34 brain zzso (including 22 high-grade zzso and four zzso cell lines indicated at least zzso reduction in zzso compared to normal whole brain in all zzso zzso and no zzso expression in 14 out of 34 zzso zzso or four out of four zzso cell zzso In contrast, differential expression of zzso and zzso was seen in nine out of 15 zzso and seven out of 13 zzso zzso with no relationship in the expression of these zzso zzso and Western analysis indicated zzso of zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso indicated promoter zzso in one out of 24 brain zzso (a zzso and three out of four zzso cell lines suggesting an alternative mechanism of zzso These data suggest a role for zzso in brain zzso zzso further investigation into its role in regulation of zzso zzso and local zzso
