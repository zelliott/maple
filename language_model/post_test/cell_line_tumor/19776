Human zzso zzso cells zzso exhibit an increase in zzso zzso and total zzso compounds, as well as a switch from high zzso zzso PC to low zzso PC, with progression to zzso zzso The treatment of human breast cancer cells with a zzso zzso agent, zzso reverted the high zzso zzso pattern to a low zzso zzso pattern indicative of a less zzso zzso supported by decreased zzso Here, we have characterized mechanisms underlying zzso zzso in zzso membrane metabolism in zzso breast cancer cells and zzso zzso labeled with zzso using zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso gene expression analysis was performed to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these zzso In breast cancer cells, zzso treatment activated zzso that, combined with an increased zzso zzso zzso led to increased zzso and decreased PC zzso However, in zzso zzso zzso of the anabolic zzso alone was detected following zzso zzso Following zzso treatment in breast cancer cells, several candidate zzso such as zzso 8, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso which may have contributed to changes in zzso metabolism through secondary effects or signaling zzso leading to changes in zzso zzso
