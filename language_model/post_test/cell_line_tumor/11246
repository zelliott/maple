A newly isolated and characterized zzso zzso strain zzso 3A has been found to produce an zzso zzso zzso which structurally resembled zzso D, earlier reported to be produced by zzso zzso The zzso showed a dose dependent killing of three different human cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso while not affecting the normal cell line zzso zzso zzso zzso when analyzed using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the cells with zzso showed an increase in zzso oxygen species zzso formation in the zzso treated cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso further indicated zzso as a major mechanism of cell death in zzso treated cells and the typical symptoms of zzso including cell zzso nuclear zzso and fragmentation of zzso were zzso zzso treatment induced extensive DNA damage in the treated cells, which was indicated by a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis exhibited zzso concentration dependent zzso which was further confirmed during zzso zzso of the zzso treated zzso
