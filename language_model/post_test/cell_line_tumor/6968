Upon binding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso toxins zzso undergo retrograde transport to reach zzso cleave zzso zzso and inhibit protein zzso zzso induce the zzso stress response and zzso and zzso expression in some cell zzso Signaling mechanisms necessary for zzso expression in the face of zzso protein synthesis zzso are not well zzso zzso may regulate zzso expression via multiple mechanisms involving increased gene transcription, zzso transcript stabilization, and/or increased translation initiation zzso We show that treatment of differentiated zzso cells with zzso zzso resulted in prolonged zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso rapidly triggered transient zzso of zzso and zzso and prolonged zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment with zzso + zzso zzso prolonged zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso zzso by zzso within 4-6 zzso and zzso or zzso + zzso treatment increased zzso zzso by zzso and zzso respectively, within 1 zzso zzso zzso required zzso zzso activity and was zzso by zzso another zzso stress zzso A combination of zzso zzso or a zzso zzso 1 zzso inhibitor blocked zzso zzso by all zzso zzso zzso blocked the transient increase in total protein synthesis detected in zzso cells but failed to block long-term protein synthesis zzso The zzso zzso or zzso inhibitor blocked soluble zzso zzso and zzso production or release by zzso These data suggest that zzso may regulate zzso expression in part through zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso
