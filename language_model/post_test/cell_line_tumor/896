We have previously shown that treatment of human zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso with a DNA zzso II zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso cell zzso However, zzso E6 cells lacking functional zzso due to the expression of human zzso virus type 16 zzso E6 zzso were resistant to zzso In order to gain insight into the roles of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cell death, we used zzso E6 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso were relatively resistant to zzso zzso E6 cells, which lost functional zzso became susceptible to zzso zzso zzso of zzso and formation of zzso by acid zzso but not by neutral zzso were associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso death in zzso E6 cells were modified by the agents which affected zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of acid zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso and then zzso cell zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and zzso zzso which inhibit zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and then augment zzso formation, enhanced zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso cells with functional zzso were relatively resistant to zzso and that zzso may play an important role in zzso zzso during zzso zzso of zzso cells lacking functional zzso
