The zzso zzso belongs to the type II zzso zzso family, and its two zzso receptors are zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression in liver cancer cell lines has not yet been zzso This information may be helpful for further clinical gene zzso 

With normal skin total zzso as template, the zzso sequences of zzso zzso and zzso were amplified by zzso Total zzso was extracted from cultured liver cancer cell lines and a normal liver cell line, then detected by northern zzso and the expression of zzso receptors was zzso 

zzso and zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressed zzso and zzso and zzso expressed zzso Only zzso expressed the zzso zzso zzso zzso completely expressed both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not express the zzso zzso 

Complete zzso receptors are seldom expressed in liver cancer cell zzso
