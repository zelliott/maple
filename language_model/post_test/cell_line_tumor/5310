zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso target zzso expressed by immune cells and are currently being evaluated as zzso in clinical zzso However, zzso signaling can promote some tumor growth and immune zzso such as in multiple myeloma zzso zzso deciphering the effects of zzso zzso on cancer cells will help in preventing these adverse effects and in designing future clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso multiple signaling zzso notably zzso that has been involved in the resistance to zzso Thus, we wondered if zzso zzso could zzso zzso zzso in different models of zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso were protected by zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso By using two fully human, zzso zzso directed against TRAIL receptors zzso and zzso zzso and zzso respectively), we show that the protection was restricted to zzso zzso Similar results were observed for two colon cancer zzso and zzso and two breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso The protection of zzso zzso was zzso by its zzso zzso backbone independent of zzso We next demonstrated by surface zzso resonance that zzso zzso zzso directly bound to either TRAIL or zzso and then decreased their binding to zzso Finally, zzso cell zzso of a zzso zzso cell line zzso through TRAIL was partially inhibited by zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, our results suggest that the zzso modification of zzso zzso could dampen the clinical efficacy of zzso zzso zzso by altering zzso zzso zzso
