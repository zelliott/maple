The zzso transition zzso is emerging as a critical factor for the progression and zzso of zzso as well as drug zzso The zzso zzso factor zzso has been recently characterized as a driver of zzso in human zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to characterize zzso as a potential target for lung cancer zzso 

The expression of zzso was evaluated by zzso and by zzso in human lung tumors and adult normal zzso zzso gene copy number and promoter zzso status were analyzed in tumor zzso with various levels of zzso zzso Lung zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also evaluated relative to the levels of zzso 

Our results showed zzso protein expression in zzso of primary lung zzso including zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso cell zzso With the exception of normal zzso and some zzso zzso the majority of normal zzso evaluated in this study were negative for the expression of zzso zzso zzso T cells could lyse zzso tumors and the level of zzso corresponded to resistance of tumor cells to zzso zzso zzso 

We zzso that the elimination of zzso tumor cells may be able to prevent and/or diminish tumor dissemination and the establishment of zzso The ability of zzso zzso lines to lyse zzso tumor cells, in zzso supports the development of zzso zzso approaches for the treatment of lung zzso
