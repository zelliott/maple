"Recent progress in genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics enables unprecedented opportunities to examine the evolutionary history of molecular, cellular, and developmental pathways through phylogenomics. Accordingly, we have developed a motif analysis tool for phylogenomics (Phylomat, http://alg.ncsa.uiuc.edu/pmat) that scans predicted proteome sets for proteins containing highly conserved amino acid motifs or domains for in silico analysis of the evolutionary history of these motifs/domains. Phylomat enables the user to download results as full protein or extracted motif/domain sequences from each protein. Tables containing the percent distribution of a motif/domain in organisms normalized to proteome size are displayed. Phylomat can also align the set of full protein or extracted motif/domain sequences and predict a neighbor-joining tree from relative sequence similarity. Together, Phylomat serves as a user-friendly data-mining tool for the phylogenomic analysis of conserved sequence motifs/domains in annotated proteomes from the three domains of life.",algorithms,0.2,2,10806.31,10802.43,11057.56,15121.93,17617.12,17914.81,3189.07
"The cultured cell lines Yoshida ascites sarcoma, L-1210 mouse leukemia, OAT cell line derived from human lung cancer of the oat cell type, and P3HR-1 cell line derived from Burkitt's lymphoma have been used for the cell-killing kinetics study of anticancer agents and evaluation of the sensitivity of cells using the soft agar cloning assay method. It has been found that there are 2 types of actions: 1) Type I (cytocidal and concentration-dependent action). The dose survival curves of Type I agents fit the equation log S=log nminuskD (S, surviving fraction; D, concentration of agents; n and k are constant). The sensitivity of cells can be expressed by mean lethal dose 90% (MLD90=1/k). Four cell lines were compared on this basis, and some problems concerning the chemotherapy of human cancer are discussed. Alkylating agents and anticancer antibiotics belonged to this group.2) Type II (cytostatic and time-dependent action). The dose survival curves fit the Gompertz equation S=exp[(minusbeta/alpha)(1minus e-aD)] (beta, population reduction parameter; alpha, constant). The exposure survival curve is negative exponential, indicating that exposure time rather than concentration is the key fo effective cell killing of Type II agents. Difficulties in expression of sensitivity to Type II agents are discussed. Antimetabolites, Vinca alkaloids, and L-asparaginase belonged to this group. The cell-killing kinetics of anticancer agents and comparison of the sensitivity of cells may provide some indications not only of optimal dosage schedules but also of a new approach in screening systems for truly effective agents for human cancer.",neoplasms,0,5,8987.274,7531.149,7663.614,17089.48,15619.3,15882.5,3887.571

As other contributions in this volume amply testify, the time has come to re-evaluate that notion. C-peptide either directly through interaction with its specific cell-surface receptor or indirectly through an interaction with a related membrane entity, exerts a unique effect on several intracellular processes.

"Several cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have recently been shown to display anticancer activity via a mechanism that usually entails the disruption of cancer cell membranes. In this work, we designed an 18-residue anticancer peptide, SVS-1, whose mechanism of action is designed to take advantage of the aberrant lipid composition presented on the outer leaflet of cancer cell membranes, which makes the surface of these cells electronegative relative to the surface of noncancerous cells. SVS-1 is designed to remain unfolded and inactive in aqueous solution but to preferentially fold at the surface of cancer cells, adopting an amphiphilic Î²-hairpin structure capable of membrane disruption. Membrane-induced folding is driven by electrostatic interaction between the peptide and the negatively charged membrane surface of cancer cells. SVS-1 is active against a variety of cancer cell lines such as A549 (lung carcinoma), KB (epidermal carcinoma), MCF-7 (breast carcinoma), and MDA-MB-436 (breast carcinoma). However, the cytotoxicity toward noncancerous cells having typical membrane compositions, such as HUVEC and erythrocytes, is low. CD spectroscopy, appropriately designed peptide controls, cell-based studies, liposome leakage assays, and electron microscopy support the intended mechanism of action, which leads to preferential killing of cancerous cells.",cell_line_tumor,1,4,11077.06,7930.731,7876.169,17107.67,14642.65,14945.32,5030.133
"Limited data suggest that people with the metabolic syndrome have lower intakes or circulating concentrations of magnesium than those who do not have the syndrome. The aim of this study was to examine the associations between dietary intake of magnesium and the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults.

We used data for 7669 participants&> or =20 years of age of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988 to 1994). The metabolic syndrome was defined using the criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program. Magnesium intake was determined from a single dietary 24-hour recall.

The unadjusted prevalences of the metabolic syndrome were 29.0% (quintile of lowest magnesium intake), 27.5%, 25.8%, 23.9%, and 21.8% for increasing quintiles of magnesium intake (p for trend = 0.002). After multiple adjustment, the odds ratios for the second through the fifth quintiles (highest intake) of magnesium intake among all participants included in the analysis were 0.84 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.58, 1.23], 0.76 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.07), 0.62 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.98), and 0.56 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.92), respectively (p for trend = 0.029).

"To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of peptide-binding enzyme immunoassay (PEIA) and heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA) for the determination of HIV-1 subtypes B and E; to determine the proportions of infections due to subtypes B and E over time; and to generate data on DNA sequences of the C2-V3 region of the env genes.

HIV-1 subtyping was conducted by PEIA and HMA on blood specimens obtained from 97 injecting drug users (IDU) infected with HIV between 1988 and 1993. Genetic sequencing was performed on 84 specimens.

Both laboratory methods were highly sensitive and specific for the determination of HIV-1 subtypes B and E. The two tests were complementary; samples which could not be typed by HMA were correctly typed by PEIA and vice versa. While subtype B accounted for 80.4% (78 out of 97) of infections overall, the proportion of new infections due to subtype E increased from 2.6% (one out of 38) in 1988-1989 to 25.6% (11 out of 43) in 1990-1991, and to 43.8% (seven out of 16) in 1992-1993 (chi 2 for linear trend, P < 0.001).

HMA and PEIA are practical, sensitive and specific laboratory methods for the determination of HIV-1 subtypes in Thailand, and may be useful in other geographic areas to define the molecular epidemiology of the global HIV-1 pandemic.

"We have isolated the embryonic lethal gene muscleblind (mbl) as a suppressor of the sev-svp2 eye phenotype. Analysis of clones mutant for mbl during eye development shows that it is autonomously required for photoreceptor differentiation. Mutant cells are recruited into developing ommatidia and initiate neural differentiation, but they fail to properly differentiate as photoreceptors. Molecular analysis reveals that the mbl locus is large and complex, giving rise to multiple different proteins with common 5' sequences but different carboxy termini. Mbl proteins are nuclear and share a Cys3His zinc-finger motif which is also found in the TIS11/NUP475/TTP family of proteins and is highly conserved in vertebrates and invertebrates. Functional analysis of mbl, the observation that it also dominantly suppresses the sE-Jun(Asp) gain-of-function phenotype and the phenotypic similarity to mutants in the photoreceptor-specific glass gene suggest that mbl is a general factor required for photoreceptor differentiation.",molecular_sequence_data,0.6,5,7293.339,7027.07,7277.587,9485.605,11503.9,11880.74,3462.014
"Gel filtration of human serum extracts on Bio-Gel P-30 columns produced two peaks of material reactive with insulin antisera. The earlier eluting fraction appeared at the elution position of proinsulin (serum proinsulin-like component, PLC) while the second fraction corresponded in elution volume to insulin. In assays using porcine insulin-(131)I and an antiserum against porcine insulin, human pancreatic proinsulin was less reactive than human insulin. Serial dilutions of the serum PLC in the immunoassay showed immunological identity with the human proinsulin standard. Partial tryptic digestion of the serum PLC yielded products with increased immunological reactivity as estimated with insulin as the standard. With larger amounts of trypsin, all the serum PLC was converted to insulin-like components (desthreonine and desoctapeptide insulin). On the basis of these results we conclude that the earlier eluting fraction of human serum extracts is proinsulin. The fasting values of proinsulin in normal subjects ranged between 0.05 and 0.4 ng/ml, representing from 5 to 48% of the insulin concentration. In one subject the values of proinsulin were higher than those of insulin. After oral administration of 100 g of glucose, the proinsulin levels tended to rise similarly to insulin. Three obese patients with hyperinsulinemia had higher fasting levels of proinsulin and a greater increase after glucose than the normal subjects. As the high levels of proinsulin coexisted with raised insulin concentration in these obese subjects, the relative proportions of the two hormones were in the same range observed in the normal group. Thus hyperinsulinemia in these obese subjects was not accompanied by an increase in the fraction of serum proinsulin. When the values for serum proinsulin were expressed as percentage of the insulin levels, there was a decrease in the per cent proinsulin in the first hour of the glucose tolerance test. After the second hour, the per cent tended to rise towards the fasting levels.",obesity,0.4,9,6214.873,5760.024,5725.686,11553.74,10469.86,10737.03,3115.068

"Tumor cells can evade the immune system through several mechanisms, one of which is to block DC maturation. It has been suggested that signaling via Toll-like receptors (TLR) may be involved in the induction of prophylactic anti-cancer immunity and in the treatment of established tumors. In the present study we found that high numbers of tumor cells interfere with BMDC activation induced by the TLR ligands LPS and poly IC. Tumor cells blocked TLR3- and TLR4-mediated induction of MHCII and the co-stimulatory molecules CD40 and CD86, as well as the cytokines IL-12, TNF-alpha and IL-6. Importantly, tumor cells induced inhibitory molecules (B7-DC, B7-H1 and CD80) on spleen DC in vivo and on BMDC, even in the presence of TLR ligands. Moreover, after a long exposure with tumor cells, purified BMDC were unable to respond to a second challenge with TLR ligands. The failure of tumor exposed-BMDC to express co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines in the presence of TLR ligands has implications for the future development of DC-based cancer immune therapies using TLR ligands as adjuvants for the activation of DC.",cell_line_tumor,0.2,2,6825.804,5154.166,5135.123,10564.98,8426.403,8792.344,3349.941

"NO is a pleiotropic signaling molecule and has an important role in cognition and emotion. In the brain, NO is produced by neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS-I, encoded by NOS1) coupled to the NMDA receptor via PDZ interactions; this protein-protein interaction is disrupted upon binding of NOS1 adapter protein (encoded by NOS1AP) to NOS-I. As both NOS1 and NOS1AP were associated with schizophrenia, we here investigated these genes in greater detail by genotyping new samples and conducting a meta-analysis of our own and published data. In doing so, we confirmed association of both genes with schizophrenia and found evidence for their interaction in increasing risk towards disease. Our strongest finding was the NOS1 promoter SNP rs41279104, yielding an odds ratio of 1.29 in the meta-analysis. As findings from heterologous cell systems have suggested that the risk allele decreases gene expression, we studied the effect of the variant on NOS1 expression in human post-mortem brain samples and found that the risk allele significantly decreases expression of NOS1 in the prefrontal cortex. Bioinformatic analyses suggest that this might be due the replacement of six transcription factor binding sites by two new binding sites as a consequence of proxy SNPs. Taken together, our data argue that genetic variance in NOS1 resulting in lower prefrontal brain expression of this gene contributes to schizophrenia liability, and that NOS1 interacts with NOS1AP in doing so. The NOS1-NOS1AP PDZ interface may thus well constitute a novel target for small molecules in at least some forms of schizophrenia.",signal_transduction,0,10,7338.8,6475.433,6426.315,11970.39,12648.58,13008.26,2946.671
"The ability to map individual nucleosomes accurately across genomes enables the study of relationships between dynamic changes in nucleosome positioning/occupancy and gene regulation. However, the highly heterogeneous nature of nucleosome densities across genomes and short linker regions pose challenges in mapping nucleosome positions based on high-throughput microarray data of micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digested DNA. Previous works rely on additional detrending and careful visual examination to detect low-signal nucleosomes, which may exist in a subpopulation of cells. We propose a non-homogeneous hidden-state model based on first order differences of experimental data along genomic coordinates that bypasses the need for local detrending and can automatically detect nucleosome positions of various occupancy levels. Our proposed approach is applicable to both low and high resolution MNase-Chip and MNase-Seq (high throughput sequencing) data, and is able to map nucleosome-linker boundaries accurately. This automated algorithm is also computationally efficient and only requires a simple preprocessing step. We provide several examples illustrating the pitfalls of existing methods, the difficulties of detrending the observed hybridization signals and demonstrate the advantages of utilizing first order differences in detecting nucleosome occupancies via simulations and case studies involving MNase-Chip and MNase-Seq data of nucleosome occupancy in yeast S. cerevisiae.",algorithms,0.4,8,9792.187,8387.697,8445.975,17882.18,20342.04,20295.46,3285.161

"In the past two decades a trickle of manuscripts examining the non-neuronal central nervous system immune consequences of the drugs of abuse has now swollen to a significant body of work. Initially, these studies reported associative evidence of central nervous system proinflammation resulting from exposure to the drugs of abuse demonstrating key implications for neurotoxicity and disease progression associated with, for example, HIV infection. However, more recently this drug-induced activation of central immune signaling is now understood to contribute substantially to the pharmacodynamic actions of the drugs of abuse, by enhancing the engagement of classical mesolimbic dopamine reward pathways and withdrawal centers. This review will highlight the key in vivo animal, human, biological and molecular evidence of these central immune signaling actions of opioids, alcohol, cocaine, methamphetamine, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). Excitingly, this new appreciation of central immune signaling activity of drugs of abuse provides novel therapeutic interventions and opportunities to identify 'at risk' individuals through the use of immunogenetics. Discussion will also cover the evidence of modulation of this signaling by existing clinical and pre-clinical drug candidates, and novel pharmacological targets.

In this study, we evaluated the correlation between the titer of AdNAbs in the serum and the transduction profiles in the tumor and the liver following intratumoral administration into mice possessing various titers of AdNAbs. Adenovirus vector-mediated transduction in the tumor was inhibited by AdNAbs; however, when the titer of AdNAbs was less than 200, the levels of inhibition in the transduction efficiencies within the tumor ranged from approximately 2- to 100-fold. A more than 2500-fold reduction of adenovirus vector-mediated transduction was found in most of the mice when the titers of AdNAbs were >200.

"Polar residues comprise about 15% of the transmembrane (TM) domains of proteins, where they can stabilize structure via native side chain-side chain interhelical hydrogen bonds between TM helices. However, non-native H-bonds may be implicated in disease states, through limiting protein dynamics during transport and/or misfolding the protein by inducing non-native rotational positions about TM helical axes. Here we have undertaken an investigation of the presence and strength of H-bond interactions within a series of helix-loop-helix (""hairpin"") constructs derived from TM helices 3 and 4 (italic) of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (prototypic sequence G(194)LALAHFVWIAPLQ(207)VALLMGLIWELLQASAFAGLGFLIV(232)LALFQ(237)AGLG(241)) in which wild-type Q207 in TM3 forms an interhelical H-bond with CF-phenotypic mutant V232D in TM4 [Therien, A.

Using gel shift assays-in which H-bond-linked hairpins (closed conformation) migrate faster than the elongated forms (open conformation)-we found that Q207 in TM3 is able to ""capture"" all 21 TM4 D mutations into measurable populations of interhelical H-bonds. A similar library of TM4 D mutants-but also containing Q207L-reverted to wild-type migration rates, confirming Q207 as the polar partner for TM4 D residues.

"One enduring question in evolutionary biology is the extent of archaic admixture in the genomes of present-day populations. In this paper, we present a test for ancient admixture that exploits the asymmetry in the frequencies of the two nonconcordant gene trees in a three-population tree. This test was first applied to detect interbreeding between Neandertals and modern humans. We derive the analytic expectation of a test statistic, called the D statistic, which is sensitive to asymmetry under alternative demographic scenarios. We show that the D statistic is insensitive to some demographic assumptions such as ancestral population sizes and requires only the assumption that the ancestral populations were randomly mating. An important aspect of D statistics is that they can be used to detect archaic admixture even when no archaic sample is available. We explore the effect of sequencing error on the false-positive rate of the test for admixture, and we show how to estimate the proportion of archaic ancestry in the genomes of present-day populations. We also investigate a model of subdivision in ancestral populations that can result in D statistics that indicate recent admixture.",algorithms,0.2,9,3777.575,3271.567,3355.772,6787.041,5609.407,5861.533,1823.906
"A number of algorithms have been developed to correct for migration time drift in capillary electrophoresis. Those algorithms require identification of common components in each run.

The fluorescein thiocarbamyl derivative of aspartic acid migrates before FQ-labeled proteins and the fluorescein thiocarbamyl derivative of arginine migrates after the FQ-labeled proteins. These compounds were used as internal standards to correct for variations in migration time over a two-week period in the separation of a cellular homogenate. The experimental conditions were deliberately manipulated by varying electric field and sample preparation conditions. Three components of the homogenate were used to evaluate the alignment efficiency. Before alignment, the average relative standard deviation in migration time for these components was 13.3%.

"A comparative analysis was performed of the properties of cloned AT1 and AT2 receptors and their ability to induce ion currents and oocyte maturation.

Frog oocytes were injected with cRNA that codes for rat AT1A and AT2 and bovine AT1 receptors and membrane currents were recorded by using the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique. Oocyte maturation was scored by observation of the germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD).

Xenopus oocytes expressing AT1 or AT2 generated oscillatory chloride currents by coupling to the diacylglycerol/inositol-3-phosphate (DAG/IP(3)) cascade. Ang II activation of collagenase-defolliculated oocytes expressing rat AT1A yielded larger chloride currents (9.2+/-3.4 A) than those generated by oocytes expressing bovine AT1 (3.78+/-2.6 A). Oocytes expressing rat AT1A were recovered from desensitization after 0.5 h and completely after 10.5 h; whereas oocytes expressing bovine AT1 receptors were unable to do so. Expression of rat AT2 generated smaller chloride currents (32-210 nA). Expression of AT2 receptors triggered GVBD whereas AT1 did not. The proportion of oocytes developing GVBD was greater for folliculated oocytes than for oocytes that were defolliculated. Furthermore, oocytes injected with AT2 secreted into the media, a heat-resistant factor(s) that stimulated GVBD of oocytes. This media elicited inward and outward membrane currents when applied to non-injected oocytes.

"Obesity and stress inhibit insulin action by activating protein kinases that enhance serine phosphorylation of IRS1 and have been thus associated to insulin resistance and the development of type II diabetes. The protein kinase C (PKC) is activated by free-fatty acids, and its activity is higher in muscle from obese diabetic patients. However, a molecular link between PKC and insulin resistance has not been defined yet. Here we show that PKC phosphorylates IRS1 at serine 1101 blocking IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream activation of the Akt pathway. Mutation of Ser(1101) to alanine makes IRS1 insensitive to the effect of PKC and restores insulin signaling in culture cells. These results provide a novel mechanism linking the activation of PKC to the inhibition of insulin signaling.",signal_transduction,0.2,10,9527.534,9053.707,8730.076,13442.14,16677.75,16843.79,3991.965

"To our knowledge, no published functional map of the human lower brainstem exists. Our purpose was to use 1.5-T functional MR imaging (fMRI) to visualize the location of cranial nerve (CN) nuclei and other pontine, bulbar, and cervical spinal cord nuclei by using specific sensory stimulation or motor performance.

We localized nuclei by using cross-correlation analysis of regional blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal intensity during specific motor and sensory procedures based on known functions of specific nuclei. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis was used for comparison. Head, cardiac, and respiratory motion artifact correction was applied. Histologic atlases aided localization.

We obtained evidence of localization of the following nuclei by using tests, as follows: main trigeminal sensory (CN V), brushing the face; abducens (CN VI), left-right eye movement; facial (CN VII), smiling and lip puckering; hypoglossal (CN XII), pushing the tongue against the hard palate; nucleus ambiguus, swallowing; nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), tasting a sweet-sour-salty-bitter mixture; nucleus cuneatus, finger tapping; and cervical spinal cord levels C1-C3, tongue movement to activate the strap muscles. Activation of cortical motor and sensory areas and somatosensory thalamus corresponded with the tasks and sites of brainstem activation. Head movement was minimal, typically less than 1 mm in all three axes.

"Changing plasma protein concentrations may affect the protein binding and pharmacokinetics of drugs in the postoperative period. This study examined the effect of postoperative increases (in response to surgery) in plasma alpha1-acid-glycoprotein (AAG) concentrations on the plasma concentrations of the enantiomers of bupivacaine during continuous epidural infusion of racemic bupivacaine for postoperative pain relief.

Six patients scheduled for total hip surgery with combined epidural and general anesthesia received a bolus dose of bupivacaine (65 mg) followed by constant-rate (8 ml/h) epidural infusion of 2.5 mg/ml bupivacaine for 48 h. Total and unbound plasma concentrations of the enantiomers of bupivacaine and plasma AAG concentrations during the 48-h epidural infusion were determined.

Total plasma concentrations of the enantiomers of bupivacaine increased steadily during the infusion (P < 0.0001), whereas unbound concentrations did not change after 12 h (P > 0.1). Total plasma concentrations of S(-)-bupivacaine were higher than those of R(+)-bupivacaine (P < 0.02), whereas unbound concentrations of S(-)-bupivacaine were lower than those of R(+)-bupivacaine (P < 0.002). AAG concentrations initially decreased, but thereafter increased steadily (P < 0.0001). Consequently, free fractions of the enantiomers initially increased and then decreased with time (P = 0.0002). Free fractions of S(-)-bupivacaine were smaller than those of R(+)-bupivacaine (P = 0.0003).

The study confirmed that the pharmacokinetics of bupivacaine are enantioselective. During postoperative epidural infusion, changing plasma AAG concentrations affect the protein binding of both enantiomers of bupivacaine. Consequently, total plasma concentrations of the enantiomers increase with time, whereas unbound concentrations reach a plateau.",algorithms,0,6,14236.08,13728.47,13508.07,23291.54,25306.41,25719.55,5407.254
"Insight into the molecular basis of cholecystokinin (CCK) binding to its receptor has come from receptor mutagenesis and photoaffinity labeling studies, with both contributing to the current hypothesis that the acidic Tyr-sulfate-27 residue within the peptide is situated adjacent to basic Arg(197) in the second loop of the receptor. Here, we refine our understanding of this region of interaction by examining a structure-activity series of these positions within both ligand and receptor and by performing three-dimensional molecular modeling of key pairs of modified ligand and receptor constructs. The important roles of Arg(197) and Tyr-sulfate-27 were supported by the marked negative impact on binding and biological response with their natural partner molecule when the receptor residue was replaced by acidic Asp or Glu and when the peptide residue was replaced by basic Arg, Lys, p-amino-Phe, p-guanidino-Phe, or p-methylamino-Phe. Complementary ligand-receptor charge-exchange experiments were unable to regain the lost function. This was supported by the molecular modeling, which demonstrated that the charge-reversed double mutants could not form a good interaction without extensive rearrangement of receptor conformation. The models further predicted that R197D and R197E mutations would lead to conformational changes in the extracellular domain, and this was experimentally supported by data showing that these mutations decreased peptide agonist and antagonist binding and increased nonpeptidyl antagonist binding. These receptor constructs also had increased susceptibility to trypsin degradation relative to the wild-type receptor. In contrast, the relatively conservative R197K mutation had modest negative impact on peptide agonist binding, again consistent with the modeling demonstration of loss of a series of stabilizing inter- and intramolecular bonds. The strong correlation between predicted and experimental results support the reported refinement in the three-dimensional structure of the CCK-occupied receptor.",signal_transduction,0,8,6450.974,4515.192,4598.887,10899.5,9810.271,10083.85,2772.029
"Cost-analysis comparing darbepoetin-alfa (DARB), epoetin-alfa (EPO-A), and epoetin-beta (EPO-B) for treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia in Belgium concluded that costs for DARB-treated patients were significantly lower than costs for EPO-A- or EPO-B-treated patients. The objective of the present study was to extend the Belgian analysis to Austria, France, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, estimating differences in costs between erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in each country.

Differences in epidemiology and treatment patterns between countries were adjusted using data from Eurostat, national cancer registries, IMS sales data, and reimbursement and treatment guidelines. Belgian unit costs were replaced with country-specific costs. Costs were analyzed using a mixed-effects model stratifying for propensity score quintiles.

All populations were comparable to the Belgian population in terms of age, gender, ESA, and blood transfusions use. After adjusting for country-specific chemotherapy use and cancer incidence, total management costs per patient (Euro, 2010) were 19-26% (France, Spain) lower with DARB compared with EPO-A (pâ&lt;â0.0001) and 20-36% (Portugal, Austria) compared with EPO-B (pâ&lt;â0.01). Anemia-related costs with DARB were between 12% (Portugal; pâ=â0.0235) and 38% (Italy; pâ&lt;â0.0001) lower compared with EPO-A (pâ&lt;â0.01; all remaining countries), and between 13% (Austria; pâ=â0.064) and 19% (Portugal; pâ=â0.0028) lower compared with EPO-B (pâ&lt;â0.05; all remaining countries except Italy; pâ=â0.0935).

Not all differences could be accounted for by a lack of country-specific data; however, the potential under- and over-estimation of costs should be similar for all three ESAs.

These findings are in line with the Belgian analysis. In all countries, total and anemia-related costs were lowest in patients receiving DARB vs EPO-A or EPO-B. This study demonstrates the feasibility of adapting real-life country-specific data to other settings, adjusting for differences in patients' characteristics and treatment strategies.

"The capability to foster metacognitive evaluations (MEs) of oneself and others represents a major component of conscious awareness. Separate emerging lines of brain activation research examining ME have converged on the medial prefrontal cortex as a common finding. The current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study utilized a task that directly compared ME associated with two referentially discrete targets: oneself and a significant other (e.g., close friend or relative). Nineteen healthy young adult participants (mean age 24; 9 female, 10 male) were required to make yes/no decisions based on individually presented trait adjectives across two separate referential conditions and a nonreferential control condition: self-evaluation (SE), significant other-evaluation (OE), and semantic positivity-evaluation (SPE), respectively. Results of random-effects group analyses indicated a common area of medial prefrontal activation during the ME conditions of self- and other-evaluation versus the baseline semantic positivity-evaluation condition. A direct comparison of brain activation between the self and other evaluative conditions revealed a right dorsolateral prefrontal response that was significantly more active when making evaluations about the self. The present study extends upon the prior findings of separate research domains by directly comparing the cerebral response to ME about the self and others, and finding right PFC activation increases as a function of self-relevance.",magnetic_resonance_imaging,0.2,5,10125.27,7344.854,7536.505,15935.7,14346.13,14704.9,4555.214
"Dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) mutations in Pneumocystis jiroveci have been associated epidemiologically with resistance to sulfamethoxazole (SMX). Since P. jiroveci cannot be cultured, inherent drug resistance cannot be measured. This study explores the effects of these mutations in a tractable model organism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Based on the sequence conservation between the DHPS enzymes of P. jiroveci and S. cerevisiae, together with the structural conservation of the three known DHPS structures, DHPS substitutions commonly observed in P. jiroveci were reverse engineered into the S. cerevisiae DHPS. Those mutations, T(597)A and P(599)S, can occur singly but are most commonly found together and are associated with SMX treatment failure. Mutations encoding the corresponding changes in the S. cerevisiae dhps were made in a yeast centromere vector, p414FYC, which encodes the native yeast DHPS as part of a trifunctional protein that also includes the two enzymes upstream of DHPS in the folic acid synthesis pathway, dihydroneopterin aldolase and 2-amino-4-hydroxymethyl dihydropteridine pyrophosphokinase. A yeast strain with dhps deleted was employed as the host strain, and transformants having DHPS activity were recovered. Mutants having both T(597) and P(599) substitutions had a requirement for p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), consistent with resistance being associated with altered substrate binding. These mutants could be adapted for growth in the absence of PABA, which coincided with increased sulfa drug resistance. Upregulated PABA synthesis was thus implicated as a mechanism for sulfa drug resistance for mutants having two DHPS substitutions.",molecular_sequence_data,0.2,7,10552.04,8745.484,8738.005,16517.75,15942.71,16525.19,5701.051

"Lipids and cholesterol in particular, have long been associated with breast cancer (BC) onset and progression. However, the causative effects of elevated lipid levels and breast cancer remain largely undisclosed and were the subject of the present study.We took advantage of well-established in vitro and in vivo models of cholesterol enrichment to exploit the mechanism involved in LDL-cholesterol favouring BC growth and invasiveness. We analyzed its effects in models that mimic different BC subtypes and stages.Our data show that LDL-cholesterol (but not HDL-cholesterol) promotes BC cells proliferation, migration and loss of adhesion, hallmarks of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. In vivo studies modeling cholesterol levels showed that breast tumors are consistently larger and more proliferative in hypercholesterolemic mice, which also have more frequently lung metastases. Microarray analysis revealed an over expression of intermediates of Akt and ERK pathways suggesting a survival response induced by LDL, confirmed by WB analyses. Gene expression analysis also evidenced an activation of ErbB2 signaling pathway and decreased expression of adhesion molecules (cadherin-related family member3, CD226, Claudin 7 and Ocludin) in the cells exposed to LDL.Together, the present work shows novel mechanistic evidence that high LDL-cholesterol levels promote BC progression.

"A novel Gram-positive-staining, aerobic, spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain YIM 91119(T), was isolated from Ebinur Lake in Xinjiang Province, north-west China. Cells were motile, produced terminal endospores and grew at pH 6.0-8.0 (optimally at pH 7.0), 4-45 degrees C (optimally at 28-37 degrees C) and 1-22 % (w/v) NaCl, (optimally at 10-15 %, w/v). Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strain YIM 91119(T) belongs to the genus Gracilibacillus, exhibiting the highest sequence similarity with respect to the type strain of Gracilibacillus orientalis (97.8 %); the next most similar 16S rRNA gene sequences were those of the type strains of Gracilibacillus boraciitolerans (96.8 %), Gracilibacillus dipsosauri (96.5 %) and Gracilibacillus halotolerans (95.8 %). DNA-DNA hybridization with G. orientalis AS 1.4250(T) showed a relatedness of 55 %. The major fatty acids of strain YIM 91119(T) were anteiso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(15 : 0) and anteiso-C(17 : 0).

"LKB1, a tumor-suppressor gene that codifies for a serine/threonine kinase, is mutated in the germ-line of patients affected with the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), which have an increased incidence of several cancers including gastrointestinal, pancreatic and lung carcinomas. Regarding tumors arising in non-PJS patients, we recently observed that at least one-third of lung adenocarcinomas (LADs) harbor somatic LKB1 gene mutations, supporting a role for LKB1 in the origin of some sporadic tumors. To characterize the pattern of LKB1 mutations in LADs further, we first screened for LKB1 gene alterations (gene mutations, promoter hypermethylation and homozygous deletions) in 19 LADs and, in agreement with our previous data, five of them (26%) were shown to harbor mutations, all of which gave rise to a truncated protein. Recent reports demonstrate that LKB1 is able to suppress cell growth, but little is known about the specific mechanism by which it functions. To further our understanding of LKB1 function, we analysed global expression in lung primary tumors using cDNA microarrays to identify LKB1-specific variations in gene expression. In all, 34 transcripts, 24 of which corresponded to known genes, differed significantly between tumors with and without LKB1 gene alterations. Among the most remarkable findings was deregulation of transcripts involved in signal transduction (e.g. FRAP1/mTOR, ARAF1 and ROCK2), cytoskeleton (e.g. MPP1), transcription factors (e.g. MEIS2, ATF5), metabolism of AMP (AMPD3 and APRT) and ubiquitinization (e.g. USP16 and UBE2L3). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR on 15 tumors confirmed the upregulation of the homeobox MEIS2 and of the AMP-metabolism AMPD3 transcripts in LKB1-mutant tumors. In addition, immunohistochemistry in 10 of the lung tumors showed the absence of phosphorylated FRAP1/mTOR protein in LKB1-mutant tumors, indicating that LKB1 mutations do not lead to FRAP1/mTOR protein kinase activation. In conclusion, our results reveal that several important factors contribute to LKB1-mediated carcinogenesis in LADs, confirming previous observations and identifying new putative pathways that should help to elucidate the biological role of LKB1.",signal_transduction,0.4,9,9864.0,9576.901,9636.207,14905.84,16196.96,16216.55,4636.466
"Immediate-release oral morphine, given every four hours in individually titrated doses, is effective in the control of severe cancer pain. To evaluate the analgesic efficacy of a controlled-release morphine sulfate preparation, MS Contin tablets (MSC, Purdue Frederick, Toronto, Ontario, Canada), after a single dose and under steady-state conditions, the authors compared MSC administered every 12 hours with morphine oral solution (MOS) administered every 4 hours in 17 adult cancer patients with chronic severe pain. In the single-dose evaluation, in which the patients were randomly assigned to receive MSC or MOS, there were no significant differences in analgesic efficacy or requirement for supplemental morphine between the two treatments. With both preparations, pain severity ratings increased toward the end of the 12-hour, single-dose observation period and were higher than the pain scores reported after dose titration. In the steady-state evaluation, which was a randomized crossover comparison, both preparations provided effective pain control with minimal side effects. There was no significant difference between MSC and MOS in overall pain scores or in pain scores analyzed by time of day and day of therapy. In conclusion, that an individualized twice-daily regimen of MSC is as effective as 4-hourly MOS for the control of chronic severe cancer pain. The twice-daily regimen has several advantages: it allows an uninterrupted night's sleep, it is substantially more convenient, and it can be expected to reduce both medication errors and noncompliance.",neoplasms,0.4,4,6830.563,5035.821,4885.08,12511.22,12127.43,11598.23,3868.401

"To determine the types of subcutaneous adiposity represented by different measurements of skinfold thickness that are associated with birth weight in white (n=759), Black (n=916) and Hispanic (n=813) American children aged 5-11 y. We also determined the contribution of birth weight to ethnic differences in subcutaneous and central adiposity.

Data for this analysis were from the Third US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The outcome measures were triceps, subscapular, suprailiac and thigh skinfold thicknesses at 5-11 y of age. Central adiposity was defined as ratios of subscapular to triceps (STR) and central-peripheral (CPR) (subscapular+suprailiac)/(triceps+thigh) skinfolds. Partial correlation analyses were used to determine the association between birth weight and measures of subcutaneous fatness, while multiple linear regression analyses were used to determine the independent contribution of birth weight to ethnicity variations in subcutaneous and central adiposity adjusting for sex, age and BMI.

Overall, birth weight was negatively associated with subscapular skinfold and central adiposity in White, Black and Hispanic American children (P &<0.05). Birth weight was also negatively associated with suprailliac skinfold in both Blacks and Hispanics (P &<0.01) and with sum of the four skinfolds in Blacks (P &<0.05). Compared with White, Black ethnicity was negatively associated with triceps, suprailliac thigh and sum of skinfold thicknesses controlling for birth weight, sex, age and BMI (P &<0.01). Compared with White, Hispanic ethnicity was negatively associated with triceps, thigh and sum of skinfold thicknesses (P &<0.01). Both Black and Hispanic ethnicity was positively associated with STR and CPR (P &<0.01).

In this population of American children, the association of birth weights with subcutaneous and central fat accumulation may be due to fetal programming.

"Signals sent through CD40 play crucial roles in B cell differentiation, including blocking apoptosis of germinal center B cells. In this study, using a murine B cell WEHI-231 line that undergoes apoptosis by the cross-linking of surface Ag receptors (sIgM), we have demonstrated that CD40 signalings are linked to induction of the Bcl-xL, Cdk4, and Cdk6 proteins whose expression was significantly suppressed by the apoptotic signal through sIgM. Mutational analyses of CD40 revealed that the domain of human CD40 required for blocking apoptosis of WEHI-231 cells coincides with that required for Bcl-xL induction. Signals through sIgM arrest cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, which is followed by apoptosis. However, while constitutive expression of Bcl-XL leads to the inhibition of apoptosis. Nevertheless, Bcl-xL fails to induce S phase entry. By CD40 signalings, both Cdk4 and Cdk6 resume their normal expression levels, which are sufficient for passing the restriction point in G1 even in the presence of the apoptotic signals mediated by sIgM. These results suggest that cooperation of Bcl-xL, Cdk4, and Cdk6 induced by CD40 signaling plays a key role in CD40-mediated selective growth of B cells.",signal_transduction,0.6,8,8158.47,7523.438,7551.857,16308.1,15293.59,15752.69,4578.947
"The workforce of the UK Atomic Energy Authority has been the subject of several previous epidemiological investigations.

To detect and investigate associations between mortality rates and employment in a substantially increased cohort size and follow up extended to 1997.

The new cohort included 51 367 employees, of whom 10 249 were dead. Mortality rates for all workers were low compared to national rates, as were rates in radiation workers and for workers monitored for internal contamination. For radiation workers all cause mortality and all cancer mortality were significantly lower than for non-radiation workers. There was no overall trend of increasing mortality with radiation dose. There was little evidence of raised mortality from leukaemia. The association of prostatic cancer with radiation dose was much less significant than in previous reports. However, the relatively high mortality from uterine cancers among radiation workers remained, though the numbers were very small. The association was with endometrial rather than cervical cancer. Mortality from cancer of the pleura was high among radiation workers, but was not correlated with dose.

Overall, radiation workers at UKAEA showed no excess mortality. The previously detected association of prostate cancer with high radiation dose may have been a statistical artefact or a risk associated with discontinued activities. Endometrial cancer occurred at higher rates in female radiation workers, but, because there was no correlation with dose, may well be due to something other than their radiation exposure. Cancer of the pleura in radiation workers was almost certainly related to past asbestos exposure.",neoplasms,0.4,5,5285.427,3929.738,3692.448,11196.6,13034.37,13108.24,3144.857
"The thermal behavior of the Soret band relative to the carbonmonoxy derivatives of some beta-chain mutant hemoglobins is studied in the temperature range 300-10 K and compared to that of wild-type carbonmonoxy hemoglobin. The band profile at various temperatures is modeled as a Voigt function that accounts for homogeneous broadening and for the coupling with high- and low-frequency vibrational modes, while inhomogeneous broadening is taken into account with a gaussian distribution of purely electronic transition frequencies. The various contributions to the over-all bandwidth are singled out with this analysis and their temperature dependence, in turn, gives information on structural and dynamic properties of the system studied. In the wild-type and mutant hemoglobins, the values of homogeneous bandwidth and of the coupling constants to high-frequency vibrational modes are not modified with respect to natural human hemoglobin, thus indicating that the local electronic and vibrational properties of the heme-CO complex are not altered by the recombinant procedures. On the contrary, differences in the protein dynamic behavior are observed. The most relevant are those relative to the ""polar isosteric"" beta Val-67(E11)-->Thr substitution, localized in the heme pocket, which results in decreased coupling with low-frequency modes and increased anharmonic motions. Mutations involving residue beta Lys-144(Hc1) at the C-terminal and residue beta Cys-112(G14) at the alpha 1 beta 1 interface have a smaller effect consisting in an increased coupling with low-frequency modes.

"Prediction of a protein's structure from its amino acid sequence is a key issue in molecular biology. While dynamics, performed in the space of two-dimensional contact maps, eases the necessary conformational search, it may also lead to maps that do not correspond to any real three-dimensional structure. To remedy this, an efficient procedure is needed to reconstruct three-dimensional conformations from their contact maps.

We present an efficient algorithm to recover the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its contact map representation. We show that when a physically realizable map is used as target, our method generates a structure whose contact map is essentially similar to the target. furthermore, the reconstructed and original structures are similar up to the resolution of the contact map representation. Next, we use nonphysical target maps, obtained by corrupting a physical one; in this case, our method essentially recovers the underlying physical map and structure. Hence, our algorithm will help to fold proteins, using dynamics in the space of contact maps. Finally, we investigate the manner in which the quality of the recovered structure degrades when the number of contacts is reduced.

The procedure is capable of assigning quickly and reliably a three-dimensional structure to a given contact map. It is well suited for use in parallel with dynamics in contact map space to project a contact map onto its closest physically allowed structural counterpart.",algorithms,0,6,5044.989,4009.592,4022.554,8600.598,9418.932,9640.367,2139.335
"Madelung's disease, or multiple symmetric lipomatosis, is an extremely rare disease and very likely to be under-diagnosed. It is characterized by multiple symmetrical non-encapsulated fat accumulations mainly located around the neck, shoulders, upper extremities and upper parts of the trunk. The disorder predominantly affects middle-aged men of Mediterranean origin with a history of ethanol intake. Reports of this uncommon disorder in women are very rare. The aim of this article is to report the endocrine and metabolic workup leading to the diagnosis of this uncommon disorder. A 55-year-old woman with osteoporosis was referred to our outpatient clinic with a suspected diagnosis of Cushing's disease. The patient complained of undesired weight gain with atypical fat accumulations predominantly in the upper trunk region during the previous 10 weeks. She presented with the characteristic physical features of Madelung's disease and underwent a thorough examination with endocrine and metabolic evaluation of this rare condition and was finally diagnosed with Madelung's disease. This report demonstrates how a diagnosis of this rare disorder can be reached efficiently. A history of osteoporosis in combination with weight gain and atypical fat accumulations ultimately led to the diagnosis of Madelung's diseases, a rather unknown disorder likely to be under-diagnosed. Although treatment options are limited, a diagnosis is still important for the affected individual.",obesity,0.4,2,4805.756,3406.567,3398.652,10219.44,8857.417,9074.341,2758.897
"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been shown to be a very useful tool to do research on psychiatric disorders, validating psychotherapeutical interventions, medication as well as disorder-specific deficits. The field of fMRI-research is examining the potential of identifying differences of activity between brains of clinical, subclinical and healthy subjects. The design of such research is drawn to evaluate the average activation to different conditions. We remark that there are still some methodological problems to face, i.e. choosing the sample with special considerations on comorbidity and medication, accounting individual differences in brain activation, complex statistical calculations etc. When evaluating therapeutical interventions it is necessary to take the placebo-effect into account. However, fMRI is a highly promising research method. For future application of fMRI in clinical practice it would be worth building standard paradigms. Then, valid diagnostics of impaired functionality may be possible. Furthermore, fMRI should be combined with other neurodiagnostical technologies and with genetics. The cooperation of different fields in brain research with fMRI may provide further knowledge about psychiatric disorders.",magnetic_resonance_imaging,0.6,2,6441.241,3767.943,3749.737,11364.83,9638.919,9525.209,3154.735
"Melanocytes express MITF, which is crucial for the development of the melanocyte lineage and is overexpressed in malignant melanomas. Adenoviral E1A protein-expressing melanocytes are unpigmented, with the expression of MITF being silenced. We tested here a direct repression of the melanocyte-specific MITF promoter by E1A and its mutants. We found that the extreme N-terminus and conserved region 1 are required for repression. In contrast, the motif in conserved region 2 (a.a. 122-126), as well as amino acids 26-35 at the N-terminus, are not necessary. As these two later motifs mediate E1A binding to the retinoblastoma protein or to the transcriptional co-activator TRRAP, respectively, and are important for transformation by E1A in cooperation with other oncogenes, the results suggest that the transformation-defective E1A can still efficiently repress the MITF promoter. The CREB binding motif-mutated promoter had lower activity, but was also repressed by the same E1A mutants in human melanoma cells. The E1A protein is known to also exert an antitumour activity, which is associated with its transcription repression function and the ability to induce apoptosis, and is a potential antimelanoma agent. Since recent data suggest that MITF may be a survival factor for melanoma cells, the E1A mutants described here might constitute a good targeting agent for antimelanoma therapy.",cell_line_tumor,0,10,6123.468,4919.19,5078.011,10000.73,8377.606,8646.649,3475.971
"Recently, chronic supplementation with alpha-galactosidase A (alphaGal A) has been approved as a treatment modality for Fabry disease. The aim of the current study was to investigate the feasibility of home therapy for Fabry disease during a follow-up of >3 years and to make a proposal for practice guidelines.

Based on experience in previous clinical trials, an algorithm for home treatment eligibility was developed. The number of successful and uneventful infusions was recorded, as well as adverse and infusion-associated events. The presence and titre of recombinant human (rh)-alphaGal A antibodies were monitored every 3 months.

Thirty of the 36 patients eligible for home treatment received a total of 1418 infusions at home (median 44 infusions, range 1-108), between March 2001 and July 2005. Mean age was 44.7 years (17-71). Seventeen patients receiving home treatment (57%) were male. The majority of patients (27 out of 30, 90%) undergoing home treatment received 0.2 mg/kg agalsidase alpha or beta. Six male patients developed an infusion-associated event, of which three developed these at home. All patients with an infusion-associated event were anti-rh-alphaGal A IgG positive at 3 months, but three patients with rh-alphaGal A antibodies did not develop side effects. Antibody titres between these patients did not differ. None of the events was life-threatening or necessitated urgent admission.

Home treatment with rh-alphaGal A for Fabry disease with 0.2 mg/kg for males and both 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg for females is feasible and safe, and reduces both the burden related to chronic intravenous therapy and health care costs. Whether this can also be applied for male patients treated with 1.0 mg/kg has not yet been determined.",algorithms,0,8,6351.271,5472.609,5540.238,13250.03,14926.1,15054.6,3858.901
"The relative role of Btk-dependent B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling in the induction of antipolysaccharide (anti-PS) and antiprotein immunoglobulin (Ig) responses to an intact extracellular bacterium in vivo is unknown. Btklow mice exhibit reduced BCR signaling but largely restore B-cell development. Btklow mice immunized with intact Streptococcus pneumoniae elicit reduced anti-PS but normal antiprotein Ig responses. Immunization of Btklow mice with PS-protein conjugate in saline results in an even more profound defect in the anti-PS but not antiprotein response, which is largely restored by use of a CpG-containing oligodeoxynucleotide as an adjuvant. These data demonstrate a greater dependence on Btk-mediated BCR signaling for physiologic anti-PS relative to antiprotein responses, as well as the existence of a compensatory Toll-like-receptor-mediated signaling pathway naturally triggered in response to intact bacterial pathogens.",signal_transduction,0,7,13643.85,11750.64,11465.83,20138.53,19533.9,19573.96,6593.46
"Bone marrow-derived cells (BMDC) localize in premetastatic niche through chemokines and integrins signals and establish clusters that precede the arrival of even single metastatic tumor cell at distant site. CSCs demonstrate an increased metastatic propensity and would seem likely candidates for the acquisition of migratory capabilities and propagation of heterogeneous tumor cell populations to different target organs. Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), FOXM1 and Notch pathways and signaling molecules such as integrin and chemokine could dictate their fate.

In this review, the molecular mechanisms of premetastatic niche onset are summarized.

Premetastatic niche is defined as a fertile microenvironment that forms in metastatic target organ and facilitates the invasion, survival and/or proliferation of metastatic tumor cells, providing a novel mechanism for the promotion of metastasis. Drugs targeting premetastatic niche could represent a new promising therapeutic approach in the treatment of bone metastases.",neoplasms,0,8,11637.83,11203.05,11390.98,18118.91,21160.58,21633.22,4657.476
"To demonstrate the feasibility of dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with near-real-time temporal resolution (""real-time MRI"") for analyzing the velopharyngeal closure in comparison with multiview videofluoroscopy.

Seven patients (three females and four males, 5-21 years old, mean age=11.3 years) with suspected velopharyngeal insufficiency, and one healthy volunteer were examined with videofluoroscopy and real-time MRI using a turbo-spin-echo (TSE) sequence (TR=170 msec, TE=21 msec, slice thickness=6 mm, six images per second). Imaging was done during phonation in all three image planes. The results were analyzed by two radiologists in comparison with videofluoroscopy as the standard of reference for overall image quality and the pattern of velopharyngeal closure.

Real-time MRI correctly depicted the pattern of velopharyngeal closure in correspondence to videofluoroscopy in all cases. Concerning the movement of the pharyngeal walls, real-time MRI falsely depicted a general movement of the dorsal pharyngeal wall in one case, whereas videofluoroscopy showed no movement. In one patient, real-time MRI provided additional information by showing an asymmetric movement of the lateral pharyngeal walls that could not be depicted by videofluoroscopy due to technical limitations. Concerning image quality, the coronal plane was more difficult to evaluate with real-time MRI compared to videofluoroscopy. The axial plane was easier to analyze in real-time MRI compared to videofluoroscopy.

Real-time MRI has the potential to depict the pattern of velopharyngeal closure in close correlation with videofluoroscopy, and may deliver additional information in selected cases.",magnetic_resonance_imaging,0,8,9055.384,7887.852,7799.184,14565.58,16507.68,16897.43,3947.154
"Low-affinity A2B adenosine receptors (A2B ARs), which are expressed in astrocytes, are mainly activated during brain hypoxia and ischaemia, when large amounts of adenosine are released. Cytokines, which are also produced at high levels under these conditions, may regulate receptor responsiveness. In the present study, we detected A2B AR in human astrocytoma cells (ADF) by both immunoblotting and real-time PCR. Functional studies showed that the receptor stimulated adenylyl cyclase through Gs proteins. Moreover, A2B ARs were phosphorylated and desensitized following stimulation of the receptors with high agonist concentration. Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) treatment (24- h) increased A2B AR functional response and receptor G protein coupling, without any changes in receptor protein and mRNA levels. TNF-alpha markedly reduced agonist-dependent receptor phosphorylation on threonine residues and attenuated agonist-mediated A2B ARs desensitization. In the presence of TNF-alpha, A2B AR stimulation in vitro induced the elongation of astrocytic processes, a typical morphological hallmark of in vivo reactive astrogliosis. This event was completely prevented by the selective A2B AR antagonist MRS 1706 and required the presence of TNF-alpha. These results suggest that, in ADF cells, TNF-alpha selectively modulates A2B AR coupling to G proteins and receptor functional response, providing new insights to clarify the pathophysiological role of A2B AR in response to brain damage.",cell_line_tumor,0,9,18097.83,17788.11,17786.24,25941.23,26086.29,26260.71,7465.541
"This study examined the effect of leptin on renal ouabain-resistant Na(+)-ATPase, which drives the reabsorption of about 10% of sodium transported in the proximal tubule. Chronic leptin administration (0.25 mg/kg s.c. twice daily for seven days) increased Na(+)-ATPase activity by 62.9%. This effect was prevented by the coadministration of superoxide dismutase mimetic, tempol, or the NADPH oxidase inhibitor, apocynin (2 mM in the drinking water). Acutely administered NO donors decreased Na(+)-ATPase activity. This effect was abolished by soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor, ODQ, but not by protein kinase G inhibitors. Exogenous cGMP reduced Na(+)-ATPase activity, but its synthetic analogues, 8-bromo-cGMP and 8-pCPT-cGMP, were ineffective. The inhibitory effect of NO donors and cGMP was abolished by EHNA, an inhibitor of cGMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase (PDE2). Exogenous cAMP analogue and dibutyryl-cAMP increased Na(+)-ATPase activity and abolished the inhibitory effect of cGMP. Finally, the administration of superoxide-generating mixture (xanthine oxidase+hypoxanthine) increased Na(+)-ATPase activity. The results suggest that nitric oxide decreases renal Na(+)-ATPase activity by stimulating cGMP, which in turn activates PDE2 and decreases cAMP concentration. Increased production of reactive oxygen species may lead to the elevation of Na(+)-ATPase activity by scavenging NO and limiting its inhibitory effect. Chronic hyperleptinemia is associated with increased Na(+)-ATPase activity due to excessive oxidative stress.",obesity,0,7,16448.19,17876.68,17973.37,25189.9,26533.87,26927.49,8836.261
"Molecular, morphological and morphometrical studies were conducted on two species of the genus Monorchis (Monorchiidae), Monorchis parvus and Monorchis monorchis, collected in different fish hosts from the Mediterranean Sea. The analysis of internal transcribed spacer 1 sequences of ribosomal DNA showed that M. monorchis specimens from Parablennius gattorugine were strongly divergent (12.9%) from specimens of this species collected in Spondyliosoma cantharus and Diplodus puntazzo. This high genetic variation was confirmed by the analysis of morphological structures and morphometrics, which showed that M. monorchis specimens from P. gattorugine can be distinguished from those of S. cantharus and D. puntazzo by several morphological characteristics, including body size, number and distribution of vitelline follicles, testis shape, structure of the cirrus pouch, and number of eggs.

"Carcinogenicity and chronic toxicity of 1,4-dioxane were examined by inhalation exposure of 50 male F344 rats to 1,4-dioxane vapor at 0 (clean air), 50, 250, or 1250 ppm (v/v) for 6 h/day, 5 days/wk, and 104 wk. Survival rates of 250 and 1250 ppm-exposed groups were decreased near the end of the 2-yr exposure period, due probably to the occurrence of malignant tumors. A statistically significant but marginal decrement of terminal body weight (&lt;10%) was found in the 1250 ppm-exposed group, suggesting slight systemic toxicity. Significant changes in plasma levels of AST, ALT, ALP, and gamma-GTP and relative weight of the liver occurred in the 1250 ppm-exposed group. Dose-dependent and statistically significant increases in incidences of nasal squamous cell carcinomas, hepatocellular adenomas, and peritoneal mesotheliomas were found primarily in the 1250 ppm-exposed group. The incidences of renal cell carcinomas, fibroadenomas in the mammary gland, and adenomas in the Zymbal gland were also increased dose-dependently. Preneoplastic lesions occurred in the nasal cavity and liver of the 1,4-dioxane-exposed groups. As nonneoplastic lesions, the significantly increased incidences of nuclear enlargement, atrophy, and respiratory metaplasia in the nasal cavity were noted at 50 ppm and above. A LOAEL (lowest observed adverse effect level) was determined at 50 ppm for the nasal endpoint of general chronic toxicity.

"The main objective of this study was to investigate the relation between brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels within the first 96 hours after ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) and the development of left ventricular (LV) dilatation at 6-month follow-up. Eighty-two patients with first STEMIs, reperfused within 12 hours of symptom onset, were prospectively included. Plasma BNP was determined on admission and at 1- and 6-month follow-up. Clinically significant LV dilatation, defined as a >20% increase in LV end-diastolic volume at 6-month follow-up, was assessed using echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance. Thirty-two percent of patients developed clinically significant LV dilatation. BNP values on admission and at follow-up were significantly higher in patients who developed clinically significant LV dilatation at 6 months (182 +/- 117 vs 106 +/- 91 pmol/ml). After adjusting for age, infarct size, E-wave deceleration time, and the LV ejection fraction, BNP on admission was an independent predictor of LV dilatation, whether assessed by echocardiography (B = 0.075, p = 0.04) or cardiac magnetic resonance (B = 0.085, p = 0.04). In conclusion, high BNP levels on admission and at follow-up predict LV dilatation after STEMI. The early determination of plasma BNP upon admission for STEMI could be helpful in identifying patients at higher risk for LV dilatation, in whom aggressive management is warranted.",magnetic_resonance_imaging,0,9,14265.02,14043.6,14138.18,26228.79,30495.87,31140.79,6135.147

"Synovial tissue is rarely available from patients with early synovitis, with the exception of synovial biopsies. However, T cell populations early in the development of synovitis may be enriched in antigen-specific cells and critical to disease pathogenesis. To investigate the T cell repertoire in early synovitis, we utilized a PCR protocol for detection of T cell receptor (TCR) transcripts present in small amounts of synovial tissue. To expand the substrate for PCR, preamplification of cDNA was performed with a 3' constant region primer plus either a mixture of variable region primers or random hexanucleotides. Utilizing this method improved the sensitivity of detection. This technique is applied here to the analysis of TCR transcripts in synovial biopsies from individuals with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and non-RA synovitis. TCR alpha-chain transcripts were detectable in 5/5 RA and 4/4 non-RA specimens evaluated, with beta-chain transcripts detected in 4/5 early RA and 4/4 non-RA specimens evaluated. Confirmation of transcripts by sequencing of cloned PCR products verified the specificity of amplification. The most frequently expressed TCR V region families in early RA synovitis were V alpha 11, V alpha 14, V alpha 28, V beta 7, V beta 9 and V beta 17. Several of these V regions have previously been implicated in studies of chronic RA synovitis. J alpha and J beta region usage was similar to that seen in chronic RA, and conserved N region motifs were apparent. We conclude that it is possible to detect TCR transcripts in small synovial biopsies from individuals with early arthritis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",molecular_sequence_data,0,9,10375.24,9717.167,9352.101,19484.77,22117.86,21861.91,4408.711
"Tissue fibrosis is a leading cause of death in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). Effective antifibrotic treatments are not available. Here, the authors investigated inhibition of hedgehog signalling by targeting Smoothened (Smo) as a novel antifibrotic approach.

The activation status of the hedgehog pathway was assessed by immunohistochemistry for Gli transcription factors and by quantification of hedgehog target genes. Hedgehog signalling was inhibited by the selective inhibitor LDE223 and by small interfering RNA against Smo in the models of bleomycin-induced dermal fibrosis and in tight-skin-1 mice.

Hedgehog signalling is activated in SSc and in murine models of SSc. Inhibition of Smo either by LDE223 or by small interfering RNA prevented dermal thickening, myofibroblast differentiation and accumulation of collagen upon challenge with bleomycin. Targeting Smo also exerted potent antifibrotic effects in tight-skin-1 mice and did prevent progression of fibrosis and induced regression of pre-established fibrosis.

Inhibition of hedgehog signalling exerted potent antifibrotic effects in preclinical models of SSc in both preventive and therapeutic settings.

"In this study, we investigated whether wogonin significantly affects MUC5AC mucin gene expression and production in human airway epithelial cells. Confluent NCI-H292 cells were pretreated with wogonin for 30 min and then stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) for 24 h or the indicated periods. The MUC5AC mucin gene expression and mucin protein production were measured by RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. We found that incubation of NCI-H292 cells with wogonin significantly inhibited mucin production and down-regulated MUC5AC gene expression induced by TNF-Î± in a dose-dependent fashion. To elucidate the action mechanism of wogonin, effect of wogonin on TNF-Î±-induced NF-ÎºB signaling pathway was investigated by western blot analysis. Wogonin inhibited NF-ÎºB activation induced by TNF-Î±. Inhibition of IKK by wogonin led to the suppression of IÎºB phosphorylation and degradation, p65 nuclear translocation and NF-ÎºB-regulated gene expression. This, in turn, led to the down-regulation of MUC5AC protein production in NCI-H292 cells. Wogonin also inhibited the gene products involved in cell survival (Bcl-2) and proliferation (cyclooxygenase-2). These results suggest that wogonin inhibits the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, which may explain its role in the inhibition of MUC5AC mucin gene expression and production.",cell_line_tumor,0,8,13867.63,14148.54,14292.09,22185.98,26467.59,26858.34,5729.038
"An insidious increase in features of the 'metabolic syndrome' - obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia -- has conspired to produce a worldwide epidemic of type 2 insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus. Most current therapies for this disease were developed in the absence of defined molecular targets or an understanding of disease pathogenesis. Emerging knowledge of key pathogenic mechanisms, such as the impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and the role of 'lipotoxicity' as a probable cause of hepatic and muscle resistance to insulin's effects on glucose metabolism, has led to a host of new molecular drug targets.

"One of the most important issues in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD)-based brain functional magnetic resonance imaging is the understanding of the vascular structures that are responsible for the signal changes observed. The T2*-related signal changes observed during variations in susceptibility-induced magnetic field gradients are a function both of non-refocusable mechanisms, such as diffusion, and of refocusable effects such as field inhomogeneities. Conversely, T2-related signal changes are only a function of non-refocusable effects. It has been suggested that T2-weighted images could be less sensitive to blood susceptibility changes in a macrovascular environment than T2*-weighted images and could thus be more accurate in identifying the ""activation"" of the parenchyma rather than ""draining vein"" effects. In this study we use hypoxia and hypercapnia challenges in cats to provide a change in blood deoxyhemoglobin concentration (as a model for classic BOLD changes and not as a model for neuronal activation). A combined gradient echo and spin echo echo-planar-imaging (EPI) pulse sequence was used to map DeltaR2 (i.e., Delta(1/T2)) and DeltaR2* (i.e., Delta(1/T2*)) changes during the challenges. Our experiments demonstrate that: (i) the acquisition of T2-weighted EPI data does not in itself differentiate signal changes in the parenchyma from those occurring in regions around larger vessels, but that (ii) the simultaneous acquisition of T2- and T2*-weighted images could be useful in identifying microvascular regions in gray matter by analyzing the ratio DeltaR2/DeltaR2*. This value seems independent of the degree of deoxyhemoglobin concentration change, but is related to properties of the vascular environment. We suggest a possible application of the results to the study of brain function in humans.",magnetic_resonance_imaging,0,3,4953.992,3598.999,3616.942,8769.511,7404.606,7689.397,2006.554
"Clinical trials are essential to improve cancer therapy, but only 3% of newly diagnosed adult cancer patients enroll annually. We previously conducted a prospective analysis of factors affecting trial accrual at the UC Davis Cancer Center between 1997 and 2000. It was found that the accrual rate was 14% and that patients with private insurance were significantly less likely than patients with government insurance to enroll, suggesting that fear of insurance denial was a barrier. In 2002, a new California law (SB37) required insurers to reimburse routine costs of care for cancer trials.

To assess the impact of SB37 on accrual, we repeated our study using the same sur vey instrument. Oncologists seeing new patients at the UC Davis Cancer Center from August to November 2002 completed questionnaires that inquired about patient characteristics and eligibility, protocol availability, and patient willingness to participate.

Physicians considered clinical trials for 55% (118/216) of patients, but trials were available for only 53% (62/118). Eligibility criteria were met by 82% (51/62). Of these, 69% (35/51) agreed to participate (vs 51% previously). No patient declined to participate because of insurance limitations (vs 8% previously). Furthermore, insurance type was no longer a significant factor in determining whether patients would enroll. This suggests that although the overall rate of accrual is only slightly increased after passage of SB37, patients may be more willing to enroll. Efforts to increase participation must include enhancing physician and patient awareness of SB37.",neoplasms,0.2,1,6576.968,4238.235,4364.196,14271.56,14233.69,14637.85,5098.7
"Tumour cell lines derived from breast cancer patients constitute one of the cornerstones of breast cancer research. To characterise breast cancer cell lines at the genetic level, we have developed a full tiling path bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) array collection for comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH). This aCGH BAC collection covers 98% of the entire human genome at a resolution of 40-60 kbp. We have used this platform alongside an in-house produced 17 K cDNA microarray set to characterise the genetic and transcriptomic profiles of 24 breast cancer cell lines, as well as cell types derived from non-diseased breast. We demonstrate that breast cancer cell lines have genomic and transcriptomic features that recapitulate those of primary breast cancers and can be reliably subclassified into basal-like and luminal subgroups. By overlaying aCGH and transcriptomic data, we have identified 753 genes whose expression correlate with copy number; this list comprised numerous oncogenes recurrently amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer (e.g., HER2, MYC, CCND1 and AURKA). Finally, we demonstrate that although breast cancer cell lines have genomic features usually found in grade III breast cancers (i.e., gains of 1q, 8q and 20q), basal-like and luminal cell lines are characterised by distinct genomic aberrations.",cell_line_tumor,0,2,12441.02,9150.582,9329.038,22532.3,23790.84,23699.53,5292.557
"Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, for which a great deal of research has been devoted to analyze and characterize brain activity during seizures. While this can be done by a human expert, automatic methods still lag behind. This paper analyzes neural activity captured with Electrocorticogram (ECoG), recorded through intracranial implants from Kindling model test subjects. The goal is to automatically identify the main seizure stages: Pre-Ictal, Ictal and Post-Ictal. While visually differentiating each stage can be done by an expert if the complete time-series is available, the goal here is to automatically identify the corresponding stage of short signal segments.

The proposal is to pose the above task as a supervised classification problem and derive a mapping function that classifies each signal segment. Given the complexity of the signal patterns, it is difficult to a priori choose any particular classifier. Therefore, Genetic Programming (GP), a population based meta-heuristic for automatic program induction, is used to automatically search for the mapping functions. Two GP-based classifiers are used and extensively evaluated. The signals from epileptic seizures are obtained using the Kindling model of elicited epilepsy in rodent test subjects, for which a seizure was elicited and recorded on four separate days.

Results show that signal segments from a single seizure can be used to derive accurate classifiers that generalize when tested on different signals from the same subject; i.e., GP can automatically produce accurate mapping functions for intra-subject classification. A large number of experiments are performed with the GP classifiers achieving good performance based on standard performance metrics. Moreover, a proof-of-concept real-world prototype is presented, where a GP classifier is transferred and hard-coded on an embedded system using a digital-to-analogue converter and a field programmable gate array, achieving a low average classification error of 14.55%, sensitivity values between 0.65 and 0.97, and specificity values between 0.86 and 0.94.

The proposed approach achieves good results for stage identification, particularly when compared with previous works that focus on this task. The results show that the problem of intra-class classification can be solved with a low error, and high sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, the limitations of the approach are identified and good operating configurations can be proposed based on the results.",algorithms,0.4,3,5580.568,4343.432,4284.777,9450.224,8789.031,8935.896,2219.156
"Based on ""quantitative pharmaco-EEG"" using computer-analyzed EEG (CEEG) measurements, unknown CNS effects of lisuride hydrogen maleate (LHM) were established. CEEG profiles of LHM in low dosages (less than or equal to 10 mcg) are similar to CNS ""inhibitory"" compounds, while in higher dosages (25 mcg to 100 mcg) they resemble ""psychostimulant"" compounds. By measuring the brain function using computer period analysis of cerebral biopotentials, dose-efficacy relations were found (in the range of 25-75 mcg) which suggest the bioavailability of LHM at the CNS level. By comparing the CEEG profiles of LHM with the previously studied compounds, five different clinical uses of LHM were predicted. The pilot trials suggest that LHM may have therapeutic potentials in patients with ""aging"" and/or organic brain syndromes, and in children with behavioral disturbances.",obesity,0.2,9,11204.85,12210.6,12597.78,19905.99,22017.41,22564.84,5169.389
"Prenatal ethanol exposure (PEE) induces dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia in fetus and adult offspring. However, whether PEE increases the susceptibility to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in offspring and its underlying mechanism remain unknown. This study aimed to demonstrate an increased susceptibility to high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD and its intrauterine programming mechanisms in female rat offspring with PEE. Rat model of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) was established by PEE, the female fetus and adult offspring that fed normal diet (ND) or HFD were sacrificed. The results showed that, in PEE+ND group, serum corticosterone (CORT) slightly decreased and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and glucose increased with partial catch-up growth; In PEE+HFD group, serum CORT decreased, while serum IGF-1, glucose and triglyceride (TG) increased, with notable catch-up growth, higher metabolic status and NAFLD formation. Enhanced liver expression of the IGF-1 pathway, gluconeogenesis, and lipid synthesis as well as reduced expression of lipid output were accompanied in PEE+HFD group. In PEE fetus, serum CORT increased while IGF-1 decreased, with low body weight, hyperglycemia, and hepatocyte ultrastructural changes. Hepatic IGF-1 expression as well as lipid output was down-regulated, while lipid synthesis significantly increased. Based on these findings, we propose a ""two-programming"" hypothesis for an increased susceptibility to HFD-induced NAFLD in female offspring of PEE. That is, the intrauterine programming of liver glucose and lipid metabolic function is ""the first programming"", and postnatal adaptive catch-up growth triggered by intrauterine programming of GC-IGF1 axis acts as ""the second programming"".",signal_transduction,0,9,18384.65,19010.41,19129.85,29487.69,37809.58,36834.25,8368.341
"Cardiac differentiation involves a cascade of coordinated gene expression that regulates cell proliferation and matrix protein formation in a defined temporo-spatial manner. The zinc-finger-containing transcription factor has been implicated as a critical regulator of multiple cardiac-expressed genes as well as a regulator of inducible gene expression in response to hypertrophic stimulation. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathways are among the most widespread mechanisms of eukaryotic cell regulation. The MAPKs function inside the nucleus and target transcription factors that are prebound to DNA. Many transcription factors are probably important MAPK targets. Here, we have cloned a new zinc-finger gene named ZNF411 using degenerate primers from an early embryo heart cDNA library, which mapped to 19p13.11. The ZNF411 gene consists of 2360 nucleotides and encodes a protein of 499 amino acids with an amino-terminal KRAB domain and eleven carboxy-terminal C2H2 zinc-finger units. Northern blot analysis indicates that a 2.4 kb transcript specific for ZNF411 is expressed in heart, skeletal muscle, and placenta at adult stage and is expressed in most of the examined embryonic tissues, especially at a higher level in skeletal muscle, heart, and pancreas. ZNF411 protein distributes evenly in nuclei when overexpressed in the cells. Reporter gene assays show that ZNF411 is a transcriptional repressor and overexpression of ZNF411 in the COS-7 cells inhibits the transcriptional activities of AP-1 and SRE. These results indicate that ZNF411 is a member of the zinc-finger transcription factor family and may be involved in the heart development, and it probably works as a negative regulator in MAPK signaling pathway.",molecular_sequence_data,0,9,9466.017,7344.574,7258.486,12915.81,10729.78,10861.1,4054.031
"Fibronectin (Fn) matrices are vital to vertebrate development and wound healing and modulate tumorigenesis. We used a recombinant Fn-binding integrin alpha IIb beta3, to define rules for integrin-initiated Fn matrix formation. We report the following. First, multiple Fn-binding integrins can support matrix assembly; their activation state controls fibrillogenesis. Second, Fn binding to cells expressing an activated integrin is necessary but not sufficient for matrix assembly. Additional ""postoccupancy"" events involving the integrin beta, but not the alpha subunit, cytoplasmic domain are needed. Third, these postoccupancy events require an intact actin cytoskeleton.

"Global growth of the elderly population is requiring health care providers to cater to an expanding elderly cancer subpopulation. Surgeons are called upon to provide optimal cancer management for this heterogeneous group in par with care provided for younger patients, an ethical dilemma that is compounded by an ill-understood tumor biology. Delivery of suboptimal surgical cancer treatment due to ageist attitudes and personal beliefs is no longer acceptable. Cancer surgeons have to offer optimal surgery in consideration of individualized operative risk. The need for a tool to assess operative risk and predict postoperative outcome is obvious. This article wishes to raise awareness among surgeons about epidemiology, physiologic changes, performance status and comorbidities, and patterns of care and ways to improve them.

"The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of automated nodal quantification in a phantom. MDCT of a phantom with 17 synthetic lymph nodes of different sizes (diameter 6.0-30.0 mm) was performed at varying tube currents, reconstruction kernels and slice thicknesses. RECIST diameter and volume were measured using an automated software tool. Results were compared with the reference diameter and volume by calculating the absolute percentage error (APE). Degree of agreement between software and reference measurements was evaluated by computing corresponding concordance correlation coefficients (CCC). Under varying tube currents the mean APE (CCC) varied between 5.18% and 10.12% (0.95-0.99) for RECIST diameter and between 7.22% and 16.21% (0.94-1.00) for the volume. At different reconstruction kernels the mean APE values ranged between 7.20% and 7.55% (0.99) (RECIST) and between 8.96% and 14.42% (1.00) (volume).

"Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is a widespread environmental genotoxic carcinogen that damages DNA by forming adducts. This damage along with activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) induces complex transcriptional responses in cells. To investigate whether human cells are more susceptible to BaP in a particular phase of the cell cycle, synchronised breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells were exposed to BaP. Cell cycle progression was analysed by flow cytometry, DNA adduct formation was assessed by 32P-postlabeling analysis, microarrays of 44K human genome-wide oligos and RT-PCR were used to detect gene expression (mRNA) changes and Western blotting was performed to determine the expression of some proteins, including cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1 and CYP1B1, which are involved in BaP metabolism.

Following BaP exposure, cells evaded G1 arrest and accumulated in S-phase. Higher levels of DNA damage occurred in S- and G2/M- compared with G0/G1-enriched cultures. Genes that were found to have altered expression included those involved in xenobiotic metabolism, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation and DNA repair. Gene ontology and pathway analysis showed the involvement of various signalling pathways in response to BaP exposure, such as the Catenin/Wnt pathway in G1, the ERK pathway in G1 and S, the Nrf2 pathway in S and G2/M and the Akt pathway in G2/M. An important finding was that higher levels of DNA damage in S- and G2/M-enriched cultures correlated with higher levels of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNA and proteins. Moreover, exposure of synchronised MCF-7 cells to BaP-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE), the ultimate carcinogenic metabolite of BaP, did not result in significant changes in DNA adduct levels at different phases of the cell cycle.

This study characterised the complex gene response to BaP in MCF-7 cells and revealed a strong correlation between the varying efficiency of BaP metabolism and DNA damage in different phases of the cell cycle.

"MicroRNA (miR)-203 is known to be downregulated and to act as an anti-oncomir in melanoma cells. At present, we found that exogenous miR-203 increased pigmentation and protein expression levels of the melanoma antigen recognized by T cells (Melan-As/MART1s) and/or tyrosinase (TYR) in the human melanoma cells tested. Inversely, treatment with an inhibitor of miR-203 downregulated the expression level of TYR. The target gene of miR-203 involved in the mechanism was kinesin superfamily protein 5b (kif5b), which was revealed by gene silencing using short interfering RNA and luciferase activity assay. Furthermore, immunocytochemistry showed obvious accumulation of melanosomes around nuclei of human melanoma Mewo cells transfected with miR-203 or siR-kif5b. Importantly, treatment with the miR-203 inhibitor, but not miR-203, exhibited effects on human epidermal melanocytes isolated from lightly pigmented adult skin similar to those on melanoma cells. In addition, the data indicated that exogenous miR-203 also negatively regulated the cAMP response element-binding protein 1 (CREB1)/microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)/Rab27a pathway, which is one of the main pathways active in melanoma cells.

The data were analyzed by applying a one-compartment model with both zero-order and first-order absorptions based on a nonlinear least squares method, Bayesian algorithm. The present study indicated that the zero-order absorption model provided better estimated pharmacokinetic parameters than the first-order absorption model. It was also found that prediction by the Bayesian method is dependent on number of sampling trials, but the best sampling time is still unknown.

Data from 70 children who participated in a trial of a weight management programme for obese children were analysed. BMI was plotted on UK 1990 charts at baseline, 6 months and 12 months, and four clinicians experienced in obesity management independently scored the charts on a five-point scale for how successful children were in tackling their obesity over a 6-month period. Scores were compared with change in BMI, fat mass and lean mass z-scores as measured by DXA.

54 children (aged 8-15 years; BMI z-score 2.93 (SD 0.48)) had simultaneous BMI and DXA scans performed, giving 104 pairs of measurements 6 months apart. There was good consistency between clinicians' scores for weight management and these related well to change in BMI and fat mass z-scores, but not lean mass z-score. They reported that measurement proximity to centile lines and crossing of lines influenced their confidence in making a decision and change in severe obesity was harder to judge as higher centile lines are so far apart.

"Botulinum neurotoxin (NT) serotype E is synthesized by Clostridium botulinum as an approximately 150-kDa single-chain polypeptide of 1252 amino acid residues of which 8 are Cys residues [Puolet et al. (1992); Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 183, 107-113]. The posttranslational processing of the gene product removes only the initiating methionine. A very narrow segment of this 1251-residue-long mature protein--at one-third the distance from the N-terminus (between residues Lys 418 and Arg 421)--is highly sensitive to proteases, such as trypsin. The single-chain NT easily undergoes an exogenous posttranslational modification by trypsin; residues 419-421 (Gly-Ile-Arg) are excised. The proteolytically processed NT is a dichain protein in which Pro 1-Lys 418 constitute the approximately 50-kDa light chain, Lys 422-Lys 1251 constitute the approximately 100-kDa heavy chain; Cys 411-Cys 425 and Cys 1196-Cys 1237 form the interchain and intrachain disulfide bonds, respectively; the other four Cys residues at positions 25, 346, 941, and 1035 remain as free sulfhydryl groups. The approximately 150-kDa dichain NT, and separated light and heavy chains, were fragmented with CNBr and endoproteases (pepsin and clostripain); some of these fragments were carboxymethylated with iodoacetamide (with or without 14C label) before and after fragmentation. The fragments were separated and analyzed for amino acid compositions and sequences by Edman degradation to determine the complete covalent structure of the dichain type E NT.

Participants comprised a sample of 15 Chinese-Australians who had been recruited through several community-based organizations.

The level of acculturation does not correlate with holding beliefs about inheritance, kinship, and causes of hereditary cancer that are based on ""Western"" biomedical or traditional concepts.

"MRI and MRS techniques are being applied to the characterisation of various aspects of the tumour microenvironment and to the assessment of tumour response to therapy. For example, kinetic parameters describing tumour blood vessel flow and permeability can be derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI data and have been correlated with a positive tumour response to antivascular therapies. The ongoing development and validation of noninvasive, high-resolution anatomical/molecular MR techniques will equip us with the means to detect specific tumour biomarkers early on, and then to monitor the efficacy of cancer treatments efficiently and reliably, all within a clinically relevant time frame. Reliable tumour microenvironment imaging biomarkers will provide obvious advantages by enabling tumour-specific treatment tailoring and potentially improving patient outcome. However, for routine clinical application across many disease types, such imaging biomarkers must be quantitative, robust, reproducible, sufficiently sensitive and cost-effective.

"SH2 domains are found in a variety of signal transduction proteins; they bind phosphotyrosine-containing sequences, allowing them to both recognize target molecules and regulate intramolecular kinase activity. Fyn is a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases that are involved in signal transduction by association with a number of membrane receptors. The kinase activity of these signalling proteins is modulated by switching the binding mode of their SH2 and SH3 domains from intramolecular to intermolecular. The molecular basis of the signalling roles observed for different Src family members is still not well understood; although structures have been determined for the SH2 domains of other Src family molecules, this is the first structure of the Fyn SH2 domain.

The structure of the Fyn SH2 domain in complex with a phosphotyrosyl peptide (EPQpYEEIPIYL) was determined by high resolution NMR spectroscopy. The overall structure of the complex is analogous to that of other SH2-peptide complexes. Noteworthy aspects of the structure are: the BG loop, which contacts the bound peptide, contains a type-I' turn; a capping-box-like interaction is present at the N-terminal end of helix alpha A; cis-trans isomerization of the Val beta G1-Pro beta G2 peptide bond causes conformational heterogeneity of residues near the N and C termini of the domain.

Comparison of the Fyn SH2 domain structure with other structures of SH2 domains highlights several interesting features. Conservation of helix capping interactions among various SH2 domains is suggestive of a role in protein stabilisation. The presence of a type-I' turn in the BG loop, which is dependent on the presence of a glycine residue at position BG3, is indicative of a binding pocket, characteristic of the Src family, SykC and Abl, rather than a binding groove found in PLC-gamma 1C, p85 alpha N and Shc, for example.",molecular_sequence_data,0.6,9,6226.772,5158.043,5135.847,9667.721,7998.906,8164.038,2946.149
"Organic-inorganic hybrid nanoparticles with calcium phosphate (CaP) core and PEGylated shell were developed to incorporate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid gadolinium (III) (Gd-DTPA) for noninvasive diagnosis of solid tumors.

"This article concerns one of the most important problems of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) based on Steady State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP), that is the selection of the a-priori most suitable frequencies for stimulation. Previous works related to this problem were done either with measuring systems that have little in common with actual BCI systems (e.g., single flashing LED) or were presented on a small number of subjects, or the tested frequency range did not cover a broad spectrum. Their results indicate a strong SSVEP response around 10 Hz, in the range 13-25 Hz, and at high frequencies in the band of 40-60 Hz. In the case of BCI interfaces, stimulation with frequencies from various ranges are used. The frequencies are often adapted for each user separately. The selection of these frequencies, however, was not yet justified in quantitative group-level study with proper statistical account for inter-subject variability. The aim of this study is to determine the SSVEP response curve, that is, the magnitude of the evoked signal as a function of frequency. The SSVEP response was induced in conditions as close as possible to the actual BCI system, using a wide range of frequencies (5-30 Hz, in step of 1 Hz). The data were obtained for 10 subjects. SSVEP curves for individual subjects and the population curve was determined. Statistical analysis were conducted both on the level of individual subjects and for the group. The main result of the study is the identification of the optimal range of frequencies, which is 12-18 Hz, for the registration of SSVEP phenomena. The applied criterion of optimality was: to find the largest contiguous range of frequencies yielding the strong and constant-level SSVEP response.",algorithms,0.2,7,4076.53,3020.933,2973.727,7857.466,6060.27,6005.993,1879.484
"5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is one of the most common chemotherapeutic agents used for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, chemoresistance has precluded the use of 5-FU alone in clinical regimens. Combination therapies with 5-FU and other anticancer agents are considered to be a therapeutic option for patients with HCC. We previously reported that the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) can decrease the sensitivity of HCC cells to 5-FU. To overcome this problem, in this study, we elucidated the mechanism underlying EGFRvIII-mediated 5-FU resistance. We observed that EGFRvIII expression can induce miR-520d-3p downregulation and the ensuing upregulation of the transcription factor E2F-1 and the enzyme thymidylate synthase (TS), which may lead to drug resistance. Intriguingly, we found that CH12, a monoclonal antibody directed against EGFRvIII, and 5-FU together had an additive antitumor effect on EGFRvIII-positive HCC xenografts and significantly improved survival in all mice with established tumors when compared with either 5-FU or CH12 alone. Mechanistically, compared with 5-FU alone, the combination more noticeably downregulated EGFR phosphorylation and Akt phosphorylation as well as the expression of the apoptotic protector Bcl-xL and the cell cycle regulator cyclin D1. Additionally, the combination upregulated the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 in in vivo treatment. More interestingly, CH12 treatment upregulated miR-520-3p and downregulated E2F-1 and TS at the mRNA and protein levels. Collectively, these observations suggest that the combination of 5-FU with mAb CH12 is a potential means of circumventing EGFRvIII-mediated 5-FU resistance in HCC.",cell_line_tumor,0.2,9,8194.978,7071.726,6982.193,11888.15,11123.08,10702.99,3934.682
"Successful trophoblast invasion and transformation of the maternal spiral arteries requires that the pregnant endometrium (i.e., decidua) act in an immunologically paradoxical fashion, accepting the semi-allogenic placenta, while maintaining host defenses against an array of microbial pathogens. In contrast to the growing evidence that the immune surveillance molecules known as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are expressed by trophoblasts and fetal membranes, to date, no studies have been conducted on the decidua.

Decidual tissues and cells were obtained from women undergoing first trimester elective terminations or repeat Cesarean sections and analyzed at both the protein and mRNA level.

We now demonstrate for the first time that human decidua differentially express TLRs and their downstream signaling molecules as well as TLR stimulated induction of cytokine production in the first and third trimester of pregnancy.

These findings suggest that the decidua is a critical component of the innate immune response in pregnancy.

"Our objectives were to (1) describe the clinical characteristics of and viruses isolated from patients who presented with neurologic symptoms associated with influenza A infection and were hospitalized at Texas Children's Hospital during October and November 2003 and (2) to raise awareness of the neurologic complications of influenza among US children.

We reviewed the medical and laboratory records of all children who were hospitalized with neurologic symptoms and who also had evidence of influenza virus infection by rapid antigen testing or viral isolation.

Eight children aged 5 months to 9 years with neurologic complications associated with influenza A were identified. None of the children had received the influenza vaccine. Four presented with seizures, 3 with mental status changes, and 1 with mutism. All but 1 of the patients had influenza A viral antigen detected in nasal wash samples. Influenza A virus was isolated in culture from nasal wash specimens obtained from 6 of the patients; influenza A virus was also isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of 1 of these patients. None of the patients had serum metabolic abnormalities or other cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities. Three of the patients had brain imaging abnormalities. Five of the patients were treated with antivirals. All 8 of the patients survived, 6 with complete recovery and 2 with sequelae (1 mild and 1 severe).

Neurologic symptoms and sequelae were associated with influenza A virus infection in children during the 2003-2004 influenza season in Houston, Texas.

"Apart from assessing the nutrition status, the diagnosis of obesity also includes the assessment of mass and distribution of adipose tissue which provides revealing of latent types of obesity that hold higher health risks. The aim of our study was to assess the nutritional status and to analyze the prevalence of normal weight obesity and abdominal obesity in students from the University of Novi Sad.

The body mass index, waist circumference and body fat mass were assessed in the group of 371 students from the University of Novi Sad (their average age being 22.9 +/- 2.5 y).

One-fifth of the study sample students were found to be overweight and obese, i.e. 21% and 1.1%, respectively. The frequency of overweight and obesity was higher in male respondents (overweight: 41.67% vs. 6.05%; obesity: 1.92% vs. 0.46%). Among the survey respondents, there were 4.6% of underweight students, all of whom were female students. Body fat was found to be increased in 11% of the students, the frequency being higher in the males. The phenomenon of obesity in normal body mass was recorded in 7% of the respondents, being more frequent in female students. The total of 5.6% of female students and 5.8% of male students had abdominal obesity.

"Of the thirteen active carbonic anhydrase (CA) isozymes, the transmembrane isoform CA IX has been shown to be linked with carcinogenesis. CA IX presents an ectopic expression in a multitude of carcinomas derived from cervix, uteri, kidney, lung, oesophagus, breast, colon, etc., contrasting with its restricted expression in normal tissues, namely in the epithelia of the gastrointestinal tract. It has been demonstrated that this membrane-bound CA is strongly overexpressed in hypoxic tumors, participating in tumor cell environment acidosis and contributing to malignant progression and poor treatment outcome. Targeting CA IX could thus be an important means of controlling cancer disease. Modulation of extracellular tumor pH via inhibition of CA IX activity represents a promising approach to novel anticancer therapies. Much attention has recently been paid to the CA IX inhibitors drug design, and efforts have been made to obtain isozyme IX inhibitors, with putative applications as antitumor drugs/diagnostic agents.

"Assessing the pharmacodynamics (PD) of a potential therapeutic through the use of a downstream biomarker is essential. This is traditionally performed in the target tissue but limited volume and invasiveness of sampling pose challenges with solid tumours. Currently, there are several small molecule receptor kinase inhibitors and large molecule therapeutic antibodies in clinical trials that interfere with TGFbeta signalling to treat various forms of cancer. With the advent of these new therapies, there is a need for a surrogate tissue that is easily accessible and indicative of tumour response. We propose the use of an ex vivo TGFbeta1 stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) coupled with the measurement of phosphorylated SMAD2 (Sma/Mothers Against dpp, a downstream transcriptional activator) using a sandwich ELISA. TGFbeta is involved in many different cellular responses, such as proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, invasion and immunomodulation. SMAD2 and SMAD3 are phosphorylated as a result of the canonical cascade through ligand binding and receptor kinase activation. These phosphorylated SMADs (pSMAD) associate with SMAD4, a co-SMAD, and transcriptionally activate TGFbeta-mediated genes. This paper describes the novel method for measuring the downstream effects of inhibiting canonical TGFbeta signalling using ex vivo stimulation of surrogate tissue to predict tumour response. In addition, we present the assay validation rationale and data. This novel, validated assay can be used to gain insight into clinical trials regarding TGFbeta signal modulation by multiple inhibitor platforms for both large and small molecules.",cell_line_tumor,0.4,9,9999.382,6663.268,6267.975,15481.31,13121.63,12541.65,3651.056
"p50 is phosphorylated in mitogen-stimulated T cells, and translocated from the membrane to the cytosol after activation of protein kinase C. Sequence analysis of p50 revealed that it is identical with LSP1, a putative calcium-binding and actin-binding protein. lymphocyte form of p50 exhibits heterogeneity in the apparent molecular mass on SDS-PAGE, 50 and 52 kDa (pp50 and pp52), and each isoform exhibits heterogeneity in the isoelectric point, when examined by two-dimensional PAGE. When the two molecular mass variants of p50 were dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase, both isoforms showed the same apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa on SDS-PAGE, but could be distinguished by their distinct isoelectric points. Dephosphorylated pp50 (p50a) has an acidic pI compared with dephosphorylated pp52 (p50b). Comparison of the peptide maps of purified p50a and p50b on HPLC revealed that the difference was limited to one peptide peak. NH2-terminal sequence and mass spectrometric analyses of these peptides showed that the peptides derived from p50a and p50b had the same NH2-terminal amino acid sequence up to eight residues, but had distinct molecular masses, 5,533.4 and 6,318.6 Da, respectively. These data suggested that pp52 (p50b) is the product of the previously cloned cDNA and the reduction in the molecular mass of the p50a-derived peptide could be explained by deletion of six amino acid residues, EHLIRH or HLIRHQ.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",molecular_sequence_data,0.4,9,8955.079,7835.343,8025.174,12522.01,12969.92,13335.94,4119.013
"Heterotrimeric G protein signaling is involved in many pathways essential to development including those controlling cell migration, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. One key developmental event known to rely on proper heterotrimeric G protein signaling is primordial germ cell (PGC) migration. We previously developed an in vivo PGC migration assay that identified differences in the signaling capacity of G protein gamma subunits. In this study we developed GÎ³ subunit chimeras to determine the regions of GÎ³ isoforms that are responsible for these differences. The central section of the GÎ³ subunit was found to be necessary for the ability of a GÎ³ subunit to mediate signaling involved in PGC migration. Residues found in the carboxy-terminal segment of GÎ³ transducin (gngt1) were found to be responsible for the ability of this subunit to disrupt PGC migration. The type of prenylation did not affect the ability of a GÎ³ subunit to reverse prenylation-deficient-GÎ³-induced PGC migration defects. However, a version of gng2, engineered to be farnesylated instead of geranylgeranylated, still lacks the ability to reverse PGC migration defects known to result from treatment of zebrafish with geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitors (GGTI), supporting the notion that GÎ³ subunits are one of several protein targets that need to be geranylgeranylated to orchestrate the proper long-range migration of PGCs.",signal_transduction,0.2,9,6352.837,4059.466,4092.038,10717.68,8848.643,8975.836,3320.857
"The GluR2 flop subunit of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors greatly determines calcium permeability and kinetic properties of heteromeric AMPA subunit assemblies. Post-transcriptional editing of this subunit at the Q/R/N site controls calcium permeability whereas editing at the R/G site is involved in the regulation of biophysical properties. We used patch-clamp techniques with ultrafast solution exchange to examine the kinetics of recombinant human homomeric GluR2 flop channels transiently expressed in HEK293 cells [edited at the R/G site and Q/R/N site (GR), and unedited (RN) and edited (GN) at the R/G site both with asparagine (N) at the Q/R/N site]. The time constant of desensitization after application of 10 mm glutamate was 1.38 +/- 0.05 ms (n = 10), 5.53 +/- 0.57 ms (n = 7) and 1.33 +/- 0.06 ms (n = 12) for the GluR2 flop GR, RN and GN channels, respectively. The time constant of resensitization was 75 ms for the GluR2 flop RN and 30 ms for the GN channels. The dose-dependence of the peak current amplitude, kinetics of activation and deactivation, and peak open probability did not differ between RN and GN channels. The study shows that desensitization and resensitization kinetics of homomeric GluR2 flop channels are controlled by a single amino acid exchange (glycine by arginine) at the R/G site.

"More than a quarter of the world's population is infected with nematode parasites, and more than a hundred species of nematodes are parasites of humans [1-3]. Despite extensive morbidity and mortality caused by nematode parasites, the biological mechanisms of host-parasite interactions are poorly understood, largely because of the lack of genetically tractable model systems. We have demonstrated that the insect parasitic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, its bacterial symbiont Photorhabdus luminescens, and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster constitute a tripartite model for nematode parasitism and parasitic infection. We find that infective juveniles (IJs) of Heterorhabditis, which contain Photorhabdus in their gut, can infect and kill Drosophila larvae. We show that infection activates an immune response in Drosophila that results in the temporally dynamic expression of a subset of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes, and that this immune response is induced specifically by Photorhabdus. We also investigated the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying IJ recovery, the developmental process that occurs in parasitic nematodes upon host invasion and that is necessary for successful parasitism. We find that the chemosensory neurons and signaling pathways that control dauer recovery in Caenorhabditis elegans also control IJ recovery in Heterorhabditis, suggesting conservation of these developmental processes across free-living and parasitic nematodes.",signal_transduction,0,6,8249.758,7112.698,7130.726,13039.25,12431.86,12696.75,4119.747
"Silibinin is known to exert growth inhibition and cell death together with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells. Whether silibinin could inhibit the invasion, motility and migration of prostate cancer cells remains largely unknown. This study was designed to evaluate this efficacy and possible mechanisms using a novel highly bone metastatic ARCaP(M) cell model.

Four prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP, PC-3, DU145, and ARCaP(M), were used in this study. These cells were treated with increasing concentrations of silibinin (50, 100, and 200 micromol/L) for different periods of time. After treatment, cell viabilities of four prostate cancer cells were compared by MTT assay. Alterations of ARCaP(M) cell invasion, motility and migration were assessed by cell invasion, motility and wound healing assays. The changes of vimentin expression were observed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining, and the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and uPA was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

ARCaP(M) cells showed less sensitivity to the growth inhibition of pharmacological doses of silibinin than LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145 cells. However, silibinin exerted significant dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effects on the invasion, motility and migration of ARCaP(M) cells. Furthermore, the expression of vimentin and MMP-2, but not MMP-9 or uPA, was down-regulated in a dose- and time-dependent manner after treatment of silibinin.

"In Compton cameras, the measured scattering angle is associated with an uncertainty which becomes larger as the incident gamma-ray energy decreases. Since this uncertainty degrades the spatial resolution of reconstructed images, Hirasawa and Tomitani (2003 Phys. Med. Biol. 48 1009-26) previously revised their analytical reconstruction algorithm to compensate for it. As the new algorithm improved the spatial resolution in effect, they expected an enhancement of the statistical noise. In this paper, the effect of this compensation has been analysed in view of spatial resolution (the FWHM of the noise-free reconstructed image for a point source distribution), statistical noise (the relative standard deviation of reconstructed images for an isotropic source distribution) and image quality (the roughness of reconstructed images for a phantom). The results describe not only the effect of the compensation, but also the relation between the statistical noise and three parameters, i.e., the incident gamma-ray energy, the spatial resolution and the measured total event numbers, in reconstruction with compensation. This relation should be taken into account for the design of Compton cameras with good quality images, i.e., useful image, output.",algorithms,0,6,6941.497,6196.116,6245.142,12346.96,11182.22,11164.67,2397.734
"Diastolic heart failure is defined clinically when signs and symptoms of heart failure are present in the presence of preserved left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction&>45%). The incidence and prevalence of primary diastolic heart failure increases with age and it may be as high as 50% in the elderly. Age, female gender, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and increased body mass index are risk factors for diastolic heart failure. Hemodynamic consequences such as increased pulmonary venous pressure, post-capillary pulmonary hypertension, and secondary right heart failure as well as decreased cardiac output are similar to those of systolic left ventricular failure, although the nature of primary left ventricular dysfunction is different. Diagnosis of primary diastolic heart failure depends on the presence of preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. Assessment of diastolic dysfunction is preferable but not mandatory. It is to be noted that increased levels of B-type natriuretic peptide does not distinguish between diastolic and systolic heart failure. Echocardiographic studies are recommended to exclude hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, infiltrative heart disease, primary valvular heart disease, and constrictive pericarditis. Myocardial stress imaging is frequently required to exclude ischemic heart disease. The prognosis of diastolic heart failure is variable; it is related to age, severity of heart failure, and associated comorbid diseases such as coronary artery disease. The prognosis of severe diastolic heart failure is similar to that of systolic heart failure. However, cautious use of diuretics and/or nitrates may cause hypotension and low output state. Heart rate control is essential to improving ventricular filling. Pharmacologic agents such as angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers are used in selected patients to decrease left ventricular hypertrophy.

"Oxidative stress has been implicated in the cell death that occurs after ischemia-reperfusion of the brain, which causes the production of reactive oxygen species and a decrease in antioxidants, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the invasive methods used to collect much of this evidence are themselves stress inducing, which could skew the results. In this study, we aimed at demonstrating brain redox alterations after ischemia-reperfusion noninvasively, using Overhauser-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. The reduction rate of 3-methoxycarbonyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidine-L-oxyl (methoxycarbonyl-PROXYL), a redox-sensitive contrast agent, was used as an index of the redox status in vivo. No changes were observed in the antioxidant concentration, the mitochondrial complex activity, or in the redox status image intensity after 3 h of reperfusion, following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion; however, after 24 h of reperfusion, the methoxycarbonyl-PROXYL reduction rate, calculated from continuous images, had decreased significantly.

"Anticancer drugs are effective against tumors that depend on the molecular target of the drug. Known targets of cytotoxic anticancer drugs are involved in cell proliferation; drugs acting on such targets are ineffective against nonproliferating tumor cells, survival of which leads to eventual therapy failure. Function-based genomic screening identified the coatomer protein complex Î¶1 (COPZ1) gene as essential for different tumor cell types but not for normal cells. COPZ1 encodes a subunit of coatomer protein complex 1 (COPI) involved in intracellular traffic and autophagy. The knockdown of COPZ1, but not of COPZ2 encoding isoform coatomer protein complex Î¶2, caused Golgi apparatus collapse, blocked autophagy, and induced apoptosis in both proliferating and nondividing tumor cells. In contrast, inhibition of normal cell growth required simultaneous knockdown of both COPZ1 and COPZ2. COPZ2 (but not COPZ1) was down-regulated in the majority of tumor cell lines and in clinical samples of different cancer types. Reexpression of COPZ2 protected tumor cells from killing by COPZ1 knockdown, indicating that tumor cell dependence on COPZ1 is the result of COPZ2 silencing. COPZ2 displays no tumor-suppressive activities, but it harbors microRNA 152, which is silenced in tumor cells concurrently with COPZ2 and acts as a tumor suppressor in vitro and in vivo.

"Inactivating mutations of the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) gene, NF2, result predominantly in benign neurological tumors, schwannomas and meningiomas, in humans; however, mutations in murine Nf2 lead to a broad spectrum of cancerous tumors. The tumor-suppressive function of the NF2 protein, merlin, a membrane-cytoskeleton linker, remains unclear. Here, we identify the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) as a novel mediator of merlin's tumor suppressor activity. Merlin-deficient human meningioma cells and merlin knockdown arachnoidal cells, the nonneoplastic cell counterparts of meningiomas, exhibit rapamycin-sensitive constitutive mTORC1 activation and increased growth. NF2 patient tumors and Nf2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts demonstrate elevated mTORC1 signaling. Conversely, the exogenous expression of wild-type merlin isoforms, but not a patient-derived L64P mutant, suppresses mTORC1 signaling. Merlin does not regulate mTORC1 via the established mechanism of phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt or mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-mediated TSC2 inactivation and may instead regulate TSC/mTOR signaling in a novel fashion. In conclusion, the deregulation of mTORC1 activation underlies the aberrant growth and proliferation of NF2-associated tumors and may restrain the growth of these lesions through negative feedback mechanisms, suggesting that rapamycin in combination with phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors may be therapeutic for NF2.",signal_transduction,0,8,17256.43,17627.8,17642.93,27262.32,28345.2,28647.49,8767.643
"We have cloned and sequenced the single-copy nuclear gene (GapC) encoding the complete 335-amino acid cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPC) from the red alga Gracilaria verrucosa. The proline residue which contributes to the specificity of NAD+ binding in other GAPC-like proteins is present. Putative regulatory regions, including GC-rich regions, a GATA element, and 11-base T- and T/G-clusters, but excluding TATA- and CCAAT-boxes, were identified upstream. Two types of GapC cDNAs differing in polyadenylation site were characterized. An 80-bp phase-two spliceosomal intron was identified in a novel position interrupting the highly conserved cofactor-coding region I. The G. verrucosa GAPC was easily aligned with other known GAPC-type sequences.

"To test whether a feeding algorithm could improve the nutritional support of intensive care patients.

Numerous factors may impede delivery of both enteral and parenteral nutrition to patients in the intensive care unit. Often there is a discrepancy between what is prescribed and actual delivery of nutrients. The purpose of this study was to test the effect of a nutritional support algorithm in an intensive care unit mainly by using the enteral route and if necessary by combining enteral and parenteral nutrition.

In this prospective study, nutritional data were collected from routinely fed critically ill patients (controls, n=21) during the first three days following admission to the intensive care unit. A nutritional support algorithm was then implemented and nutritional data were collected from critically ill patients who participated in this intervention (intervention group, n=21). Data collected included the total amount of calories prescribed vs. received, onset of delivery of enteral nutrition, enteral vs. parenteral nutrition, and the use and size of enteral feeding tubes.

Patients in the intervention group were both prescribed and actually received significantly larger amounts of nutrients than patients in the control group. They also received a larger proportion of their nutrients in the form of enteral nutrition. In addition, the nutritional support algorithm led to greater consistency in nursing practices with respect to aspiration of gastric content and rate of increment in enteral feeding.

The study confirms that a nutritional support algorithm improved the delivery of nutrients to critically ill patients. The algorithm was most effective with respect to the delivery of enteral nutrition. The effect was primarily because of early and more rapid increment in the delivery of enteral nutrition administered by nurses based on improved physician orders. The combination of enteral and parenteral nutrition may contribute to meeting adequate nutritional requirements.

By using a nutritional algorithm focused on enteral nutrition, but including parenteral nutrition as a supplement, it is possible to improve the delivery of clinical nutrition in the intensive care unit patients.",algorithms,0.2,7,5424.863,3739.053,3703.516,10396.89,8634.44,8660.365,2452.246
"Stimuli-responsive hydrogels have attracted considerable interest in the field of microfluidics due to their ability to transform electrical energy directly into mechanical work through swelling, bending, and other deformations. In particular, electroactive hydrogels hold great promise for biomedical micropumping applications such as implantable drug delivery systems. In such applications, energy consumption rate and durability are key properties. Here, we developed a valveless micropump system that utilizes a hydrogel as the main actuator, and tested its performance over 6 months of continuous operation. The proposed micropump system, powered by a single 1.5 V commercial battery, expended very little energy (less than 750 Î¼Ws per stroke) while pumping 0.9 wt% saline solution under a low voltage (less than 1 V), and remained fully functional after 6 months. CFD simulations were conducted to improve the microchannel geometry so as to minimize the backflow caused by the valveless mechanism of the system. Based on the simulation results, an asymmetric geometry and a stop post were introduced to enhance the pumping performance. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system as a drug delivery pump, an anti-cancer drug (adriamycin) was perfused to human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) using the pump. The present study showed that the proposed system can operate continuously for long periods with low energy consumption, powered by a single 1.5 V battery, making it a promising candidate for an implantable drug delivery system.",cell_line_tumor,0.2,5,7205.185,4904.887,4835.203,15099.08,14986.14,15245.89,3852.392
"Obese patients have many physical limitations and much psychiatric burden to overcome. Several studies have shown that the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in the obese is similar to those with normal weight. However, in obese patients seeking treatment there is an increased prevalence (40-60%) of psychiatric morbidity, most commonly depression. It is difficult to separate the effects of depression on obesity and, on the contrary, the neuroendocrine changes associated with stress and depression may cause metabolic changes that predispose and perpetuate obesity. The stigma associated with obesity causes bullying in school as well as childhood psychiatric morbidity. Prejudice is not limited to the general public but exists among health professionals too. This chapter discusses the treatment of depression in obesity and the psychiatric evaluation of the pre-bariatric surgery patient. Education of society, starting with schools and including healthcare professionals will reduce bias and stigma as well as assist this vulnerable group of patients to seek help for their obesity and the many problems that come with it. Given that by the year 2025 obesity will be the world's number one health problem with the US leading the way, it is very important that we pursue preventive measures as well as encourage research for treatments of obesity.",obesity,0.2,7,3434.692,2199.847,2168.696,6218.599,5363.602,5236.165,2411.59
"A method is described for the rapid comparison of protein binding sites using geometric matching to detect similar three-dimensional structure. The geometric matching detects common atomic features through identification of the maximum common sub-graph or clique. These features are not necessarily evident from sequence or from global structural similarity giving additional insight into molecular recognition not evident from current sequence or structural classification schemes. Here we use the method to produce an all-against-all comparison of phosphate binding sites in a number of different nucleotide phosphate-binding proteins. The similarity search is combined with clustering of similar sites to allow a preliminary structural classification. Clustering by site similarity produces a classification of binding sites for the 476 representative local environments producing ten main clusters representing half of the representative environments. The similarities make sense in terms of both structural and functional classification schemes. The ten main clusters represent a very limited number of unique structural binding motifs for phosphate. These are the structural P-loop, di-nucleotide binding motif [FAD/NAD(P)-binding and Rossman-like fold] and FAD-binding motif.

"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl groups from the tails of lysine residues of histone protein in nuclear chromatin and also from acetylated sites in non-histone proteins. HDACs and histone acetyltransferases (HATs) are major influences on the level of cellular protein acetylation, and an imbalance in acetylation levels, particularly under-acetylated (hypoacetylated) histone protein has been associated with precancerous or malignant states. Consequently, small molecule inhibitors of HDACs have been synthesised and some now form a newly emerging class of anti-cancer agents that can regulate transcription and inhibit proliferation of cancer cells by inducing cell cycle arrest, differentiation and/or apoptosis, among other major biological phenomena. The different mechanism(s) of action of HDAC inhibitors compared to conventional anti-neoplastic agents provides a possibility that HDAC inhibitors may be effective for refractory cancers. Accordingly, a number of programs for the development of HDAC inhibitors as anti-cancer drugs have been initiated. This review highlights recent developments in the design, synthesis and biological properties of HDAC inhibitors in the context of potential cancer therapy.",neoplasms,0.4,10,8455.694,6700.919,6640.264,13352.08,11576.15,11844.86,3921.917
"A human receptor for the cytotoxic ligand TRAIL (TRAIL receptor-1, designated DR4) was identified recently as a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family. In this report we describe the identification of two additional human TRAIL receptors, TRAIL receptor-2 and TRAIL receptor-3, that belong to the tumor necrosis factor receptor family. Interestingly, TRAIL receptor-2 but not TRAIL receptor-3 contains a cytoplasmic ""death domain"" necessary for induction of apoptosis and is hence designated death receptor-5 (DR5). Like DR4, DR5 engages the apoptotic pathway independent of the adaptor molecule FADD/MORT1. Because of its lack of a death domain, TRAIL receptor-3 is not capable of inducing apoptosis. However, by competing for TRAIL, it is capable of inhibiting TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Thus, TRAIL receptor-3 may function as an antagonistic decoy receptor to attenuate the cytotoxic effect of TRAIL in most tissues that are TRAIL+, DR4+, and DR5+.",molecular_sequence_data,0.4,9,11667.64,9568.18,9470.571,15801.51,15249.1,15576.05,6214.098
"Pituitary metastases are found in about 1% of all pituitary resections. They often derive from breast, lung, and gastroenteric tract adenocarcinomas, very rarely from thyroid carcinoma. Presenting symptoms of thyroid carcinoma metastatic to the pituitary gland are usually chiasmatic with central neurological impairment due to space-occupying expansion in the parasellar region. Hypopituitarism is more often associated with papillary and medullary rather than follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). Here we describe a patient with pituitary metastasis from FTC who had hypopituitarism with thyrotropin (TSH) deficiency.

A 61-year-old woman, who presented with visual deficits and pain to the right orbit, was found on magnetic resonance imaging to have a large mass involving the pituitary gland. She was found to have pituitary insufficiency based on corticotropin-releasing hormone and TSH-releasing hormone testing. Transnasopharyngeal biopsy of the mass revealed metastases from FTC. After total thyroidectomy, which confirmed widely invasive FTC, the patient underwent external beam radiation therapy of the metastases for progressive neurological symptoms and an increase in orbit pain. Since endogenous TSH production was insufficient, we used recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) as preparation for a series of radioiodine treatments. rhTSH administration, followed by 7.4 GBq of (131)I, was repeated seven times over a 10-year period. This was associated with a marked decrease in serum thyroglobulin levels accompanied by substantial clinical improvement, but after 7 years disease progression occurred.

Seven patients with pituitary metastases from FTC have been reported. In all cases, some neurological signs and symptoms related to mass effect were reported, but no pituitary insufficiency was described. This may be the first case of FTC with metastases to the pituitary causing hypopituitarism. It seems likely that management of such cases could be limited to biopsy to confirm thyroid carcinoma, rather than more extensive surgery, and that this could be followed by multiple treatments with rhTSH followed by (131)I.",magnetic_resonance_imaging,0,10,7650.775,5295.625,5297.709,12866.16,11777.73,11927.43,4138.112

This excitable behavior can account for the spontaneous migration of cells. A number of reports have suggested that the chemoattractant-mediated signaling can bias excitability, thus providing a means by which cell motility can be directed.

"CAPS (Ca(2+)-dependent activator protein for secretion) functions in priming Ca(2+)-dependent vesicle exocytosis, but the regulation of CAPS activity has not been characterized. Here we show that phosphorylation by protein kinase CK2 is required for CAPS activity. Dephosphorylation eliminated CAPS activity in reconstituting Ca(2+)-dependent vesicle exocytosis in permeable and intact PC12 cells. Ser-5, -6, and -7 and Ser-1281 were identified by mass spectrometry as the major phosphorylation sites in the 1289 residue protein. Ser-5, -6, and -7 but not Ser-1281 to Ala substitutions abolished CAPS activity. Protein kinase CK2 phosphorylated CAPS in vitro at these sites and restored the activity of dephosphorylated CAPS. CK2 is the likely in vivo CAPS protein kinase based on inhibition of phosphorylation by tetrabromo-2-benzotriazole in PC12 cells and by the identity of in vivo and in vitro phosphorylation sites. CAPS phosphorylation by CK2 was constitutive, but the elevation of Ca(2+) in synaptosomes increased CAPS Ser-5 and -6 dephosphorylation, which terminates CAPS activity.

"Reliable screening of mechanical prosthetic mitral valve (PMV) dysfunction by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is mandatory because transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) cannot be routinely used. However, acoustic shadowing seriously hampers detection of PMV dysfunction with TTE, particularly regurgitation. To identify TTE indexes that can detect PMV dysfunction (regurgitation or obstruction), 134 patients (age 60 +/- 12 years, 64 men) with PMV who underwent TTE and TEE within 3 +/- 5 days were assessed. There were 73 normal and 61 dysfunctional valves (40 regurgitant, 21 obstructive). By multivariate analysis, peak E velocity was the best predictor of a dysfunctional valve. Both peak E velocity (E > or =1.9 m/s; sensitivity 92%, specificity 78%) and the ratio of velocity-time integrals of flow through the prosthesis to that of the left ventricular outflow (VTI(pmv/)VTI(lvo) > or =2.2; sensitivity 91%, specificity 74%) were successful in detecting PMV dysfunction. Although pressure half-time (PHT) readily identified PMV obstruction, it did not detect regurgitation. Logistic models including peak E velocity and VTI(pmv)/VTI(lvo) or PHT were equally successful in detecting PMV dysfunction. However, all 3 variables were needed to best distinguish among normal, obstructed, and regurgitant valves. A peak E velocity > or =1.9 m/s and VTI(pmv)/VTI(lvo) ratio > or =2.2 predicted valve regurgitation in 83% of valves when PHT was < 130 ms, and valve stenosis in 95% when PHT was >130 ms. Importantly, a peak E velocity < 1.9 m/s, VTI(pmv)/VTI(lvo) ratio < 2.2, and a PHT < 130 ms had a predictive accuracy for a normal valve of 98%. Thus, TTE Doppler indexes can be used as screening parameters of PMV dysfunction and help select patients for further diagnostic evaluation with TEE.",algorithms,0.6,6,18631.21,20240.11,19983.57,31097.13,34784.89,35327.95,9332.97
"Crosslinking HLA-DR molecules by monoclonal antibodies (moAbs) induces protein tyrosine phosphorylation and results in a secondary elevation of free cytoplasmic calcium concentrations in activated human T cells. Binding of bacterial superantigens or moAbs to DR molecules on activated T cells was recently reported to induce homotypic aggregation through activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and mediated by CD11a/CD54 (LFA-1/CAM-1) adhesion molecules. Here, we report that moAbs directed against framework DR, but neither DR1, 2- and DRw52- nor DQ- and DP-specific moABs induced homotypic aggregation of antigen- and alloantigen-activated T cells, antigen-specific CD4+ T-cell lines, a CD8+ T-cytotoxic cell line, and T-leukemia cells (HUT78). Protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitor herbimycin A partly blocked class-II-induced aggregation responses. In contrast, phorbol ester (PMA)-induced aggregation was essentially unaffected. A potent inhibitor of PKC, staurosporin, inhibited both moAb- and PMA-induced aggregation responses. The aggregation responses were completely inhibited by low temperatures, cytochalasins B and E, and partly inhibited by EDTA and CD18 moAbs, but unaffected by aphidicolin, mitomycin C, an adenylate cyclase inhibitor (2'5'-dideoxyadenosine), and moAbs against other adhesion molecules (CD2/CD58 [LFA-3], CD28/CD28 ligand B7, CD4, and CD44).

"Obesity is a risk factor for development of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers. Substantial proportions of obese people die from diseases caused by complications of overweight.

Body Mass Index (BMI) is also influenced by genetic factors, estimates of the degree of inheritance of obesity, according to the type of study range from 30 to 70%. Newly detected genetic risk factor for body weight is the FTO gene (""fat mass and obesity associated""). Variants in the first (and in some populations also in the third) intron of this gene are associated with BMI values and the presence of one risk allele is associated with an increase of body weight by about 1.5-2 kg. Studies on the possible causality (impact on energy intake, basal metabolism, physical activity) did not show consistent results. Variants in the first intron are also associated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, and cardiovascular disease and seem to play a role in the determination of certain types of cancer and are associated with higher mortality.

"Deguelin, a naturally occurring rotenoid, is known to be an Akt inhibitor and to have an anti-tumor effect on several cancers.

This study was performed to elucidate the effect of deguelin on apoptotic pathways related to NF-ÎºB signaling in colon cancer cells and on the anti-tumor effect in colon cancer xenograft mice.

We studied COLO 205 and HCT116 cells in the presence or absence of deguelin. NF-ÎºB signaling was examined by real-time RT-PCR for interleukin (IL)-8, by Western blotting for IÎºB phosphorylation/degradation, and by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Cell death was determined by the MTT assay, and apoptosis by Annexin V-FITC staining and caspase-3 activity. We also assessed the expression of antiapoptotic and proapoptotic factors by use of RT-PCR. In colon cancer xenograft mice, we evaluated the effect of deguelin on inoculated tumor growth, and apoptotic index was measured by the in vivo TUNEL assay.

Deguelin significantly inhibited IL-8 gene expression, IÎºB phosphorylation/degradation, and DNA binding activity of NF-ÎºB in colon cancer cells. Deguelin induced cell death and apoptosis in colon cancer cells in a dose and time-dependent manner. Deguelin down-regulated expression of NF-ÎºB-mediated antiapoptotic factors such as cFLIP, Bcl-2, and Bcl-X(L).

"We investigated the difference between brain activities in speeded and precisely timed responses to identical visual stimulus using fMRI. Stimulus used was a row of seven light-emitting diodes (LEDs) lightened up one after another with constant speed within a trial but with various speeds between trials. Subjects were asked to execute finger-thumb tapping with the right hand in response to the onset of the first LED light in the reaction time (RT) task and in anticipation of the onset of the last (i.e., seventh) LED light in the timing task. In control condition, they were asked to passively view the stimulus without motor response. Results showed that various movement-related areas including contralateral cingulate motor cortex were commonly activated for both tasks relative to the control condition, suggesting these structures are involved in general perception and response execution rather than specific function for speeded or precisely timed responses. In the RT task, the presupplementary motor area extending to the cingulate sulcus was activated more strongly than in the timing task probably to focus attention to the onset of the first LED light unpredictably presented after random foreperiods. The lateral occipital area extending to the temporo-parieto-occipital junction was activated more strongly in the timing task than in the RT task; the same area was deactivated in the RT task relative to the control condition.

"We have analyzed the molecular mechanism of regulation of the ferric dicitrate transport system in Escherichia coli (Ec), by studying the transcription of the regulatory and structural genes under various environmental conditions, and by determining the location of their transcriptional start points and promoter regions. We report here that the main species observed in Northern hybridization analyses were a 2.5-kb mRNA, encoded by the outer membrane protein receptor gene fecA, and a 1.5-kb mRNA encoded by a region including the fecIR genes. The synthesis of the 2.5-kb fecA mRNA is regulated by both citrate and iron. Furthermore, transcription of fecA is dependent on the presence of FecI. The promoter region for the fecA mRNA, a likely site of action for FecI, is not related to the consensus promoter region for sigma 70 RNA polymerase in Ec K-12. However, it shows greatest similarity with promoters of genes regulated by a new sub-family of sigma factors, i.e., the extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors, which are associated with the expression of genes involved in extracytoplasmic functions, suggesting that FecI may act as a specialized sigma factor. We also show that the fecB,C,D,E transport genes are linked in operon fashion to fecA. Since the levels of the fecB,C,D,E RNAs are extremely low, as compared to the level of fecA mRNA, it is likely that processing from the 3' end must occur and stop near the end of fecA where a hairpin structure is located.",molecular_sequence_data,0,8,5351.473,4347.05,4374.749,9037.608,8019.897,8227.175,2450.427

"MiR-34a, a direct target of p53, has been shown to target several molecules associated with the cell cycle and cell survival pathways, and its dysregulation is implicated in cancer drug resistance or sensitivity in several human cancers. However, the correlation between miR-34a expression and chemoresistance has not been explored in HCC. In this study, we confirmed that miR-34a was significantly down-regulated in HCC tissues and HCC cell lines by qRT-PCR. HCC tissues with lower miR-34a expression displayed higher expression of Bcl-2 protein than those with high expression of miR-34a; therefore, an inverse correlation is evident between the miR-34a level and Bcl-2 expression. Moreover, patients with lower miR-34a expression had significantly poorer overall survival. Bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays revealed that miR-34a binds the 3'-UTR of the Bcl-2 mRNA and represses its translation. Western blotting analysis and qRT-PCR confirmed that Bcl-2 is inhibited by miR-34a overexpression. Functional analyses indicated that the restoration of miR-34a reduced cell viability, promoted cell apoptosis and potentiated sorafenib-induced apoptosis and toxicity in HCC cell lines by inhibiting Bcl-2 expression.

"It is generally accepted that, during evolution, replicating RNA molecules emerged from pools of random polynucleotides. This prebiotic RNA world was followed by an era of RNA-mediated catalysis of amide-bond formation. RNA would thus have provided the machinery responsible for the assembly of peptides and the beginning of the protein world of today. Naturally occurring ribozymes, which catalyze the cleavage or ligation of oligonucleotide phosphodiester bonds, support the idea that RNA could self-replicate. But was RNA constrained to this path and were RNA-acylated carriers required before RNA could catalyze the formation of amide bonds?

We have isolated RNA catalysts that are capable of mediating amide-bond synthesis without the need for specifically designed templates to align the substrates, and we have kinetically characterized these catalysts. The rate enhancement observed for these RNA amide synthases exceeds the noncatalyzed amidation rate by a factor of approximately 10(4). In addition, Cu2+ ions caused a change in the affinity of RNA for the substrate rather than being directly involved in amide-bond formation.

The discovery of these new amide synthases shows how functionally modified nucleic acids can facilitate covalent-bond formation without templating. Previously unforeseen RNA-evolution pathways can, therefore, be considered; for example, to guide amide-bond formation, en route to the protein world, it appears that substrate-binding pockets were formed that are analogous to those of protein enzymes.",molecular_sequence_data,0.8,5,8398.082,6211.68,6135.638,12873.07,12055.03,11887.27,4327.929

"The nucleoli and chromatin clumps of ovarian cells contain important features in discriminating malignant cells from normal ones. In geometric properties, the ovarian nucleoli and chromatin clumps appear as irregularly shaped dark spots in the nuclear images from specimens immunohistochemically stained with antibody to Mib-1. Malignant cells often have more active and larger nucleoli and chromatin clumps. However, estimating the size of the nucleoli or chromatin clumps is a difficult task since it is not easy to recognize and accurately separate the regions of nucleoli and chromatin clumps from the rest of the nuclei that are highly irregular and variant in contents and intensities. In this paper, we develop a method to derive a parameter called power ratio that is proportionally related to the size of nucleoli and chromatin clumps based on an ideal nuclear model without the region segmentation of nucleoli or chromatin clumps.

"Adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (A-FABP) plays a key role in obesity-related insulin resistance and inflammation which may be involved in the pathogenesis of sarcopenic obesity (SO). This study examined the association of SO with serum A-FABP levels in Korean adults.

Two hundred ninety eight adults aged 20-70 years were examined using dual X-ray absorptiometry and computed tomography and measuring serum A-FABP levels. Sarcopenia was defined as the appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) divided by weight (%) of &< SD below the mean values of young adults in both sexes. Obesity was defined as visceral fat area (VFA) â¥ 100 cm(2).

Serum A-FABP levels were higher in groups with SO compared to non-SO groups in both men and women. In the unadjusted model, serum A-FABP levels were positively associated with VFA and negatively associated with ASM/weight. Even after adjusting for possible confounding factors, ASM/weight was found to be independently and negatively associated with serum A-FABP levels. In addition, multiple logistic regression analysis showed that increased serum levels of A-FABP were independently associated with the presence of SO.

"Although a great deal has been learned about the medical aspects of intraoperative blood salvage, several fundamental medical issues remain controversial. As pressure increases to maximize the use of IBS, more research will be needed on the application of salvage techniques in cancer surgery and in the presence of bacterial contamination. The reintroduction of the use of devices that do not wash salvaged blood have reopened investigations into the effects of reinfusion of partially hemolyzed and partially clotted salvaged blood on coagulation, renal function, and cardiopulmonary performance. More studies are also needed so that empirically based standards of practice for the collection and storage of salvaged blood can be established.

"Phytocannabinoids from the plant Cannabis sativa induce a variety of physiological and pharmacological responses in living systems, including anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, anti-ulcer and antitumor activities. The discovery of the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 led to the development of agonists and antagonists of these receptors for the treatment of a variety of diseases. Nabilone, a synthetic derivative of Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta9-THC), which is the main natural psychotropic constituent of C sativa, was approved by the US FDA for the treatment of nausea and as an anti-emetic for patients undergoing chemotherapy. Delta9-THC and related cannabinoids are involved in a variety of signal transduction pathways; thus, reducing or removing the psychotropic effects of these compounds would enhance their therapeutic spectra. Compound synthesis and qualitative SAR studies are time-consuming activities; however, microbes are effectively the most inventive synthetic chemists because of their metabolic plasticity. This review discusses the potential of C sativa mycoflora, which is pathogenic as well as endophytic, to remove the psychotropic effects of Delta9-THC and related cannabinoids, and describes the development of a model system for the rapid and cost-effective commercial production of cannabinoids through fermentation pathways.",signal_transduction,0,8,5466.895,3978.902,3909.311,9364.376,7111.404,7248.784,2908.722
"The effect of echoplanar imaging (EPI) acoustic background noise on blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activations was investigated. Two EPI pulse sequences were compared: (i) conventional EPI with a pulsating sound component of typically 8-10 Hz, which is a potent physiological stimulus, and (ii) the more recently developed continuous-sound EPI, which is perceived as less distractive despite equivalent peak sound pressure levels. Sixteen healthy subjects performed an established demanding visual n-back working memory task. Using an exploratory data analysis technique (tensorial probabilistic independent component analysis; tensor-PICA), we studied the inter-session/within-subject response variability introduced by continuous-sound versus conventional EPI acoustic background noise in addition to temporal and spatial signal characteristics. The analysis revealed a task-related component associated with the established higher-level working memory and motor feedback response network, which exhibited a significant 19% increase in its average effect size for the continuous-sound as opposed to conventional EPI. Stimulus-related lower-level activations, such as primary visual areas, were not modified. EPI acoustic background noise influences much more than the auditory system per se. This analysis provides additional evidence for an enhancement of task-related, extra-auditory BOLD activations by continuous-sound EPI due to less distractive acoustic background gradient noise.",magnetic_resonance_imaging,0,8,14097.92,11416.11,11774.05,24222.48,23179.49,23630.57,5154.64

The NBS-leucine-rich repeat homologues appeared to include members of the two major groups that have been described in dicot plants: one possessing a toll-interleukin receptor element and one lacking such a domain. Genetic mapping of the cloned sequences was achieved through the development of CAPS and SSCP markers using a segregating population of a cross between the two apple cultivars Fiesta and Discovery.

"Tomosynthesis is a 3-dimensional mammography technique that generates thin slices separated one to the other by typically 1 mm from source data sets. The relatively high image noise in these thin slices raises the value of 1-cm thick slices computed from the set of reconstructed slices for image interpretation. In an initial evaluation, we investigated the potential of different algorithms for generating thick slices from tomosynthesis source data (maximum intensity projection-MIP; average algorithm-AV, and image generation by means of a new algorithm, so-called softMip). The three postprocessing techniques were evaluated using a homogeneous phantom with one textured slab with a total thickness of about 5 cm in which two 0.5-cm-thick slabs contained objects to simulate microcalcifications, spiculated masses, and round masses. The phantom was examined by tomosynthesis (GE Healthcare). Microcalcifications were simulated by inclusion of calcium particles of four different sizes. The slabs containing the inclusions were examined in two different configurations: adjacent to each other and close to the detector and with the two slabs separated by two 1-cm thick breast equivalent material slabs. The reconstructed tomosynthesis slices were postprocessed using MIP, AV, and softMip to generate 1-cm thick slices with a lower noise level. The three postprocessing algorithms were assessed by calculating the resulting contrast versus background for the simulated microcalcifications and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) for the other objects. The CNRs of the simulated round and spiculated masses were most favorable for the thick slices generated with the average algorithm, followed by softMip and MIP. Contrast of the simulated microcalcifications was best for MIP, followed by softMip and average projections. Our results suggest that the additional generation of thick slices may improve the visualization of objects in tomosynthesis. This improvement differs from the different algorithms for microcalcifications, speculated objects, and round masses.

"The proteolytic activity of Furin responsible for processing full length Notch-1 (p300) plays a critical role in Notch signaling. The amplitude and duration of Notch activity can be regulated at various points in the pathway, but there has been no report regarding regulation of the Notch-1-Furin interaction, despite its importance. In the present study, we found that the Notch-1-Furin interaction is regulated by the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, c-Src. c-Src and Notch-1 are physically associated, and this association is responsible for Notch-1 processing and activation. We also found that growth factor TGF-Î±, an EGFR ligand, and PDGF-BB, a PDGFR ligand, induce the Notch-1-Furin interaction mediated by c-Src. Our results support three new and provocative conclusions: (1) The association between Notch-1 and Furin is a well-regulated process; (2) Extracellular growth factor signals regulate this interaction, which is mediated by c-Src; (3) There is cross-talk between the plasma growth factor receptor-c-Src and Notch pathways.

"Adult neural stem cells (NSCs) are known to exist in a few regions of the brain; however, the entity and physiological/disease relevance of adult hypothalamic NSCs (htNSCs) remain unclear. This work shows that adult htNSCs are multipotent and predominantly present in the mediobasal hypothalamus of adult mice. Chronic high-fat-diet feeding led to not only depletion but also neurogenic impairment of htNSCs associated with IKKÎ²/NF-ÎºB activation. In vitro htNSC models demonstrated that their survival and neurogenesis markedly decreased on IKKÎ²/NF-ÎºB activation but increased on IKKÎ²/NF-ÎºB inhibition, mechanistically mediated by IKKÎ²/NF-ÎºB-controlled apoptosis and Notch signalling. Mouse studies revealed that htNSC-specific IKKÎ²/NF-ÎºB activation led to depletion and impaired neuronal differentiation of htNSCs, and ultimately the development of obesity and pre-diabetes.

"Because of unparalleled sensitivity and tolerance to protein size, mass spectrometry (MS) has become a popular method for measuring the solution hydrogen (1H/2H) exchange (HX) of biologically relevant protein states. While incorporated deuterium can be localized to different regions by pepsin proteolysis of the labeled protein, the assignment of deuteriums to individual residues is typically not obtained, thereby limiting a detailed understanding of HX and the dynamics of protein structure. Here we use gas-phase fragmentation of peptic peptides by electron transfer dissociation (ETD) to measure the HX of individual amide linkages in the amyloidogenic protein beta2-microglobulin. A comparison of the deuterium levels of 60 individual backbone amides of beta2-microglobulin measured by HX-ETD-MS analysis to the corresponding values measured by NMR spectroscopy shows an excellent correlation. The deuterium labeling pattern of beta2-microglobulin is retained in the gaseous fragment ions by employing mild declustering conditions for electrospray ionization. A recently developed model peptide is used to arrive at such ion source declustering conditions that prevent the occurrence of intramolecular gas-phase hydrogen (1H/2H) migration (i.e., hydrogen scrambling).

"Identifying neighborhood environment attributes related to childhood obesity can inform environmental changes for obesity prevention.

To evaluate child and parent weight status across neighborhoods in King County (Seattle metropolitan area) and San Diego County differing in GIS-defined physical activity environment (PAE) and nutrition environment (NE) characteristics.

Neighborhoods were selected to represent high (favorable) versus low (unfavorable) on the two measures, forming four neighborhood types (low on both measures, low PAE/high NE, high PAE/low NE, and high on both measures). Weight and height of children aged 6-11 years and one parent (n=730) from selected neighborhoods were assessed in 2007-2009.

"To find an accurate algorithm for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in nontraumatic chest pain patients on presentation to the emergency department.

In a prospective clinical study, we compared the diagnostic performances of clinical symptoms, presenting ECG, creatinine kinase, creatine kinase MB activity and mass concentration, myoglobin, and cardiac troponin T test results of hospital admission blood samples.

The time constant of resensitization was 75 ms for the GluR2 flop RN and 30 ms for the GN channels. The dose-dependence of the peak current amplitude, kinetics of activation and deactivation, and peak open probability did not differ between RN and GN channels.

"Of the thirteen active carbonic anhydrase (CA) isozymes, the transmembrane isoform CA IX has been shown to be linked with carcinogenesis. CA IX presents an ectopic expression in a multitude of carcinomas derived from cervix, uteri, kidney, lung, oesophagus, breast, colon, etc., contrasting with its restricted expression in normal tissues, namely in the epithelia of the gastrointestinal tract. It has been demonstrated that this membrane-bound CA is strongly overexpressed in hypoxic tumors, participating in tumor cell environment acidosis and contributing to malignant progression and poor treatment outcome. Targeting CA IX could thus be an important means of controlling cancer disease. Modulation of extracellular tumor pH via inhibition of CA IX activity represents a promising approach to novel anticancer therapies. Much attention has recently been paid to the CA IX inhibitors drug design, and efforts have been made to obtain isozyme IX inhibitors, with putative applications as antitumor drugs/diagnostic agents.

The aim of our study was to assess the nutritional status and to analyze the prevalence of normal weight obesity and abdominal obesity in students from the University of Novi Sad.

The body mass index, waist circumference and body fat mass were assessed in the group of 371 students from the University of Novi Sad (their average age being 22.9 +/- 2.5 y).

One-fifth of the study sample students were found to be overweight and obese, i.e. 21% and 1.1%, respectively. The frequency of overweight and obesity was higher in male respondents (overweight: 41.67% vs. 6.05%; obesity: 1.92% vs. 0.46%). Among the survey respondents, there were 4.6% of underweight students, all of whom were female students. Body fat was found to be increased in 11% of the students, the frequency being higher in the males. The phenomenon of obesity in normal body mass was recorded in 7% of the respondents, being more frequent in female students. The total of 5.6% of female students and 5.8% of male students had abdominal obesity.

The survey results indicate the necessity and obligation to direct attention to regular and complete diagnostics of obesity in order to determine the size of fat body mass and its distribution. The presence of obesity in normal body mass among young, student population requires the comprehensive, detailed and timely diagnosis and treatment of this disease.",obesity,0.4,4,4231.229,2705.835,2688.134,7537.123,7314.988,7487.261,2487.56
"Our objectives were to (1) describe the clinical characteristics of and viruses isolated from patients who presented with neurologic symptoms associated with influenza A infection and were hospitalized at Texas Children's Hospital during October and November 2003 and (2) to raise awareness of the neurologic complications of influenza among US children.

We reviewed the medical and laboratory records of all children who were hospitalized with neurologic symptoms and who also had evidence of influenza virus infection by rapid antigen testing or viral isolation.

Eight children aged 5 months to 9 years with neurologic complications associated with influenza A were identified. None of the children had received the influenza vaccine. Four presented with seizures, 3 with mental status changes, and 1 with mutism. All but 1 of the patients had influenza A viral antigen detected in nasal wash samples. Influenza A virus was isolated in culture from nasal wash specimens obtained from 6 of the patients; influenza A virus was also isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of 1 of these patients. None of the patients had serum metabolic abnormalities or other cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities. Three of the patients had brain imaging abnormalities. Five of the patients were treated with antivirals. All 8 of the patients survived, 6 with complete recovery and 2 with sequelae (1 mild and 1 severe).

Neurologic symptoms and sequelae were associated with influenza A virus infection in children during the 2003-2004 influenza season in Houston, Texas. Influenza should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with seizures and mental status changes, especially if they present with respiratory symptoms or during an influenza outbreak.",magnetic_resonance_imaging,0,5,4989.121,4174.568,4068.958,11836.8,12436.83,12782.21,2451.602
"Heterotrimeric G protein signaling is involved in many pathways essential to development including those controlling cell migration, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. One key developmental event known to rely on proper heterotrimeric G protein signaling is primordial germ cell (PGC) migration. We previously developed an in vivo PGC migration assay that identified differences in the signaling capacity of G protein gamma subunits. In this study we developed GÎ³ subunit chimeras to determine the regions of GÎ³ isoforms that are responsible for these differences. The central section of the GÎ³ subunit was found to be necessary for the ability of a GÎ³ subunit to mediate signaling involved in PGC migration. Residues found in the carboxy-terminal segment of GÎ³ transducin (gngt1) were found to be responsible for the ability of this subunit to disrupt PGC migration. The type of prenylation did not affect the ability of a GÎ³ subunit to reverse prenylation-deficient-GÎ³-induced PGC migration defects. However, a version of gng2, engineered to be farnesylated instead of geranylgeranylated, still lacks the ability to reverse PGC migration defects known to result from treatment of zebrafish with geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitors (GGTI), supporting the notion that GÎ³ subunits are one of several protein targets that need to be geranylgeranylated to orchestrate the proper long-range migration of PGCs.",signal_transduction,0.2,8,6352.837,4059.466,4092.038,10717.68,8848.643,8975.836,3320.857
"p50 is phosphorylated in mitogen-stimulated T cells, and translocated from the membrane to the cytosol after activation of protein kinase C. Sequence analysis of p50 revealed that it is identical with LSP1, a putative calcium-binding and actin-binding protein. lymphocyte form of p50 exhibits heterogeneity in the apparent molecular mass on SDS-PAGE, 50 and 52 kDa (pp50 and pp52), and each isoform exhibits heterogeneity in the isoelectric point, when examined by two-dimensional PAGE. When the two molecular mass variants of p50 were dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase, both isoforms showed the same apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa on SDS-PAGE, but could be distinguished by their distinct isoelectric points. Dephosphorylated pp50 (p50a) has an acidic pI compared with dephosphorylated pp52 (p50b). Comparison of the peptide maps of purified p50a and p50b on HPLC revealed that the difference was limited to one peptide peak. NH2-terminal sequence and mass spectrometric analyses of these peptides showed that the peptides derived from p50a and p50b had the same NH2-terminal amino acid sequence up to eight residues, but had distinct molecular masses, 5,533.4 and 6,318.6 Da, respectively. These data suggested that pp52 (p50b) is the product of the previously cloned cDNA and the reduction in the molecular mass of the p50a-derived peptide could be explained by deletion of six amino acid residues, EHLIRH or HLIRHQ.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",molecular_sequence_data,0,8,8955.079,7835.343,8025.174,12522.01,12969.92,13335.94,4119.013
"Assessing the pharmacodynamics (PD) of a potential therapeutic through the use of a downstream biomarker is essential. This is traditionally performed in the target tissue but limited volume and invasiveness of sampling pose challenges with solid tumours. Currently, there are several small molecule receptor kinase inhibitors and large molecule therapeutic antibodies in clinical trials that interfere with TGFbeta signalling to treat various forms of cancer. With the advent of these new therapies, there is a need for a surrogate tissue that is easily accessible and indicative of tumour response. We propose the use of an ex vivo TGFbeta1 stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) coupled with the measurement of phosphorylated SMAD2 (Sma/Mothers Against dpp, a downstream transcriptional activator) using a sandwich ELISA. TGFbeta is involved in many different cellular responses, such as proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, invasion and immunomodulation. SMAD2 and SMAD3 are phosphorylated as a result of the canonical cascade through ligand binding and receptor kinase activation. These phosphorylated SMADs (pSMAD) associate with SMAD4, a co-SMAD, and transcriptionally activate TGFbeta-mediated genes. This paper describes the novel method for measuring the downstream effects of inhibiting canonical TGFbeta signalling using ex vivo stimulation of surrogate tissue to predict tumour response. In addition, we present the assay validation rationale and data. This novel, validated assay can be used to gain insight into clinical trials regarding TGFbeta signal modulation by multiple inhibitor platforms for both large and small molecules.",cell_line_tumor,0.2,7,9999.382,6663.268,6267.975,15481.31,13121.63,12541.65,3651.056
"The unique energy demands of neurons require well-orchestrated distribution and maintenance of mitochondria. Thus, dynamic properties of mitochondria, including fission, fusion, trafficking, biogenesis, and degradation, are critical to all cells, but may be particularly important in neurons. Dysfunction in mitochondrial dynamics has been linked to neuropathies and is increasingly being linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, but the evidence is particularly strong, and continuously accumulating, in Parkinson's disease (PD). The unique characteristics of neurons that degenerate in PD may predispose those neuronal populations to susceptibility to alterations in mitochondrial dynamics. In addition, evidence from PD-related toxins supports that mitochondrial fission, fusion, and transport may be involved in pathogenesis. Furthermore, rapidly increasing evidence suggests that two proteins linked to familial forms of the disease, parkin and PINK1, interact in a common pathway to regulate mitochondrial fission/fusion. Parkin may also play a role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis through targeting damaged mitochondria for mitophagy. Taken together, the current data suggests that mitochondrial dynamics may play a role in PD pathogenesis, and a better understanding of mitochondrial dynamics within the neuron may lead to future therapeutic treatments for PD, potentially aimed at some of the earliest pathogenic events.",signal_transduction,1,6,7574.807,5197.767,5039.88,12543.46,12383.54,11737.97,3923.497
"The aim of this study was to survey Canadian oncology practitioners' attitudes toward psychosocial concerns and issues in women with breast cancer. Surveys were mailed to 351 medical, radiation and surgical oncologists and 375 oncology nurses. Standard questionnaires assessed attitudes towards psychosocial issues in women with primary and metastatic breast cancer and evaluated the practitioners' willingness to refer women to psychosocial intervention trials in the presence and absence of competing drug trials. Responses were obtained from 74% of those surveyed. Respondents reported being aware of the common occurrence of psychosocial problems in women with metastatic breast cancer, however, physicians were less likely than nurses to offer these women psychosocial support on a prophylactic basis (p &<0.0001) and they expressed greater concern than nurses about scientific validity of (p = 0.0003), and potential psychological damage from (p = 0.005), psychosocial support groups. Nurses were more likely than physicians to favour a study investigating group psychosocial support over competing drug studies (p &<or = 0.003) in the metastatic setting. Physicians were less likely than nurses to deal with weight problems prophylactically in women with primary breast cancer (p = 0.0009) and they expressed greater concern over scientific validity of psychosocial interventions addressing weight than nurses (p = 0.0008); nurses were more concerned about excessive expectations of patients regarding potential benefits of such interventions (p &<0.0001). Regardless, nurses were more likely than physicians to favour a psychosocial intervention study focused on weight management over drug studies in pre- (p = 0.0006) and postmenopausal women (p = 0.05) with primary breast cancer.

"In single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the dopaminergic system, measurements of striatal uptake are useful for diagnosis and patient follow-up but are strongly biased by the partial volume effect (PVE). We studied whether PVE correction might improve patient classification based on binding potential (BP) measurements.

Patients with a probable diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, 10 patients) or Alzheimer's disease (AD, 13 patients) were studied by( 123)I-FP-CIT SPECT. SPECT images were reconstructed with and without PVE correction. Each patient SPECT scan was also simulated to obtain SPECT data whose characteristics were fully known. In addition, 17 SPECT scans were simulated with striatal uptake values mimicking pre-symptomatic cases of DLB.

Without PVE correction, mean putamen BP values were 2.9+/-0.4 and 0.9+/-0.2 for AD and DLB patients respectively, while with PVE correction, they were 8.6+/-1.5 and 1.9+/-0.5 respectively. All patients were properly identified as having AD or DLB when considering mean putamen BP measured on their real or simulated SPECT scan, with and without PVE correction. All 30 simulations mimicking pre-symptomatic DLB and AD patients were accurately classified with PVE correction, but without PVE correction 15 mean putamen BP values were in a range where AD and DLB could not be distinguished.

We conclude that putamen BP values measured without PVE correction can be used to differentiate probable DLB and AD due to the already severe reduction in dopamine transporter levels. PVE correction appeared useful for accurate differential diagnosis between AD and pre-symptomatic DLB.",magnetic_resonance_imaging,1,7,14415.06,14356.22,14499.25,23845.74,28378.59,28445.71,4794.426

"Age-adjustment of rates is a basic tool for epidemiologists. The methodologies can be classified into direct and indirect types. The direct methods facilitate a valid comparison between populations or across calendar periods. However, they suffer from the problem of instability. By contrast, the indirect methods achieve maximal precision but may sacrifice a valid inter-populational comparison (violating the 'consistency criteria'). In this paper, we propose a new weighting system to summarize the rates. The weighting system is optimal in the sense that it produces age-adjusted rates which are most stable and ensure a valid comparison between populations. The new weighting system calls for an iterative algorithm. However, the procedure simplifies considerably under some conditions. We use real and simulated data to demonstrate the new method.",algorithms,1,5,6032.883,5213.73,5399.735,11716.44,12696.58,12519.87,2441.752
"In a recent study, we presented preliminary evidence for biological activity in a Phase I dose-finding study (15-600 mg/m(2)) of recombinant human endostatin in patients with refractory solid tumors. Here, we conducted additional biomarker analyses to correlate changes in tumor biology with dose.

Excisional tumor biopsies were obtained at baseline and after 56 days of endostatin therapy. Laser scanning cytometry (LSC) was used to quantify biomarker levels in whole tissue sections. Apoptosis in tumor cells (TCs) and tumor-associated endothelial cells (ECs) was quantified by fluorescent three-color anti-CD31/terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling staining. Microvessel densities were measured by LSC-guided vessel contouring. Levels of tumor-associated EC BCL-2 and hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha were determined by immunofluorescence and LSC quantification. The results, including tumor blood flow measured by positron emission tomography, were analyzed using a quadratic polynomial model.

Significant increases in EC death and decreases in tumor microvessel density were observed, with maximal effects of endostatin at a dose of 249 mg/m(2) (95% confidence interval, 159-338) and 257 mg/m(2) (95% confidence interval, 183-331), respectively. In contrast, levels of TC death were uniformly low and did not correlate with endostatin dose. Maximal nuclear hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha and minimal EC Bcl-2 levels were observed at approximately 250 mg/m(2), although the changes did not reach statistical significance.

The data suggest that endostatin had optimal biological activity at doses approximately 250 mg/m(2) in our cohort of patients. Endostatin's failure to induce high levels of TC death may explain its lack of significant clinical activity in this Phase I trial.",neoplasms,1,8,14914.68,13467.81,13543.44,25485.34,27835.64,28320.19,6030.973
"The insertion/deletion DNA polymorphism of the gene coding human angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was examined in 109 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and 93 non-coronary subjects (NCS) living in a northern part of Japan. The presence of risk factors including age, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, tobacco use, diabetes mellitus and hyperuricemia were also examined. An insertion (I) / deletion (D) polymorphism of the ACE gene was determined by the polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotide primers encompassing the polymorphic region in intron 16. The template DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes of patients. The frequency of the D-allele in NCS was 0.27, significantly lower than that reported in Caucasians or in Japanese living in the Osaka area. The frequency of the D-allele in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) and angina pectoris was 0.39 and was higher than that in NCS. The frequencies of genotypes DD, ID, and II were 17.8, 43.3 and 38.9%, respectively, in CAD except in young patients (below 40 years of age) with MI and AP groups, and 6.5, 40.9 and 52.7%, respectively in NCS (p < 0.05 between CAD and NCS). Young MI showed similar frequencies in ACE gene polymorphisms to those in NCS, a pattern which differed from that seen in subjects with CAD (p < 0.05). The numbers of risk factors did not alter the frequency of ACE gene genotype among patients with CAD, however, in normotensives, the odds ratio of DD-genotype was significantly increased to 3.4. Accordingly, ACE gene polymorphism may be associated with morbidity from CAD in Japanese living in northern Japan as has been noted in Caucasians, despite the lower frequencies of the D-allele in the Japanese population.",molecular_sequence_data,0.6,6,7450.475,6337.563,6548.341,14041.33,14524.19,14869.48,3548.67
"This study specifies a strategy to improve radiotherapy by partial synchronization of p53-deficient cancer cells (FaDu and H1299) in mitosis using taxol, with protecting p53 wild-type cells (A549) by the prior administration of cytostatic compounds.

A protective effect of doxorubicin but not cisplatin was found after administration of triple sequence with ionizing radiation and taxol. It was found that preliminary administration of doxorubicin induced growth arrest and protected A549 cells from the taxol/radiation treatment, while simultaneously killing FaDu and H1299 cells.

"Body mass index (BMI) is the pragmatic measure to assess children's obesity clinically and BMI charts are widely used for counselling families about children's weight management over time.

To explore the variability in clinicians' interpretation of BMI patterns and to ascertain the diagnostic accuracy of their judgement by relating it to change in body composition by dual-emission x-ray absorptiometry (DXA).

Data from 70 children who participated in a trial of a weight management programme for obese children were analysed. BMI was plotted on UK 1990 charts at baseline, 6 months and 12 months, and four clinicians experienced in obesity management independently scored the charts on a five-point scale for how successful children were in tackling their obesity over a 6-month period. Scores were compared with change in BMI, fat mass and lean mass z-scores as measured by DXA.

54 children (aged 8-15 years; BMI z-score 2.93 (SD 0.48)) had simultaneous BMI and DXA scans performed, giving 104 pairs of measurements 6 months apart. There was good consistency between clinicians' scores for weight management and these related well to change in BMI and fat mass z-scores, but not lean mass z-score. They reported that measurement proximity to centile lines and crossing of lines influenced their confidence in making a decision and change in severe obesity was harder to judge as higher centile lines are so far apart.

Incubations were made with PMA and protease inhibitors directed against different target protease groups. The serineprotease inhibitors TPCK and dichloroisocoumarin and the metalloprotease inhibitor 1,10-phenanthroline reduced PMA-induced release of both soluble receptor forms with about 60-70%. Furthermore, 1,10-phenanthroline also reduced PMA-induced down-regulation of TNF-receptors in both cell lines as judged by TNF-binding to cells. Reduced down-regulation and TNF-receptor shedding by 1,10-phenanthroline was reversed by Zn2+, indicating involvement of a Zn(2+)-dependent metalloprotease.

The present study indicated that the zero-order absorption model provided better estimated pharmacokinetic parameters than the first-order absorption model. It was also found that prediction by the Bayesian method is dependent on number of sampling trials, but the best sampling time is still unknown.

"In societies such as Australia with a strong multicultural makeup, culturally determined attitudes to genetics, testing, and counseling may be incompatible with current genetics service provision.

Participants comprised a sample of 15 Chinese-Australians who had been recruited through several community-based organizations.

The level of acculturation does not correlate with holding beliefs about inheritance, kinship, and causes of hereditary cancer that are based on ""Western"" biomedical or traditional concepts. Mismatch between beliefs may exist within families that can impact participation in cancer genetic testing.

"Botulinum neurotoxin (NT) serotype E is synthesized by Clostridium botulinum as an approximately 150-kDa single-chain polypeptide of 1252 amino acid residues of which 8 are Cys residues [Puolet et al. (1992); Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 183, 107-113]. The posttranslational processing of the gene product removes only the initiating methionine. A very narrow segment of this 1251-residue-long mature protein--at one-third the distance from the N-terminus (between residues Lys 418 and Arg 421)--is highly sensitive to proteases, such as trypsin. The single-chain NT easily undergoes an exogenous posttranslational modification by trypsin; residues 419-421 (Gly-Ile-Arg) are excised. The proteolytically processed NT is a dichain protein in which Pro 1-Lys 418 constitute the approximately 50-kDa light chain, Lys 422-Lys 1251 constitute the approximately 100-kDa heavy chain; Cys 411-Cys 425 and Cys 1196-Cys 1237 form the interchain and intrachain disulfide bonds, respectively; the other four Cys residues at positions 25, 346, 941, and 1035 remain as free sulfhydryl groups. The approximately 150-kDa dichain NT, and separated light and heavy chains, were fragmented with CNBr and endoproteases (pepsin and clostripain); some of these fragments were carboxymethylated with iodoacetamide (with or without 14C label) before and after fragmentation. The fragments were separated and analyzed for amino acid compositions and sequences by Edman degradation to determine the complete covalent structure of the dichain type E NT.

"Lack of receptor tyrosine kinase (TrkA), a high-affinity nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor, is closely associated with the malignant progression of neuroblastoma (NB) and its prognosis. Vitamin K3 (VK3) analogs inhibit the activity of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases), which causes hydrolysis of the phosphate groups bound to the tyrosine residues on tyrosine kinase, resulting in sustained tyrosine phosphorylation.

In order to reverse this abnormal NGF/TrkA signal transduction in NB cells, we synthesized new VK3 analogs and examined their activity against NB cells.

VK3 analogs increased or maintained the expression level of c-fos mRNA in the NB cells, which express the downstream genes of NGF/TrkA signal transduction. Moreover, the expression level of GAP-43 mRNA, which is a marker of neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation, was increased and morphological differentiation was also observed. VK3 analogs (especially COOH analog) continued to express c-fos and GAP-43 mRNAs and induced differentiation of NB cells after stimulation of NGF by strong inhibition of PTPase without affecting TrkA autophosphorylation.

For our study we used 52 NAs from 26 cerebral MRIs from neurosurgical patients. Of these MRIs, 15 were preoperative from patients with advanced PD who underwent bilateral deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus. The group of non-parkinsonian MRIs came from the rest 11 individuals. We measured the absolute and relative NA maximum transverse diameter (D (max)), and absolute and relative NA width at a specific transverse plane.

We found a statistically significant difference of the mean value of the D (max) (absolute and relative) between the two groups. The mean percentage reduction of the NA size was 11.77% represented by the relative D (max).

To our knowledge, this is the first report of parkinsonism-related shrinkage of the human NA. Further research is needed to identify whether a respective shrinkage is also observed in patients with early PD and whether this atrophy is correlated with dopaminergic neuropsychiatric symptoms (perhaps mediated by a malfunctioning NA) that occur in PD.",magnetic_resonance_imaging,0,6,5480.279,3798.424,3672.627,10454.25,10130.92,10148.28,2562.252
"To evaluate the hospital multistay rate to determine if it has the attributes necessary for a performance indicator that can be applied to administrative databases.

The fiscal year 1994 Veterans Affairs Patient Treatment File (PTF), which contains discharge data on all VA inpatients.

Using a retrospective study design, we assessed cross-hospital variation in (a) the multistay rate and (b) the standardized multistay ratio. A hospital's multistay rate is the observed average number of hospitalizations for patients with one or more hospital stays. A hospital's standardized multistay ratio is the ratio of the geometric mean of the observed number of hospitalizations per patient to the geometric mean of the expected number of hospitalizations per patient, conditional on the types of patients admitted to that hospital.

Discharge data were extracted for the 135,434 VA patients who had one or more admissions in one of seven disease groups.

We found that 17.3 percent (28,300) of the admissions in the seven disease categories were readmissions. The average number of stays per person (multistay rate) for an average of seven months of follow-up ranged from 1.15 to 1.45 across the disease categories. The maximum standardized multistay ratio ranged from 1.12 to 1.39.

"Many confounding variables (age, sex, race, income level) may contribute to an incorrect estimate of the prevalence of hypertension in the obese population. Furthermore, as far as methodology is concerned, both casual morning BP measurement and, the use, in the obese patient, of inappropriate cuffs both also contribute significantly to the overestimation with the inclusion of false positives even in relevant percentages. Different types of obesity (android or gynoid; visceral or subcutaneous) should be considered when enrolling obese patients in prevalence studies being android or visceral obesity at a higher hypertensive risk. At last and overall, universally recognized cutoff-points for obesity and hypertension should always be used when studying prevalence of hypertension among general population and/or among obese patients. When such conditions are not taken into account, inaccurate and misleading conclusions on the real prevalence of hypertension in obesity may result.",obesity,0,5,8434.565,7306.178,7314.698,12111.48,10538.19,10681.25,4491.127
"Glucocorticoids may play a significant role in the etiology of neuropsychiatric illnesses. Abnormalities in plasma cortisol levels, glucocorticoid sensitivity, and HPA-axis function often accompany clinical symptoms of stress-related illnesses such as PTSD and depression. Of particular interest are genetic association studies that link single nucleotide polymorphisms of HPA-axis genes with illnesses only in the context of an early-life trauma exposure such as child abuse. These studies suggest that dysregulation of HPA-axis function can have lasting repercussions in shaping mood and anxiety, long after termination of the traumatic experience. As persistent glucocorticoid-induced loss of DNA methylation in FK506 binding protein 5 (Fkbp5) was previously observed in the hippocampus and blood and in the neuronal cell line HT-22, we asked whether these epigenetic alterations occur in non-neuronal, HPA-axis relevant cells. We used the pituitary adenoma cell line AtT-20 to demonstrate that the intronic enhancer region of Fkbp5 undergoes loss of DNA methylation in response to dexamethasone treatment in a dose-dependent manner. We also focused on the mouse hippocampal dentate gyrus to test whether these changes would be enriched in a region implicated in the HPA-axis stress response, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. We observed an increase in enrichment of DNA methylation loss in the dentate gyrus, as compared to whole hippocampal tissues that were similarly treated with glucocorticoids. We then asked whether DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1), a methyltransferase enzyme involved in maintaining DNA methylation following cell division, is involved in the observed epigenetic alterations. We found a dose-dependent decrease of Dnmt1 expression in the AtT-20 cells following dexamethasone treatment, and a similar decrease in corticosterone-treated mouse hippocampus. Taken together, we provide evidence that these glucocorticoid-induced epigenetic alterations have a broader validity in non-neuronal cells and that they may involve the DNA methylation machinery.",cell_line_tumor,0,8,7834.972,6439.839,6516.321,12142.95,11129.43,11626.64,3673.789
"RelA/SpoT Homologue (RSH) proteins, named for their sequence similarity to the RelA and SpoT enzymes of Escherichia coli, comprise a superfamily of enzymes that synthesize and/or hydrolyze the alarmone ppGpp, activator of the ""stringent"" response and regulator of cellular metabolism. The classical ""long"" RSHs Rel, RelA and SpoT with the ppGpp hydrolase, synthetase, TGS and ACT domain architecture have been found across diverse bacteria and plant chloroplasts, while dedicated single domain ppGpp-synthesizing and -hydrolyzing RSHs have also been discovered in disparate bacteria and animals respectively. However, there is considerable confusion in terms of nomenclature and no comprehensive phylogenetic and sequence analyses have previously been carried out to classify RSHs on a genomic scale. We have performed high-throughput sensitive sequence searching of over 1000 genomes from across the tree of life, in combination with phylogenetic analyses to consolidate previous ad hoc identification of diverse RSHs in different organisms and provide a much-needed unifying terminology for the field. We classify RSHs into 30 subgroups comprising three groups: long RSHs, small alarmone synthetases (SASs), and small alarmone hydrolases (SAHs). Members of nineteen previously unidentified RSH subgroups can now be studied experimentally, including previously unknown RSHs in archaea, expanding the ""stringent response"" to this domain of life. We have analyzed possible combinations of RSH proteins and their domains in bacterial genomes and compared RSH content with available RSH knock-out data for various organisms to determine the rules of combining RSHs. Through comparative sequence analysis of long and small RSHs, we find exposed sites limited in conservation to the long RSHs that we propose are involved in transmitting regulatory signals. Such signals may be transmitted via NTD to CTD intra-molecular interactions, or inter-molecular interactions either among individual RSH molecules or among long RSHs and other binding partners such as the ribosome.",molecular_sequence_data,0,6,9479.437,8293.941,8559.815,14744.03,16843.46,17275.45,4539.313
"The pharmacokinetics of alkylating activity were studied in 17 children treated i.v. with ifosfamide (IF) at 3 g/m2 as a 1-h infusion for 2 consecutive days every 3 weeks, with mesna as a uroprotector. Two patients were treated for a newly diagnosed rhabdomyosarcoma according to the current SIOP (International Society of Pediatric Oncology) protocol. The other 15 patients were treated in a phase II study and presented with one of the following malignancies in relapse: neuroblastoma (7), osteosarcoma (3), soft tissue sarcoma (2), Wilms' tumor (1), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (1), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (1). Plasma alkylating activity levels determined by using 4(4'-nitro-benzyl)-pyridine showed considerable inter-individual and intercyclic variations and decreased biphasically, with mean alpha and beta half-lives of 60 min and 6-7 h, respectively. Probably as a result of liver mixed-function oxidase induction, on the 2nd day of treatment the terminal half-lives were shorter, the plasma exposures were lower, and the mean plasma clearances were higher. Renal excretion was almost complete after 24 h, accounting for a mean of 19% of the injected dose. The CSF alkylating activity levels, obtained in four children, were always lower than the plasma levels and ranged from 8 to 51 micrograms/ml, with a mean CSF/plasma ratio of 0.53 +/- 0.23 during the first 12 h. We conclude that IF alkylating activity was biphasically cleared from the plasma, with significant interindividual and intercyclic variability, that the renal contribution to the clearance was low, and that high levels of CSF alkylating activity could possibly contribute to the CNS toxic side effects observed in pediatric patients treated with high-dose IF/mesna.",neoplasms,0.4,5,7721.583,6862.688,6805.604,13639.68,14056.26,14233.43,4024.062
Adaptive interventions apply a priori decision rules for adjusting treatment services in response to participants' clinical presentation or performance in treatment. This pilot study (n = 30) experimentally examined an adaptive intervention in a misdemeanor drug court. The participants were primarily charged with possession of marijuana (73%) or possession of drug paraphernalia (23%). Results revealed that participants in the adaptive condition had higher graduation rates and required significantly less time to graduate from the program and achieve a final resolution of the case. It took an average of nearly 4 fewer months for participants in the adaptive intervention to resolve their cases compared with those participating in drug court as usual. Participants in the adaptive condition also reported equivalent satisfaction with the program and therapeutic alliances with their counselors. These data suggest that adaptive interventions may enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of drug courts and justify examining adaptive interventions in large-scale drug court studies.,algorithms,0.4,4,4995.886,3353.423,3450.006,12702.41,11297.36,11553.87,2807.643
"The pathophysiology of tinnitus, the perception of sound in the absence of acoustic stimulation, is largely unknown, although several lines of research implicate long-term neuroplastic loss of inhibition. The evidence to date suggests that the neuroplastic alterations are likely to be found in multiple brain structures. The present study used manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) to assess the pattern of neural activity in the central auditory pathway of rats with psychophysical evidence of chronic acoustic-exposure-induced tinnitus. Manganese, an activity-dependent paramagnetic contrast agent, accumulates in active neurons through voltage-gated calcium channels, primarily at synapses, and serves as both a structural and functional indicator. Comparison images were obtained from normal subjects exposed to external tinnitus-like sound, and from tinnitus subjects treated with vigabatrin, a GABA agonist shown to eliminate the psychophysical evidence of tinnitus in rats. MEMRI indicated: (1) In rats with evidence of tinnitus, activity was generally elevated in the auditory brainstem, with significant elevation in the cerebellar paraflocculus, the posterior ventral cochlear nucleus, and the inferior colliculus; in general forebrain structures showed decreased activity, although MEMRI may be a less sensitive indicator of forebrain activity than brainstem activity; (2) in normal rats exposed to a tinnitus-like sound, a similar pattern of elevated brainstem activity and decreased forebrain activity was evident, with the notable exception of the paraflocculus, where artificial tinnitus had no effect and (3) vigabatrin, decreased brainstem activity to control levels, in rats with prior evidence of tinnitus, and decreased forebrain activity to below control levels. It was concluded that chronic tinnitus in rats is associated with focal activity elevation in the auditory brainstem and increased activity in the paraflocculus that may be unique to tinnitus.",magnetic_resonance_imaging,0.2,10,7317.588,5577.089,5502.831,12279.11,12179.06,12480.48,3329.405
"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal primary human brain tumor. GBMs are characterized by a variety of genetic alterations, among which oncogenic mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRvIII) is most common. GBMs harboring EGFRvIII have increased proliferation and invasive characteristics versus those expressing wild-type (wt) EGFR. To identify the molecular basis of this increased tumorgenic phenotype, we used iTRAQ-labeling differential proteomic analysis. Among several differentially expressed proteins, we selected CRMP1, a protein implicated in cellular invasion that was markedly decreased in GBMs expressing EGFRvIII, for further study. The differential expression of CRMP1 was confirmed in a panel of human GBM cell lines and operative specimens that express wtEGFR or mutant EGFRvIII by quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemical analysis. In human GBM samples, decreased expression of CRMP1 correlated with EGFRvIII positivity. Knockdown of CRMP1 by siRNA resulted in increased invasion of wtEGFR expressing human GBM cells (U87 and U373) to those found in isogenic GBM cells. Exogenous expression of EGFRvIII in these wtEGFR-expressing GBM cells promoted their ability to invade and was accompanied by decreased expression of CRMP1. Rescuing CRMP1 expression decreased invasion of the EGFRvIII-expressing GBM cells by tilting the balance between Rac and Rho. Collectively, these results show that the loss of CRMP1 contribute to the increased invasive phenotype of human GBMs expressing mutant EGFRvIII.",cell_line_tumor,0.2,6,12877.65,11084.39,11155.85,21031.45,21162.76,21496.16,5361.24
"Paravahlkampfia francinae n. sp., a new species of the free-living amoeba genus Paravahlkampfia, designated as CDC:V595, was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with headache, sore throat, and vomiting, typical symptoms of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) caused by Naegleria fowleri. The isolate grew at 33 degrees C, 37 degrees C, 40 degrees C, and 42 degrees C and destroyed mammalian cell cultures. However, it did not kill young mice upon intranasal inoculation. P. francinae does not produce flagellates and does not grow on agar plates coated with Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, the usual food source of Paravahlkampfia ustiana, the type species of the genus. The trophozoite at light microscopy exhibited eruptive locomotion and possessed a single vesicular nucleus. Ultrastructurally, the trophozoites had numerous mitochondria with discoidal cristae but did not have a Golgi apparatus. The trophozoites differentiated into cysts after consuming most of the monolayer. The cyst had an inner well-differentiated endocyst and an outer thin, wrinkled, and wavy ectocyst with no pores. During excystation trophozoites ruptured the cyst wall and emerged from the cysts. A unique feature seen in the cysts was the presence of bacterial endosymbionts, both in the endoplasm and within the cyst wall. Full-length sequencing analysis of the 18S and 5.8S RNA genes of P. francinae showed that they were distinct from those of other Paravahlkampfia species.

"T lymphocytes can be activated via the T cell receptor (TCR) or by triggering through a number of other surface structures, including the CD2 co-receptor molecule. Signaling through the CD2 molecule was shown previously to be dependent on the TCR-associated zeta-chain. Here, we show that CD2-induced activation also functions in T cells which express zeta-chains lacking a functional immune-receptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). TCR-positive T cells that express only the transmembrane part of the zeta-chain protein and thus lack a functional zeta-derived ITAM readily produce interleukin (IL)-2 when cross-linked with CD2-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb). TCR-negative T cell hybridomas expressing minimal receptors consisting of an extracellular CD25 and an intracellular zeta-chain-derived segment were effectively stimulated via CD2-specific mAb. For CD2-mediated co-stimulation of TCR-negative cells, two zeta-chain-derived ITAM were sufficient to induce IL-2 when the CD2 molecules were co-cross-linked with the chimeric CD25-zeta molecules. Taken together, our results show that CD2-induced signaling does not necessarily employ the zeta-chain in TCR-positive cells and that CD2-dependent co-stimulation in TCR-negative cells can be mediated via two functional zeta-chain-derived ITAM.",signal_transduction,0.4,5,13436.53,13076.65,13314.8,20263.31,20578.32,20886.91,6360.798
"Studies were carried out on cholesterol metabolism in 11 nonobese patients and 16 obese patients with hypothyroidism and 13 with hyperthyroidism. The patients underwent several investigations under metabolic ward conditions. Hypothyroid patients usually had an increase in low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. Several mechanisms may have combined to cause a high LDL. For instance, the obese hypothyroid patients had an increase in cholesterol synthesis. Absorption of cholesterol also was increased frequently. However, other mechanisms not explored in this study probably contributed to most of the fall in LDL-cholesterol. Treatment of hypothyroid patients produced the expected fall in LDL. One possible mechanism could be that thyroid hormones enhance the conversion of cholesterol into bile acids; this mechanism has been suggested by other workers from animal studies. However, no evidence was obtained in either hypothyroid or hyperthyroid patients that thyroid hormones alter synthesis of bile acids. On the other hand, the hormones appeared to increase the synthesis of cholesterol. Patients with hypothyroidism frequently had supersaturated bile. The cause was mostly an enhanced secretion of biliary cholesterol associated with a tendency to obesity and increased synthesis of cholesterol. In contrast, the usually thin hyperthyroid patients did not have supersaturated bile. The studies show that thyroid hormones a) influence LDL-cholesterol by an action on the catabolism of LDL-independent of alterations in synthesis, catabolism, absorption, or excretion: b) stimulate synthesis of cholesterol; and c) affect biliary lipid metabolism in large part by influencing energy balance and cholesterol synthesis.",obesity,0.4,7,6878.911,6025.438,5851.864,13003.96,13929.97,13944.74,3731.223
"The effect of water-soluble chitosan, a natural polymer used as a dietary supplement, on human bladder-tumor cells was investigated. Apoptotic morphological change was demonstrated by nuclear staining. Chitosan-treated cells showed elevation of caspase-8-like activity, but no significant elevation of caspase-9-like activity, which suggest that proapoptotic effect of chitosan is attributable to death receptor activation and not to activation of the mitochondria-cytochrome c pathway. Chitosan increased expression of TNF-R1, but decreased Fas expression. Use of monoclonal antibodies to inhibit death-receptor signal transduction did not attenuate the proapoptotic activity of chitosan. Examination of death-ligands revealed that TNFalpha mRNA expression was markedly increased by chitosan treatment while FasL mRNA was not affected. Although the direct interaction of chitosan with death receptors remains unidentified, the results suggest that its proapoptotic effect might be related to interaction with TNFalpha or TNF-R1.",cell_line_tumor,0.6,4,9493.138,8511.256,8736.507,13882.26,13492.11,13746.0,4557.929
"In the United States, New York City has had the greatest number of subjects at risk of AIDS for the longest period of time. This population therefore serves as an indicator of changes in cancer risk which may emerge among persons at risk from AIDS. Using a proportional incidence method, we surveyed cancers occurring among single (a surrogate for homosexual) young men and married young men in Manhattan, the rest of New York City, and the remainder of New York State. The baseline period was established earlier to be 1973-76, during which time no cases of Kaposi's sarcoma were observed among single men in Manhattan. By 1985, the frequency of Kaposi's sarcoma in this group was increased 1,850-fold (compared with expected cases derived from other registries). In the same group, the increase of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was 6.2-fold (p for trend less than 0.0001), with excesses of Burkitt's lymphoma and immunoblastic lymphoma being most noticeable. Diagnoses of Hodgkin's disease increased markedly in 1985 but not earlier. Since this pattern did not follow that of the AIDS epidemic in this area, we suggest that Hodgkin's disease is not an AIDS-associated tumor. Hepatoma was diagnosed more frequently in single young men during the 1980s but similar increases also were observed in married men and thus may be unrelated to AIDS. Thus, only Kaposi's sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma appear to be AIDS-associated tumors, at least so far.

"The biological molecule NO and its cyclic nucleotide effector molecule cGMP, are involved in a variety of biological systems. This article reviews evidence supporting a role for these molecules in signal transduction. Over the last 10 years, it has become evident that these molecules are important in Ca2+ regulation, particularly in excitable cells. In these cells, cGMP-dependent mechanisms appear to both directly and indirectly regulate Ca2+ transport. Until recently, reports of the actions of cGMP in non-excitable cells have been contradictory, presenting a confusing plethora of effects. In these cells, the cGMP-Ca2+ regulation pathway appears to be concentration-dependent, possibly representing a negative feedback mechanism. Ca2+ entry appears to be activated when low concentrations of cGMP are present, and inhibited at higher concentrations. The role of cGMP in Ca2+ regulation in non-excitable cells has been largely overlooked and further investigation of this issue may provide clues as to the nature of various unknown components that induce Ca2+ entry into these cells.",signal_transduction,0.2,8,6773.077,5156.83,5012.199,12828.66,11148.26,11114.99,3786.615
"Complete envelope genes were amplified from autopsy brain tissue of five individuals who had died of AIDS and had neurological complications. Lymph node samples were included for two of the patients. Nineteen different envelope clones from the five patients had distinct V1V2 sequences. Thirteen of the envelopes were functional and conferred fusigenicity and infectivity for CD4(+) CCR5(+) cells. Infectivity and cell-cell fusion assays showed that most envelopes used both CCR5 and CCR3. One brain-derived envelope used a broad range of coreceptors, while three other brain envelopes from one individual were restricted to CCR5. However, there was no correlation between tissue of origin and coreceptor use. Envelopes showed two very distinct phenotypes depending on their capacity to infect macrophages and to exploit low levels of CD4 and/or CCR5 for infection. Envelopes that were highly fusigenic and tropic for macrophages were identified in brain tissue from four of the five patients. The enhanced macrophage tropism correlated with reduced sensitivity to inhibition by Q4120, a CD4-specific antibody, but not with sensitivity to the CCR5 inhibitor, TAK779. The highly macrophage-tropic envelopes were able to infect cells expressing low levels of CD4 and/or CCR5. Comparison with several well-characterized macrophage-tropic envelopes showed that the four identified patient envelopes were at the top limit of macrophage tropism. In contrast, all four lymph node-derived envelopes exhibited a non-macrophage-tropic phenotype and required high levels of CD4 for infection. Our data support the presence of envelopes that are highly fusigenic and tropic for macrophages in the brains of patients with neurological complications. These envelopes are able to infect cells that express low levels of CD4 and/or CCR5 and may have adapted for replication in brain macrophages and microglia, which are known to express limited amounts of CD4.",molecular_sequence_data,0.2,10,7347.273,5122.457,5134.234,11732.35,11436.04,11574.49,3943.42
"Increasing evidence points to a role for circulating endothelial progenitor cells, including populations of CD34- and CD133-positive cells present in peripheral blood, in maintenance of the vasculature and neovascularization. Immature populations, including CD34-positive cells, have been shown to contribute to vascular homeostasis, not only as a pool of endothelial progenitor cells but also as a source of growth/angiogenesis factors at ischemic loci. We hypothesized that diminished numbers of circulating immature cells might impair such physiological and reparative processes, potentially contributing to cerebrovascular dysfunction.

The level of circulating immature cells, CD34-, CD133-, CD117-, and CD135-positive cells, in patients with a history of atherothrombotic cerebral ischemic events was analyzed to assess possible correlations with the degree of carotid atherosclerosis and number of cerebral infarctions. There was a strong inverse correlation between numbers of circulating CD34- and CD133-positive cells and cerebral infarction. In contrast, there was no correlation between the degree of atherosclerosis and populations of circulating immature cells. Analysis of patients with cerebral artery occlusion revealed a significant positive correlation between circulating CD34- and CD133-positive cells and regional blood flow in areas of chronic hypoperfusion.

These results suggest a possible contribution of circulating CD34- and CD133-positive cells in maintenance of the cerebral circulation in settings of ischemic stress.

"Factor analysis is a powerful tool used for the analysis of dynamic studies. One of the major drawbacks of factor analysis of dynamic structures (FADS) is that the solution is not mathematically unique when only nonnegativity constraints are used to determine factors and factor coefficients. In this paper, a method to correct for ambiguous FADS solutions has been developed. A nonambiguous solution (to within certain scaling factors) is obtained by constructing and minimizing a new objective function. The most common objective function consists of a least squares term that when minimized with nonnegativity constraints, forces agreement between the applied factor model and the measured data. In our method, this objective function is modified by adding a term that penalizes multiple components in the images of the factor coefficients. Due to nonuniqueness effects, these factor coefficients consist of more than one physiological component. The technique was tested on computer simulations, an experimental canine cardiac study using 99mTc-teboroxime, and a patient planar 99mTc-MAG3 renal study. The results show that the technique works well in comparison to the truth in computer simulations and to region of interest (ROI) measurements in the experimental studies.",algorithms,0.6,6,4798.972,3686.267,3802.923,8608.149,8313.995,8543.762,1695.962
"It is now widely accepted that the early-life nutritional environment is important in determining susceptibility to metabolic diseases. In particular, intra-uterine growth restriction followed by accelerated postnatal growth is associated with an increased risk of obesity, type-2 diabetes and other features of the metabolic syndrome.

Using a well-established maternal protein-restriction rodent model, our aim was to determine if exposure to mismatched nutrition in early-life programmes adipose tissue structure and function, and expression of key components of the insulin-signalling pathway.

Offspring of dams fed a low-protein (8%) diet during pregnancy were suckled by control (20%)-fed dams to drive catch-up growth. This 'recuperated' group was compared with offspring of dams fed a 20% protein diet during pregnancy and lactation (control group). Epididymal adipose tissue from 22-day and 3-month-old control and recuperated male rats was studied using histological analysis. Expression and phosphorylation of insulin-signalling proteins and gene expression were assessed by western blotting and reverse-transcriptase PCR, respectively.

Recuperated offspring at both ages had larger adipocytes (P&<.001). Fasting serum glucose, insulin and leptin levels were comparable between groups but increased with age. Recuperated offspring had reduced expression of IRS-1 (P&<.01) and PI3K p110Î² (P&<.001) in adipose tissue. In adult recuperated rats, Akt phosphorylation (P&<.01) and protein levels of Akt-2 (P&<.01) were also reduced. Messenger RNA expression levels of these proteins were not different, indicating a post-transcriptional effect.

"In the past two decades a trickle of manuscripts examining the non-neuronal central nervous system immune consequences of the drugs of abuse has now swollen to a significant body of work. Initially, these studies reported associative evidence of central nervous system proinflammation resulting from exposure to the drugs of abuse demonstrating key implications for neurotoxicity and disease progression associated with, for example, HIV infection. However, more recently this drug-induced activation of central immune signaling is now understood to contribute substantially to the pharmacodynamic actions of the drugs of abuse, by enhancing the engagement of classical mesolimbic dopamine reward pathways and withdrawal centers. This review will highlight the key in vivo animal, human, biological and molecular evidence of these central immune signaling actions of opioids, alcohol, cocaine, methamphetamine, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). Excitingly, this new appreciation of central immune signaling activity of drugs of abuse provides novel therapeutic interventions and opportunities to identify 'at risk' individuals through the use of immunogenetics. Discussion will also cover the evidence of modulation of this signaling by existing clinical and pre-clinical drug candidates, and novel pharmacological targets. Finally, following examination of the breadth of central immune signaling actions of the drugs of abuse highlighted here, the current known common immune signaling components will be outlined and their impact on established addiction neurocircuitry discussed, thereby synthesizing a common neuroimmune hypothesis of addiction.",signal_transduction,0,8,6620.535,5394.136,5397.18,11698.11,11107.38,11056.51,3569.689
"Pre-existing anti-adenovirus neutralizing antibodies (AdNAbs) are a major barrier in clinical gene therapy using adenovirus vectors; however, the transduction profile of adenovirus vectors in the presence of AdNAbs following intratumoral injection has not been fully examined, although such vectors are often intratumorally injected in clinical studies. In this study, we evaluated the correlation between the titer of AdNAbs in the serum and the transduction profiles in the tumor and the liver following intratumoral administration into mice possessing various titers of AdNAbs. Adenovirus vector-mediated transduction in the tumor was inhibited by AdNAbs; however, when the titer of AdNAbs was less than 200, the levels of inhibition in the transduction efficiencies within the tumor ranged from approximately 2- to 100-fold. A more than 2500-fold reduction of adenovirus vector-mediated transduction was found in most of the mice when the titers of AdNAbs were >200. On the other hand, the transduction efficiencies in the liver were largely reduced almost to the levels of the mock-transduced mice even at the low titers of AdNAbs. These results provide crucial information for the clinical use of adenovirus vectors.",cell_line_tumor,0,9,5154.338,4084.584,4056.269,8249.303,7710.49,8117.838,2406.743
"A method for the simultaneous determination of quinolones in water and urine samples by microextraction in a sorbent-packed syringe (MEPS) with LC is described. MEPS is a new miniaturized SPE technique that can be used with chromatographic instruments without any modifications. In MEPS, approximately 1 mg of the solid packing material is inserted into a syringe (100-250 microL) as a plug. Sample preparation takes place on the packed bed. The new method is promising, easy to use, economical, and rapid. The determination of quinolones in groundwater and urine was performed using MEPS as a sample preparation method with LC-UV determination. Four quinolone antibiotics--enrofloxacin, enoxacin, danofloxacin, and nalidixic acid--in groundwater and urine samples were used as analytes. The extraction recovery was found to be between 64.9 and 98.9%. The results showed high correlation coefficients (R2 > 0.992) for all of the analytes within the calibration range.

"The rapid advancement of nanotechnology in recent years has fuelled a burgeoning interest in the field of nanoparticle research, in particular, its application in the medical arena. A constantly expanding knowledge based on a better understanding of the properties of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) coupled with relentless experimentation means that the frontiers of nanotechnology are constantly being challenged. At present, there seems to be heightened interest in the application of AuNPs to the management of cancer, encompassing diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of the disease. These efforts are undertaken in the hope of revolutionizing current methods of treatment and treatment strategies for a multifactorial disease such as cancer. This review will focus on the current applications of AuNPs in cancer management.",neoplasms,0,4,3297.188,2524.395,2512.528,6420.194,4602.078,4503.629,2060.43
"Polar residues comprise about 15% of the transmembrane (TM) domains of proteins, where they can stabilize structure via native side chain-side chain interhelical hydrogen bonds between TM helices. However, non-native H-bonds may be implicated in disease states, through limiting protein dynamics during transport and/or misfolding the protein by inducing non-native rotational positions about TM helical axes. Here we have undertaken an investigation of the presence and strength of H-bond interactions within a series of helix-loop-helix (""hairpin"") constructs derived from TM helices 3 and 4 (italic) of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (prototypic sequence G(194)LALAHFVWIAPLQ(207)VALLMGLIWELLQASAFAGLGFLIV(232)LALFQ(237)AGLG(241)) in which wild-type Q207 in TM3 forms an interhelical H-bond with CF-phenotypic mutant V232D in TM4 [Therien, A.

In the present work, a library of 21 TM3/4 constructs was prepared, where Asp residues were placed individually at TM4 positions 221-241. Using gel shift assays-in which H-bond-linked hairpins (closed conformation) migrate faster than the elongated forms (open conformation)-we found that Q207 in TM3 is able to ""capture"" all 21 TM4 D mutations into measurable populations of interhelical H-bonds. A similar library of TM4 D mutants-but also containing Q207L-reverted to wild-type migration rates, confirming Q207 as the polar partner for TM4 D residues. In view of the broad capture range of Q207, these results emphasize the potential consequences to folding and dynamics of introducing polar mutations into the TM domains of membrane proteins in the vicinity of a native polar TM residue.",molecular_sequence_data,0,10,15531.72,13907.88,13979.9,25962.89,25408.51,25598.04,7846.508
"We previously reported that alpha-trifluoromethyl acyloins (TFs) induced various types of cell death, depending on the target cancer cell line. We investigated here what type of cell death is induced by a-trifluoromethyl acyloins in two human oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (HSC-2, HSC-4). TFs produced few TUNEL-positive cells. TFs induced annexin V/PI-double positive HSC-2 cells and annexin V-positive/PI-negative HSC-4 cells, respectively, but failed to activate caspase-3, capase-8 and caspase-9 in both HSC-2 and HSC-4 cells. On the other hand, TFs induced the formation of acidic organelles (detected by acridine orange staining) in both HSC-2 and HSC-4 cells. When HSC-2 and HSC-4 cells that had been transfected with expression vector encording the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) gene fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) were treated with TFs, LC3-GFP fusion protein was accumulated as granular dots in autophagosomes. Pretreatment with 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of autophagy, partially inhibited the cytotoxicity of TFs, the formation of acidic organelles and LC3 accumulation in the autophagosome. These data suggest that alpha-trifluoromethyl acyloins may induce autophagic cell death in HSC-2 and HSC-4 cells following the early stage of necrosis or apoptosis, respectively.",cell_line_tumor,0,6,14197.37,14258.4,14149.97,21857.6,24929.9,25129.48,6851.264
"Serum leptin concentrations in obese patients are influenced at short-term by a reduction of food intake. The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the relationship between serum leptin level and eating behavior. The eating behavior and the food and shape attitudes of a group of obese women were assessed by the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE), and the subscale scores were correlated with serum leptin levels. No difference in serum leptin level was found between obese patients with binge eating disorder (BED) and their nonbingeing counterparts. Considering all patients, the serum leptin levels positively correlated with the body mass index values (BMI), and the EDE subscales scores were positively interrelated. After controlling for BMI, serum leptin level was negatively correlated with the EDE Restraint score and positively correlated with the EDE Shape Concern score. The findings of this investigation indicate that in obese women serum leptin level and the occurrence of binge eating are unrelated. Furthermore, this study also found that the relationship between serum leptin level and restraint over food intake observed in eating disordered patients and in overweight preadolescent girls is shared by obese adult women. In addition, the positive relationship between EDE Shape Concern and serum leptin concentration suggests that the restrained eating might be the cause rather the consequence of the low leptin production.",obesity,0,4,7254.726,5946.459,5878.253,11229.25,11940.86,12232.22,3459.588
"The seed of Phaseolus calcaratus Roxburgh (PHCR) has traditionally been used as a herbal medicine, considered to have anti-inflammatory potential. Here we examined the ability of PHCR seed extract to inhibit inflammatory responses of macrophages to bacterial toxin and the mechanism involved.

In the present study, we prepared four fractions from an ethanol extract of PHCR seed and investigated their effects on the production of nitric oxide and cytokines, and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage cells.

The fractions inhibited LPS-induced nitric oxide production and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in the cells. The ethyl acetate fraction at 100 Âµg/ml almost completely suppressed NO production, iNOS and COX-2 expression, and TNF-Î± and IL-6 secretion in cells stimulated with LPS. The fraction also inhibited phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 in LPS-stimulated cells with the attendant suppression of IÎºBÎ± nuclear translocation and nuclear factor (NF)-ÎºB activation. Furthermore, PHCR seed extracts contained a large number of phenolic compounds having antioxidant potentials against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals and hydroxyl radicals. We identified catechin-7-O-Î²-D-glucopyranoside as one of the active compounds responsible for the biological activity of PHCR seed extract.

These results suggest for the first time that ethanol extracts from PHCR seed have anti-inflammatory potential on LPS-stimulated macrophages through the down-regulation of ERK/p38- and NF-ÎºB-mediated signalling pathways.",signal_transduction,0,4,11154.7,10332.46,10332.25,17990.85,17742.41,17815.66,5822.188
"We report here the isolation of three members of a new family of antimicrobial peptides from the hemolymph of shrimps Penaeus vannamei in which immune response has not been experimentally induced. The three molecules display antimicrobial activity against fungi and bacteria with a predominant activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The complete sequences of these peptides were determined by a combination of enzymatic cleavages, Edman degradation, mass spectrometry, and cDNA cloning using a hemocyte cDNA library. The mature molecules (50 and 62 residues) are characterized by an NH2-terminal domain rich in proline residues and a COOH-terminal domain containing three intramolecular disulfide bridges. One of these molecules is post-translationally modified by a pyroglutamic acid at the first position.

"Analyses of gene expression data from microarray experiments has become a central tool for identifying co-regulated, functional gene modules. A crucial aspect of such analysis is the integration of data from different experiments and different laboratories. How to weigh the contribution of different experiments is an important point influencing the final outcomes. We have developed a novel method for this integration, and applied it to genome-wide data from multiple Arabidopsis microarray experiments performed under a variety of experimental conditions. The goal of this study is to identify functional globally co-regulated gene modules in the Arabidopsis genome.

Following the analysis of 21,000 Arabidopsis genes in 43 datasets and about 2 x 10(8) gene pairs, we identified a globally co-expressed gene network. We found clusters of globally co-expressed Arabidopsis genes that are enriched for known Gene Ontology annotations. Two types of modules were identified in the regulatory network that differed in their sensitivity to the node-scoring parameter; we further showed these two pertain to general and specialized modules. Some of these modules were further investigated using the Genevestigator compendium of microarray experiments. Analyses of smaller subsets of data lead to the identification of condition-specific modules.

Our method for identification of gene clusters allows the integration of diverse microarray experiments from many sources. The analysis reveals that part of the Arabidopsis transcriptome is globally co-expressed, and can be further divided into known as well as novel functional gene modules.

"Tumor cells can evade the immune system through several mechanisms, one of which is to block DC maturation. It has been suggested that signaling via Toll-like receptors (TLR) may be involved in the induction of prophylactic anti-cancer immunity and in the treatment of established tumors. In the present study we found that high numbers of tumor cells interfere with BMDC activation induced by the TLR ligands LPS and poly IC. Tumor cells blocked TLR3- and TLR4-mediated induction of MHCII and the co-stimulatory molecules CD40 and CD86, as well as the cytokines IL-12, TNF-alpha and IL-6. Importantly, tumor cells induced inhibitory molecules (B7-DC, B7-H1 and CD80) on spleen DC in vivo and on BMDC, even in the presence of TLR ligands. Moreover, after a long exposure with tumor cells, purified BMDC were unable to respond to a second challenge with TLR ligands.

"The ability to map individual nucleosomes accurately across genomes enables the study of relationships between dynamic changes in nucleosome positioning/occupancy and gene regulation. However, the highly heterogeneous nature of nucleosome densities across genomes and short linker regions pose challenges in mapping nucleosome positions based on high-throughput microarray data of micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digested DNA. Previous works rely on additional detrending and careful visual examination to detect low-signal nucleosomes, which may exist in a subpopulation of cells. We propose a non-homogeneous hidden-state model based on first order differences of experimental data along genomic coordinates that bypasses the need for local detrending and can automatically detect nucleosome positions of various occupancy levels. Our proposed approach is applicable to both low and high resolution MNase-Chip and MNase-Seq (high throughput sequencing) data, and is able to map nucleosome-linker boundaries accurately. This automated algorithm is also computationally efficient and only requires a simple preprocessing step. We provide several examples illustrating the pitfalls of existing methods, the difficulties of detrending the observed hybridization signals and demonstrate the advantages of utilizing first order differences in detecting nucleosome occupancies via simulations and case studies involving MNase-Chip and MNase-Seq data of nucleosome occupancy in yeast S. cerevisiae.",algorithms,1,4,9792.187,8387.697,8445.975,17882.18,20342.04,20295.46,3285.161

One hundred percent of patients with less than five preoperative seizures and/or an history under 12 months was seizure free, while only 62.5% of patients with more than five seizures and/or an history longer than 12 months was seizure free.

"Gel filtration of human serum extracts on Bio-Gel P-30 columns produced two peaks of material reactive with insulin antisera. The earlier eluting fraction appeared at the elution position of proinsulin (serum proinsulin-like component, PLC) while the second fraction corresponded in elution volume to insulin. In assays using porcine insulin-(131)I and an antiserum against porcine insulin, human pancreatic proinsulin was less reactive than human insulin. Serial dilutions of the serum PLC in the immunoassay showed immunological identity with the human proinsulin standard. Partial tryptic digestion of the serum PLC yielded products with increased immunological reactivity as estimated with insulin as the standard. With larger amounts of trypsin, all the serum PLC was converted to insulin-like components (desthreonine and desoctapeptide insulin). On the basis of these results we conclude that the earlier eluting fraction of human serum extracts is proinsulin. The fasting values of proinsulin in normal subjects ranged between 0.05 and 0.4 ng/ml, representing from 5 to 48% of the insulin concentration. In one subject the values of proinsulin were higher than those of insulin. After oral administration of 100 g of glucose, the proinsulin levels tended to rise similarly to insulin. Three obese patients with hyperinsulinemia had higher fasting levels of proinsulin and a greater increase after glucose than the normal subjects. As the high levels of proinsulin coexisted with raised insulin concentration in these obese subjects, the relative proportions of the two hormones were in the same range observed in the normal group. Thus hyperinsulinemia in these obese subjects was not accompanied by an increase in the fraction of serum proinsulin. When the values for serum proinsulin were expressed as percentage of the insulin levels, there was a decrease in the per cent proinsulin in the first hour of the glucose tolerance test. After the second hour, the per cent tended to rise towards the fasting levels.",obesity,1,6,6214.873,5760.024,5725.686,11553.74,10469.86,10737.03,3115.068
"We have isolated the embryonic lethal gene muscleblind (mbl) as a suppressor of the sev-svp2 eye phenotype. Analysis of clones mutant for mbl during eye development shows that it is autonomously required for photoreceptor differentiation. Mutant cells are recruited into developing ommatidia and initiate neural differentiation, but they fail to properly differentiate as photoreceptors. Molecular analysis reveals that the mbl locus is large and complex, giving rise to multiple different proteins with common 5' sequences but different carboxy termini. Mbl proteins are nuclear and share a Cys3His zinc-finger motif which is also found in the TIS11/NUP475/TTP family of proteins and is highly conserved in vertebrates and invertebrates. Functional analysis of mbl, the observation that it also dominantly suppresses the sE-Jun(Asp) gain-of-function phenotype and the phenotypic similarity to mutants in the photoreceptor-specific glass gene suggest that mbl is a general factor required for photoreceptor differentiation.",molecular_sequence_data,0.8,6,7293.339,7027.07,7277.587,9485.605,11503.9,11880.74,3462.014
"NO is a pleiotropic signaling molecule and has an important role in cognition and emotion. In the brain, NO is produced by neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS-I, encoded by NOS1) coupled to the NMDA receptor via PDZ interactions; this protein-protein interaction is disrupted upon binding of NOS1 adapter protein (encoded by NOS1AP) to NOS-I. As both NOS1 and NOS1AP were associated with schizophrenia, we here investigated these genes in greater detail by genotyping new samples and conducting a meta-analysis of our own and published data. In doing so, we confirmed association of both genes with schizophrenia and found evidence for their interaction in increasing risk towards disease. Our strongest finding was the NOS1 promoter SNP rs41279104, yielding an odds ratio of 1.29 in the meta-analysis. As findings from heterologous cell systems have suggested that the risk allele decreases gene expression, we studied the effect of the variant on NOS1 expression in human post-mortem brain samples and found that the risk allele significantly decreases expression of NOS1 in the prefrontal cortex. Bioinformatic analyses suggest that this might be due the replacement of six transcription factor binding sites by two new binding sites as a consequence of proxy SNPs. Taken together, our data argue that genetic variance in NOS1 resulting in lower prefrontal brain expression of this gene contributes to schizophrenia liability, and that NOS1 interacts with NOS1AP in doing so. The NOS1-NOS1AP PDZ interface may thus well constitute a novel target for small molecules in at least some forms of schizophrenia.",signal_transduction,0.6,6,7338.8,6475.433,6426.315,11970.39,12648.58,13008.26,2946.671

"Chemotherapy is the preferred therapeutic approach for advanced ovarian cancer, but a successful long-term treatment is prevented by the development of drug resistance. Recent works have underlined the involvement of non-coding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) in cancer development, with several conjectures regarding their possible involvement in the evolution of drug resistance. This study is to investigate the promoting effects and mechanism of miR-125b involved in the development of chemoresistance in ovarian cancer. The different expression of miR-125b in cisplatin-sensitive ovarian cancer cell line (OV2008) and its resistant variant (C13*) was identified by real-time PCR. An in vitro cytotoxicity assay and apoptosis assay using CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, were carried out to detect the effect of miR-125b and Bak1 on cisplatin resistance of cells. Real-time PCR, Western blotting and luciferase reporter assay were used to detect whether Bak1 is a target of miR-125b. As compared with OV2008 cells, the expression levels of miR-125b in C13* cells were increased. It was found that the up-regulation of microRNA-125b caused a marked inhibition of cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis and a subsequent increase in the resistance to cisplatin in OV2008 and C13* cells. Moreover, Bak1 was a direct target of miR-125b, and down-regulation of Bak1 suppressed cisplatin-induced apoptosis and led to an increased resistance to cisplatin. Our study indicates that miR-125b has a significantly promoting effect on chemoresistance of C13* cells and up-regulation of miR-125b expression contributes to cisplatin resistance through suppression of Bak1 expression. This finding has important implications in the development of targeted therapeutics for overcoming cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer.",cell_line_tumor,0.4,2,5850.376,4981.735,5068.186,10394.92,10091.41,10468.16,3243.077

"This study aims to evaluate the incidence of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) in severely obese Asians and to study the impact of weight loss on OSA.

We report the results of routine preoperative Polysomnograms in 350 Asian patients undergoing bariatric surgery in our institute. Polysomnograms were repeated in 75 randomly selected patients with moderate to severe OSA after target weight loss with the laparoscopically placed adjustable gastric band (LAGB).

The prevalence of OSA in obese Asians is high. Moderate OSA was found in 46% of patients and severe OSA was found in 33%. Severe OSA was significantly more in the Chinese (46%) compared to the Malays (29%) or Indians (21%) (P = 0.035). We identified other risk factors for severe OSA (male sex, higher body mass index and the presence of hypertension) but were unable to select identifying parameters for very low (&<%) likelihood of severe OSA such that routine sleep studies prior to bariatric surgery could be omitted. Apnoea Hypoapnoea Index (AHI) showed improvement of 50% at 20 kg excess weight loss with the cure of OSA in preoperatively severe cases (P &<.005). Mild to moderate cases reported similar improvements although a direct correlation could not be established. Desaturation events, apnoea episodes, work of breathing and subjective assessment of sleepiness scores and quality of life (QOL) showed improving trends, albeit not statistically significant. Similar improvements were seen in sleep architecture with increased rapid eye movement (REM) and stage 3 sleep.

The incidence of OSA in Asians undergoing bariatric surgery is high. Routine sleep studies in Asian patients are justified.

The respiratory cycle is first pre-processed, in order to normalize its spectral information, and its spectrogram is then computed. After this procedure, the spectrogram image is processed by a two-dimensional convolution filter and a half-threshold in order to increase the contrast and isolate its highest amplitude components, respectively. Thus, in order to generate more compressed data to automatic recognition, the spectral projection from the processed spectrogram is computed and stored as an array. The higher magnitude values of the array and its respective spectral values are then located and used as inputs to a multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network, which results an automatic indication about the presence of wheezes. For validation of the methodology, lung sounds recorded from three different repositories were used. The results show that the proposed technique achieves 84.82% accuracy in the detection of wheezing for an isolated respiratory cycle and 92.86% accuracy for the detection of wheezes when detection is carried out using groups of respiratory cycles obtained from the same person. Also, the system presents the original recorded sound and the post-processed spectrogram image for the user to draw his own conclusions from the data.",algorithms,0.6,1,4468.034,3677.319,3623.854,7214.2,6682.406,6803.211,1547.65
"While characterizing various splice forms of p120 catenin, we observed what appeared to be a novel posttranslational modification of p120, resulting in a higher molecular weight form that was dependent on the splicing pattern. Further investigation revealed the higher molecular weight form to be a fusion protein between sequences encoded by the retroviral vector and p120. We found that the publicly available sequence of the vector we used does not agree with the experimental sequence. We caution other investigators to be aware of this potential artifact.",molecular_sequence_data,0,6,4575.396,2857.398,2794.931,8061.499,5533.873,5742.408,1851.967
"Low-power laser therapy has become popular in clinical applications including promoting wound healing and pain relief. However, effects of this photoradiation on human hepatoma cells are rarely studied. Previously, we found 808 nm gallium aluminum arsenide (GaAlAs) continuous wave laser had an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human hepatoma cell lines HepG2 and J-5 at the energy density of 5.85 and 11.7 J/cm(2), respectively. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible mechanism of action of this photoradiation on HepG2 and J-5 cells. HepG2 and J-5 cells were cultured in 24-well plates for 24 h. After photoradiation by 130 mW 808 nm GaAlAs continuous wave laser for different time intervals (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 s), Western blot and immunofluorescent staining were used to examine the expression and distribution of histone and cytoskeletal proteins. The cell counts as well as histone and synemin expression of HepG2 and J-5 cells were reduced by photoradiation at the energy density of 5.85 and 11.7 J/cm(2), respectively. Furthermore, the architecture of cytoskeletons and the distribution of intermediate filament-associated proteins (plectin and synemin) were disorganized by photoradiation. Photoradiation by 808 nm GaAlAs continuous wave laser at the energy density of 5.85 and 7.8 J/cm(2) inhibited the survival of human hepatoma cell lines. The mechanism might reduce synthesis of histone and synemin. Reduced histone synthesis might further reduce the proliferation rate of these cells. Reduced synemin synthesis might result in the destruction of the cytoskeleton. Therefore, the net effects by this photoradiation were reduced cell survival.",cell_line_tumor,0.2,2,9474.953,8011.13,8094.568,16088.23,16402.23,16781.75,4707.727

"Gynecomastia, or persistent enlargement of the male breast, is a common occurrence during early sexual development. Typically, two types of tissue can be identified during this period of growth. Initially, a dense fibrous growth of supporting stroma and breast tissue forms directly under the areola, creating a prominent mass effect. A supporting fibrofatty stroma variably develops around the periphery of the breast, particularly as the body mass index of the patient increases. Treatment is directed at both of these tissue types and includes liposuction contouring along with direct excision of the fibrous subareolar tissue.

"An evaluation index that can quantitatively assess the severity of chest wall deformities is essential to prepare and assess corrective surgical operations for patients with these deformities, including funnel chest patients. In previous studies, our group proposed several automatically calculated indices that represent the severity of depression and asymmetry in the chest wall. These indices showed sufficient performance in most cases of deformities, including those involving asymmetric and symmetric depression; however, their linearity declined when assessing complex deformities. The purpose of this study is to propose two automated indices that provide linear evaluation output for all types of chest wall deformities, including complex deformities, and to evaluate their performance and clinical feasibility. Six reference chest wall boundary curves were obtained from 60 computed tomography (CT) images of a normal chest. Next, an active contour model-based image processing technique was used to extract boundary curves from images of patients with real chest wall deformities. Third, the required parameters were extracted from the boundary curves and the targeted indices were calculated. Finally, the performance of the proposed indices was evaluated using 33 synthetic images and 60 real chest CT images of patients with chest wall deformities. The newly proposed indices can be automatically calculated from the original CT images and showed sufficient performance for all types of chest wall deformities. We believe that the newly proposed indices can facilitate pre- and postoperative evaluation of chest wall deformities in clinical practice.",algorithms,0.2,8,7722.302,6326.035,6297.891,17509.46,16037.56,16125.57,2010.993
"Population projections of the aging global society and its fiscal and social impact have depended on assumptions regarding the human life span. Until now, the assumption that the maximum human life span is fixed has been justified. Recent advances in cell biology, genetics, and our understanding of the cellular processes that underlie aging, however, have shown that this assumption is invalid in a number of animal models and suggest that this assumption may become invalid for humans as well. In vitro alteration of telomeres affects cellular senescence, and in vivo manipulation of genes and diet can increase maximum life span in animal models if these discoveries are extended to humans. We may soon be able to extend the maximum human life span and postpone or prevent the onset of diseases associated with aging. Such a possibility requires that we recognize a growing uncertainty in any attempt to project international health care costs into the next few decades. The costs may be significantly lower than projections, if life span increases and age-related disabilities are postponed or less severe, or perhaps higher, if life span increases without altering the onset and severity of disability. An appropriate uncertainty regarding the human life span undermines any attempt to accurately predict health costs in the next century.",neoplasms,0.2,4,4697.467,2425.22,2462.312,8022.781,6245.908,6305.414,2971.073
"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is released from vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC), after percutaneous coronary intervention and is related with neointimal proliferation and restenosis. Adrenal steroid dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), the sulfated prohormone of dehydroepiandrosterone has shown remarkable biological activity against proliferation of VSMC in some animal and clinical studies. Combinations of DHEAS with other agents have also shown promising results, with acquiring more efficient effect. Berberine is a naturally occurring isoquinoline alkaloid. To investigate their effects in combination, a VSMC cell line A7r5 was stimulated by PDGF-BB (dimer of the B chain of PDGF), and then treated with berberine and/or DHEAS in the current study. Cell proliferation assay, cell cycle assay, Western blot, and co-immunoprecipitation were analyzed in A7r5 cells. Antiproliferative effects of berberine and/or DHEAS targeting the Skp2/p27 pathways were evaluated. Berberine and DHEAS can both inhibit the growth of A7r5 cells. Berberine induces cell cycle arrest and potentiates the inhibitory effect of DHEAS through disrupting the binding of p27, p21 with Skp2. Berberine and DHEAS decreased the expression of CDK2, CDK4, PCNA, cyclin D1, and cyclin E, which was induced by PDGF-BB. Being treated with berberine and DHEAS also promoted p27 and p21 bind to CDK2, so the proliferation of A7r5 cells induced by PDGF-BB was inhibited. The data provide evidence that berberine acts through the inhibition of p27-Skp2 and p21-Skp2 with subsequent activation of the cell cycle arrest, which leads to the increase in sensitivity to DHEAS. In summary, the findings suggest that combined berberine and DHEAS will be active in the prevention of restenosis after angioplasty treatment, and the treatment of atherosclerosis.",signal_transduction,0,10,9067.474,9050.058,9186.336,14385.04,15488.5,15770.93,4957.74

"MicroRNA (miR)-203 is known to be downregulated and to act as an anti-oncomir in melanoma cells. At present, we found that exogenous miR-203 increased pigmentation and protein expression levels of the melanoma antigen recognized by T cells (Melan-As/MART1s) and/or tyrosinase (TYR) in the human melanoma cells tested. Inversely, treatment with an inhibitor of miR-203 downregulated the expression level of TYR. The target gene of miR-203 involved in the mechanism was kinesin superfamily protein 5b (kif5b), which was revealed by gene silencing using short interfering RNA and luciferase activity assay. Furthermore, immunocytochemistry showed obvious accumulation of melanosomes around nuclei of human melanoma Mewo cells transfected with miR-203 or siR-kif5b. Importantly, treatment with the miR-203 inhibitor, but not miR-203, exhibited effects on human epidermal melanocytes isolated from lightly pigmented adult skin similar to those on melanoma cells.

First, multiple Fn-binding integrins can support matrix assembly; their activation state controls fibrillogenesis. Second, Fn binding to cells expressing an activated integrin is necessary but not sufficient for matrix assembly. Additional ""postoccupancy"" events involving the integrin beta, but not the alpha subunit, cytoplasmic domain are needed. Third, these postoccupancy events require an intact actin cytoskeleton.

"The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of automated nodal quantification in a phantom. MDCT of a phantom with 17 synthetic lymph nodes of different sizes (diameter 6.0-30.0 mm) was performed at varying tube currents, reconstruction kernels and slice thicknesses. RECIST diameter and volume were measured using an automated software tool. Results were compared with the reference diameter and volume by calculating the absolute percentage error (APE). Degree of agreement between software and reference measurements was evaluated by computing corresponding concordance correlation coefficients (CCC). Under varying tube currents the mean APE (CCC) varied between 5.18% and 10.12% (0.95-0.99) for RECIST diameter and between 7.22% and 16.21% (0.94-1.00) for the volume.

"Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is a widespread environmental genotoxic carcinogen that damages DNA by forming adducts. This damage along with activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) induces complex transcriptional responses in cells. To investigate whether human cells are more susceptible to BaP in a particular phase of the cell cycle, synchronised breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells were exposed to BaP. Cell cycle progression was analysed by flow cytometry, DNA adduct formation was assessed by 32P-postlabeling analysis, microarrays of 44K human genome-wide oligos and RT-PCR were used to detect gene expression (mRNA) changes and Western blotting was performed to determine the expression of some proteins, including cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1 and CYP1B1, which are involved in BaP metabolism.

Following BaP exposure, cells evaded G1 arrest and accumulated in S-phase. Higher levels of DNA damage occurred in S- and G2/M- compared with G0/G1-enriched cultures. Genes that were found to have altered expression included those involved in xenobiotic metabolism, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation and DNA repair. Gene ontology and pathway analysis showed the involvement of various signalling pathways in response to BaP exposure, such as the Catenin/Wnt pathway in G1, the ERK pathway in G1 and S, the Nrf2 pathway in S and G2/M and the Akt pathway in G2/M. An important finding was that higher levels of DNA damage in S- and G2/M-enriched cultures correlated with higher levels of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNA and proteins. Moreover, exposure of synchronised MCF-7 cells to BaP-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE), the ultimate carcinogenic metabolite of BaP, did not result in significant changes in DNA adduct levels at different phases of the cell cycle.

This study characterised the complex gene response to BaP in MCF-7 cells and revealed a strong correlation between the varying efficiency of BaP metabolism and DNA damage in different phases of the cell cycle.

"Obese patients have many physical limitations and much psychiatric burden to overcome. Several studies have shown that the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in the obese is similar to those with normal weight. However, in obese patients seeking treatment there is an increased prevalence (40-60%) of psychiatric morbidity, most commonly depression. It is difficult to separate the effects of depression on obesity and, on the contrary, the neuroendocrine changes associated with stress and depression may cause metabolic changes that predispose and perpetuate obesity. The stigma associated with obesity causes bullying in school as well as childhood psychiatric morbidity. Prejudice is not limited to the general public but exists among health professionals too. This chapter discusses the treatment of depression in obesity and the psychiatric evaluation of the pre-bariatric surgery patient. Education of society, starting with schools and including healthcare professionals will reduce bias and stigma as well as assist this vulnerable group of patients to seek help for their obesity and the many problems that come with it.

"Stimuli-responsive hydrogels have attracted considerable interest in the field of microfluidics due to their ability to transform electrical energy directly into mechanical work through swelling, bending, and other deformations. In particular, electroactive hydrogels hold great promise for biomedical micropumping applications such as implantable drug delivery systems. In such applications, energy consumption rate and durability are key properties. Here, we developed a valveless micropump system that utilizes a hydrogel as the main actuator, and tested its performance over 6 months of continuous operation. The proposed micropump system, powered by a single 1.5 V commercial battery, expended very little energy (less than 750 Î¼Ws per stroke) while pumping 0.9 wt% saline solution under a low voltage (less than 1 V), and remained fully functional after 6 months. CFD simulations were conducted to improve the microchannel geometry so as to minimize the backflow caused by the valveless mechanism of the system. Based on the simulation results, an asymmetric geometry and a stop post were introduced to enhance the pumping performance. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system as a drug delivery pump, an anti-cancer drug (adriamycin) was perfused to human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) using the pump.

"A human receptor for the cytotoxic ligand TRAIL (TRAIL receptor-1, designated DR4) was identified recently as a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family. In this report we describe the identification of two additional human TRAIL receptors, TRAIL receptor-2 and TRAIL receptor-3, that belong to the tumor necrosis factor receptor family. Interestingly, TRAIL receptor-2 but not TRAIL receptor-3 contains a cytoplasmic ""death domain"" necessary for induction of apoptosis and is hence designated death receptor-5 (DR5). Like DR4, DR5 engages the apoptotic pathway independent of the adaptor molecule FADD/MORT1. Because of its lack of a death domain, TRAIL receptor-3 is not capable of inducing apoptosis. However, by competing for TRAIL, it is capable of inhibiting TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Thus, TRAIL receptor-3 may function as an antagonistic decoy receptor to attenuate the cytotoxic effect of TRAIL in most tissues that are TRAIL+, DR4+, and DR5+.",molecular_sequence_data,0,3,11667.64,9568.18,9470.571,15801.51,15249.1,15576.05,6214.098
"A method is described for the rapid comparison of protein binding sites using geometric matching to detect similar three-dimensional structure. The geometric matching detects common atomic features through identification of the maximum common sub-graph or clique. These features are not necessarily evident from sequence or from global structural similarity giving additional insight into molecular recognition not evident from current sequence or structural classification schemes. Here we use the method to produce an all-against-all comparison of phosphate binding sites in a number of different nucleotide phosphate-binding proteins. The similarity search is combined with clustering of similar sites to allow a preliminary structural classification. Clustering by site similarity produces a classification of binding sites for the 476 representative local environments producing ten main clusters representing half of the representative environments. The similarities make sense in terms of both structural and functional classification schemes. The ten main clusters represent a very limited number of unique structural binding motifs for phosphate. These are the structural P-loop, di-nucleotide binding motif [FAD/NAD(P)-binding and Rossman-like fold] and FAD-binding motif.

"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl groups from the tails of lysine residues of histone protein in nuclear chromatin and also from acetylated sites in non-histone proteins. HDACs and histone acetyltransferases (HATs) are major influences on the level of cellular protein acetylation, and an imbalance in acetylation levels, particularly under-acetylated (hypoacetylated) histone protein has been associated with precancerous or malignant states. Consequently, small molecule inhibitors of HDACs have been synthesised and some now form a newly emerging class of anti-cancer agents that can regulate transcription and inhibit proliferation of cancer cells by inducing cell cycle arrest, differentiation and/or apoptosis, among other major biological phenomena. The different mechanism(s) of action of HDAC inhibitors compared to conventional anti-neoplastic agents provides a possibility that HDAC inhibitors may be effective for refractory cancers.

"Pituitary metastases are found in about 1% of all pituitary resections. They often derive from breast, lung, and gastroenteric tract adenocarcinomas, very rarely from thyroid carcinoma. Presenting symptoms of thyroid carcinoma metastatic to the pituitary gland are usually chiasmatic with central neurological impairment due to space-occupying expansion in the parasellar region. Hypopituitarism is more often associated with papillary and medullary rather than follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). Here we describe a patient with pituitary metastasis from FTC who had hypopituitarism with thyrotropin (TSH) deficiency.

A 61-year-old woman, who presented with visual deficits and pain to the right orbit, was found on magnetic resonance imaging to have a large mass involving the pituitary gland. She was found to have pituitary insufficiency based on corticotropin-releasing hormone and TSH-releasing hormone testing. Transnasopharyngeal biopsy of the mass revealed metastases from FTC. After total thyroidectomy, which confirmed widely invasive FTC, the patient underwent external beam radiation therapy of the metastases for progressive neurological symptoms and an increase in orbit pain. Since endogenous TSH production was insufficient, we used recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) as preparation for a series of radioiodine treatments. rhTSH administration, followed by 7.4 GBq of (131)I, was repeated seven times over a 10-year period. This was associated with a marked decrease in serum thyroglobulin levels accompanied by substantial clinical improvement, but after 7 years disease progression occurred.

Seven patients with pituitary metastases from FTC have been reported. In all cases, some neurological signs and symptoms related to mass effect were reported, but no pituitary insufficiency was described. This may be the first case of FTC with metastases to the pituitary causing hypopituitarism.

"Five strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were isolated from five layer flocks that had nephropathogenic infection in four provinces in China. Among them, three of the five flocks had been vaccinated against infectious bronchitis. Virulence studies indicated that the five Chinese IBV isolates caused 10 to 30% mortality in 15-day-old specific pathogen free chickens and gross lesions were mainly confined to the kidneys in all of the dead chickens. Two oligonucleotide pairs, S1Uni2 and S1Oligo3' or S1Oligo5' and S1Oligo3', were used after propagation of the isolates in embryonated eggs to amplify the S1 protein genes of the spike protein. The cDNA derived by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was cloned and sequenced. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence of S1 protein gene had a similar degree of identity (> or =92%) among the five Chinese IBV isolates. The nucleotide and amino acid identity of the S1 protein gene between the five Chinese IBV isolates and 16 strains of other IBVs varied from 60 to 81%. This clearly showed that the five Chinese IBV isolates comprised a separate genotype.

"Advanced-stage cancers are extremely difficult to treat and rarely result in a cure. The application of oncolytic viruses is a potential strategy for controlling advanced-stage cancer because intratumoral (i.t.) injection of an oncolytic virus, such as vaccinia virus, results in tumor cell lysis and subsequent release of tumor antigens into the microenvironment. Furthermore, the viruses can serve as a vehicle for delivering genes of interest to cancer cells.

In the current study, we hypothesize that in tumor-bearing mice primed with DNA encoding an immunogenic foreign antigen, ovalbumin (OVA) followed by a boost with i.t. administration of vaccinia virus encoding the same foreign antigen, OVA, can generate enhanced antitumor effects through the combination of viral oncolysis and tumor-specific immunity.

We observed that tumor-bearing mice primed with OVA DNA and boosted with vaccinia encoding OVA (Vac-OVA) generated significant therapeutic antitumor effects as well as induced significant levels of OVA-specific CD8+ T cells in two different tumor models. Furthermore, treatment with Vac-OVA not only kills the tumor and stromal cells directly but also renders the tumor cells and surrounding stromal cells susceptible to OVA-specific CD8+ T-cell killing, resulting in enhanced antitumor therapeutic effects.

Thus, the current study may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the control of advanced-stage cancers.",cell_line_tumor,0.8,3,9274.97,7598.483,7584.308,15486.03,15385.73,15471.83,4271.184
"Death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) is a tumor suppressor and negatively regulates several activation signals. Consistent with its potential anti-inflammatory activity, DAPK promotes the formation of IFN-Î³-activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) complex that suppresses the translation of selected inflammatory genes. DAPK has been found to inhibit tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±)- or lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced NF-ÎºB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Inflammation is always associated with T cell activation, while DAPK attenuates T cell activation by a selective suppression in T cell receptor-triggered NF-ÎºB activation. Recent studies, however, also reveal a contribution of DAPK to pro-inflammatory processes. DAPK is shown to mediate pro-inflammatory signaling downstream of TNF-Î±, LPS, IL-17, or IL-32. In addition, DAPK is required for the full formation of NLRP3 inflammasome, essential for the generation of IL-1Î² and IL-18.

"To evaluate different cut-off temperature levels for a threshold-based prediction of the coagulation zone in magnetic resonance (MR)-guided radiofrequency (RF) ablation of liver tumours.

Temperature-sensitive measurements were acquired during RF ablation of 24 patients with primary (6) and secondary liver lesions (18) using a wide-bore 1.5 T MR sytem and compared with the post-interventional coagulation zone. Temperature measurements using the proton resonance frequency shift method were performed directly subsequent to energy application. The temperature maps were registered on the contrast-enhanced follow-up MR images acquired 4 weeks after treatment. Areas with temperatures above 50Â°, 55Â° and 60Â°C were segmented and compared with the coagulation zones. Sensitivity and positive predictive value were calculated.

No major complications occurred and all tumours were completely treated. No tumour recurrence was observed at the follow-up examination after 4 weeks. Two patients with secondary liver lesions showed local tumour recurrence after 4 and 7 months. The 60Â°C threshold level achieved the highest positive predictive value (87.7âÂ±â9.9) and the best prediction of the coagulation zone.

"We have undertaken a functional analysis of the odorant receptor repertoire in the Drosophila antenna. Each receptor was expressed in a mutant olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) used as a ""decoder,"" and the odor response spectrum conferred by the receptor was determined in vivo by electrophysiological recordings. The spectra of these receptors were then matched to those of defined ORNs to establish a receptor-to-neuron map. In addition to the odor response spectrum, the receptors dictate the signaling mode, i.e., excitation or inhibition, and the response dynamics of the neuron. An individual receptor can mediate both excitatory and inhibitory responses to different odorants in the same cell, suggesting a model of odorant receptor transduction.

"Pancreatic cancer (PaCa) is one of the most aggressive, apoptosis-resistant and currently incurable cancers with a poor survival rate. Eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase (eEF-2K) is an atypical kinase, whose role in PaCa survival is not yet known. Here, we show that eEF-2K is overexpressed in PaCa cells and its down-regulation induces apoptotic cell death. Rottlerin (ROT), a polyphenolic compound initially identified as a PKC-Î´ inhibitor, induces apoptosis and autophagy in a variety of cancer cells including PaCa cells. We demonstrated that ROT induces intrinsic apoptosis, with dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential (ÎÎ¨m), and stimulates extrinsic apoptosis with concomitant induction of TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors, DR4 and DR5, with caspase-8 activation, in PANC-1 and MIAPaCa-2 cells. Notably, while none of these effects were dependent on PKC-Î´ inhibition, ROT down-regulates eEF-2K at mRNA level, and induce eEF-2K protein degradation through ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Down-regulation of eEF-2K recapitulates the events observed after ROT treatment, while its over-expression suppressed the ROT-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, eEF-2K regulates the expression of tissue transglutaminase (TG2), an enzyme previously implicated in proliferation, drug resistance and survival of cancer cells. Inhibition of eEF-2K/TG2 axis leads to caspase-independent apoptosis which is associated with induction of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Collectively, these results indicate, for the first time, that the down-regulation of eEF-2K leads to induction of intrinsic, extrinsic as well as AIF-dependent apoptosis in PaCa cells, suggesting that eEF-2K may represent an attractive therapeutic target for the future anticancer agents in PaCa.",cell_line_tumor,0,7,13730.88,11597.62,11395.83,17419.99,16667.83,16446.28,7377.476

Despite similar infarct sizes (50% Â± 4% for WT and 49% Â± 2% for KKAy, P=not significant), the 7d post-MI survival was 70% (n=7/10) in WT mice and 45% (n=10/22) in KKAy mice (P&<05). Plasma glucose levels were 1.4-fold increased in KKAy mice at baseline compared to WT (P&<05). Glucose levels did not change in WT mice but decreased 38% in KKAy post-MI (P&<05). End-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions post-MI were smaller and fractional shortening improved in the KKAy (5% Â± 1% in WT and 10% Â± 2% in KKAy, P&<05 for all). The improved cardiac function in KKAy was accompanied by reduced macrophage numbers and collagen I and III levels (both P&<05).

"DNA methylation is important in cancer development and is a promising biomarker for cancer detection. An epigenomic approach used in our previous work showed that LMX-1A is methylation-silenced in cervical cancer. LMX-1A, a LIM-homeobox gene, is known to participate in developmental events; however, there are at present no data on the role of LMX-1A in cancers. In this study, we characterized the function of this transcription factor by examining cell lines, animal models and human cervical neoplastic tissues, and found that over-expression of LMX-1A does not affect cell proliferation or the cell cycle of cervical cancer cell lines but significantly inhibits colony formation and invasion in vitro. Analysis of changes in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, such as CDH1, CDH2, VIMENTIN, SNAIL, SLUG and TWIST, revealed involvement of the EMT in LMX-1A-mediated cancer invasion; this result was validated in a stable transfectant over-expressing LMX-1A with RNA interference. Xenograft studies using immunocompromised mice confirmed the suppressor effects of LMX-1A on tumour formation and distant metastasis in cervical cancer cell lines. LMX-1A immunohistochemical staining of tissue arrays containing the full spectrum of cervical neoplasms, including normal cervix, low-grade cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN), high-grade CIN, locally invasive and distant metastatic cancers, demonstrated the critical role of LMX-1A in invasion and metastasis.

"Diabetes is a multi-organ disease and diabetic cardiomyopathy can result in heart failure, which is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. In the liver, insulin resistance contributes to hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia, which further worsens the metabolic profile. Defects in mTOR signalling are believed to contribute to metabolic dysfunctions in diabetic liver and hearts, but evidence is missing that mTOR activation is causal to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. This study shows that specific mTORC1 inhibition by PRAS40 prevents the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. This phenotype was associated with improved metabolic function, blunted hypertrophic growth and preserved cardiac function. In addition PRAS40 treatment improves hepatic insulin sensitivity and reduces systemic hyperglycaemia in obese mice.

"Many kinds of natural sphingolipids and their analogs stimulate or inhibit a wide assortment of biochemical phenomena and enzymes. The puzzle considered here is: how can these lipids control so many different kinds of processes? In almost every study in which a structural comparison was made, an allylic alcohol moiety [-CH=CH-CH(OH)-] was found to be an essential feature of the sphingolipid. Many of those stimulations lead to cell death, emphasizing the importance of allylic sphingolipid structure in the design of chemotherapeutic agents. The proposal offered here is that these lipids function as coenzymes, in which the allylic moiety acts as an anion transferring agent, forming transient phosphate or acyl or peptidyl esters for the synthesis or hydrolysis of phosphoproteins, proteins, and phospholipids. Sphingolipids that inhibit these reactions may simply displace the active sphingolipids from their sites in the enzymes' active regions, or bind to the enzymes' allosteric region. This kind of competition could act as a major homeostatic control mechanism. Some of the allylic sphingolipids also generate reactive oxygen, possibly by oxidation of the allylic alcohol group. This explains the need to control redox-controlling metabolites in sphingolipid-controlled processes (e.g., glutathione). Many anticancer drugs that produce apoptosis in tumors possess an allylic alcohol residue, affect protein phosphorylation, and produce reactive oxygen species. They may be therapeutically useful because they control the action of sphingolipids as anion transfer agonists or inhibitors.",neoplasms,0.2,7,7068.117,5533.569,5446.672,10799.73,10142.32,10361.0,4663.251

This indicates that the new century will have one of most epidemic progressions of cardiovascular, cancer and inflammatory diseases. The high challenge for medical research is to compress such morbidity. In these conditions, invertebrates have demonstrated to be truly useful models in drug discovery for such ageing diseases. The last decade, drug discovery in leeches has opened the gate of new molecules to treat emphysema, coagulation, inflammation, dermitis and cancer. Also other invertebrates such as insects, which evolved from the annelids, harvest potential interesting molecules, such as serine protease inhibitors that can be exploited by the medical industry.",molecular_sequence_data,0.2,5,5119.014,3622.24,3851.126,10026.94,8882.589,9270.217,3625.423
"Experimental approaches for identifying new anthelmintics include target-based and whole-worm screening methods. The former involves basic research into characterising and validating new targets, mostly proteins, followed by identification of inhibitors or agonists through the use of target-based screening assays and/or in silico drug design. The latter experimental approach uses whole-worm assays to identify anthelmintic agents with unknown modes of action, or where the primary interest lies in whether analogues are able to kill (or disable) worms rather than in measuring their direct impact on their likely target. This paper focuses initially on the intestine and external layers of nematodes as potential drug targets. Specific anthelmintic agents targeting either tissue are discussed to illustrate the impact of disruption to these structures. In both cases, the activity of these agents against insects was known, and activity against nematodes was identified using whole worm screening assays. Recent literature identifying ecdysone signalling pathway receptors in nematodes is then used to provide an example of basic research into a specific target that may lead to the development of high-throughput target-based drug screening assays. Finally, the role of whole-worm screening approaches versus target-based screening is discussed briefly.",signal_transduction,0.2,5,8016.937,6122.844,5885.28,14305.15,13632.71,13635.27,3669.452
"Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death in the majority of developed, as well as in many developing countries. The aim of this study was to determine cardiovascular risk factors in student population and to suggest possible measures for prevention.

The study was carried out during 2007-2008 at the School of Medicine, University of Nis. It included 824 students in their final year (220 males, 604 females).

There was no significant difference in prevalence of hypertension among the male (1.81%) and female students (0%). The prevalence of obesity (Body Mass Index - BMI&> 30 kg/m2) was significantly higher (p &<0.001) in the male (7.27%) than in the female population (1.32%). Abdominal obesity was also more frequently encountered (p &<0.01) in the male (9.09%) than in female population (1.32%). Every fourth student smoked cigarettes with no significant difference between the male and female students. Alcohol consumption was a significantly higher problem (p &<0.001) in the male population (18.18%) than in the female one (2.65%). Physical inactivity was more often found (p &<0.001) in the female students (65.56%), than in male ones (36.36%). By the bivariate correlation of cardiovascular risk factors, it was determined that in the male student population systolic blood pressure correlated significantly with diastolic blood pressure, BMI and waist size, whereas age correlated with sistolic blood pressure, waist size and smoking. In the female students sistolic blood pressure correlated with diastolic blood pressure, BMI and waist size; diastolic blood pressure correlated with BMI and physical inactivity; cigarette smoking correlated with alcohol consumption and age.

Our objective was to investigate the direct effects of MTT on in vitro SH-SY5Y cells. Results showed that the endocytosis of MTT did not cause obvious lesion and induce cell death, but the metabolism and exocytosis of MTT could dramatically damage cells. Our results also indicated that MTT could activate apoptosis related factors such as caspase-8, caspase-3 or accelerate the leakage of cell contents after the appearance of MTT formazan crystals.

"Human arylacetamide deacetylase (AADAC) can hydrolyze clinical drugs such as flutamide, phenacetin, and rifamycins. AADAC is a glycoprotein, but the role of glycosylation remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effect of glycosylation on AADAC enzyme activity. Immunoblot analysis of mutant AADACs that contained an asparagine (N, Asn) to glutamine (Q, Gln) substitution at either residue 78 or 282 (N78Q or N282Q) showed a different migration compared with the wild-type protein. A mutant AADAC that contained N to Q substitutions at both residue 78 and 282 (N78Q/N282Q) showed a similar migration to AADAC in human liver microsomes (HLM) treated with endoglycosidase H (Endo H), which produces deglycosylated proteins. This result indicated that AADAC was glycosylated at both N78 and N282. Mutant types of AADAC with the N282Q and the N78Q/N282Q substitutions showed dramatically lower phenacetin hydrolase activity than did the wild-type protein. The treatment of wild-type AADAC-expressing HuH-7 cells with tunicamycin, which produces unglycosylated protein, decreased AADAC enzyme activity. However, the treatment of the HLM with Endo H caused no decrease of AADAC activity. Thus, the oligosaccharide chain, per se, was not important for AADAC activity in the mature form. The mutant types of AADAC containing the N282Q and the N78Q/N282Q substitutions were not detected by immunoblotting analysis after non-reducing SDS-PAGE, suggesting that the glycosylation of AADAC at N282 was important for proper protein folding. Overall, this study found that the translational, but not post-translational, N-glycosylation of AADAC plays a crucial role in regulating AADAC enzyme activity.",molecular_sequence_data,0.2,10,9709.232,9266.921,9334.534,15636.27,15865.43,16023.64,5815.087
"The proteins kinases SNF1/AMPK/SnRK1 are a subfamily of serine/threonine kinases that act as metabolite sensors to constantly adapt metabolism to the supply of, and demand for, energy. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the SNF1 complex is a central component of the regulatory response to glucose starvation. AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) the mammalian homologue of SNF1, plays a central role in the regulation of energy homeostasis at the cellular as well as the whole-body levels. In Arabidopsis thaliana, SnRK1.1 and SnRK1.2 have recently been described as central integrators of a transcription network for stress and energy signalling. In this study, biochemical analysis established SnRK1.1 as the major SnRK1 isoform both in isolated cells and leaves. In order to elucidate the function of SnRK1.1 in Arabidopsis thaliana, transgenic plants over-expressing SnRK1.1 were produced. Genetic, biochemical, physiological and molecular analyses of these plants revealed that SnRK1.1 is implicated in sugar and ABA signalling pathways. Modifications of the starch and soluble sugar content were observed in the 35S:SnRK1.1 transgenic lines.

"KrÃ¼ppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), a zinc finger-containing transcriptional factor, is a pivotal regulator of cellular fate. KLF4 has attracted considerable attention for its opposing effect in carcinogenesis as tumor suppressor (e.g. colorectal cancer) or oncoprotein (e.g. breast cancer), depending on tissue context, with the underlying mechanism remaining largely unknown. Here we report that KLF4 mediates estrogen signaling in breast cancer formation. Accumulation of KLF4 by inhibiting its turnover triggers estrogen-induced transactivation. We identified Von Hippel-Lindau, pVHL, as the protein that governs KLF4 turnover in breast cancer cells and demonstrated that estrogen-induced down-regulation of pVHL facilitates accumulation of KLF4. We provide mechanistic insights into KLF4 steady-state degradation as well as its elevation in the presence of estrogen and show that elevated levels of pVHL or depletion of KLF4 attenuates the estrogen-induced transactivation and cell growth. Finally, immunohistochemical staining revealed reduced concentration of pVHL and accumulation of KLF4 in breast cancer tissues. We thus propose that suppression of pVHL in response to estrogen signaling results in elevation of KLF4, which mediates estrogen-induced mitogenic effect.",cell_line_tumor,0,8,13986.93,11050.63,11009.62,23319.7,26893.62,26772.65,6538.484

Resident cells of the injured tissue communicate with circulating effector cells by cytokines and direct cell-cell contact. These cytokines stimulate expression of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E- and P-selectin on endothelial cell surfaces and upregulate beta 2-integrins and ICAM-1 on luminal leukocytes. White blood cells then adhere to the activated endothelial cells, migrate through the vessel wall, and penetrate areas of infection or tissue damage.

"Identification of low-income women with the rare but serious risk of hereditary cancer and their referral to appropriate services presents an important public health challenge. We report the results of formative research to reach thousands of women for efficient identification of those at high risk and expedient access to free genetic services. External validity is maximized by emphasizing intervention fit with the two end-user organizations who must connect to make this possible. This study phase informed the design of a subsequent randomized controlled trial.

We conducted a randomized controlled pilot study (n = 38) to compare two intervention models for feasibility and impact. The main outcome was receipt of genetic counseling during a two-month intervention period. Model 1 was based on the usual outcall protocol of an academic hospital genetic risk program, and Model 2 drew on the screening and referral procedures of a statewide toll-free phone line through which large numbers of high-risk women can be identified. In Model 1, the risk program proactively calls patients to schedule genetic counseling; for Model 2, women are notified of their eligibility for counseling and make the call themselves. We also developed and pretested a family history screener for administration by phone to identify women appropriate for genetic counseling.

There was no statistically significant difference in receipt of genetic counseling between women randomized to Model 1 (3/18) compared with Model 2 (3/20) during the intervention period. However, when unresponsive women in Model 2 were called after 2 months, 7 more obtained counseling; 4 women from Model 1 were also counseled after the intervention. Thus, the intervention model that closely aligned with the risk program's outcall to high-risk women was found to be feasible and brought more low-income women to free genetic counseling. Our screener was easy to administer by phone and appeared to identify high-risk callers effectively. The model and screener are now in use in the main trial to test the effectiveness of this screening and referral intervention. A validation analysis of the screener is also underway.

Regular monitoring to ensure that these standards are being met and that schools are improving healthy eating is essential to their success. Of no lesser importance are assessments to determine whether changes to school meals are having an impact on the diets of school children. It is early days in terms of evaluation because food-based standards have only recently been introduced and nutrient-based standards are in the process of being developed and implemented. Studies in England provide some evidence that the re-introduction of standards for school food is having a positive impact on both pupil's food choices and the nutritional profile of school lunches.

LAMB was administered until intolerance or maximum efficacy at dosages individually determined by the responsible physician.

Fifty-nine courses were post-HSCT (42%, 49 allogeneic), and 92 courses were started during granulocytopenia (65%). The median duration of LAMB therapy was 13 days (range 1-79), and the median maximum dosage was 2.8 mg/kg (range 0.93-5.10). Mild-to-moderate adverse events were noted during 109 courses (77%; hepatic, 58.8%; electrolyte wasting, 52.5%; renal, 31.9%; infusion-related reactions, 8.5%); adverse events necessitating discontinuation of LAMB occurred in 6 courses (4.3%; renal, 3; anaphylaxis, 2; hepatic, 1).

Sequence analysis revealed that M.HpyI was closely related to CATG-recognizing adenine DNA methyltransferases, including M.NlaIII in N. lactamica. hpyIM was present in all H. pylori strains tested. DNA from wild-type H. pylori strains was resistant to digestion by SphI and NlaIII, which recognize DNA at sites containing CATG, whereas their isogenic hpyIM mutants were susceptible, indicating lack of modification. Overexpression of hpyIM in Escherichia coli rendered DNA from these cells resistant to NlaIII digestion, confirming the role of hpyIM in modifying CATG sites.

"Recent clinical studies revealed that positive results of cell transplantation on cardiac function are limited to the short- and mid-term restoration phase following myocardial infarction (MI), emphasizing the need for long-term follow-up. These transient effects may depend on the transplanted cell-type or its differentiation state. We have identified a population of cardiomyocyte progenitor cells (CMPCs) capable of differentiating efficiently into beating cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells in vitro. We investigated whether CMPCs or pre-differentiated CMPC-derived cardiomyocytes (CMPC-CM) are able to restore the injured myocardium after MI in mice.

MI was induced in immunodeficient mice and was followed by intra-myocardial injection of CMPCs, CMPC-CM, or vehicle. Cardiac function was measured longitudinally up to 3 months post-MI using 9.4 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging. The fate of the human cells was determined by immunohistochemistry. Transplantation of CMPCs or CMPC-CM resulted in a higher ejection fraction and reduced the extent of left ventricular remodelling up to 3 months after MI when compared with vehicle-injected animals. CMPCs and CMPC-CM generated new cardiac tissue consisting of human cardiomyocytes and blood vessels. Fusion of human nuclei with murine nuclei was not observed.

"Oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) is the eighth most common cancer type worldwide with a dismal 5-year survival. Barrett oesophagus, the replacement of the normal squamous epithelia with glandular cells, is the first step in the pathway towards OAC. Although most patients with OAC present de novo, the presence of the easily detectable OAC precursor lesion, Barrett oesophagus, enables the possibility of early detection of high-risk patients who are more likely to progress. Currently, identification of high-risk patients depends on histopathological assessment of dysplasia with no regards to molecular pathogenesis. In the future, screening and risk stratification initiatives for Barrett oesophagus that incorporate molecular profiles might permit improved early diagnosis and intervention strategies with the possibility of preventing OAC. For the majority of patients presenting de novo at an advanced stage, combining so-called -omics datasets with current clinical staging algorithms might enable OACs to be better classified according to distinct molecular programmes, thereby leading to better targeted treatment strategies as well as cancer monitoring regimes.

"In major depression, prefrontal regulation of limbic brain areas may be a key mechanism that is impaired during the processing of affective information. This prefrontal-limbic interaction has been shown to be modulated by serotonin (5-HTT) genotype, indicating a higher risk for major depressive disorder (MDD) with increasing number of 5-HTT low-expression alleles.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess neural response to uncued unpleasant affective pictures in 21 unmedicated patients with MDD compared to 21 matched healthy controls, taking into account genetic influences of the 5-HTT (SCL6A4) high- and low-expression genotype.

Healthy controls displayed greater prefrontal activation (BA10) to uncued negative pictures compared to patients with MDD. While in healthy controls prefrontal (BA10) activation and BA10-amygdala coupling increased with the number of 5-HTT low-expression risk alleles, this effect was abolished, and even reversed, in patients with MDD. In MDD, connectivity decreased with severity of depressive symptoms (HAMD total score).

These findings suggest that increased medial prefrontal (BA10) activation and BA10-amygdala connectivity may counteract the risk for MDD in healthy carriers of 5-HTT low-expression alleles, while this protective factor might be lost in patients who actually suffer from MDD.

"Genetic, epidemiological and clinical evidence have clearly demonstrated the importance of the human apolipoprotein (apo) A-I/C-III/A-IV gene cluster in lipid metabolism and heart attack. The transcriptional regulation of these genes determines the level of the encoded proteins and therefore influences the concentration of triglycerides and cholesterol. Here, we analyze the existence of transcription control elements in the 6.6 kb apoC-III/A-IV intergenic region and their influence on the expression of both genes. Two main positive common control elements were found to modulate apoC-III and apoA-IV expression in HepG2 and in Caco-2 cells: the previously described apoC-III enhancer, located 0.8 kb upstream from the cap site of the gene, and a newly detected activating region located in the center of the intergenic sequence. The activity of both elements is highly increased by the hepatic and intestinal transcription factor HNF-4. Analysis of a 641 bp fragment containing the central element showed that it has the properties of a tissue-specific enhancer. Liver nuclear proteins interact with seven DNA binding sites present in this enhancer and HNF-4 specifically interacts with one of these sites. A third positive element, situated immediately upstream from the apoA-IV minimal promoter, is also activated by HNF-4; however, this element is not involved in apoC-III expression. In addition, two negative regions were identified, one located near the apoA-IV gene and the other one between the apoC-III enhancer and the newly identified central enhancer. In conclusion, negative and positive control elements are located in the apoC-III/A-IV intergenic region, including two enhancers important for the expression of the two genes. These results add new evidence that common regulatory elements for the expression of the apoA-I, apoC-III and apoA-IV genes are interspersed throughout the cluster.",molecular_sequence_data,0.2,6,5585.979,4867.598,4895.563,9561.23,8421.595,8389.242,2526.479
"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-D and its homolog VEGF-C influence lymphangiogenesis through activation of VEGF receptor 3 (VEGFR-3), and have been implicated in lymphatic tumor spread. Nodal dissemination of gastric adenocarcinomas critically determines clinical outcome and therapeutic options of affected patients. Therefore, we analyzed expression and prognostic significance of VEGF-D along with VEGF-C, and VEGFR-3 in gastric adenocarcinomas.

VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and VEGFR-3 were analyzed in 91 R(0)-resected primary gastric adenocarcinomas, corresponding noncancerous gastric mucosa, and lymph node metastases employing immunohistochemistry and/or in situ hybridization. Blood and lymph vessel densities were assessed after staining with CD31 and LYVE-1-specific antibodies.

VEGF-D and VEGF-C were detected in 67.0% and 50.5% of gastric cancers, respectively. Healthy gastric mucosa was negative for VEGF-C and in 12.5% positive for VEGF-D. Presence of VEGF-D (P = .005) or VEGF-C (P = .006) was correlated with lymphatic metastases and decreased survival (VEGF-D, P < .05; VEGF-C, P < .05). VEGFR-3 was correlated with reduced carcinoma-specific survival (P < .05), and Cox multivariate regression analysis qualified VEGF-D and VEGFR-3, but not VEGF-C, as independent prognostic parameters. In lymph node-positive gastric cancers, presence of VEGF-D/VEGFR-3 was associated with poor survival, whereas absence of VEGF-D/VEGFR-3 defined a subgroup of patients with clearly favorable prognosis.

VEGF-D and VEGFR-3 are novel independent prognostic marker molecules aiding to identify patients with poor prognosis after curative resection of gastric adenocarcinomas.

"Foregut endocrine polypeptide-secreting APUD cells (Amine-Precursor-Uptake and Decarboxylation), in their embryologic migration from neural crest to foregut may become ""arrested"" in the mesoderm or in other ectopic locations. They may become hyperplastic, adenomatous or malignant. Eight illustrative patients are reported. One patient had ""pancreatic hyperparathyroidism"" with hypercalcemic crises, pancreatic apudocarcinoma, normal parathyroids, biologically active parathormone, but inert immunochemically to the usual parathyroid antisera. Two had gastrin-secreting malignancies in the mesoderm. Remission after excision, but eventual recurrence of the syndrome due to islet cell hyperplasia required total gastrectomy. One patient had a gastric corpus apudocarcinoma found prospectively with hypergastrinemia which required excision of the tumor. One patient had acromegaly with hypergastrinemia and antral gastrinosis treated by pituitary irradiation,  One patient had the antral or intermediary type of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome with moderate hypergastrinemia, duodenal ulcer and antral gastrinosis, treated by vagotomy and antrectomy. One patient had hyperparathyroidism with antral gastrinosis, treated by parathyroidectomy. One patient had malignant Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and developed associated thyroid parafollicular cell hyperplasia and parathyroid chief cell hyperplasia, treated by total gastrectomy and multiple endocrine excisions.

"Y-receptors control energy homeostasis, but the role of Npy6 receptors (Npy6r) is largely unknown. Young Npy6r-deficient (Npy6r(-/-)) mice have reduced body weight, lean mass, and adiposity, while older and high-fat-fed Npy6r(-/-) mice have low lean mass with increased adiposity. Npy6r(-/-) mice showed reduced hypothalamic growth hormone releasing hormone (Ghrh) expression and serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels relative to WT. This is likely due to impaired vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) signaling in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), where we found Npy6r coexpressed in VIP neurons. Peripheral administration of pancreatic polypeptide (PP) increased Fos expression in the SCN, increased energy expenditure, and reduced food intake in WT, but not Npy6r(-/-), mice. Moreover, intraperitoneal (i.p.) PP injection increased hypothalamic Ghrh mRNA expression and serum IGF-1 levels in WT, but not Npy6r(-/-), mice, an effect blocked by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.)

"In order to survey, facilitate, and evaluate studies of medical language processing on clinical narratives, i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology to the Bedside) organized its second challenge and workshop. This challenge focused on automatically extracting information on obesity and fifteen of its most common comorbidities from patient discharge summaries. For each patient, obesity and any of the comorbidities could be Present, Absent, or Questionable (i.e., possible) in the patient, or Unmentioned in the discharge summary of the patient. i2b2 provided data for, and invited the development of, automated systems that can classify obesity and its comorbidities into these four classes based on individual discharge summaries. This article refers to obesity and comorbidities as diseases. It refers to the categories Present, Absent, Questionable, and Unmentioned as classes. The task of classifying obesity and its comorbidities is called the Obesity Challenge. The data released by i2b2 was annotated for textual judgments reflecting the explicitly reported information on diseases, and intuitive judgments reflecting medical professionals' reading of the information presented in discharge summaries. There were very few examples of some disease classes in the data. The Obesity Challenge paid particular attention to the performance of systems on these less well-represented classes. A total of 30 teams participated in the Obesity Challenge. Each team was allowed to submit two sets of up to three system runs for evaluation, resulting in a total of 136 submissions. The submissions represented a combination of rule-based and machine learning approaches. Evaluation of system runs shows that the best predictions of textual judgments come from systems that filter the potentially noisy portions of the narratives, project dictionaries of disease names onto the remaining text, apply negation extraction, and process the text through rules. Information on disease-related concepts, such as symptoms and medications, and general medical knowledge help systems infer intuitive judgments on the diseases.",obesity,0.4,6,5348.443,4273.983,4282.185,9650.993,8912.446,9070.065,3215.794
"To evaluate the effectiveness of the iterative decomposition of water and fat with echo asymmetric and least-squares estimation (IDEAL) MRI to quantify tumour infiltration into the lumbar vertebrae in myeloma patients without visible focal lesions.

The lumbar spine was examined with 3 T MRI in 24 patients with multiple myeloma and in 26 controls. The fat-signal fraction was calculated as the mean value from three vertebral bodies. A post hoc test was used to compare the fat-signal fraction in controls and patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), asymptomatic myeloma or symptomatic myeloma. Differences were considered significant at Pâ<â0.05. The fat-signal fraction and Î²(2)-microglobulin-to-albumin ratio were entered into the discriminant analysis.

Fat-signal fractions were significantly lower in patients with symptomatic myelomas (43.9 Â±19.7%, Pâ<â0.01) than in the other three groups. Discriminant analysis showed that 22 of the 24 patients (92%) were correctly classified into symptomatic or non-symptomatic myeloma groups.

Fat quantification using the IDEAL sequence in MRI was significantly different when comparing patients with symptomatic myeloma and those with asymptomatic myeloma. The fat-signal fraction and Î²(2)-microglobulin-to-albumin ratio facilitated discrimination of symptomatic myeloma from non-symptomatic myeloma in patients without focal bone lesions.

"The insertion/deletion DNA polymorphism of the gene coding human angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was examined in 109 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and 93 non-coronary subjects (NCS) living in a northern part of Japan. The presence of risk factors including age, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, tobacco use, diabetes mellitus and hyperuricemia were also examined. An insertion (I) / deletion (D) polymorphism of the ACE gene was determined by the polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotide primers encompassing the polymorphic region in intron 16. The template DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes of patients. The frequency of the D-allele in NCS was 0.27, significantly lower than that reported in Caucasians or in Japanese living in the Osaka area. The frequency of the D-allele in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) and angina pectoris was 0.39 and was higher than that in NCS. The frequencies of genotypes DD, ID, and II were 17.8, 43.3 and 38.9%, respectively, in CAD except in young patients (below 40 years of age) with MI and AP groups, and 6.5, 40.9 and 52.7%, respectively in NCS (p < 0.05 between CAD and NCS). Young MI showed similar frequencies in ACE gene polymorphisms to those in NCS, a pattern which differed from that seen in subjects with CAD (p < 0.05). The numbers of risk factors did not alter the frequency of ACE gene genotype among patients with CAD, however, in normotensives, the odds ratio of DD-genotype was significantly increased to 3.4.

"In a recent study, we presented preliminary evidence for biological activity in a Phase I dose-finding study (15-600 mg/m(2)) of recombinant human endostatin in patients with refractory solid tumors. Here, we conducted additional biomarker analyses to correlate changes in tumor biology with dose.

Excisional tumor biopsies were obtained at baseline and after 56 days of endostatin therapy. Laser scanning cytometry (LSC) was used to quantify biomarker levels in whole tissue sections. Apoptosis in tumor cells (TCs) and tumor-associated endothelial cells (ECs) was quantified by fluorescent three-color anti-CD31/terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling staining. Microvessel densities were measured by LSC-guided vessel contouring. Levels of tumor-associated EC BCL-2 and hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha were determined by immunofluorescence and LSC quantification. The results, including tumor blood flow measured by positron emission tomography, were analyzed using a quadratic polynomial model.

Significant increases in EC death and decreases in tumor microvessel density were observed, with maximal effects of endostatin at a dose of 249 mg/m(2) (95% confidence interval, 159-338) and 257 mg/m(2) (95% confidence interval, 183-331), respectively. In contrast, levels of TC death were uniformly low and did not correlate with endostatin dose. Maximal nuclear hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha and minimal EC Bcl-2 levels were observed at approximately 250 mg/m(2), although the changes did not reach statistical significance.

The data suggest that endostatin had optimal biological activity at doses approximately 250 mg/m(2) in our cohort of patients.

"Age-adjustment of rates is a basic tool for epidemiologists. The methodologies can be classified into direct and indirect types. The direct methods facilitate a valid comparison between populations or across calendar periods. However, they suffer from the problem of instability. By contrast, the indirect methods achieve maximal precision but may sacrifice a valid inter-populational comparison (violating the 'consistency criteria'). In this paper, we propose a new weighting system to summarize the rates. The weighting system is optimal in the sense that it produces age-adjusted rates which are most stable and ensure a valid comparison between populations. The new weighting system calls for an iterative algorithm. However, the procedure simplifies considerably under some conditions.

"The aim of this study was to survey Canadian oncology practitioners' attitudes toward psychosocial concerns and issues in women with breast cancer. Surveys were mailed to 351 medical, radiation and surgical oncologists and 375 oncology nurses. Standard questionnaires assessed attitudes towards psychosocial issues in women with primary and metastatic breast cancer and evaluated the practitioners' willingness to refer women to psychosocial intervention trials in the presence and absence of competing drug trials. Responses were obtained from 74% of those surveyed. Respondents reported being aware of the common occurrence of psychosocial problems in women with metastatic breast cancer, however, physicians were less likely than nurses to offer these women psychosocial support on a prophylactic basis (p &<0.0001) and they expressed greater concern than nurses about scientific validity of (p = 0.0003), and potential psychological damage from (p = 0.005), psychosocial support groups. Nurses were more likely than physicians to favour a study investigating group psychosocial support over competing drug studies (p &<or = 0.003) in the metastatic setting. Physicians were less likely than nurses to deal with weight problems prophylactically in women with primary breast cancer (p = 0.0009) and they expressed greater concern over scientific validity of psychosocial interventions addressing weight than nurses (p = 0.0008); nurses were more concerned about excessive expectations of patients regarding potential benefits of such interventions (p &<0.0001). Regardless, nurses were more likely than physicians to favour a psychosocial intervention study focused on weight management over drug studies in pre- (p = 0.0006) and postmenopausal women (p = 0.05) with primary breast cancer.

"In single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the dopaminergic system, measurements of striatal uptake are useful for diagnosis and patient follow-up but are strongly biased by the partial volume effect (PVE). We studied whether PVE correction might improve patient classification based on binding potential (BP) measurements.

Patients with a probable diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, 10 patients) or Alzheimer's disease (AD, 13 patients) were studied by( 123)I-FP-CIT SPECT. SPECT images were reconstructed with and without PVE correction. Each patient SPECT scan was also simulated to obtain SPECT data whose characteristics were fully known. In addition, 17 SPECT scans were simulated with striatal uptake values mimicking pre-symptomatic cases of DLB.

Without PVE correction, mean putamen BP values were 2.9+/-0.4 and 0.9+/-0.2 for AD and DLB patients respectively, while with PVE correction, they were 8.6+/-1.5 and 1.9+/-0.5 respectively. All patients were properly identified as having AD or DLB when considering mean putamen BP measured on their real or simulated SPECT scan, with and without PVE correction. All 30 simulations mimicking pre-symptomatic DLB and AD patients were accurately classified with PVE correction, but without PVE correction 15 mean putamen BP values were in a range where AD and DLB could not be distinguished.

We conclude that putamen BP values measured without PVE correction can be used to differentiate probable DLB and AD due to the already severe reduction in dopamine transporter levels.

"The unique energy demands of neurons require well-orchestrated distribution and maintenance of mitochondria. Thus, dynamic properties of mitochondria, including fission, fusion, trafficking, biogenesis, and degradation, are critical to all cells, but may be particularly important in neurons. Dysfunction in mitochondrial dynamics has been linked to neuropathies and is increasingly being linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, but the evidence is particularly strong, and continuously accumulating, in Parkinson's disease (PD). The unique characteristics of neurons that degenerate in PD may predispose those neuronal populations to susceptibility to alterations in mitochondrial dynamics. In addition, evidence from PD-related toxins supports that mitochondrial fission, fusion, and transport may be involved in pathogenesis. Furthermore, rapidly increasing evidence suggests that two proteins linked to familial forms of the disease, parkin and PINK1, interact in a common pathway to regulate mitochondrial fission/fusion. Parkin may also play a role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis through targeting damaged mitochondria for mitophagy. Taken together, the current data suggests that mitochondrial dynamics may play a role in PD pathogenesis, and a better understanding of mitochondrial dynamics within the neuron may lead to future therapeutic treatments for PD, potentially aimed at some of the earliest pathogenic events.",signal_transduction,0.6,6,7574.807,5197.767,5039.88,12543.46,12383.54,11737.97,3923.497
"The sigmoidorectal junction (SRJ) has been defined as an anatomical sphincter with particular physiological behavior that regulates sigmoid and rectum evacuation. Its function in clinical conditions, such as diverticular disease has been advocated. The aim of our study is to identify the SRJ and to compare the morphometric and dynamic features of the SRJ between patients with diverticular disease and healthy subjects using MR-defecography.

Sixteen individuals, eight with uncomplicated diverticular disease and eight healthy subjects, were studied using MR-defecography to identify the SRJ and to compare the morphometric and dynamic features observed.

In each subject studied, MR-defecography was able to identify the SRJ. This resulted in the identification of a discrete anatomical entity with a mean length of 31.23Â mm, located in front of the first sacral vertebra (S1) and at a mean distance of 15.55Â cm from the anal verge, with a mean wall thickness of 4.45Â mm, significantly different from the sigmoid and rectal parietal thickness. The SRJ wall was significantly thicker in patients with diverticular disease than the controls (PÂ =Â 0.005), showing a unique shape and behavior in dynamic sequences.

"In Compton cameras, the measured scattering angle is associated with an uncertainty which becomes larger as the incident gamma-ray energy decreases. Since this uncertainty degrades the spatial resolution of reconstructed images, Hirasawa and Tomitani (2003 Phys. Med. Biol. 48 1009-26) previously revised their analytical reconstruction algorithm to compensate for it. As the new algorithm improved the spatial resolution in effect, they expected an enhancement of the statistical noise. In this paper, the effect of this compensation has been analysed in view of spatial resolution (the FWHM of the noise-free reconstructed image for a point source distribution), statistical noise (the relative standard deviation of reconstructed images for an isotropic source distribution) and image quality (the roughness of reconstructed images for a phantom). The results describe not only the effect of the compensation, but also the relation between the statistical noise and three parameters, i.e., the incident gamma-ray energy, the spatial resolution and the measured total event numbers, in reconstruction with compensation.

"Diastolic heart failure is defined clinically when signs and symptoms of heart failure are present in the presence of preserved left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction&>45%). The incidence and prevalence of primary diastolic heart failure increases with age and it may be as high as 50% in the elderly. Age, female gender, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and increased body mass index are risk factors for diastolic heart failure. Hemodynamic consequences such as increased pulmonary venous pressure, post-capillary pulmonary hypertension, and secondary right heart failure as well as decreased cardiac output are similar to those of systolic left ventricular failure, although the nature of primary left ventricular dysfunction is different. Diagnosis of primary diastolic heart failure depends on the presence of preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. Assessment of diastolic dysfunction is preferable but not mandatory. It is to be noted that increased levels of B-type natriuretic peptide does not distinguish between diastolic and systolic heart failure. Echocardiographic studies are recommended to exclude hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, infiltrative heart disease, primary valvular heart disease, and constrictive pericarditis. Myocardial stress imaging is frequently required to exclude ischemic heart disease. The prognosis of diastolic heart failure is variable; it is related to age, severity of heart failure, and associated comorbid diseases such as coronary artery disease. The prognosis of severe diastolic heart failure is similar to that of systolic heart failure. However, cautious use of diuretics and/or nitrates may cause hypotension and low output state. Heart rate control is essential to improving ventricular filling. Pharmacologic agents such as angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers are used in selected patients to decrease left ventricular hypertrophy. To decrease myocardial fibrosis, aldosterone antagonists have a potential therapeutic role. However, prospective controlled studies will be required to establish their efficacy in primary diastolic heart failure.",obesity,0.4,5,10542.97,7380.654,6939.872,17087.39,17385.87,17258.86,4280.084
"More than a quarter of the world's population is infected with nematode parasites, and more than a hundred species of nematodes are parasites of humans [1-3]. Despite extensive morbidity and mortality caused by nematode parasites, the biological mechanisms of host-parasite interactions are poorly understood, largely because of the lack of genetically tractable model systems. We have demonstrated that the insect parasitic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, its bacterial symbiont Photorhabdus luminescens, and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster constitute a tripartite model for nematode parasitism and parasitic infection. We find that infective juveniles (IJs) of Heterorhabditis, which contain Photorhabdus in their gut, can infect and kill Drosophila larvae. We show that infection activates an immune response in Drosophila that results in the temporally dynamic expression of a subset of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes, and that this immune response is induced specifically by Photorhabdus. We also investigated the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying IJ recovery, the developmental process that occurs in parasitic nematodes upon host invasion and that is necessary for successful parasitism. We find that the chemosensory neurons and signaling pathways that control dauer recovery in Caenorhabditis elegans also control IJ recovery in Heterorhabditis, suggesting conservation of these developmental processes across free-living and parasitic nematodes.",signal_transduction,0,5,8249.758,7112.698,7130.726,13039.25,12431.86,12696.75,4119.747

"Silibinin is known to exert growth inhibition and cell death together with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells. Whether silibinin could inhibit the invasion, motility and migration of prostate cancer cells remains largely unknown. This study was designed to evaluate this efficacy and possible mechanisms using a novel highly bone metastatic ARCaP(M) cell model.

Four prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP, PC-3, DU145, and ARCaP(M), were used in this study. These cells were treated with increasing concentrations of silibinin (50, 100, and 200 micromol/L) for different periods of time. After treatment, cell viabilities of four prostate cancer cells were compared by MTT assay. Alterations of ARCaP(M) cell invasion, motility and migration were assessed by cell invasion, motility and wound healing assays. The changes of vimentin expression were observed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining, and the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and uPA was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

ARCaP(M) cells showed less sensitivity to the growth inhibition of pharmacological doses of silibinin than LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145 cells. However, silibinin exerted significant dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effects on the invasion, motility and migration of ARCaP(M) cells. Furthermore, the expression of vimentin and MMP-2, but not MMP-9 or uPA, was down-regulated in a dose- and time-dependent manner after treatment of silibinin.

"The use of self-monitoring as a tool to facilitate behavioral modification is common in many lifestyle-based weight loss interventions. Electronic tracking programs, including computer-based systems and smart phone applications, have been developed to allow individuals to self-monitor their behavior digitally.

Rates of CTS utilization were highest during the first year of this 2-year intervention, and utilization of the CTS declined steadily over time.

"The p53 tumor suppressor is a key regulator of cell growth and survival upon various forms of cellular stress. p53 is a redox-regulated transcription factor that binds specifically to DNA and activates transcription of target genes. The core domain of p53 holds a zinc atom that protects p53 from oxidation and is critical for DNA binding. A large fraction of human tumors carry p53 mutation, allowing evasion of apoptosis and tumor progression. Restoration of wild type p53 expression triggers rapid elimination of tumors in vivo. This makes mutant p53 an attractive target for novel cancer therapy. Small molecules have been identified that reactivate mutant p53 and induce apoptosis in tumor cells. Interestingly, several of these compounds share the ability to target thiols and affect the redox state of p53, indicating that this is critical for mutant p53 rescue.

"Inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene has been reported to be a prognostic factor in several human cancer types. Normal function of the gene is affected by deletion in one allele; dysfunction of the other allele is often caused by a mutation. In tumors of heterozygous individuals, deletion of one allele can be detected as loss of heterozygosity (LOH). A recently found variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) segment in intron 1 of the p53 gene seems to be highly polymorphic and, therefore, a very useful marker in detecting LOH in various types of tumor samples. We in vitro amplified the VNTR segment from genomic DNA samples of 101 lung cancer patients and run conventional agarose gel electrophoreses in order to detect the alleles of various length, differing by the number of repeats. The usefulness of the method was studied using DNA from white blood cell samples and from fresh and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples. Of the patients, 56% were found to have two different alleles, i.e. were informative in this assay. In 18% of the lung tumors from the informative cases, LOH in the p53 suppressor gene was detected.",molecular_sequence_data,0.2,9,5761.312,4458.994,4416.093,9938.875,7148.106,7346.487,2225.497
"The mu opioid receptor (MOR) is expressed in the central nervous system and specific cell lines with varying expression levels perhaps playing important roles. One of the neuronal-specific transcription regulators, neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF), has been shown to repress the expression of neuron-specific genes in non-neuronal cells. However, we showed here that the neuron-restrictive silencer element (NRSE) of MOR functions as a critical regulator to repress the MOR gene expression in specific neuronal cells depending on NRSF expression level. Using co-transfection studies, we showed that the NRSE of the MOR promoter is functional in NRSF-positive cells (NS20Y and HeLa) but not in NRSF-negative cells (PC12). NRSF binds to the NRSE of the MOR gene in a sequence-specific manner confirmed by supershift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, respectively. The suppression of NRSF activity with either trichostatin A or a dominant-negative NRSF induced MOR promoter activity and transcription of the MOR gene. When the NRSF was disrupted in NS20Y and HeLa cells using small interfering RNA, the transcription of the endogenous target MOR gene increased significantly. This provides direct evidence the role of NRSF in the cells and also indicates that NRSF expression is regulated by post-translational modification in neuronal NMB cells. Our data suggested that NRSF can function as a repressor of MOR transcription in specific cells, via a mechanism dependent on the MOR NRSE.",cell_line_tumor,0,9,8355.308,8263.052,8404.088,13708.1,13513.86,13687.66,3693.64
"Small-molecule growth factor receptor inhibitors block cell growth in vitro and downstream signaling in vivo, but controlled trials in patients with advanced solid tumors have yielded disappointing response rates. To clarify this discrepancy, we compared the patterns of tyrosine phosphoprotein expression in human cancer cells and primary tumors.

Immunoaffinity chromatography, two-dimensional electrophoresis, and antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting were combined with mass spectrometry to determine the phosphoproteomic signatures of 40 matched normal and malignant tissues from patients with breast or liver cancer. The identities and abundance of the detected tyrosine phosphoproteins were compared with those of ligand-responsive A431 cells.

Patterns of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins are similar among normal tissues of the same origin but vary markedly between different tissues. Primary breast tumors exhibit a strikingly homogeneous tyrosine phosphorylation profile, whereas liver cancers display greater phosphoproteomic diversity. The main breast-tumor-specific tyrosine phosphoproteins are cytoskeletal molecules (actin, tubulin, and vimentin) and molecular chaperones (Hsp70, Hsc71, and Grp75). In contrast, control studies in ligand-stimulated A431 human cancer cells revealed an additional phosphorylated subset of promitogenic phosphoproteins (Grb2, Shc, Jnk2, phospholipase C-gamma, and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase).

Identification of cytoskeletal and stress proteins as the most abundant tyrosine phosphoproteins in breast tumors implicates these molecules, rather than promitogenic effectors, as the prime stoichiometric substrates for kinase-inhibitory anticancer drugs in vivo. Because phosphorylated cytoskeletal proteins and chaperones mediate cell motility and apoptotic resistance, respectively, these data raise the intriguing possibility that small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be of greatest value either as adjuvant antimetastatic/-invasive drugs or as chemo-/radiosensitizers.",signal_transduction,0.2,10,15978.23,16753.63,17049.9,24076.55,29416.01,29562.02,6310.848
"Inactivating mutations of the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) gene, NF2, result predominantly in benign neurological tumors, schwannomas and meningiomas, in humans; however, mutations in murine Nf2 lead to a broad spectrum of cancerous tumors. The tumor-suppressive function of the NF2 protein, merlin, a membrane-cytoskeleton linker, remains unclear. Here, we identify the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) as a novel mediator of merlin's tumor suppressor activity. Merlin-deficient human meningioma cells and merlin knockdown arachnoidal cells, the nonneoplastic cell counterparts of meningiomas, exhibit rapamycin-sensitive constitutive mTORC1 activation and increased growth. NF2 patient tumors and Nf2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts demonstrate elevated mTORC1 signaling. Conversely, the exogenous expression of wild-type merlin isoforms, but not a patient-derived L64P mutant, suppresses mTORC1 signaling. Merlin does not regulate mTORC1 via the established mechanism of phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt or mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-mediated TSC2 inactivation and may instead regulate TSC/mTOR signaling in a novel fashion. In conclusion, the deregulation of mTORC1 activation underlies the aberrant growth and proliferation of NF2-associated tumors and may restrain the growth of these lesions through negative feedback mechanisms, suggesting that rapamycin in combination with phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors may be therapeutic for NF2.",signal_transduction,0,0,17256.43,17627.8,17642.93,27262.32,28345.2,28647.49,8767.643
"Anticancer drugs are effective against tumors that depend on the molecular target of the drug. Known targets of cytotoxic anticancer drugs are involved in cell proliferation; drugs acting on such targets are ineffective against nonproliferating tumor cells, survival of which leads to eventual therapy failure. Function-based genomic screening identified the coatomer protein complex Î¶1 (COPZ1) gene as essential for different tumor cell types but not for normal cells. COPZ1 encodes a subunit of coatomer protein complex 1 (COPI) involved in intracellular traffic and autophagy. The knockdown of COPZ1, but not of COPZ2 encoding isoform coatomer protein complex Î¶2, caused Golgi apparatus collapse, blocked autophagy, and induced apoptosis in both proliferating and nondividing tumor cells. In contrast, inhibition of normal cell growth required simultaneous knockdown of both COPZ1 and COPZ2. COPZ2 (but not COPZ1) was down-regulated in the majority of tumor cell lines and in clinical samples of different cancer types. Reexpression of COPZ2 protected tumor cells from killing by COPZ1 knockdown, indicating that tumor cell dependence on COPZ1 is the result of COPZ2 silencing. COPZ2 displays no tumor-suppressive activities, but it harbors microRNA 152, which is silenced in tumor cells concurrently with COPZ2 and acts as a tumor suppressor in vitro and in vivo. Silencing of microRNA 152 in different cancers and the ensuing down-regulation of its host gene COPZ2 offer a therapeutic opportunity for proliferation-independent selective killing of tumor cells by COPZ1-targeting agents.",cell_line_tumor,0,0,10665.88,10972.92,11088.29,15546.46,15593.45,16029.96,4862.461
"Oxidative stress has been implicated in the cell death that occurs after ischemia-reperfusion of the brain, which causes the production of reactive oxygen species and a decrease in antioxidants, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the invasive methods used to collect much of this evidence are themselves stress inducing, which could skew the results. In this study, we aimed at demonstrating brain redox alterations after ischemia-reperfusion noninvasively, using Overhauser-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. The reduction rate of 3-methoxycarbonyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidine-L-oxyl (methoxycarbonyl-PROXYL), a redox-sensitive contrast agent, was used as an index of the redox status in vivo. No changes were observed in the antioxidant concentration, the mitochondrial complex activity, or in the redox status image intensity after 3 h of reperfusion, following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion; however, after 24 h of reperfusion, the methoxycarbonyl-PROXYL reduction rate, calculated from continuous images, had decreased significantly. Concordantly, biochemical assays showed that the concentration of ascorbic acid in the ischemic hemisphere and the activity of mitochondrial complex II had also decreased. Thus, the noninvasive imaging of the brain redox alterations faithfully reflected changes in antioxidant levels and in mitochondrial complex II activity after ischemia-reperfusion.",magnetic_resonance_imaging,0,0,7408.708,7413.571,7541.405,13073.82,13701.17,14326.24,3367.43

"To test whether a feeding algorithm could improve the nutritional support of intensive care patients.

Numerous factors may impede delivery of both enteral and parenteral nutrition to patients in the intensive care unit. Often there is a discrepancy between what is prescribed and actual delivery of nutrients. The purpose of this study was to test the effect of a nutritional support algorithm in an intensive care unit mainly by using the enteral route and if necessary by combining enteral and parenteral nutrition.

In this prospective study, nutritional data were collected from routinely fed critically ill patients (controls, n=21) during the first three days following admission to the intensive care unit. A nutritional support algorithm was then implemented and nutritional data were collected from critically ill patients who participated in this intervention (intervention group, n=21). Data collected included the total amount of calories prescribed vs. received, onset of delivery of enteral nutrition, enteral vs. parenteral nutrition, and the use and size of enteral feeding tubes.

Patients in the intervention group were both prescribed and actually received significantly larger amounts of nutrients than patients in the control group. They also received a larger proportion of their nutrients in the form of enteral nutrition. In addition, the nutritional support algorithm led to greater consistency in nursing practices with respect to aspiration of gastric content and rate of increment in enteral feeding.

The study confirms that a nutritional support algorithm improved the delivery of nutrients to critically ill patients. The algorithm was most effective with respect to the delivery of enteral nutrition. The effect was primarily because of early and more rapid increment in the delivery of enteral nutrition administered by nurses based on improved physician orders. The combination of enteral and parenteral nutrition may contribute to meeting adequate nutritional requirements.

By using a nutritional algorithm focused on enteral nutrition, but including parenteral nutrition as a supplement, it is possible to improve the delivery of clinical nutrition in the intensive care unit patients.",algorithms,0,0,5424.863,3739.053,3703.516,10396.89,8634.44,8660.365,2452.246

We found that US cancer patients experienced greater survival gains than their European counterparts; even after considering higher US costs, this investment generated $598 billion of additional value for US patients who were diagnosed with cancer between 1983 and 1999. The value of that additional survival gain was highest for prostate cancer patients ($627 billion) and breast cancer patients ($173 billion).

"Microelectrode recordings are a useful adjunctive method for subthalamic nucleus localization during deep brain stimulation surgery for Parkinson's disease. Attempts to quantitate and standardize this process, using single computational measures of neural activity, have been limited by variability in patient neurophysiology and recording conditions. Investigators have suggested that a multi-feature approach may be necessary for automated approaches to perform within acceptable clinical standards. We present a novel data visualization algorithm and several unique features that address these shortcomings. The algorithm extracts multiple computational features from the microelectrode neurophysiology and integrates them with tools from unsupervised machine learning. The resulting colour-coded map of neural activity reveals activity transitions that correspond to the anatomic boundaries of subcortical structures. Using these maps, a non-neurophysiologist is able to achieve sensitivities of 90% and 95% for STN entry and exit, respectively, to within 0.5 mm accuracy of the current gold standard. The accuracy of this technique is attributed to the multi-feature approach. This activity map can simplify and standardize the process of localizing the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for neurostimulation.

"Three highly homologous wheat germ isolectins (95-97%) are distinct gene products in hexaploid wheat. The amino acid sequences of two of these [wheat germ agglutinin 1 (WGA1) and 2 (WGA2)] are compared with sequence data derived from a complementary DNA (cDNA) clone for the third isolectin (WGA3). This comparison includes three corrections to earlier amino acid sequence data of both WGA1 and WGA2 at positions 109 (from Ser to Phe), 134 (from Gly to Lys), and 150 (from Gly to Trp). These reassignments are based on new results from crystal structure refinement and amino acid sequence data of WGA1, as well as the recently determined nucleotide sequence of WGA3. In addition, the C-terminal residue of WGA1 has been revised to Gly171 and now differs from WGA2 (Ala171). Four other positions, Asn9, Ala53, Gly119, and Ser123, at which WGA1 and WGA2 are identical but differ from the DNA sequence of WGA3, were also reinvestigated by amino acid sequencing techniques and confirmed. Variability among the three isolectins is observed at a total of 10 sequence positions: 9, 53, 56, 59, 66, 93, 109, 119, 123, and 171. Pairwise comparisons indicate that WGA3 deviates to a much larger extent from WGA1 (at eight positions) and from WGA2 (at seven positions) than the latter from one another (at five positions). Eight of the 10 mutations are equally distributed between domains B and C, the two interior and more highly conserved of the four WGA domains (A, B, C, D). Correlation of the variable residues with the three-dimensional structure indicates that all except the two previously described B-domain residues, 56 and 59 (Wright and Olafsdottir 1986), are easily accommodated at the dimer surface. WGA3 displays a higher degree of inter-domain similarity than found in WGA1 and WGA2.

"Cisplatin is one of the most potent chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of many types of solid tumours. Nevertheless, it is not the first-line drug for prostate cancer chemotherapy, because prostate tumour cells exhibit intrinsic and acquired resistance to cisplatin. We have previously demonstrated that Î²-elemene, a novel plant-derived anti-neoplastic with low toxicity, inhibits lung and ovarian carcinoma cell growth in vitro. In the present study, we explored the therapeutically chemosensitizing effect of Î²-elemene on cisplatin anti-tumour efficacy in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells as well as the underlying mechanism. Î²-Elemene significantly increased cisplatin cytotoxicity in the androgen-independent prostate carcinoma cell lines DU145 and PC-3. In addition, Î²-elemene markedly promoted cisplatin-induced apoptotic cell death in both cell lines, as determined by three different apoptosis assays. Î²-Elemene augmented the cisplatin-induced activation of caspase-3/7/10 and caspase-9, cleavage of caspase-3 and -9, suppression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L)  expression, and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria in these cells. Thus, Î²-elemene enhancement of cisplatin-induced apoptosis via mitochondrial activation of the caspase-mediated apoptotic pathway may account for the augmented anti-cancer potency of cisplatin in prostate cancer.

"Targeted positioning of water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) strictly regulates body water homeostasis. Trafficking of AQP2 to the apical membrane is critical to the reabsorption of water in renal collecting ducts.

The distribution of SPA-1 coincided with that of AQP2 in renal collecting ducts. The site of colocalization was concomitantly relocated by hydration status. AQP2 trafficking to the apical membrane was inhibited by the SPA-1 mutant lacking Rap1GAP activity and by the constitutively active mutant of Rap1.

To develop an efficient transfection method, we formulated a simple nanocomplex by incorporating poly Î²-amino ester (PBAE) polymers with plasmid DNAs containing a GFP reporter gene. The formed PBAE-plasmid nanocomplexes are approximately 200nm in diameter and stable under physiological conditions, but become rapidly biodegradable when pH decreases <7.0. Cultured lymphoma/leukemia cells were used for transfection assays and resultant gene delivery rates were determined by quantifying GFP expression. Exposure of cells to the nanocomplexes composed of fractioned PBAE (>7kDa) resulted in GFP expression in 3% of cells, similar to that mediated by the standard Lipofectamine method. However, with polybrene pre-treatment, the nanocomplex could achieve GFP expression in up to 32% of lymphoma/leukemia cells, an 8-fold increase over that mediated by Lipofectamine. These findings demonstrated a simple, efficient method for in vitro gene delivery into hard-to-transfect cells. The nanocomplexes are biodegradable and have minimal cytotoxicity, suggesting the potential use for in vivo gene delivery.",cell_line_tumor,0,6,12303.23,12493.43,12120.23,22476.21,26094.61,25753.75,5986.936
"Tristetraprolin (TTP) binds AU-rich elements (AREs) encoded within selected labile mRNAs and targets these transcripts for rapid cytoplasmic decay. RNA binding by TTP is mediated by an approximately 70-amino acid domain containing two tandemly arrayed CCCH zinc fingers. Here we show that a 73-amino acid peptide spanning the TTP zinc finger domain, denoted TTP73, forms a dynamic, equimolar RNA.peptide complex with a 13-nucleotide fragment of the ARE from tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA, which includes small but significant contributions from ionic interactions. Association of TTP73 with high affinity RNA substrates is accompanied by a large negative change in heat capacity without substantial modification of RNA structure, consistent with conformational changes in the peptide moiety during RNA binding. Analyses using mutant ARE substrates indicate that two adenylate residues located 3-6 bases apart within a uridylate-rich sequence are sufficient for high affinity recognition by TTP73 (K(d) <20 nm), with optimal affinity observed for RNA substrates containing AUUUA or AUUUUA.

"We have previously shown that growth hormone (GH) overexpression in the brain increased food intake, accompanied with increased hypothalamic agouti-related protein (AgRP) expression. Ghrelin, which stimulates both appetite and GH secretion, was injected intracerebroventricularly to GHR-/- and littermate control (+/+) mice to determine whether ghrelin's acute effects on appetite are dependent on GHR signaling. GHR-/- mice were also analyzed with respect to serum levels of lipoproteins, apolipoprotein (apo)B, leptin, glucose, and insulin as well as body composition. Central injection of ghrelin into the third dorsal ventricle increased food consumption in +/+ mice, whereas no change was observed in GHR-/- mice. After ghrelin injection, AgRP mRNA expression in the hypothalamus was higher in +/+ littermates than in GHR-/- mice, indicating a possible importance of AgRP in the GHR-mediated effect of ghrelin. Compared with controls, GHR-/- mice had increased food intake, leptin levels, and total and intra-abdominal fat mass per body weight and deceased lean mass. Moreover, serum levels of triglycerides, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and apoB, as well as glucose and insulin levels were lower in the GHR-/- mice. In summary, ghrelin's acute central action to increase food intake requires functionally intact GHR signaling. Long-term GHR deficiency in mice is associated with high plasma leptin levels, obesity, and increased food intake but a marked decrease in all lipoprotein fractions.",obesity,0,10,12210.96,11075.69,11068.1,17466.56,18221.79,17923.61,6445.495

"The capability to foster metacognitive evaluations (MEs) of oneself and others represents a major component of conscious awareness. Separate emerging lines of brain activation research examining ME have converged on the medial prefrontal cortex as a common finding. The current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study utilized a task that directly compared ME associated with two referentially discrete targets: oneself and a significant other (e.g., close friend or relative). Nineteen healthy young adult participants (mean age 24; 9 female, 10 male) were required to make yes/no decisions based on individually presented trait adjectives across two separate referential conditions and a nonreferential control condition: self-evaluation (SE), significant other-evaluation (OE), and semantic positivity-evaluation (SPE), respectively. Results of random-effects group analyses indicated a common area of medial prefrontal activation during the ME conditions of self- and other-evaluation versus the baseline semantic positivity-evaluation condition. A direct comparison of brain activation between the self and other evaluative conditions revealed a right dorsolateral prefrontal response that was significantly more active when making evaluations about the self. The present study extends upon the prior findings of separate research domains by directly comparing the cerebral response to ME about the self and others, and finding right PFC activation increases as a function of self-relevance.",magnetic_resonance_imaging,0.2,2,10125.27,7344.854,7536.505,15935.7,14346.13,14704.9,4555.214
"Dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) mutations in Pneumocystis jiroveci have been associated epidemiologically with resistance to sulfamethoxazole (SMX). Since P. jiroveci cannot be cultured, inherent drug resistance cannot be measured. This study explores the effects of these mutations in a tractable model organism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Based on the sequence conservation between the DHPS enzymes of P. jiroveci and S. cerevisiae, together with the structural conservation of the three known DHPS structures, DHPS substitutions commonly observed in P. jiroveci were reverse engineered into the S. cerevisiae DHPS. Those mutations, T(597)A and P(599)S, can occur singly but are most commonly found together and are associated with SMX treatment failure. Mutations encoding the corresponding changes in the S. cerevisiae dhps were made in a yeast centromere vector, p414FYC, which encodes the native yeast DHPS as part of a trifunctional protein that also includes the two enzymes upstream of DHPS in the folic acid synthesis pathway, dihydroneopterin aldolase and 2-amino-4-hydroxymethyl dihydropteridine pyrophosphokinase. A yeast strain with dhps deleted was employed as the host strain, and transformants having DHPS activity were recovered. Mutants having both T(597) and P(599) substitutions had a requirement for p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), consistent with resistance being associated with altered substrate binding. These mutants could be adapted for growth in the absence of PABA, which coincided with increased sulfa drug resistance. Upregulated PABA synthesis was thus implicated as a mechanism for sulfa drug resistance for mutants having two DHPS substitutions.",molecular_sequence_data,0.6,8,10552.04,8745.484,8738.005,16517.75,15942.71,16525.19,5701.051
"Cost-analysis comparing darbepoetin-alfa (DARB), epoetin-alfa (EPO-A), and epoetin-beta (EPO-B) for treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia in Belgium concluded that costs for DARB-treated patients were significantly lower than costs for EPO-A- or EPO-B-treated patients. The objective of the present study was to extend the Belgian analysis to Austria, France, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, estimating differences in costs between erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in each country.

Differences in epidemiology and treatment patterns between countries were adjusted using data from Eurostat, national cancer registries, IMS sales data, and reimbursement and treatment guidelines. Belgian unit costs were replaced with country-specific costs. Costs were analyzed using a mixed-effects model stratifying for propensity score quintiles.

All populations were comparable to the Belgian population in terms of age, gender, ESA, and blood transfusions use. After adjusting for country-specific chemotherapy use and cancer incidence, total management costs per patient (Euro, 2010) were 19-26% (France, Spain) lower with DARB compared with EPO-A (pâ&lt;â0.0001) and 20-36% (Portugal, Austria) compared with EPO-B (pâ&lt;â0.01). Anemia-related costs with DARB were between 12% (Portugal; pâ=â0.0235) and 38% (Italy; pâ&lt;â0.0001) lower compared with EPO-A (pâ&lt;â0.01; all remaining countries), and between 13% (Austria; pâ=â0.064) and 19% (Portugal; pâ=â0.0028) lower compared with EPO-B (pâ&lt;â0.05; all remaining countries except Italy; pâ=â0.0935).

Not all differences could be accounted for by a lack of country-specific data; however, the potential under- and over-estimation of costs should be similar for all three ESAs.

These findings are in line with the Belgian analysis. In all countries, total and anemia-related costs were lowest in patients receiving DARB vs EPO-A or EPO-B. This study demonstrates the feasibility of adapting real-life country-specific data to other settings, adjusting for differences in patients' characteristics and treatment strategies.

"Changing plasma protein concentrations may affect the protein binding and pharmacokinetics of drugs in the postoperative period. This study examined the effect of postoperative increases (in response to surgery) in plasma alpha1-acid-glycoprotein (AAG) concentrations on the plasma concentrations of the enantiomers of bupivacaine during continuous epidural infusion of racemic bupivacaine for postoperative pain relief.

Six patients scheduled for total hip surgery with combined epidural and general anesthesia received a bolus dose of bupivacaine (65 mg) followed by constant-rate (8 ml/h) epidural infusion of 2.5 mg/ml bupivacaine for 48 h. Total and unbound plasma concentrations of the enantiomers of bupivacaine and plasma AAG concentrations during the 48-h epidural infusion were determined.

Total plasma concentrations of the enantiomers of bupivacaine increased steadily during the infusion (P < 0.0001), whereas unbound concentrations did not change after 12 h (P > 0.1). Total plasma concentrations of S(-)-bupivacaine were higher than those of R(+)-bupivacaine (P < 0.02), whereas unbound concentrations of S(-)-bupivacaine were lower than those of R(+)-bupivacaine (P < 0.002). AAG concentrations initially decreased, but thereafter increased steadily (P < 0.0001). Consequently, free fractions of the enantiomers initially increased and then decreased with time (P = 0.0002). Free fractions of S(-)-bupivacaine were smaller than those of R(+)-bupivacaine (P = 0.0003).

The study confirmed that the pharmacokinetics of bupivacaine are enantioselective. During postoperative epidural infusion, changing plasma AAG concentrations affect the protein binding of both enantiomers of bupivacaine. Consequently, total plasma concentrations of the enantiomers increase with time, whereas unbound concentrations reach a plateau.",algorithms,0.6,5,14236.08,13728.47,13508.07,23291.54,25306.41,25719.55,5407.254
"Insight into the molecular basis of cholecystokinin (CCK) binding to its receptor has come from receptor mutagenesis and photoaffinity labeling studies, with both contributing to the current hypothesis that the acidic Tyr-sulfate-27 residue within the peptide is situated adjacent to basic Arg(197) in the second loop of the receptor. Here, we refine our understanding of this region of interaction by examining a structure-activity series of these positions within both ligand and receptor and by performing three-dimensional molecular modeling of key pairs of modified ligand and receptor constructs. The important roles of Arg(197) and Tyr-sulfate-27 were supported by the marked negative impact on binding and biological response with their natural partner molecule when the receptor residue was replaced by acidic Asp or Glu and when the peptide residue was replaced by basic Arg, Lys, p-amino-Phe, p-guanidino-Phe, or p-methylamino-Phe. Complementary ligand-receptor charge-exchange experiments were unable to regain the lost function. This was supported by the molecular modeling, which demonstrated that the charge-reversed double mutants could not form a good interaction without extensive rearrangement of receptor conformation. The models further predicted that R197D and R197E mutations would lead to conformational changes in the extracellular domain, and this was experimentally supported by data showing that these mutations decreased peptide agonist and antagonist binding and increased nonpeptidyl antagonist binding. These receptor constructs also had increased susceptibility to trypsin degradation relative to the wild-type receptor. In contrast, the relatively conservative R197K mutation had modest negative impact on peptide agonist binding, again consistent with the modeling demonstration of loss of a series of stabilizing inter- and intramolecular bonds. The strong correlation between predicted and experimental results support the reported refinement in the three-dimensional structure of the CCK-occupied receptor.",signal_transduction,0,6,6450.974,4515.192,4598.887,10899.5,9810.271,10083.85,2772.029

"Listeria monocytogenes bacteriophages A118, A500 and A511 are members of three distinct phage groups with characteristic host ranges. Their endolysin (ply) genes were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as demonstrated by the conferred lytic phenotype when colonies of recombinant cells were overlaid with a lawn of Listeria cells. The nucleotide sequences of the cloned DNA fragments were determined and the individual enzymes (PLY118, 30.8 kDa; PLY500, 33.4 kDa; PLY511, 36.5 kDa) were shown to have varying degrees of homology within their N-terminal or C-terminal domains. Transcriptional analysis revealed them to be 'late' genes with transcription beginning 15-20 min post-infection. The enzymes were overexpressed and partially purified and their individual specificities examined. When applied exogenously, the lysins induced rapid lysis of Listeria strains from all species but generally did not affect other bacteria. Using hydrolysis of purified listerial cell walls, PLY511 was characterized as an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase (EC 3.5.1.28) and shows homology in its N-terminal domain to other enzymes of this type. In contrast, PLY118 and PLY500 were shown to represent a new class of cell wall lytic enzymes which cleave between the L-alanine and D-glutamate residues of listerial peptidoglycan; these were designated as L-alanoyl-D-glutamate peptidases. These two enzymes share homology in the N-terminal domain which we propose determines hydrolytic specificity. Highly conserved holin (hol) gene sequences are present upstream of ply118 and ply500. They encode proteins of structural similarity to the product of phage lambda gene S, and are predicted to be membrane proteins which form pores to allow access of the lysins to their peptidoglycan substrates. This arrangement of conserved holin genes with downstream lysin genes among the siphoviral lysis cassettes explains why the cytoplasmic endolysins alone are not lethal, since they require a specific transport function across the cell membrane.",molecular_sequence_data,0,10,11596.9,10812.83,11035.1,17128.22,17841.55,18275.4,5264.257

"Fusion of mammalian cells to form stable, non-dividing heterokaryons results in nuclear reprogramming without the exchange of genetic material. In this report, we show that reprogramming in somatic cell heterokaryons involves activation of the canonical skeletal muscle transcription factors as well as contraction-excitation genes. Thus, the effect of heterokaryon formation on gene expression is to induce a recapitulation of differentiation. Heterokaryons formed with a relatively refractory cell type, the hepatocyte cell line HepG2, revealed the importance of both MyoD expression and other unidentified cytoplasmic components, neither of which are sufficient for efficient muscle gene activation, but are synergistic. We provide evidence that de-repression by transient histone deacetylase inhibition can induce MyoD expression and increase the extent and efficiency of muscle gene transcription. Taken together, the results suggest that understanding the mechanistic basis, using a combination of approaches, and taking into account cell history, will facilitate an increase in the efficiency and fidelity of conversion from one differentiated phenotype to another desired cell type.

"Chitooligosaccharide (CO) has been reported to have potential antiobestic effects in a few studies, but the antiobesity properties of CO and its related mechanisms in models of dietary obesity remain unclear. We investigated the effect of CO on body weight gain, size of adipocytes, adipokines, and lipid profiles in high-fat (HF) diet-induced obese mice and on the gene expression in adipose tissue using a complementary DNA microarray approach to test the hypothesis that CO supplementation would alleviate HF diet-induced obesity by the alteration of adipose tissue-specific gene expression. Male C57BL/6N mice were fed a normal diet (control), HF diet, or CO-supplemented HF diet (1% or 3%) for 5 months. Compared with the HF diet mice, mice fed the 3% CO-supplemented diet gained 15% less weight but did not display any change in food and energy intake. Chitooligosaccharide supplementation markedly improved serum and hepatic lipid profiles. Histologic examination showed that epididymal adipocyte size was smaller in mice fed the HF + 3% CO. Microarray analysis showed that dietary CO supplementation modulated adipogenesis-related genes such as matrix metallopeptidases 3, 12, 13, and 14; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1; and cathepsin k in the adipose tissues. Twenty-five percent of the CO-responsive genes identified are involved in immune responses including the inflammatory response and cytokine production.

"Axons of the mammalian CNS lose the ability to regenerate soon after development due to both an inhibitory CNS environment and the loss of cell-intrinsic factors necessary for regeneration. The complex molecular events required for robust regeneration of mature neurons are not fully understood, particularly in vivo. To identify genes affecting axon regeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans, we performed both an RNAi-based screen for defective motor axon regeneration in unc-70/Î²-spectrin mutants and a candidate gene screen. From these screens, we identified at least 50 conserved genes with growth-promoting or growth-inhibiting functions. Through our analysis of mutants, we shed new light on certain aspects of regeneration, including the role of Î²-spectrin and membrane dynamics, the antagonistic activity of MAP kinase signaling pathways, and the role of stress in promoting axon regeneration.

"Lipids and cholesterol in particular, have long been associated with breast cancer (BC) onset and progression. However, the causative effects of elevated lipid levels and breast cancer remain largely undisclosed and were the subject of the present study.We took advantage of well-established in vitro and in vivo models of cholesterol enrichment to exploit the mechanism involved in LDL-cholesterol favouring BC growth and invasiveness. We analyzed its effects in models that mimic different BC subtypes and stages.Our data show that LDL-cholesterol (but not HDL-cholesterol) promotes BC cells proliferation, migration and loss of adhesion, hallmarks of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. In vivo studies modeling cholesterol levels showed that breast tumors are consistently larger and more proliferative in hypercholesterolemic mice, which also have more frequently lung metastases. Microarray analysis revealed an over expression of intermediates of Akt and ERK pathways suggesting a survival response induced by LDL, confirmed by WB analyses. Gene expression analysis also evidenced an activation of ErbB2 signaling pathway and decreased expression of adhesion molecules (cadherin-related family member3, CD226, Claudin 7 and Ocludin) in the cells exposed to LDL.Together, the present work shows novel mechanistic evidence that high LDL-cholesterol levels promote BC progression.

To evaluate the analgesic efficacy of a controlled-release morphine sulfate preparation, MS Contin tablets (MSC, Purdue Frederick, Toronto, Ontario, Canada), after a single dose and under steady-state conditions, the authors compared MSC administered every 12 hours with morphine oral solution (MOS) administered every 4 hours in 17 adult cancer patients with chronic severe pain. In the single-dose evaluation, in which the patients were randomly assigned to receive MSC or MOS, there were no significant differences in analgesic efficacy or requirement for supplemental morphine between the two treatments. With both preparations, pain severity ratings increased toward the end of the 12-hour, single-dose observation period and were higher than the pain scores reported after dose titration. In the steady-state evaluation, which was a randomized crossover comparison, both preparations provided effective pain control with minimal side effects. There was no significant difference between MSC and MOS in overall pain scores or in pain scores analyzed by time of day and day of therapy. In conclusion, that an individualized twice-daily regimen of MSC is as effective as 4-hourly MOS for the control of chronic severe cancer pain.

"LKB1, a tumor-suppressor gene that codifies for a serine/threonine kinase, is mutated in the germ-line of patients affected with the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), which have an increased incidence of several cancers including gastrointestinal, pancreatic and lung carcinomas. Regarding tumors arising in non-PJS patients, we recently observed that at least one-third of lung adenocarcinomas (LADs) harbor somatic LKB1 gene mutations, supporting a role for LKB1 in the origin of some sporadic tumors. To characterize the pattern of LKB1 mutations in LADs further, we first screened for LKB1 gene alterations (gene mutations, promoter hypermethylation and homozygous deletions) in 19 LADs and, in agreement with our previous data, five of them (26%) were shown to harbor mutations, all of which gave rise to a truncated protein. Recent reports demonstrate that LKB1 is able to suppress cell growth, but little is known about the specific mechanism by which it functions. To further our understanding of LKB1 function, we analysed global expression in lung primary tumors using cDNA microarrays to identify LKB1-specific variations in gene expression. In all, 34 transcripts, 24 of which corresponded to known genes, differed significantly between tumors with and without LKB1 gene alterations. Among the most remarkable findings was deregulation of transcripts involved in signal transduction (e.g. FRAP1/mTOR, ARAF1 and ROCK2), cytoskeleton (e.g. MPP1), transcription factors (e.g. MEIS2, ATF5), metabolism of AMP (AMPD3 and APRT) and ubiquitinization (e.g. USP16 and UBE2L3). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR on 15 tumors confirmed the upregulation of the homeobox MEIS2 and of the AMP-metabolism AMPD3 transcripts in LKB1-mutant tumors. In addition, immunohistochemistry in 10 of the lung tumors showed the absence of phosphorylated FRAP1/mTOR protein in LKB1-mutant tumors, indicating that LKB1 mutations do not lead to FRAP1/mTOR protein kinase activation. In conclusion, our results reveal that several important factors contribute to LKB1-mediated carcinogenesis in LADs, confirming previous observations and identifying new putative pathways that should help to elucidate the biological role of LKB1.",signal_transduction,0,6,9864.0,9576.901,9636.207,14905.84,16196.96,16216.55,4636.466
"To determine the types of subcutaneous adiposity represented by different measurements of skinfold thickness that are associated with birth weight in white (n=759), Black (n=916) and Hispanic (n=813) American children aged 5-11 y. We also determined the contribution of birth weight to ethnic differences in subcutaneous and central adiposity.

Data for this analysis were from the Third US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The outcome measures were triceps, subscapular, suprailiac and thigh skinfold thicknesses at 5-11 y of age. Central adiposity was defined as ratios of subscapular to triceps (STR) and central-peripheral (CPR) (subscapular+suprailiac)/(triceps+thigh) skinfolds. Partial correlation analyses were used to determine the association between birth weight and measures of subcutaneous fatness, while multiple linear regression analyses were used to determine the independent contribution of birth weight to ethnicity variations in subcutaneous and central adiposity adjusting for sex, age and BMI.

Overall, birth weight was negatively associated with subscapular skinfold and central adiposity in White, Black and Hispanic American children (P &<0.05). Birth weight was also negatively associated with suprailliac skinfold in both Blacks and Hispanics (P &<0.01) and with sum of the four skinfolds in Blacks (P &<0.05). Compared with White, Black ethnicity was negatively associated with triceps, suprailliac thigh and sum of skinfold thicknesses controlling for birth weight, sex, age and BMI (P &<0.01). Compared with White, Hispanic ethnicity was negatively associated with triceps, thigh and sum of skinfold thicknesses (P &<0.01). Both Black and Hispanic ethnicity was positively associated with STR and CPR (P &<0.01).

In this population of American children, the association of birth weights with subcutaneous and central fat accumulation may be due to fetal programming. Since the impact of fetal conditions is likely to be modified by life course, defining the interaction between factors that are present at birth and subsequent exposures is one of the essential challenges for future research.",obesity,0.2,5,8591.995,6588.264,6762.748,14514.73,14501.7,14689.47,4898.643
"Mobile elements that use reverse transcriptase to make new copies of themselves are found in all major lineages of eukaryotes. The non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons have been suggested to be the oldest of these eukaryotic elements. Phylogenetic analysis of non-LTR elements suggests that they have predominantly undergone vertical transmission, as opposed to the frequent horizontal transmissions found for other mobile elements. One prediction of this vertical model of inheritance is that the oldest lineages of eukaryotes should exclusively harbor the oldest lineages of non-LTR retrotransposons. Here we characterize the non-LTR retrotransposons present in one of the most primitive eukaryotes, the diplomonad Giardia lamblia. Two families of elements were detected in the WB isolate of G. lamblia currently being used for the genome sequencing project. These elements are clearly distinct from all other previously described non-LTR lineages. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that these Genie elements (for Giardia early non-LTR insertion element) are among the oldest known lineages of non-LTR elements consistent with strict vertical descent. Genie elements encode a single open reading frame with a carboxyl terminal endonuclease domain. Genie 1 is site specific, as seven to eight copies are present in a single tandem array of a 771-bp repeat near the telomere of one chromosome. The function of this repeat is not known. One additional, highly divergent, element within the Genie 1 lineage is not located in this tandem array but is near a second telomere. Four different telomere addition sites could be identified within or near the Genie elements on each of these chromosomes. The second lineage of non-LTR elements, Genie 2, is composed of about 10 degenerate copies. Genie 2 elements do not appear to be site specific in their insertion. An unusual aspect of Genie 2 is that all copies contain inverted repeats up to 172 bp in length.",molecular_sequence_data,0,2,6343.635,5054.898,5089.128,11247.87,10461.39,10541.54,4421.804
"Childhood maltreatment has been implicated as a risk factor for adult obesity. We describe the first prospective assessment of adult obesity in individuals with documented histories of childhood physical and sexual abuse and neglect and a matched comparison group in a 30-year follow-up. Using a prospective cohort design, children with court substantiated cases of physical and sexual abuse and neglect (ages 0-11 years) from a Midwest county during 1967-1971 (n=410) were matched with children without histories of abuse or neglect on age, sex, race/ethnicity and approximate family social class (n=303) and followed up and assessed at mean age 41. Outcome measures include BMI and obesity assessed in 2003-2004 as part of a medical status examination and interview. Childhood physical abuse predicted significantly higher BMI scores in adulthood (beta=0.14, P&<.05), even controlling for demographic characteristics, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption (beta=0.16, P&<.01). Childhood sexual abuse (beta=0.07, not significant) and neglect (beta=0.02, not significant) were not significant predictors of adult BMI scores. These results demonstrate the long-term impact of childhood physical abuse on weight into adulthood and suggest that physically abused children may be at risk for other adverse health outcomes associated with increased weight. Health professionals need to understand this risk for physically abused children and researchers should identify and evaluate strategies for effective interventions.",obesity,0,3,7461.314,5869.087,5857.433,13197.01,13973.49,14343.18,5033.153

"Tumours behave as complex, self-organizing, opportunistic dynamic systems. In an attempt to better understand and describe the highly complicated tumour behaviour, a novel four-dimensional simulation model of in vivo tumour growth and response to radiotherapy has been developed. This paper presents the latest improvements to the model as well as a parametric validation of it. Improvements include an advanced algorithm leading to conformal tumour shrinkage, a quantitative consideration of the influence of oxygenation on radiosensitivity and a more realistic, imaging based description of the neovasculature distribution. The tumours selected for the validation of the model are a wild type and a mutated p53 gene glioblastomas multiforme. According to the model predictions, a whole tumour with larger cell cycle duration tends to repopulate more slowly. A lower oxygen enhancement ratio value leads to a more radiosensitive whole tumour. Higher clonogenic cell density (CCD) produces a higher number of proliferating tumour cells and, therefore, a more difficult tumour to treat. Simulation predictions agree at least semi-quantitatively with clinical experience, and particularly with the outcome of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) Study 83-02. It is stressed that the model allows a quantitative study of the interrelationship between the competing influences in a complex, dynamic tumour environment. Therefore, the model can already be useful as an educational tool with which to study, understand and demonstrate the role of various parameters in tumour growth and response to irradiation.

"Cell invasion through a dense three-dimensional (3D) matrix is believed to depend on the ability of cells to generate traction forces. To quantify the role of cell tractions during invasion in 3D, we present a technique to measure the elastic strain energy stored in the matrix due to traction-induced deformations. The matrix deformations around a cell were measured by tracking the 3D positions of fluorescent beads tightly embedded in the matrix. The bead positions served as nodes for a finite element tessellation. From the strain in each element and the known matrix elasticity, we computed the local strain energy in the matrix surrounding the cell. We applied the technique to measure the strain energy of highly invasive MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma and A-125 lung carcinoma cells in collagen gels. The results were compared to the strain energy generated by non-invasive MCF-7 breast and A-549 lung carcinoma cells. In all cases, cells locally contracted the matrix. Invasive breast and lung carcinoma cells showed a significantly higher contractility compared to non-invasive cells. Higher contractility, however, was not universally associated with higher invasiveness. For instance, non-invasive A-431 vulva carcinoma cells were the most contractile cells among all cell lines tested. As a universal feature, however, we found that invasive cells assumed an elongated spindle-like morphology as opposed to a more spherical shape of non-invasive cells. Accordingly, the distribution of strain energy density around invasive cells followed patterns of increased complexity and anisotropy. These results suggest that not so much the magnitude of traction generation but their directionality is important for cancer cell invasion.",neoplasms,0,6,7495.545,6356.463,6435.672,15527.04,14786.14,14935.46,2979.793

"Transforming growth factor Î² (TGF-Î²)-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is a key regulator in the signals transduced by proinflammatory cytokines and Toll-like receptors (TLRs). The regulatory mechanism of TAK1 in response to various tissue types and stimuli remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) negatively regulates TLR-mediated signals by inhibiting TAK1 activity. S6K1 overexpression causes a marked reduction in NF-ÎºB and AP-1 activity induced by stimulation of TLR2 or TLR4. In contrast, S6K1(-/-) and S6K1 knockdown cells display enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, S6K1(-/-) mice exhibit decreased survival in response to challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We found that S6K1 inhibits TAK1 kinase activity by interfering with the interaction between TAK1 and TAB1, which is a key regulator protein for TAK1 catalytic function. Upon stimulation with TLR ligands, S6K1 deficiency causes a marked increase in TAK1 kinase activity that in turn induces a substantial enhancement of NF-ÎºB-dependent gene expression, indicating that S6K1 is negatively involved in the TLR signaling pathway by the inhibition of TAK1 activity. Our findings contribute to understanding the molecular pathogenesis of the impaired immune responses seen in type 2 diabetes, where S6K1 plays a key role both in driving insulin resistance and modulating TLR signaling.",cell_line_tumor,0,9,13760.06,13065.53,13340.33,24203.1,27063.33,27418.51,5903.995
"Lentinula edodes has traditionally been grown on fallen logs. It produces a wide array of enzymes to digest the lignocellulolytic substrate for nutrients. Thus, this organism represents a rich source of potentially potent lignocellulolytic enzymes that can be harnessed for conversion of biomass to simple sugars.

We have cloned two cellulase genes from L. edodes grown on a wood substrate without the use of genomic or cDNA libraries by using a PCR-based strategy employing degenerate primers directed at the cellulose-binding domain. cel7A encoded a 516-amino acid protein that belonged to glycosyl hydrolase family 7 and had sequence similarities to cbhI genes from other fungi. cel6B encoded a 444-amino acid protein that belonged to glycosyl hydrolase family 6 and had sequence similarities to cbhII genes from other fungi.

"Recently, a subtype of obesity characterized as a metabolically healthy but obese (MHO) individual has been identified. However, limited data are available on these MHO individuals' metabolic and inflammatory profiles, and the effect of weight loss on these profiles. We investigated metabolic and inflammatory markers in MHO women to determine the effects of a 12-week weight loss on those markers.

One hundred and twenty-nine overweight-obese Korean women participated for 12 weeks in a clinical intervention study involving a 300 kcal/day intake reduction. The subjects were divided into two groups: MHO and metabolically abnormal obese (MAO) individuals.

Computed tomography was performed. C-reactive protein (CRP), interkeukin-6 (IL-6) and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL), as well as blood lipids, glucose and insulin concentrations were determined at baseline and after weight loss.

At baseline, plasma CRP (P&<.001), IL-6 (P&<.05) and oxidized LDL (P&<.001) levels were significantly lower in the MHO group than in the MAO group. Visceral fat at L1 (P&<.005) and visceral fat at L4 (P&<.001) were significantly lower in the MHO group than in the MAO group. The treatment induced weight loss averaging 3.11% of initial body weight, and the degree of weight loss between the two groups was similar. Visceral fat at L1 and L4 was reduced from its initial values by 3.2 and 5.4%, respectively, after weight loss. The levels of CRP (P&<.05) and oxidized LDL (P&<.01) were significantly reduced in the MAO group after the 12-week weight loss, whereas these effects were not seen in the MHO group.

Our results showed that MHO individuals exhibited lower visceral fat accumulation and more favorable metabolic and inflammatory states than MAO individuals. After a 12-week weight loss program, significant reductions in blood lipids, CRP and oxidized LDL levels were observed in MAO individuals.

"One hundred and nine patients suffering from various malignancies underwent 285 apheresis procedures for PBPC collection. A median of two leukaphereses (range: 2-5) resulted in median numbers of 4.6 x 10(8) MNC/kg, 14.1 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg, and 6.0 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg. Preleukapheresis peripheral blood CD34+ cells correlated significantly with collected CD34+ cells/kg (r = 0.94; p &lt; 0.0001) and with CFU-GM/kg (r = 0.52; p &lt; 0.0001). A value &gt; 4 x 10(4) CD34+ cells/ml was highly predictive for a collection yield &gt; 2.5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg harvested by a single leukapheresis. Sixty patients were evaluated for hematologic reconstitution and engrafted in a median time of 10 days for WBC &gt; 1.0 x 10(9)/l (range: 7-21 days), 10 days for ANC &gt; 0.5 x 10(9)/l (7-20) and 11 days for PLT &gt; 20 x 10(9)/l (7-62). Reinfused CD34+ cells/kg correlated significantly with hematologic engraftment (r = 0.44-0.52 and p &lt; 0.006-0.001) as well as CFU-GM/kg (r = 0.36-0.44 and p &lt; 0.007-0.001). A progenitor cell dose &gt; 2.5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg or &gt; 8.0 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg led to a significantly faster recovery for WBC, ANC, and PLT when compared with patients receiving &lt; 2.5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg or &lt; 8.0 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg.

"In the present study, we examined the mechanisms through which erythropoietin (Epo) activates the calcium-permeable transient receptor potential protein channel (TRPC)2. Erythroblasts were isolated from the spleens of phenylhydrazine-treated mice, and Epo stimulation resulted in a significant and dose-dependent increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)). This increase in [Ca(2+)](i) was inhibited by pretreatment with the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U-73122 but not by the inactive analog U-73343, demonstrating the requirement for PLC activity in Epo-modulated Ca(2+) influx in primary erythroid cells. To determine whether PLC is involved in the activation of TRPC2 by Epo, cell models were used to examine this interaction. Single CHO-S cells that expressed transfected Epo receptor (Epo-R) and TRPC2 were identified, and [Ca(2+)](i) was quantitated. Epo-induced Ca(2+) influx through TRPC2 was inhibited by pretreatment with U-73122 or by downregulation of PLCgamma1 by RNA interference. PLC activation results in the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)), and TRPC2 has IP(3) receptor (IP(3)R) binding sites. To determine whether IP(3)R is involved in Epo-R signaling, TRPC2 mutants were prepared with partial or complete deletions of the COOH-terminal IP(3)R binding domains. In cells expressing TRPC2 IP(3)R binding mutants and Epo-R, no significant increase in [Ca(2+)](i) was observed after Epo stimulation. TRPC2 coassociated with Epo-R, PLCgamma, and IP(3)R, and the association between TRPC2 and IP(3)R was disrupted in these mutants.

"Proper blood vessel formation is essential in health and is often dysregulated in ischaemic diseases. Therefore, regulatory mechanisms that control angiogenesis and arteriogenesis are required to improve treatment of ischaemic diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of homeobox transcription factor HoxB5 overexpression during revascularization in ischaemic disease.

To assess the effect of HoxB5 overexpression on blood vessel formation in vivo, we subjected C57BL/6 mice to femoral artery ligation with local intramuscular injection of HoxB5 or green fluorescent protein control adenoviral vectors. Laser Doppler perfusion imaging revealed that HoxB5 enhanced perfusion restoration in mice and immunohistochemistry analysis revealed increased capillary density. To identify a potential mechanism of HoxB5 in blood vessel formation, a 'proteome-profiler' array was performed. HoxB5 overexpression in endothelial cells increased the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules such as monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in vitro and in vivo. Functionally, HoxB5 enhanced monocyte as well as endothelial cell migration in vitro and increased leucocyte infiltration into ischaemic tissues. HoxB5-induced migration of monocytes was antagonized by the presence of an MCP-1 blocking antibody.

"The persistent circulation of hepatitis A virus (HAV) in the Mediterranean area suggests the need for monitoring its presence in the environment. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the presence of HAV in several consecutive raw sewage and final effluent samples, collected over an 8-month period from an activated sludge treatment plant in southern Italy.

Two distinct purification protocols, either based on antigen-capture with monoclonal antibody (AC) or RNA extraction, were compared. The possible influence of the antibody used in the AC phase was evaluated in preliminary experiments on HAV-spiked samples, using two different monoclonal antibodies. Hepatitis A virus RNA was detected in all but one sewage environmental sample examined. The contemporary presence of enteroviruses, reoviruses and phages was observed, while HAV growth in cell culture was hampered.

The RT-PCR technique was confirmed to be a valuable tool for the rapid monitoring of HAV in sewage samples. In addition, this study demonstrated that application of different sample purification methods can result in different levels of sensitivity of the assay and that, in the antigen-capture method, the choice of antibody can have a crucial role.

"Diffuse optical tomography allows quantification of hemoglobin, oxygen saturation, and water in tissue, and the fidelity in this quantification is dependent on the accuracy of optical properties determined during image reconstruction. In this study, a three-step algorithm is proposed and validated that uses the standard Newton minimization with Levenberg-Marquardt regularization as the first step. The second step is a modification to the existing algorithm using a two-parameter regularization to allow lower damping in a region of interest as compared to background. This second stage allows the recovery of the actual size of an inclusion. A region-based reconstruction is the final third step, which uses the estimated size and position information from step 2 to yield quantitatively accurate average values for the optical parameters. The algorithm is tested on simulated and experimental data and is found to be insensitive to object contrast and position. The percentage error between the true and the average recovered value for the absorption coefficient in test images is reduced from 47 to 27% for a 10-mm inclusion, from 38 to 13% for a 15-mm anomaly, and from 28 to 5.5% for a 20-mm heterogeneity. Simulated data with absorbing and scattering heterogeneities of 15 mm diam located in different positions show recovery with less than 15% error in absorption and 6% error in reduced scattering coefficients. The algorithm is successfully applied to clinical data from a subject with a breast abnormality to yield quantitatively increased absorption coefficients, which enhances the contrast to 3.8 compared to 1.23 previously.",algorithms,0,0,4214.477,4109.973,4199.882,8467.887,8778.223,9159.681,1409.241
"We describe eight members from two large Amish kindreds who share a phenotype characterized by early-onset pigmentary retinopathy and myopia, global developmental delay and mental retardation, microcephaly, short stature, hypotonia, joint hyperextensibility, small hands and feet, common facial appearance, and friendly disposition. Several of the children had intermittent granulocytopenia. The phenotypic occurrence in three siblings coupled with the increased coefficient of inbreeding in the Amish suggested that this disorder is autosomal recessive and due to a single founder allele. Despite similarity to the clinical features of Cohen syndrome, experienced dysmorphologists attending the 23rd David W. Smith Workshop suggested the facial gestalt of the Amish children was inconsistent with this diagnosis. We mapped the locus responsible for these individuals' phenotype to chromosome 8q22-q23, which contains the recently discovered Cohen syndrome gene, COH1. Complete sequencing of the COH1 gene identified a likely disease-causing frameshift mutation and a missense mutation in the Amish patients. A comparison of features among different Cohen syndrome populations with shared linkage to the COH1 locus or known COH1 gene mutations may allow for the determination of improved clinical criteria on which to suspect the diagnosis of Cohen syndrome. We conclude that facial gestalt seems to be an unreliable indicator of Cohen syndrome between ethnic populations, although it is quite consistent among affected individuals within a particular ethnic group. Other features common to almost all individuals with proven COH1 mutations, such as retinal dystrophy, myopia, microcephaly, mental retardation, global developmental delay, hypotonia, and joint hyperextensibility appear to be better clinical indicators of this disorder.",obesity,0,0,8028.047,7391.293,7481.03,15427.53,15229.03,15551.26,4805.378
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging viral infectious disease. The SARS outbreak in Singapore started in mid-March 2003. Emergency departments, being the primary portal of entry into the hospitals, had to come up with rapid strategic changes and modifications to accommodate and manage this public health problem effectively. This report discusses the changes in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Singapore General Hospital, the largest public, teaching and tertiary hospital in Singapore, during this outbreak.

"Fusion of mammalian cells to form stable, non-dividing heterokaryons results in nuclear reprogramming without the exchange of genetic material. In this report, we show that reprogramming in somatic cell heterokaryons involves activation of the canonical skeletal muscle transcription factors as well as contraction-excitation genes. Thus, the effect of heterokaryon formation on gene expression is to induce a recapitulation of differentiation. Heterokaryons formed with a relatively refractory cell type, the hepatocyte cell line HepG2, revealed the importance of both MyoD expression and other unidentified cytoplasmic components, neither of which are sufficient for efficient muscle gene activation, but are synergistic. We provide evidence that de-repression by transient histone deacetylase inhibition can induce MyoD expression and increase the extent and efficiency of muscle gene transcription. Taken together, the results suggest that understanding the mechanistic basis, using a combination of approaches, and taking into account cell history, will facilitate an increase in the efficiency and fidelity of conversion from one differentiated phenotype to another desired cell type. Inherent advantages of the heterokaryon system merit further investigation in the pursuit of directed cloning.",cell_line_tumor,0.2,7,7310.65,6042.963,6067.823,11859.66,11596.98,11641.46,3143.457
"Axons of the mammalian CNS lose the ability to regenerate soon after development due to both an inhibitory CNS environment and the loss of cell-intrinsic factors necessary for regeneration. The complex molecular events required for robust regeneration of mature neurons are not fully understood, particularly in vivo. To identify genes affecting axon regeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans, we performed both an RNAi-based screen for defective motor axon regeneration in unc-70/Î²-spectrin mutants and a candidate gene screen. From these screens, we identified at least 50 conserved genes with growth-promoting or growth-inhibiting functions. Through our analysis of mutants, we shed new light on certain aspects of regeneration, including the role of Î²-spectrin and membrane dynamics, the antagonistic activity of MAP kinase signaling pathways, and the role of stress in promoting axon regeneration.

"Chitooligosaccharide (CO) has been reported to have potential antiobestic effects in a few studies, but the antiobesity properties of CO and its related mechanisms in models of dietary obesity remain unclear. We investigated the effect of CO on body weight gain, size of adipocytes, adipokines, and lipid profiles in high-fat (HF) diet-induced obese mice and on the gene expression in adipose tissue using a complementary DNA microarray approach to test the hypothesis that CO supplementation would alleviate HF diet-induced obesity by the alteration of adipose tissue-specific gene expression. Male C57BL/6N mice were fed a normal diet (control), HF diet, or CO-supplemented HF diet (1% or 3%) for 5 months. Compared with the HF diet mice, mice fed the 3% CO-supplemented diet gained 15% less weight but did not display any change in food and energy intake. Chitooligosaccharide supplementation markedly improved serum and hepatic lipid profiles. Histologic examination showed that epididymal adipocyte size was smaller in mice fed the HF + 3% CO. Microarray analysis showed that dietary CO supplementation modulated adipogenesis-related genes such as matrix metallopeptidases 3, 12, 13, and 14; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1; and cathepsin k in the adipose tissues. Twenty-five percent of the CO-responsive genes identified are involved in immune responses including the inflammatory response and cytokine production.

"Admission, and non-admission, in intensive care units (ICU) for oncologic patients are discussed in this review. Medical, ethical and economical concerns have to be considered. We are in favor of a flexible attitude, aimed at avoiding two pitfalls: first, not to allow to a patient to benefit of intensive treatment when available and useful, and, second, to impose to a patient difficult and painful therapy if the survival chance is minimal. The patient must be a partner for the decision to admit him or her in the ICU. In addition, it is important to be aware that, during the last few years, the prognosis of the oncologic patients treated in the ICU is continuously improving.

"Listeria monocytogenes bacteriophages A118, A500 and A511 are members of three distinct phage groups with characteristic host ranges. Their endolysin (ply) genes were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as demonstrated by the conferred lytic phenotype when colonies of recombinant cells were overlaid with a lawn of Listeria cells. The nucleotide sequences of the cloned DNA fragments were determined and the individual enzymes (PLY118, 30.8 kDa; PLY500, 33.4 kDa; PLY511, 36.5 kDa) were shown to have varying degrees of homology within their N-terminal or C-terminal domains. Transcriptional analysis revealed them to be 'late' genes with transcription beginning 15-20 min post-infection. The enzymes were overexpressed and partially purified and their individual specificities examined. When applied exogenously, the lysins induced rapid lysis of Listeria strains from all species but generally did not affect other bacteria. Using hydrolysis of purified listerial cell walls, PLY511 was characterized as an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase (EC 3.5.1.28) and shows homology in its N-terminal domain to other enzymes of this type. In contrast, PLY118 and PLY500 were shown to represent a new class of cell wall lytic enzymes which cleave between the L-alanine and D-glutamate residues of listerial peptidoglycan; these were designated as L-alanoyl-D-glutamate peptidases. These two enzymes share homology in the N-terminal domain which we propose determines hydrolytic specificity. Highly conserved holin (hol) gene sequences are present upstream of ply118 and ply500. They encode proteins of structural similarity to the product of phage lambda gene S, and are predicted to be membrane proteins which form pores to allow access of the lysins to their peptidoglycan substrates. This arrangement of conserved holin genes with downstream lysin genes among the siphoviral lysis cassettes explains why the cytoplasmic endolysins alone are not lethal, since they require a specific transport function across the cell membrane.",molecular_sequence_data,0,9,11596.9,10812.83,11035.1,17128.22,17841.55,18275.4,5264.257
"Radiolabelling of leukocytes using labelled phagocytosed technetium-99m (99mTc) colloidal radiopharmaceuticals has been reported as a method for imaging infection. This in vivo study compares the use of leukocytes labelled using 99mTc stannous fluoride colloid with leukocytes labelled using indium-111 (111In) oxinate. A total of 26 patients (10 male, 16 female; mean age 52 years, range 23-88 years) referred for the investigation of possible infection were studied using both leukocyte labelling methods simultaneously. Images were acquired 4h and 24h after re-injection of the labelled cells. The images were evaluated qualitatively by two nuclear medicine physicians. The results show a high degree of concordance between the techniques: 11 of the 28 images showed a focus of leukocyte accumulation with both techniques at 24h, and 13 out of 28 showed a normal appearance at 24h with both methods. In four cases the results were discordant; the 99mTc stannous fluoride colloid labelled leukocytes gave a false positive appearance at 24h in three patients and a false negative in one. In conclusion, colloid labelling of leukocytes offers a sensitive method for the detection of infective foci coupled with the high resolution imaging offered by 99mTc. It has the advantage over other in vitro labelling methods of being a simpler, non-labour-intensive procedure employing whole blood, and its use should be considered by departments that have limited facilities for in vitro leukocyte labelling.",magnetic_resonance_imaging,0,10,6803.869,6184.642,6229.296,14779.09,16634.35,16829.91,3388.285
"For many years, bacterial cells were considered primarily as selfish individuals, but, in recent years, it has become evident that, far from operating in isolation, they coordinate collective behaviour in response to environmental challenges using sophisticated intercellular communication networks. Cell-to-cell communication between bacteria is mediated by small diffusible signal molecules that trigger changes in gene expression in response to fluctuations in population density. This process, generally referred to as quorum sensing (QS), controls diverse phenotypes in numerous Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Recent advances have revealed that bacteria are not limited to communication within their own species but are capable of 'listening in' and 'broadcasting to' unrelated species to intercept messages and coerce cohabitants into behavioural modifications, either for the good of the population or for the benefit of one species over another. It is also evident that QS is not limited to the bacterial kingdom. The study of two-way intercellular signalling networks between bacteria and both uni- and multicellular eukaryotes as well as between eukaryotes is just beginning to unveil a rich diversity of communication pathways.",signal_transduction,0,5,6577.037,4628.403,4467.743,10718.41,10681.02,10368.86,3839.325
"The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV, also called human herpesvirus 8) has been linked to KS and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) in immunocompromised individuals. We report that PEL cell lines have constitutive active alternative NF-kappa B pathway and demonstrate high-level expression of NF-kappa B2/p100 precursor and its processed subunit p52. To elucidate the mechanism of activation of the alternative NF-kappa B pathway in PEL cells, we have investigated the role of KSHV-encoded viral Fas-associated death domain-like IL- beta 1-converting enzyme inhibitory protein (vFLIP) K13. We demonstrate that stable expression of K13, but not other FLIPs, in a variety of cell lines constitutively up-regulates p100/NF-kappa B2 expression and leads to its processing into the p52 subunit. K13-induced up-regulation and processing of p100 critically depends on the I kappa B kinase (IKK)alpha/IKK1 subunit of the IKK complex, whereas IKK beta/IKK2, receptor-interacting protein, and NF-kappa B-inducing kinase are dispensable for this process. Silencing of endogenous K13 expression by siRNA inhibits p100 processing and cellular proliferation. Our results demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that KSHV vFLIP K13 is required for the growth and proliferation of PEL cells and alternative NF-kappa B pathway plays a key role in this process.

"It is unclear whether the increased risk of colon cancer associated with obesity differs for men and women, by distribution of body fat, or by location of the tumor. The primary goal of this study was to address these questions.

Eligible subjects from the Framingham Study cohort were classified according to body mass index (BMI) and waist size during two age periods: 30-54 y (n=3764) and 55-79 y (n=3802). All eligible men and women were cancer-free at baseline and had complete information on the following potential confounders: age, sex, education, height, activity, smoking, and alcohol. There were 157 incident lifetime cases of colon cancer among those followed beginning at 30-54 y of age and 149 lifetime cases among those whose follow up began at 55-79 y. Subjects were stratified further by gender, activity, and tumor location. The Cox Proportional Hazards Models were used to adjust for possible confounding by the above-described factors.

A BMI&>/=30 led to a 50% increased risk (95% CI: 0.92-2.5) of colon cancer among middle-aged (30-54 y) and a 2.4-fold increased risk (95% CI: 1.5-3.9) among older (55-79 y) adults. The BMI effect was stronger for men than for women and for cases occurring in the proximal colon. These adverse effects generally diminished when waist was added to the multivariable models. A larger waist size &>/=99.1 cm (39 in) and 101.6 cm (40 in) for women and men, respectively) was associated with a two-fold increased risk of colon cancer; this risk increased linearly with increasing waist size and was evident for both proximal and distal colon cancer. There was no attenuation of these effects when BMI was added to the multivariable models. A larger waist had a particularly adverse effect among sedentary subjects (relative risk (RR)=4.4 for middle-aged adults; RR=3.0 for older adults).

"Adenylate kinase (AK)-catalyzed phosphotransfer is essential in the maintenance of cellular energetic economy in cells of fully differentiated tissues with highly variable energy demand, such as muscle and brain. To investigate if AK isoenzymes have a comparable function in the energy-demand management of proliferating cells, AK1 and AK1beta were expressed in mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells and in human colon carcinoma SW480 cells. Glucose deprivation, galactose feeding, and metabolic inhibitor tests revealed a differential energy dependency for these two cell lines. N2a cells showed a faster proliferation rate and strongest coupling to mitochondrial activity, SW480 proliferation was more dependent on glycolysis. Despite these differences, ectopic expression of AK1 or AK1beta did not affect their growth characteristics under normal conditions. Also, no differential effects were seen under metabolic stress upon treatment with mitochondrial and glycolytic inhibitors in in vitro culture or in solid tumors grown in vivo.

"Astrocyte swelling is an integral component of cytotoxic brain edema in ischemic injury. While mechanisms underlying astrocyte swelling are likely multifactorial, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are hypothesized to contribute to such swelling. We investigated the protective effects of cinnamon polyphenol extract (CPE) that has anti-oxidant and insulin-potentiating effects on cell swelling and depolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) in ischemic injury. C6 glial cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and cell volume determined using the 3-O-methyl-[3H]-glucose method at 90 min after the end of OGD. When compared with controls, OGD increased cell volume by 34%. This increase was blocked by CPE or insulin but not by blockers of oxidative/nitrosative stress including vitamin E, resveratrol, N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) or uric acid. Mitochondrial dysfunction, a key component of ischemic injury, contributes to cell swelling. Changes in DeltaPsi(m) were assessed at the end of OGD with tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE), a potentiometric dye. OGD induced a 39% decline in DeltaPsi(m) and this decline was blocked by CPE as well as insulin. To test the involvement of the mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT), we used Cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressant and a blocker of the mPT pore. CsA blocked cell swelling and the decline in DeltaPsi(m) but FK506, an immunosuppressant that does not block the mPT, did not. Our results show that CPE reduces OGD-induced cell swelling as well as the decline in DeltaPsi(m) in cultures and some of its protective effects may be through inhibiting the mPT.",cell_line_tumor,0.4,6,8480.294,6988.532,6974.908,13534.94,14721.74,14388.13,4891.007
"Race is strongly associated with risk for metabolic dysfunction, but there is limited prospective data concerning the impact of race on antipsychotic metabolic outcomes among patients with schizophrenia.

This study is a post hoc analysis of data from a 26-week, double-blind, randomized trial of aripiprazole (N = 155) and olanzapine (N = 159) conducted from April 2000 through June 2001 in patients aged&>or= 18 years with acute schizophrenia according to DSM-IV criteria. The data were analyzed on the basis of racial breakdown: white and black/Hispanic. Between-drug and within-drug outcomes were analyzed separately for each racial cohort across weight, lipid, and glucose parameters.

For white subjects (N = 167), olanzapine significantly worsened all metabolic parameters except high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and fasting glucose, and this was significantly different than aripiprazole for every outcome except fasting glucose. In the black/Hispanic cohort (N = 137), olanzapine treatment resulted in adverse metabolic outcomes, and these changes were significantly different from aripiprazole for adiposity, total cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol. Aripiprazole decreased the odds of endpoint metabolic syndrome compared with olanzapine for all subjects (OR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.19 to 0.55), the white cohort (OR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.41), and black/Hispanic subjects (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.25 to 1.12), but the black/Hispanic result was not statistically significant (p = .096). Within the aripiprazole group, white subjects had significantly lower risk for metabolic syndrome, but there was no significant difference in metabolic syndrome between white and black/Hispanic subjects exposed to olanzapine.

Race may be an important moderator of metabolic risk during atypical antipsychotic therapy.

"During chronic injury a population of bipotent hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) become     activated to regenerate both cholangiocytes and hepatocytes. Here we show in human diseased     liver and mouse models of the ductular reaction that Notch and Wnt signaling direct     specification of HPCs via their interactions with activated myofibroblasts or macrophages. In     particular, we found that during biliary regeneration, expression of Jagged 1 (a Notch ligand)     by myofibroblasts promoted Notch signaling in HPCs and thus their biliary specification to     cholangiocytes. Alternatively, during hepatocyte regeneration, macrophage engulfment of     hepatocyte debris induced Wnt3a expression. This resulted in canonical Wnt signaling in nearby HPCs, thus maintaining expression of Numb (a cell fate determinant) within these cells and the promotion of their specification to hepatocytes.

"Video capsule enteroscopy (VCE) has revolutionized small bowel imaging, enabling visual examination of the mucosa of the entire small bowel, while MR enteroclysis (MRE) and CT enteroclysis (CTE) have largely replaced conventional barium enteroclysis. A new indication for MRE and CTE is the clinical suspicion of small bowel strictures, as indicated by delayed or non-delivery of a test capsule given before a VCE examination, to exclude stenosis. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical value of subsequent MRE and CTE in patients in whom a test capsule did not present itself in due time.

Seventy-five consecutive patients were identified with a delayed or unnoticed delivery of the test capsule. Seventy patients consented to participate and underwent MRE (44) or CTE (26). The medical records and imaging studies were retrospectively reviewed and symptoms, laboratory results and imaging findings recorded.

"A technique is developed to minimize magnetic resonance pulse sequence dead-periods, with first and higher moment requirements, while imaging in oblique planes. Dead-period requirements of starting amplitude, ending amplitudes, area, and other moment requirements are transformed from the image coordinate system to the physical gradient coordinate system, where the waveforms are then designed. With this technique, the full capabilities of the gradient hardware are utilized. An online algorithm is presented to perform dead-period minimization and gradient waveform design when the first moment and area of the dead-period are specified. The algorithm is then used to implement three-axis flow-compensation in a fast spoiled gradient-echo sequence. This results in a minimal increase in TE and TR over an equivalent non-flow-compensated sequence, and little variation in the minimum TR over the entire range of oblique slice orientations.

"The gene (cbpA) coding for a carotenoid-binding protein of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 (Anacystis nidulans R2) has been cloned and sequenced. A polyclonal antibody against the protein was used to identify immunoreactive clones from a lambda gt11 expression library of Synechococcus strain PCC 7942. The initial positive clone (lambda gtAN42) contained a 0.9-kilobase (kb) chromosomal fragment, which was used to detect a larger chromosomal fragment from a lambda EMBL3 library. The lambda EMBL3 recombinant, lambda EM109, contained an 18-kb portion of the Synechococcus strain PCC 7942 chromosome. The open reading frame of cbpA encoded 450 amino acids which give rise to a protein of 49,113 daltons.

The protein has been localized in the cytoplasmic membrane by biochemical procedures as well as by electron microscopic immunocytochemistry. Northern (RNA) blot analysis indicates that transcription of cbpA is tightly regulated by DNA topology, light intensity, and iron concentration. Transcription is greatly induced by growth under high light intensities and repressed during growth under iron-deficient conditions. The DNA gyrase inhibitor novobiocin specifically inhibited the light-induced transcription. In Northern blots, the gene-specific probe hybridized to two size classes of RNA, with lengths of 2.0 and 6.2 kb. Since cbpA appears to be a component of the 6.2-kb transcript, it is likely part of a larger operon.",molecular_sequence_data,0.2,7,11140.29,9529.976,9520.956,20368.05,17472.89,17644.49,5507.318
"Recent research has suggested that the oncomir microRNA 155 (miR-155) is up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, the authors investigated the tumorigenic mechanism of this oncomir in the development of HCC.

Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted to analyze the expressions of miR-155 and its potential target genes in paired tumor tissues and adjacent tumor-free tissues and in disease-free liver tissue samples. The in silico predicted target genes of miR-155 were assessed by dual-luciferase reporting assay, real-time RT-PCR, and Western blot analyses. U6 promoters that drive miR-155 precursor overexpression and miR-155 tough decoy knock-down constructs were used to study its affects on cell proliferation in vitro and on tumor formation in nude mice.

Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated a gradual ascension of miR-155 expression in cirrhotic liver tissues and in HCC tumor tissues compared with low expression levels in normal liver tissues. Ectopic expression of miR-155 in HepG2 cells enhanced its tumorigenesis, whereas depletion of the endogenous miR-155 reversed these tumorigenic properties. Ectopic expression of sex-determining region Y box 6 (SOX6) was able to reverse the growth-promoting property of miR-155. Concordantly, the results demonstrated for the first time that SOX6 is a direct target of miR-155. Further analysis revealed that SOX6 reduced cell growth by up-regulating p21waf1/cip1 expression in a p53-dependent manner. In addition, a decline in p21waf1/cip1 expression caused by miR-155 could be reversed by SOX6 expression.

The current data indicated that SOX6 is a novel target of miR-155 and that miR-155 enhances liver cell tumorigenesis at least in part through the novel miR-155/SOX6/p21waf1/cip1 axis. These findings suggest that miR-155 may be a potential target for HCC treatment.",cell_line_tumor,0,6,8860.254,7496.935,7578.184,15575.54,14492.48,14807.77,3961.938
"The regulation of cytokine gene transcription and biosynthesis involves the reduction-oxidation (redox)-sensitive nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), whose activation is mediated by an upstream kinase that regulates the phosphorylation of inhibitory-kappaB (IkappaB). It was hypothesized that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced biosynthesis of interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in vitro is regulated by redox equilibrium. In alveolar epithelial cells, we investigated the role of L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO), an irreversible inhibitor of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, the rate-limiting enzyme in GSH biosynthesis, 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), which inhibits glutathione oxidized disulfide reductase, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an antioxidant/prooxidant thiuram, and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), an antioxidant and GSH precursor, in regulating LPS-induced cytokine biosynthesis and IkappaB-alpha/NF-kappaB signaling. BSO blockaded the phosphorylation of IkappaB-alpha, reduced its degradation, and inhibited NF-kappaB activation, besides augmenting LPS-mediated biosynthesis of cytokines. BCNU up-regulated LPS-induced release of cytokines, an effect associated with partial phosphorylation/degradation of IkappaB-alpha and inhibition of the DNA binding activity. PDTC, which partially affected LPS-induced IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation/degradation, otherwise blockading NF-kappaB activation, reduced LPS-dependent up-regulation of cytokine release. Pretreatment with BSO did not abolish the NAC-dependent reduction of LPS-induced cytokine release, despite the fact that NAC marginally amplified IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation/degradation and suppressed NF-kappaB activation. These results indicate that cytokines are redox-sensitive mediators and that the IkappaB-alpha/NF-kappaB pathway is redox-sensitive and differentially implicated in mediating redox-dependent regulation of LPS-induced release of proinflammatory cytokines.",signal_transduction,0,0,19640.42,18974.53,18575.05,25817.5,28159.6,28194.95,11163.93
"Modulation of tumorigenicity has been considered to be a reflection of the (nuclear) genetic and cellular aberrations present in tumor cells. Recent studies have suggested that cytoplasmic elements can also contribute to the malignant phenotype of cancer, and that mitochondria may be important in this process. We, therefore, undertook a study to evaluate the effects of depletion of functional mitochondria on the tumorigenic phenotype. Brain and breast tumor cells were depleted of mitochondrial DNA [rho(-)] by treatment with ethidium bromide. These rho(-) respiratory-deficient cells showed a distinct change in the tumorigenic phenotype, including loss of ability to grow in an anchorage-independent fashion and, interestingly, a substantial increase in sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs (1,3-bis-chloroethyl-1-nitrosourea and cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)). Reversion to the tumorigenic phenotype was accomplished with transfer of normal mitochondria into the diminished tumorigenic rho(-) cells. No changes in expression of the apoptosis genes bcl-2 and bax, nor the drug resistance genes mdr1, mrp, or O6-alkyltransferase was found in any of the cell types (de novo, rho(-), or cybrid). Further, the type of cell death remained the same, i.e., cells with and without mitochondria underwent apoptosis in response to exposure to cytotoxic agents. Our results indicate that mitochondria/mitochondrial DNA play a direct role in modulating aspects of the tumorigenic phenotype, although they are not necessarily a sine qua non for apoptotic cell death. This is particularly interesting because most tumor tissues are more dependent upon glycolysis for energy production, rather than mitochondrially mediated oxidative phosphorylation. Creation of rho(-) cells will be useful to study the mitochondrial processes involved in tumorigenesis.",neoplasms,0,0,6636.278,4753.436,4732.775,10053.56,8251.199,8306.34,3372.841
"Regulatory and signaling networks coordinate the enormously complex interactions and processes that control cellular processes (such as metabolism and cell division), coordinate response to the environment, and carry out multiple cell decisions (such as development and quorum sensing). Regulatory network inference is the process of inferring these networks, traditionally from microarray data but increasingly incorporating other measurement types such as proteomics, ChIP-seq, metabolomics, and mass cytometry. We discuss existing techniques for network inference. We review in detail our pipeline, which consists of an initial biclustering step, designed to estimate co-regulated groups; a network inference step, designed to select and parameterize likely regulatory models for the control of the co-regulated groups from the biclustering step; and a visualization and analysis step, designed to find and communicate key features of the network.

"Depression has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP) has also been identified as an independent predictor of short- and long-term cardiovascular disease events. Inflammation may influence the relationship between depression and cardiovascular disease.

The objective of this study was to investigate the association between symptoms of depression and high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) in an obese clinical population. We also sought to determine whether this relationship was different in men and women, given prior reports of a gender effect.

Symptoms of depression and hs-CRP were measured in 390 participants enrolled in a weight loss intervention trial that was delivered in a primary care setting. Symptoms of depression were evaluated with the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8), in which a score â¥ 10 is consistent with major depression.

A total of 58 (15.2%) participants reported a PHQ-8 score â¥ 10. The median (interquartile range) hs-CRP concentration was significantly higher in participants with symptoms consistent with major depression (7.7 (4.2-13) mg l(-1)) compared with those without depression (5.1 (3-9.7) mg l(-1); P&<.01). Symptoms consistent with major depression were significantly associated with log-transformed hs-CRP concentrations in an analysis adjusted for age, gender, obesity class and other metabolic variables (P=0.04). When interaction by gender was examined, this relationship remained significant in men (P&<.01) but not in women (P=0.32).

Symptoms consistent with major depression were significantly associated with hs-CRP in men only, even after adjusting for age, obesity class, metabolic variables and medications known to affect inflammation. This finding suggests that there are biologic differences between men and women that may modify the relationship between hs-CRP and depression. Further studies are needed to elucidate the biologic basis for these findings.",obesity,0,0,6883.222,3866.263,3765.707,13110.43,12628.64,12400.83,3292.977
"Moraxella catarrhalis is an important cause of otitis media, sinusitis, and lower respiratory tract infections in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The purified outer membrane of M. catarrhalis contains a 29 kDa band, previously named outer membrane protein G1 (OMP G1). Polyclonal antiserum to the OMP G1 band was used to screen a genomic lambda phage library and the gene for OMP G1a was cloned and sequenced. Analysis of outer membrane by isoelectric focusing and amino-terminal protein sequence of the 29 kDa band revealed that the band is actually two individual proteins designated OMP G1a and OMP G1b. OMP G1a is a lipoprotein with an isoelectric point of 4. OMP G1b contains an unblocked amino-terminus and has an isoelectric point of 9. Analysis of the sequence of OMP G1a and OMP G1b from 25 clinical isolates revealed a high degree of conservation among strains. The sequence conservation of OMP G1a and OMP G1b among strains, combined with previous observations that OMP G1a and OMP G1b contain epitopes on the bacterial surface, indicate that OMP G1a and OMP G1b are potential vaccine antigens for M. catarrhalis.",molecular_sequence_data,0,0,12066.47,11449.53,11645.32,19426.67,19275.99,19797.85,6011.58
"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with cognitive impairments in working memory (WM). Neuronal activation during WM tasks can be indirectly assessed by blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI). The purpose of this study was to describe BOLD-fMRI responses during 2 separate working memory tasks and a finger tapping task in men with OSA. A secondary aim was to explore the possible relation between OSA severity (apnea/hypopnea index) and BOLD-fMRI signal patterns.

Nine treatment-naÃ¯ve men (mean age [+/- SD] of 45.7 [+/- 6.6] years) with OSA underwent BOLD fMRI testing on a research-dedicated university-based MRI scanner. During BOLD-fMRI subjects performed a Paced Auditory Serial Addition task (PASAT), an auditory N-Back task (2-BACK) task, and an alternating finger tapping.

PASAT and 2-BACK tasks produced similar patterns of increased bilateral activation in posterior parietal, prefrontal and cerebellar regions. BOLD signal deactivations were observed within posterior cingulate, retrosplenial and inferior frontal regions during PASAT and 2-BACK, but not during tapping. With increased disease severity, BOLD activation patterns were increased in the right parietal lobe, but decreased in the cerebellar vermis.

"Candida parapsilosis has been previously shown to produce a lipase/acyltransferase (EC 3.1.1.3) that preferentially catalyses transfer reactions such as alcoholysis over hydrolysis in the presence of suitable nucleophiles other than water, even in aqueous media (aw > 0.9 ). This enzyme has been shown to belong to a new family of lipases. The present work describes the cloning of the gene coding for this lipase/acyltransferase in the yeast Pichia pastoris and the heterologous high-level expression of the recombinant enzyme. The lipase/acyltransferase gene, in which the sequence encoding the signal peptide was replaced by that of the alpha-factor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was placed under the control of the methanol inducible promoter of the alcohol oxidase 1 gene (AOX1). A transformed P. pastoris clone, containing five copies of the lipase/acyltransferase gene, was selected for the production of recombinant enzyme.

"Pretreatment with octreotide (OCT) in acromegaly has been reported to improve surgical outcome. The objective of this study was to analyze retrospectively the effects of a 3- to 6-month presurgical treatment with OCT in acromegalics focusing on electrocardiographic (ECG) records, blood pressure levels, glucose and lipid profile, tumor size and consistency, easy tumor removal at surgery, and morphological findings at pathology. Fifty-nine patients with acromegaly who were undergoing surgical treatment were studied randomly before surgery; 37 patients were untreated, and 22 were treated with OCT at doses ranging 150-600 micrograms/day for 3-6 months. At study entry, untreated and OCT-treated patients had similar circulating GH and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), glucose, and cholesterol levels as well as prevalence of overt diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and ECG abnormalities. In untreated and OCT-treated patients, respectively, radiological imaging documented microadenoma in 0 and 1, intrasellar macroadenoma in 10 and 6, intra- and suprasellar macroadenoma in 18 and 11, invasive macroadenoma in 9 and 4 patients. Before surgery, serum GH and IGF-I levels significantly decreased in the 22 OCT-treated acromegalics, and in 5 of them, a significant shrinkage was documented. ECG abnormalities disappeared in 7 of 11 (63.6%) OCT-treated patients. In 3 of the 7 patients with diabetes mellitus, treatment with OCT together with low carbohydrate intake normalized blood glucose levels, whereas in 2 patients, insulin could be replaced by oral antidiabetics, and in 2 patients, the insulin dose was reduced. Presurgical blood glucose, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, as well as systolic (145.2 +/- 3.4 vs. 132.9 +/- 2.5 mm Hg; P < 0.01) and diastolic (94.3 +/- 1.7 vs. 84.3 +/- 1.6 mm Hg; P < 0.001) blood pressure levels were significantly higher in untreated than in OCT-treated patients. Two weeks after surgery, circulating GH and IGF-I levels were normalized in 11 untreated (29.7%) and 12 OCT-treated (54.5%) patients (P < 0.005, by chi 2 test). Macroscopically, no difference was found between untreated and OCT-treated adenomas, whereas at pathology, a significant increases in cellular atypia (31.6% vs. 19.2%; P < 0.05) was found in OCT-treated adenomas. One patients in the untreated group died from cardiorespiratory arrest during the early postoperative period. Finally, the average duration of hospitalization after operation was longer in untreated than in OCT-treated patients (8.6 +/- 0.7 vs. 5.6 +/- 0.5 days).

"The high potential of Superquadrics as modeling elements for image segmentation tasks has been pointed out since years in the computer vision community. In this work we employ superquadrics as modeling elements for multiple object segmentation in range images. Segmentation is executed in two stages. Firstly, a hypothesis about the values of the segmentation parameters is generated. Secondly, the hypothesis is refined locally. In both stages, object boundary and region information are considered. Boundary information is derived via model-based edge detection in the input range image. Hypothesis generation uses boundary information to isolate image regions which can be accurately described by superquadrics. Within hypothesis refinement, a game-theoretic framework is used to fuse the two information sources by associating an objective function to each information source. Iterative optimization of the two objective functions in succession, outputs a precise description of all image objects. We demonstrate experimentally that this approach substantially improves the most established method in superquadric segmentation, in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. We demonstrate the applicability of our segmentation framework in real world applications by constructing a novel robotic system for automatic unloading of jumbled box-like objects from platforms.",algorithms,0,7,6773.802,6292.074,6416.908,13625.16,12882.54,13279.23,2247.722
"Although regulation of chondrogenesis and cartilage development by Wnt signaling is well established, the function of Wnt in the maintenance and destruction of cartilage remains largely unknown. Here we investigated the involvement and regulatory mechanisms of Wnt signaling in cartilage destruction. We found that interleukin-1beta, the primary pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in cartilage destruction, induces expression of Wnt-5a and -7a in primary culture articular chondrocytes. The level of beta-catenin was also increased in chondrocytes of arthritic cartilage, suggesting the association of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling with arthritic cartilage destruction. In addition, our results show that Wnt-7a induces dedifferentiation and inhibits NO-induced apoptosis of primary culture articular chondrocytes. Wnt-7a induces dedifferentiation of articular chondrocytes by stimulating transcriptional activity of beta-catenin, whereas NO-induced apoptosis is inhibited via the activation of cell survival signaling, such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt, which block apoptotic signaling cascade. Our results collectively suggest that Wnt-7a is associated with cartilage destruction by regulating the maintenance of differentiation status and the apoptosis of articular chondrocytes via different mechanisms.",signal_transduction,0.4,6,10287.09,10520.05,10670.55,17463.31,18184.08,18503.34,4784.565

"Chemotherapy is the preferred therapeutic approach for advanced ovarian cancer, but a successful long-term treatment is prevented by the development of drug resistance. Recent works have underlined the involvement of non-coding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) in cancer development, with several conjectures regarding their possible involvement in the evolution of drug resistance. This study is to investigate the promoting effects and mechanism of miR-125b involved in the development of chemoresistance in ovarian cancer. The different expression of miR-125b in cisplatin-sensitive ovarian cancer cell line (OV2008) and its resistant variant (C13*) was identified by real-time PCR. An in vitro cytotoxicity assay and apoptosis assay using CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, were carried out to detect the effect of miR-125b and Bak1 on cisplatin resistance of cells. Real-time PCR, Western blotting and luciferase reporter assay were used to detect whether Bak1 is a target of miR-125b. As compared with OV2008 cells, the expression levels of miR-125b in C13* cells were increased. It was found that the up-regulation of microRNA-125b caused a marked inhibition of cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis and a subsequent increase in the resistance to cisplatin in OV2008 and C13* cells. Moreover, Bak1 was a direct target of miR-125b, and down-regulation of Bak1 suppressed cisplatin-induced apoptosis and led to an increased resistance to cisplatin. Our study indicates that miR-125b has a significantly promoting effect on chemoresistance of C13* cells and up-regulation of miR-125b expression contributes to cisplatin resistance through suppression of Bak1 expression.

"This study aims to evaluate the incidence of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) in severely obese Asians and to study the impact of weight loss on OSA.

We report the results of routine preoperative Polysomnograms in 350 Asian patients undergoing bariatric surgery in our institute. Polysomnograms were repeated in 75 randomly selected patients with moderate to severe OSA after target weight loss with the laparoscopically placed adjustable gastric band (LAGB).

The prevalence of OSA in obese Asians is high. Moderate OSA was found in 46% of patients and severe OSA was found in 33%. Severe OSA was significantly more in the Chinese (46%) compared to the Malays (29%) or Indians (21%) (P = 0.035). We identified other risk factors for severe OSA (male sex, higher body mass index and the presence of hypertension) but were unable to select identifying parameters for very low (&<%) likelihood of severe OSA such that routine sleep studies prior to bariatric surgery could be omitted. Apnoea Hypoapnoea Index (AHI) showed improvement of 50% at 20 kg excess weight loss with the cure of OSA in preoperatively severe cases (P &<.005). Mild to moderate cases reported similar improvements although a direct correlation could not be established. Desaturation events, apnoea episodes, work of breathing and subjective assessment of sleepiness scores and quality of life (QOL) showed improving trends, albeit not statistically significant. Similar improvements were seen in sleep architecture with increased rapid eye movement (REM) and stage 3 sleep.

"The present report describes the development of a technique for automatic wheezing recognition in digitally recorded lung sounds. This method is based on the extraction and processing of spectral information from the respiratory cycle and the use of these data for user feedback and automatic recognition. The respiratory cycle is first pre-processed, in order to normalize its spectral information, and its spectrogram is then computed. After this procedure, the spectrogram image is processed by a two-dimensional convolution filter and a half-threshold in order to increase the contrast and isolate its highest amplitude components, respectively. Thus, in order to generate more compressed data to automatic recognition, the spectral projection from the processed spectrogram is computed and stored as an array. The higher magnitude values of the array and its respective spectral values are then located and used as inputs to a multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network, which results an automatic indication about the presence of wheezes. For validation of the methodology, lung sounds recorded from three different repositories were used. The results show that the proposed technique achieves 84.82% accuracy in the detection of wheezing for an isolated respiratory cycle and 92.86% accuracy for the detection of wheezes when detection is carried out using groups of respiratory cycles obtained from the same person.

VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and VEGFR-3 were analyzed in 91 R(0)-resected primary gastric adenocarcinomas, corresponding noncancerous gastric mucosa, and lymph node metastases employing immunohistochemistry and/or in situ hybridization. Blood and lymph vessel densities were assessed after staining with CD31 and LYVE-1-specific antibodies.

VEGF-D and VEGF-C were detected in 67.0% and 50.5% of gastric cancers, respectively. Healthy gastric mucosa was negative for VEGF-C and in 12.5% positive for VEGF-D. Presence of VEGF-D (P = .005) or VEGF-C (P = .006) was correlated with lymphatic metastases and decreased survival (VEGF-D, P < .05; VEGF-C, P < .05). VEGFR-3 was correlated with reduced carcinoma-specific survival (P < .05), and Cox multivariate regression analysis qualified VEGF-D and VEGFR-3, but not VEGF-C, as independent prognostic parameters. In lymph node-positive gastric cancers, presence of VEGF-D/VEGFR-3 was associated with poor survival, whereas absence of VEGF-D/VEGFR-3 defined a subgroup of patients with clearly favorable prognosis.

VEGF-D and VEGFR-3 are novel independent prognostic marker molecules aiding to identify patients with poor prognosis after curative resection of gastric adenocarcinomas. Combined analysis of the VEGF-C/VEGF-D/VEGFR-3 system can be useful to identify patients with unfavorable clinical outcome and thereby may help to refine therapeutic decisions in gastric cancer.",cell_line_tumor,0,8,19380.67,20879.22,20980.99,26004.17,31271.21,31522.61,7231.515
"In major depression, prefrontal regulation of limbic brain areas may be a key mechanism that is impaired during the processing of affective information. This prefrontal-limbic interaction has been shown to be modulated by serotonin (5-HTT) genotype, indicating a higher risk for major depressive disorder (MDD) with increasing number of 5-HTT low-expression alleles.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess neural response to uncued unpleasant affective pictures in 21 unmedicated patients with MDD compared to 21 matched healthy controls, taking into account genetic influences of the 5-HTT (SCL6A4) high- and low-expression genotype.

Healthy controls displayed greater prefrontal activation (BA10) to uncued negative pictures compared to patients with MDD. While in healthy controls prefrontal (BA10) activation and BA10-amygdala coupling increased with the number of 5-HTT low-expression risk alleles, this effect was abolished, and even reversed, in patients with MDD. In MDD, connectivity decreased with severity of depressive symptoms (HAMD total score).

These findings suggest that increased medial prefrontal (BA10) activation and BA10-amygdala connectivity may counteract the risk for MDD in healthy carriers of 5-HTT low-expression alleles, while this protective factor might be lost in patients who actually suffer from MDD. Prefrontal-limbic regulation in risk populations could be a target of early interventions and should be the focus of further research.",magnetic_resonance_imaging,0.2,5,9553.794,6917.753,7025.012,15831.07,13819.55,14339.18,4210.048
"Foregut endocrine polypeptide-secreting APUD cells (Amine-Precursor-Uptake and Decarboxylation), in their embryologic migration from neural crest to foregut may become ""arrested"" in the mesoderm or in other ectopic locations. They may become hyperplastic, adenomatous or malignant. Eight illustrative patients are reported. One patient had ""pancreatic hyperparathyroidism"" with hypercalcemic crises, pancreatic apudocarcinoma, normal parathyroids, biologically active parathormone, but inert immunochemically to the usual parathyroid antisera. Two had gastrin-secreting malignancies in the mesoderm. Remission after excision, but eventual recurrence of the syndrome due to islet cell hyperplasia required total gastrectomy. One patient had a gastric corpus apudocarcinoma found prospectively with hypergastrinemia which required excision of the tumor. One patient had acromegaly with hypergastrinemia and antral gastrinosis treated by pituitary irradiation,  One patient had the antral or intermediary type of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome with moderate hypergastrinemia, duodenal ulcer and antral gastrinosis, treated by vagotomy and antrectomy. One patient had hyperparathyroidism with antral gastrinosis, treated by parathyroidectomy. One patient had malignant Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and developed associated thyroid parafollicular cell hyperplasia and parathyroid chief cell hyperplasia, treated by total gastrectomy and multiple endocrine excisions.

"Genetic, epidemiological and clinical evidence have clearly demonstrated the importance of the human apolipoprotein (apo) A-I/C-III/A-IV gene cluster in lipid metabolism and heart attack. The transcriptional regulation of these genes determines the level of the encoded proteins and therefore influences the concentration of triglycerides and cholesterol. Here, we analyze the existence of transcription control elements in the 6.6 kb apoC-III/A-IV intergenic region and their influence on the expression of both genes. Two main positive common control elements were found to modulate apoC-III and apoA-IV expression in HepG2 and in Caco-2 cells: the previously described apoC-III enhancer, located 0.8 kb upstream from the cap site of the gene, and a newly detected activating region located in the center of the intergenic sequence. The activity of both elements is highly increased by the hepatic and intestinal transcription factor HNF-4. Analysis of a 641 bp fragment containing the central element showed that it has the properties of a tissue-specific enhancer. Liver nuclear proteins interact with seven DNA binding sites present in this enhancer and HNF-4 specifically interacts with one of these sites. A third positive element, situated immediately upstream from the apoA-IV minimal promoter, is also activated by HNF-4; however, this element is not involved in apoC-III expression. In addition, two negative regions were identified, one located near the apoA-IV gene and the other one between the apoC-III enhancer and the newly identified central enhancer. In conclusion, negative and positive control elements are located in the apoC-III/A-IV intergenic region, including two enhancers important for the expression of the two genes. These results add new evidence that common regulatory elements for the expression of the apoA-I, apoC-III and apoA-IV genes are interspersed throughout the cluster.",molecular_sequence_data,0.2,8,5585.979,4867.598,4895.563,9561.23,8421.595,8389.242,2526.479
"To evaluate the effectiveness of the iterative decomposition of water and fat with echo asymmetric and least-squares estimation (IDEAL) MRI to quantify tumour infiltration into the lumbar vertebrae in myeloma patients without visible focal lesions.

The lumbar spine was examined with 3 T MRI in 24 patients with multiple myeloma and in 26 controls. The fat-signal fraction was calculated as the mean value from three vertebral bodies. A post hoc test was used to compare the fat-signal fraction in controls and patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), asymptomatic myeloma or symptomatic myeloma. Differences were considered significant at Pâ<â0.05. The fat-signal fraction and Î²(2)-microglobulin-to-albumin ratio were entered into the discriminant analysis.

Fat-signal fractions were significantly lower in patients with symptomatic myelomas (43.9 Â±19.7%, Pâ<â0.01) than in the other three groups. Discriminant analysis showed that 22 of the 24 patients (92%) were correctly classified into symptomatic or non-symptomatic myeloma groups.

Fat quantification using the IDEAL sequence in MRI was significantly different when comparing patients with symptomatic myeloma and those with asymptomatic myeloma. The fat-signal fraction and Î²(2)-microglobulin-to-albumin ratio facilitated discrimination of symptomatic myeloma from non-symptomatic myeloma in patients without focal bone lesions.

"Y-receptors control energy homeostasis, but the role of Npy6 receptors (Npy6r) is largely unknown. Young Npy6r-deficient (Npy6r(-/-)) mice have reduced body weight, lean mass, and adiposity, while older and high-fat-fed Npy6r(-/-) mice have low lean mass with increased adiposity. Npy6r(-/-) mice showed reduced hypothalamic growth hormone releasing hormone (Ghrh) expression and serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels relative to WT. This is likely due to impaired vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) signaling in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), where we found Npy6r coexpressed in VIP neurons. Peripheral administration of pancreatic polypeptide (PP) increased Fos expression in the SCN, increased energy expenditure, and reduced food intake in WT, but not Npy6r(-/-), mice. Moreover, intraperitoneal (i.p.) PP injection increased hypothalamic Ghrh mRNA expression and serum IGF-1 levels in WT, but not Npy6r(-/-), mice, an effect blocked by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.)

"In order to survey, facilitate, and evaluate studies of medical language processing on clinical narratives, i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology to the Bedside) organized its second challenge and workshop. This challenge focused on automatically extracting information on obesity and fifteen of its most common comorbidities from patient discharge summaries. For each patient, obesity and any of the comorbidities could be Present, Absent, or Questionable (i.e., possible) in the patient, or Unmentioned in the discharge summary of the patient. i2b2 provided data for, and invited the development of, automated systems that can classify obesity and its comorbidities into these four classes based on individual discharge summaries. This article refers to obesity and comorbidities as diseases. It refers to the categories Present, Absent, Questionable, and Unmentioned as classes. The task of classifying obesity and its comorbidities is called the Obesity Challenge. The data released by i2b2 was annotated for textual judgments reflecting the explicitly reported information on diseases, and intuitive judgments reflecting medical professionals' reading of the information presented in discharge summaries. There were very few examples of some disease classes in the data. The Obesity Challenge paid particular attention to the performance of systems on these less well-represented classes. A total of 30 teams participated in the Obesity Challenge. Each team was allowed to submit two sets of up to three system runs for evaluation, resulting in a total of 136 submissions. The submissions represented a combination of rule-based and machine learning approaches. Evaluation of system runs shows that the best predictions of textual judgments come from systems that filter the potentially noisy portions of the narratives, project dictionaries of disease names onto the remaining text, apply negation extraction, and process the text through rules. Information on disease-related concepts, such as symptoms and medications, and general medical knowledge help systems infer intuitive judgments on the diseases.",obesity,0.2,6,5348.443,4273.983,4282.185,9650.993,8912.446,9070.065,3215.794
"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a potent stimulus of connective tissue accumulation, and is implicated in the pathogenesis of scleroderma and other fibrotic disorders. Smad3 functions as a key intracellular signal transducer for profibrotic TGF-beta responses in normal skin fibroblasts. The potential role of Smad3 in the pathogenesis of scleroderma was investigated in Smad3-null (Smad3(-/-)) mice using a model of skin fibrosis induced by subcutaneous injections of bleomycin. At early time points, bleomycin-induced macrophage infiltration in the dermis and local TGF-beta production were similar in Smad3(-/-) and wild-type mice. In contrast, at day 28, lesional skin from Smad3(-/-) mice showed attenuated fibrosis, lower synthesis and accumulation of collagen, and reduced collagen gene transcription in situ, compared to wild-type mice. Connective tissue growth factor and alpha-smooth muscle actin expression in lesional skin were also significantly attenuated. Electron microscopy revealed an absence of small diameter collagen fibrils in the dermis from bleomycin-treated Smad3(-/-) mice. Compared to fibroblasts derived from wild-type mice, Smad3(-/-) fibroblasts showed reduced in vitro proliferative and profibrotic responses elicited by TGF-beta. Together, these results indicate that ablation of Smad3 is associated with markedly altered fibroblast regulation in vivo and in vitro, and confers partial protection from bleomycin-induced scleroderma in mice. Reduced fibrosis is due to deregulated fibroblast function, as the inflammatory response induced by bleomycin was similar in wild-type and Smad3(-/-) mice.",signal_transduction,0,6,12212.71,12628.07,12955.02,18904.27,21143.61,21766.51,5330.229

To evaluate the usefulness of the short-term assay in providing a rapid reliable assessment of chemotherapeutic response, the short-term assay was compared with the soft agar clonogenic assay. Sensitivity to five anticancer drugs was compared using three human tumor cell lines (epidermoid carcinoma of the oral cavity, pancreatic carcinoma, and bladder carcinoma). The short-term assay produced results that were similar to results of the clonogenic assay in two of the three tumors tested, for three drugs (cis-platin, doxorubicin, and BCNU), but did not detect responses to two antimetabolites (5-FU and MTX) in any tumor.

"Hereditary breast cancer comprises 5-10% of all breast cancers. Mutations in two high-risk susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, along with rare intermediate-risk genes and common low-penetrance alleles identified, altogether explain no more than 45% of the high-risk breast cancer families, although the majority of cases are unaccounted for and are designated as BRCAX tumours. Micro RNAs have called great attention for classification of different cancer types and have been implicated in a range of important biological processes and are deregulated in cancer pathogenesis.

Here we have performed an exploratory hypothesis-generating study of miRNA expression profiles in a large series of 66 primary hereditary breast tumours by microarray analysis.

Unsupervised clustering analysis of miRNA molecular profiles revealed distinct subgroups of BRCAX tumours, 'normal-like' BRCAX-A, 'proliferative' BRCAX-B, 'BRCA1/2-like' BRCAX-C and 'undefined' BRCAX-D subgroup. These findings introduce a new insight in the biology of hereditary breast cancer, defining specific BRCAX subgroups, which could help in the search for novel susceptibility pathways in hereditary breast cancer.

"The Escherichia coli open reading frame YbdK encodes a member of a large bacterial protein family of unknown biological function. The sequences within this family are remotely related to the sequence of gamma-glutamate-cysteine ligase (gamma-GCS), an enzyme in the glutathione biosynthetic pathway. A gene encoding gamma-GCS in E. coli is already known. The 2.15 A resolution crystal structure of YbdK reveals an overall fold similar to that of glutamine synthetase (GS), a nitrogen metabolism enzyme that ligates glutamate and ammonia to yield glutamine. GS and gamma-GCS perform related chemical reactions and require ATP and Mg2+ for their activity. The Mg2+-dependent binding of ATP to YbdK was confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy employing 2'(or 3')-O-(trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5'-triphosphate, and yielding a dissociation constant of 3 +/- 0.5 microM. The structure of YbdK contains a crevice that corresponds to the binding sites of ATP, Mg2+ and glutamate in GS. Many of the GS residues that coordinate the metal ions and interact with glutamic acid and the phosphoryl and ribosyl groups of ATP are also present in YbdK. GS amino acids that have been associated with ammonia binding have no obvious counterparts in YbdK, consistent with a substrate specificity that is different from that of GS. Ligase activity between glutamic acid and each of the twenty amino acid residues was tested on high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) by following the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP. Catalysis was observed only with cysteine. A pyruvate kinase/lactic acid dehydrogenase coupled assay was used to rule out GS activity and to determine that YbdK exhibits gamma-GCS activity. The catalytic rate was found to be approximately 500-fold slower than that reported for authentic gamma-GCS.",molecular_sequence_data,0.2,7,7898.498,7856.166,7672.694,13056.05,12756.99,12900.07,3412.322
"The pathophysiology of tinnitus, the perception of sound in the absence of acoustic stimulation, is largely unknown, although several lines of research implicate long-term neuroplastic loss of inhibition. The evidence to date suggests that the neuroplastic alterations are likely to be found in multiple brain structures. The present study used manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) to assess the pattern of neural activity in the central auditory pathway of rats with psychophysical evidence of chronic acoustic-exposure-induced tinnitus. Manganese, an activity-dependent paramagnetic contrast agent, accumulates in active neurons through voltage-gated calcium channels, primarily at synapses, and serves as both a structural and functional indicator. Comparison images were obtained from normal subjects exposed to external tinnitus-like sound, and from tinnitus subjects treated with vigabatrin, a GABA agonist shown to eliminate the psychophysical evidence of tinnitus in rats. MEMRI indicated: (1) In rats with evidence of tinnitus, activity was generally elevated in the auditory brainstem, with significant elevation in the cerebellar paraflocculus, the posterior ventral cochlear nucleus, and the inferior colliculus; in general forebrain structures showed decreased activity, although MEMRI may be a less sensitive indicator of forebrain activity than brainstem activity; (2) in normal rats exposed to a tinnitus-like sound, a similar pattern of elevated brainstem activity and decreased forebrain activity was evident, with the notable exception of the paraflocculus, where artificial tinnitus had no effect and (3) vigabatrin, decreased brainstem activity to control levels, in rats with prior evidence of tinnitus, and decreased forebrain activity to below control levels. It was concluded that chronic tinnitus in rats is associated with focal activity elevation in the auditory brainstem and increased activity in the paraflocculus that may be unique to tinnitus.",magnetic_resonance_imaging,0,4,7317.588,5577.089,5502.831,12279.11,12179.06,12480.48,3329.405
"Paravahlkampfia francinae n. sp., a new species of the free-living amoeba genus Paravahlkampfia, designated as CDC:V595, was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with headache, sore throat, and vomiting, typical symptoms of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) caused by Naegleria fowleri. The isolate grew at 33 degrees C, 37 degrees C, 40 degrees C, and 42 degrees C and destroyed mammalian cell cultures. However, it did not kill young mice upon intranasal inoculation. P. francinae does not produce flagellates and does not grow on agar plates coated with Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, the usual food source of Paravahlkampfia ustiana, the type species of the genus. The trophozoite at light microscopy exhibited eruptive locomotion and possessed a single vesicular nucleus. Ultrastructurally, the trophozoites had numerous mitochondria with discoidal cristae but did not have a Golgi apparatus. The trophozoites differentiated into cysts after consuming most of the monolayer. The cyst had an inner well-differentiated endocyst and an outer thin, wrinkled, and wavy ectocyst with no pores. During excystation trophozoites ruptured the cyst wall and emerged from the cysts. A unique feature seen in the cysts was the presence of bacterial endosymbionts, both in the endoplasm and within the cyst wall.

"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal primary human brain tumor. GBMs are characterized by a variety of genetic alterations, among which oncogenic mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRvIII) is most common. GBMs harboring EGFRvIII have increased proliferation and invasive characteristics versus those expressing wild-type (wt) EGFR. To identify the molecular basis of this increased tumorgenic phenotype, we used iTRAQ-labeling differential proteomic analysis. Among several differentially expressed proteins, we selected CRMP1, a protein implicated in cellular invasion that was markedly decreased in GBMs expressing EGFRvIII, for further study. The differential expression of CRMP1 was confirmed in a panel of human GBM cell lines and operative specimens that express wtEGFR or mutant EGFRvIII by quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemical analysis. In human GBM samples, decreased expression of CRMP1 correlated with EGFRvIII positivity. Knockdown of CRMP1 by siRNA resulted in increased invasion of wtEGFR expressing human GBM cells (U87 and U373) to those found in isogenic GBM cells. Exogenous expression of EGFRvIII in these wtEGFR-expressing GBM cells promoted their ability to invade and was accompanied by decreased expression of CRMP1. Rescuing CRMP1 expression decreased invasion of the EGFRvIII-expressing GBM cells by tilting the balance between Rac and Rho. Collectively, these results show that the loss of CRMP1 contribute to the increased invasive phenotype of human GBMs expressing mutant EGFRvIII.",cell_line_tumor,0,5,12877.65,11084.39,11155.85,21031.45,21162.76,21496.16,5361.24
"Studies were carried out on cholesterol metabolism in 11 nonobese patients and 16 obese patients with hypothyroidism and 13 with hyperthyroidism. The patients underwent several investigations under metabolic ward conditions. Hypothyroid patients usually had an increase in low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. Several mechanisms may have combined to cause a high LDL. For instance, the obese hypothyroid patients had an increase in cholesterol synthesis. Absorption of cholesterol also was increased frequently. However, other mechanisms not explored in this study probably contributed to most of the fall in LDL-cholesterol. Treatment of hypothyroid patients produced the expected fall in LDL. One possible mechanism could be that thyroid hormones enhance the conversion of cholesterol into bile acids; this mechanism has been suggested by other workers from animal studies. However, no evidence was obtained in either hypothyroid or hyperthyroid patients that thyroid hormones alter synthesis of bile acids. On the other hand, the hormones appeared to increase the synthesis of cholesterol. Patients with hypothyroidism frequently had supersaturated bile. The cause was mostly an enhanced secretion of biliary cholesterol associated with a tendency to obesity and increased synthesis of cholesterol. In contrast, the usually thin hyperthyroid patients did not have supersaturated bile. The studies show that thyroid hormones a) influence LDL-cholesterol by an action on the catabolism of LDL-independent of alterations in synthesis, catabolism, absorption, or excretion: b) stimulate synthesis of cholesterol; and c) affect biliary lipid metabolism in large part by influencing energy balance and cholesterol synthesis.",obesity,0,3,6878.911,6025.438,5851.864,13003.96,13929.97,13944.74,3731.223
"T lymphocytes can be activated via the T cell receptor (TCR) or by triggering through a number of other surface structures, including the CD2 co-receptor molecule. Signaling through the CD2 molecule was shown previously to be dependent on the TCR-associated zeta-chain. Here, we show that CD2-induced activation also functions in T cells which express zeta-chains lacking a functional immune-receptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). TCR-positive T cells that express only the transmembrane part of the zeta-chain protein and thus lack a functional zeta-derived ITAM readily produce interleukin (IL)-2 when cross-linked with CD2-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb). TCR-negative T cell hybridomas expressing minimal receptors consisting of an extracellular CD25 and an intracellular zeta-chain-derived segment were effectively stimulated via CD2-specific mAb. For CD2-mediated co-stimulation of TCR-negative cells, two zeta-chain-derived ITAM were sufficient to induce IL-2 when the CD2 molecules were co-cross-linked with the chimeric CD25-zeta molecules. Taken together, our results show that CD2-induced signaling does not necessarily employ the zeta-chain in TCR-positive cells and that CD2-dependent co-stimulation in TCR-negative cells can be mediated via two functional zeta-chain-derived ITAM.",signal_transduction,0.4,6,13436.53,13076.65,13314.8,20263.31,20578.32,20886.91,6360.798

Plasma alkylating activity levels determined by using 4(4'-nitro-benzyl)-pyridine showed considerable inter-individual and intercyclic variations and decreased biphasically, with mean alpha and beta half-lives of 60 min and 6-7 h, respectively. Probably as a result of liver mixed-function oxidase induction, on the 2nd day of treatment the terminal half-lives were shorter, the plasma exposures were lower, and the mean plasma clearances were higher. Renal excretion was almost complete after 24 h, accounting for a mean of 19% of the injected dose. The CSF alkylating activity levels, obtained in four children, were always lower than the plasma levels and ranged from 8 to 51 micrograms/ml, with a mean CSF/plasma ratio of 0.53 +/- 0.23 during the first 12 h. We conclude that IF alkylating activity was biphasically cleared from the plasma, with significant interindividual and intercyclic variability, that the renal contribution to the clearance was low, and that high levels of CSF alkylating activity could possibly contribute to the CNS toxic side effects observed in pediatric patients treated with high-dose IF/mesna.",neoplasms,0,7,7721.583,6862.688,6805.604,13639.68,14056.26,14233.43,4024.062
Adaptive interventions apply a priori decision rules for adjusting treatment services in response to participants' clinical presentation or performance in treatment. This pilot study (n = 30) experimentally examined an adaptive intervention in a misdemeanor drug court. The participants were primarily charged with possession of marijuana (73%) or possession of drug paraphernalia (23%). Results revealed that participants in the adaptive condition had higher graduation rates and required significantly less time to graduate from the program and achieve a final resolution of the case. It took an average of nearly 4 fewer months for participants in the adaptive intervention to resolve their cases compared with those participating in drug court as usual. Participants in the adaptive condition also reported equivalent satisfaction with the program and therapeutic alliances with their counselors. These data suggest that adaptive interventions may enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of drug courts and justify examining adaptive interventions in large-scale drug court studies.,algorithms,0,4,4995.886,3353.423,3450.006,12702.41,11297.36,11553.87,2807.643
"Free radical induced polymerization of vinyl monomers such as the acryloyl peptides described here is a facile and rapid reaction used routinely, for example, in the polymerization of acrylamide and bisacrylamide for the assembly of polyacrylamide gels. The technology allows the incorporation of many of the same or different peptide determinants into a single polymer chain. In this study large polymers containing multiple copies of peptides representing T- and B-cell determinants of influenza haemagglutinin were constructed. The determinants retained antigenicity after the polymerization procedure and the polymers were highly immunogenic; the levels of antibody obtained after a single dose of polymeric immunogen were at least as great as those achieved only after repeated doses of the equivalent monomeric peptide. The technology has a wide range of potential applications, not the least significant of which is the construction of designer immunogens for third generation vaccine candidates.",molecular_sequence_data,0.6,7,4499.831,3387.104,3476.733,8505.955,6733.073,6990.639,2479.035
"Pancreatic cancer (PaCa) is one of the most aggressive, apoptosis-resistant and currently incurable cancers with a poor survival rate. Eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase (eEF-2K) is an atypical kinase, whose role in PaCa survival is not yet known. Here, we show that eEF-2K is overexpressed in PaCa cells and its down-regulation induces apoptotic cell death. Rottlerin (ROT), a polyphenolic compound initially identified as a PKC-Î´ inhibitor, induces apoptosis and autophagy in a variety of cancer cells including PaCa cells. We demonstrated that ROT induces intrinsic apoptosis, with dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential (ÎÎ¨m), and stimulates extrinsic apoptosis with concomitant induction of TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors, DR4 and DR5, with caspase-8 activation, in PANC-1 and MIAPaCa-2 cells. Notably, while none of these effects were dependent on PKC-Î´ inhibition, ROT down-regulates eEF-2K at mRNA level, and induce eEF-2K protein degradation through ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Down-regulation of eEF-2K recapitulates the events observed after ROT treatment, while its over-expression suppressed the ROT-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, eEF-2K regulates the expression of tissue transglutaminase (TG2), an enzyme previously implicated in proliferation, drug resistance and survival of cancer cells. Inhibition of eEF-2K/TG2 axis leads to caspase-independent apoptosis which is associated with induction of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Collectively, these results indicate, for the first time, that the down-regulation of eEF-2K leads to induction of intrinsic, extrinsic as well as AIF-dependent apoptosis in PaCa cells, suggesting that eEF-2K may represent an attractive therapeutic target for the future anticancer agents in PaCa.",cell_line_tumor,0,9,13730.88,11597.62,11395.83,17419.99,16667.83,16446.28,7377.476
"Introduction of the yellow obese gene (A(y)) into mice (KKAy) results in obesity and diabetes by 5 weeks of age.

Using this model of type 2 diabetes, we evaluated male and female 6- to 8-month-old wild-type (WT, n=10) and KKAy (n=22) mice subjected to myocardial infarction (MI) and sacrificed at day (d) 7.

Despite similar infarct sizes (50% Â± 4% for WT and 49% Â± 2% for KKAy, P=not significant), the 7d post-MI survival was 70% (n=7/10) in WT mice and 45% (n=10/22) in KKAy mice (P&<05). Plasma glucose levels were 1.4-fold increased in KKAy mice at baseline compared to WT (P&<05). Glucose levels did not change in WT mice but decreased 38% in KKAy post-MI (P&<05). End-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions post-MI were smaller and fractional shortening improved in the KKAy (5% Â± 1% in WT and 10% Â± 2% in KKAy, P&<05 for all). The improved cardiac function in KKAy was accompanied by reduced macrophage numbers and collagen I and III levels (both P&<05). Griffonia (Bandeiraea) simplicifolia lectin-I staining for vessel density demonstrated fewer vessels in KKAy infarcts (5.9% Â± 0.5%) compared to WT infarcts (7.3% Â± 0.1%, P&<05).

In conclusion, our study in KKAy mice revealed a paradoxical reduced post-MI survival but improved cardiac function through reduced inflammation, extracellular matrix accumulation, and neovascularization in the infarct region.

"Clinical magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain is typically performed in the standard three orthogonal planes of the magnet, with little regard to head positioning. Multiple sequences with different imaging parameters are performed, and gray-scale images are obtained and displayed separately. The authors have implemented, and currently advocate, the routine acquisition of coregistered transverse images after roll, yaw, and pitch correction to Talairach space. Talairach, anterior commissure (AC)-posterior commissure (PC) referenced, stereotactic space has been widely embraced by the neuroscience community. This standardization should lead to more reproducible and readily interpretable MR examinations. A method is described to obtain direct AC-PC referenced (Talairach space) MR images.

"We have undertaken a functional analysis of the odorant receptor repertoire in the Drosophila antenna. Each receptor was expressed in a mutant olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) used as a ""decoder,"" and the odor response spectrum conferred by the receptor was determined in vivo by electrophysiological recordings. The spectra of these receptors were then matched to those of defined ORNs to establish a receptor-to-neuron map. In addition to the odor response spectrum, the receptors dictate the signaling mode, i.e., excitation or inhibition, and the response dynamics of the neuron. An individual receptor can mediate both excitatory and inhibitory responses to different odorants in the same cell, suggesting a model of odorant receptor transduction. Receptors vary widely in their breadth of tuning, and odorants vary widely in the number of receptors they activate.

"BIIB021 is the first oral, synthetic, non-geldanamycin-based HSP90 inhibitor that showed activity in preclinical models at low nanomolar concentrations. We performed a phase 1 trial of BIIB021 administered to subjects with advanced solid tumors.

Sixty patients received BIIB021 capsules orally on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, and 18 of each course in schedule 1, and on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, and 25 of each course in schedule 2.

"Bradykinin (BK) induces angiogenesis by promoting vessel permeability, growth and remodeling. This study aimed to demonstrate that the B2R antagonist, fasitibant, inhibits the BK pro-angiogenic effects.

We assesed the ability of fasibitant to antagonize the BK stimulation of cultured human cells (HUVEC) and circulating pro-angiogenic cells (PACs), in producing cell permeability (paracellular flux), migration and pseocapillary formation. The latter parameter was studied in vitro (matrigel assay) and in vivo in mice (matrigel plug) and in rat model of experimental osteoarthritis (OA). We also evaluated NF-ÎºB activation in cultured cells by measuring its nuclear translocation and its downstream effectors such as the proangiogenic ciclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

HUVEC, exposed to BK (1-10 ÂµM), showed increased permeability, disassembly of adherens and tight-junction, increased cell migration, and pseudocapillaries formation. We observed a significant increase of vessel density in the matrigel assay in mice and in rats OA model. Importantly, B2R stimulation elicited, both in HUVEC and PACs, NF-ÎºB activation, leading to COX-2 overexpression, enhanced prostaglandin E-2 production. and VEGF output. The BK/NF-ÎºB axis, and the ensuing amplification of inflammatory/angiogenic responses were fully prevented by fasitibant as well as by IKK VII, an NF-ÎºB. Inhibitor.

"A Hindmarsh-Rose model perceptibility phantom containing inserts with various in vitro atherosclerotic plaque compositions was constructed and imaged on a clinical 64 slice multidetector (MDCT) system using 80 and 120 kVp settings and two other cone-beam (CBCT) systems at 80 kVp. Perceptibility of the simulated lipid-fibrotic plaque solutions in the images was evaluated by six observers. The effective doses of the protocols employed were estimated using phantom CTDI-vol measurements placed at identical settings. The CBCT system allowed reduction in effective dose in comparison with the conventional MDCT system for imaging of the carotid plaque phantoms without degrading image quality. The CBCT dose was less than MDCT, with a mean dose of 1.14 Â± 0.01 mSv and 1.11 Â± 0.02 mSv for MDCT using two measuring techniques vs. 0.35 Â± 0.01 mSv for CBCT. The image quality analysis showed no significant differences in the contrast-detail (C-D) curves of the best performing CBCT vs. clinical MDCT (p &gt; 0.05) using a Mann-Whitney U test.

Immunohistochemical staining showed that TFPI-2 was significantly downregulated in GBC tissue specimens. Ad5-TFPI-2 could significantly inhibit GBC growth both in vitro and in vivo. Apoptosis analysis and western blotting assay demonstrated that Ad5-TFPI-2 could induce the apoptosis of both GBC cell lines and tissues by promoting the activities of cytochrome c, Bax, caspase-3 and -9 and suppressing Bcl-2 activity.

"Applanation tonometry evaluation of pulse wave velocity is widely accepted as the 'gold standard' method for noninvasively assessing arterial stiffness. Newer noninvasive tools such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance can also evaluate arterial stiffness, but have not been validated. The aim of this study was to validate cardiovascular magnetic resonance-derived aortic distensibility with pulse wave velocity and to investigate age-related changes in regional aortic distensibility.

Ten young (20-30 years) and ten old (60-70 years) patients underwent applanation tonometry assessment of pulse wave velocity. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance measurements of arterial stiffness were evaluated by aortic distensibility (10-3 mmHg-1) at three separate locations, the ascending aorta, proximal descending aorta and distal descending aorta.

Pulse wave velocity correlated strongly with aortic distensibility measurements at each site: ascending aorta R2 = 0.57, proximal descending aorta R2 = 0.60 and distal descending aorta R2 = 0.72. As expected, the old cohort had significantly increased aortic stiffness compared with the young cohort (P < 0.01). Post-hoc comparison showed an increase in proximal stiffness in the old cohort compared with the young cohort (P = 0.018).

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance-derived aortic distensibility is an accurate measure of arterial stiffness and can evaluate regional stiffness through the aorta.

"Ionizing radiation (IR) is an important therapeutic modality used in approximately 50% of all cancer patients and is particularly effective against solid tumors that cannot be removed by surgery or that are refractory to standard anticancer agents. IR is often combined with other chemotherapeutic agents with the goal of sensitizing cancer cells to the cytotoxic effects of IR to produce a synergistic cell-killing effect.

This review article describes current and emerging therapeutic agents that are designed to increase the therapeutic efficacy of IR. This includes a discussion of how IR causes cell death by damaging nucleic acid. The involvement of various DNA repair pathways, cell-cycle-dependent kinases and apoptotic pathways is also described. This mechanistic information provides the framework to understand how combining therapeutic modalities with IR produces synergistic effects as well as to explain how emerging therapeutic strategies are being designed to inhibit or activate these pathways. Biochemical mechanisms and clinical applications of these chemical entities are discussed. Finally, brief descriptions are provided for several emerging chemical entities that show promise as potential adjunctive agents to sensitize cells to the effects of IR.

Indonesia has had the largest number of human infections and fatalities caused by these viruses. To understand the enzootic conditions of the viruses in Indonesia, twenty-four H5N1 viruses isolated from poultry from 2003 to 2007 were phylogenetically characterized. Although previous studies exclusively classified the Indonesian viruses into clades 2.1.1-2.1.3, our phylogenetic analyses showed a new sublineage that did not belong to any of the present clades. In addition, novel reassortant viruses were identified that emerged between this new sublineage and other clades in 2005-2006 on Java Island. H5N1 viruses were introduced from Java Island to Sulawesi, Kalimantan, and Sumatra Island on multiple occasions from 2003-2007, causing the geographical expansion of these viruses in Indonesia.

"One of the most important issues in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD)-based brain functional magnetic resonance imaging is the understanding of the vascular structures that are responsible for the signal changes observed. The T2*-related signal changes observed during variations in susceptibility-induced magnetic field gradients are a function both of non-refocusable mechanisms, such as diffusion, and of refocusable effects such as field inhomogeneities. Conversely, T2-related signal changes are only a function of non-refocusable effects. It has been suggested that T2-weighted images could be less sensitive to blood susceptibility changes in a macrovascular environment than T2*-weighted images and could thus be more accurate in identifying the ""activation"" of the parenchyma rather than ""draining vein"" effects. In this study we use hypoxia and hypercapnia challenges in cats to provide a change in blood deoxyhemoglobin concentration (as a model for classic BOLD changes and not as a model for neuronal activation). A combined gradient echo and spin echo echo-planar-imaging (EPI) pulse sequence was used to map DeltaR2 (i.e., Delta(1/T2)) and DeltaR2* (i.e., Delta(1/T2*)) changes during the challenges. Our experiments demonstrate that: (i) the acquisition of T2-weighted EPI data does not in itself differentiate signal changes in the parenchyma from those occurring in regions around larger vessels, but that (ii) the simultaneous acquisition of T2- and T2*-weighted images could be useful in identifying microvascular regions in gray matter by analyzing the ratio DeltaR2/DeltaR2*. This value seems independent of the degree of deoxyhemoglobin concentration change, but is related to properties of the vascular environment.

"Cardiac differentiation involves a cascade of coordinated gene expression that regulates cell proliferation and matrix protein formation in a defined temporo-spatial manner. The zinc-finger-containing transcription factor has been implicated as a critical regulator of multiple cardiac-expressed genes as well as a regulator of inducible gene expression in response to hypertrophic stimulation. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathways are among the most widespread mechanisms of eukaryotic cell regulation. The MAPKs function inside the nucleus and target transcription factors that are prebound to DNA. Many transcription factors are probably important MAPK targets. Here, we have cloned a new zinc-finger gene named ZNF411 using degenerate primers from an early embryo heart cDNA library, which mapped to 19p13.11. The ZNF411 gene consists of 2360 nucleotides and encodes a protein of 499 amino acids with an amino-terminal KRAB domain and eleven carboxy-terminal C2H2 zinc-finger units. Northern blot analysis indicates that a 2.4 kb transcript specific for ZNF411 is expressed in heart, skeletal muscle, and placenta at adult stage and is expressed in most of the examined embryonic tissues, especially at a higher level in skeletal muscle, heart, and pancreas. ZNF411 protein distributes evenly in nuclei when overexpressed in the cells. Reporter gene assays show that ZNF411 is a transcriptional repressor and overexpression of ZNF411 in the COS-7 cells inhibits the transcriptional activities of AP-1 and SRE. These results indicate that ZNF411 is a member of the zinc-finger transcription factor family and may be involved in the heart development, and it probably works as a negative regulator in MAPK signaling pathway.",molecular_sequence_data,0,7,9466.017,7344.574,7258.486,12915.81,10729.78,10861.1,4054.031
"Clinical trials are essential to improve cancer therapy, but only 3% of newly diagnosed adult cancer patients enroll annually. We previously conducted a prospective analysis of factors affecting trial accrual at the UC Davis Cancer Center between 1997 and 2000. It was found that the accrual rate was 14% and that patients with private insurance were significantly less likely than patients with government insurance to enroll, suggesting that fear of insurance denial was a barrier. In 2002, a new California law (SB37) required insurers to reimburse routine costs of care for cancer trials.

To assess the impact of SB37 on accrual, we repeated our study using the same sur vey instrument. Oncologists seeing new patients at the UC Davis Cancer Center from August to November 2002 completed questionnaires that inquired about patient characteristics and eligibility, protocol availability, and patient willingness to participate.

Physicians considered clinical trials for 55% (118/216) of patients, but trials were available for only 53% (62/118). Eligibility criteria were met by 82% (51/62). Of these, 69% (35/51) agreed to participate (vs 51% previously). No patient declined to participate because of insurance limitations (vs 8% previously). Furthermore, insurance type was no longer a significant factor in determining whether patients would enroll. This suggests that although the overall rate of accrual is only slightly increased after passage of SB37, patients may be more willing to enroll.

We demonstrate that breast cancer cell lines have genomic and transcriptomic features that recapitulate those of primary breast cancers and can be reliably subclassified into basal-like and luminal subgroups. By overlaying aCGH and transcriptomic data, we have identified 753 genes whose expression correlate with copy number; this list comprised numerous oncogenes recurrently amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer (e.g., HER2, MYC, CCND1 and AURKA).

"Prenatal ethanol exposure (PEE) induces dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia in fetus and adult offspring. However, whether PEE increases the susceptibility to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in offspring and its underlying mechanism remain unknown. This study aimed to demonstrate an increased susceptibility to high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD and its intrauterine programming mechanisms in female rat offspring with PEE. Rat model of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) was established by PEE, the female fetus and adult offspring that fed normal diet (ND) or HFD were sacrificed. The results showed that, in PEE+ND group, serum corticosterone (CORT) slightly decreased and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and glucose increased with partial catch-up growth; In PEE+HFD group, serum CORT decreased, while serum IGF-1, glucose and triglyceride (TG) increased, with notable catch-up growth, higher metabolic status and NAFLD formation. Enhanced liver expression of the IGF-1 pathway, gluconeogenesis, and lipid synthesis as well as reduced expression of lipid output were accompanied in PEE+HFD group. In PEE fetus, serum CORT increased while IGF-1 decreased, with low body weight, hyperglycemia, and hepatocyte ultrastructural changes. Hepatic IGF-1 expression as well as lipid output was down-regulated, while lipid synthesis significantly increased. Based on these findings, we propose a ""two-programming"" hypothesis for an increased susceptibility to HFD-induced NAFLD in female offspring of PEE. That is, the intrauterine programming of liver glucose and lipid metabolic function is ""the first programming"", and postnatal adaptive catch-up growth triggered by intrauterine programming of GC-IGF1 axis acts as ""the second programming"".",signal_transduction,0,9,18384.65,19010.41,19129.85,29487.69,37809.58,36834.25,8368.341
"Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, for which a great deal of research has been devoted to analyze and characterize brain activity during seizures. While this can be done by a human expert, automatic methods still lag behind. This paper analyzes neural activity captured with Electrocorticogram (ECoG), recorded through intracranial implants from Kindling model test subjects. The goal is to automatically identify the main seizure stages: Pre-Ictal, Ictal and Post-Ictal. While visually differentiating each stage can be done by an expert if the complete time-series is available, the goal here is to automatically identify the corresponding stage of short signal segments.

The proposal is to pose the above task as a supervised classification problem and derive a mapping function that classifies each signal segment. Given the complexity of the signal patterns, it is difficult to a priori choose any particular classifier. Therefore, Genetic Programming (GP), a population based meta-heuristic for automatic program induction, is used to automatically search for the mapping functions. Two GP-based classifiers are used and extensively evaluated. The signals from epileptic seizures are obtained using the Kindling model of elicited epilepsy in rodent test subjects, for which a seizure was elicited and recorded on four separate days.

Results show that signal segments from a single seizure can be used to derive accurate classifiers that generalize when tested on different signals from the same subject; i.e., GP can automatically produce accurate mapping functions for intra-subject classification. A large number of experiments are performed with the GP classifiers achieving good performance based on standard performance metrics. Moreover, a proof-of-concept real-world prototype is presented, where a GP classifier is transferred and hard-coded on an embedded system using a digital-to-analogue converter and a field programmable gate array, achieving a low average classification error of 14.55%, sensitivity values between 0.65 and 0.97, and specificity values between 0.86 and 0.94.

The proposed approach achieves good results for stage identification, particularly when compared with previous works that focus on this task. The results show that the problem of intra-class classification can be solved with a low error, and high sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, the limitations of the approach are identified and good operating configurations can be proposed based on the results.",algorithms,0.2,5,5580.568,4343.432,4284.777,9450.224,8789.031,8935.896,2219.156
"Recent research has suggested that the oncomir microRNA 155 (miR-155) is up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, the authors investigated the tumorigenic mechanism of this oncomir in the development of HCC.

Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted to analyze the expressions of miR-155 and its potential target genes in paired tumor tissues and adjacent tumor-free tissues and in disease-free liver tissue samples. The in silico predicted target genes of miR-155 were assessed by dual-luciferase reporting assay, real-time RT-PCR, and Western blot analyses. U6 promoters that drive miR-155 precursor overexpression and miR-155 tough decoy knock-down constructs were used to study its affects on cell proliferation in vitro and on tumor formation in nude mice.

Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated a gradual ascension of miR-155 expression in cirrhotic liver tissues and in HCC tumor tissues compared with low expression levels in normal liver tissues. Ectopic expression of miR-155 in HepG2 cells enhanced its tumorigenesis, whereas depletion of the endogenous miR-155 reversed these tumorigenic properties. Ectopic expression of sex-determining region Y box 6 (SOX6) was able to reverse the growth-promoting property of miR-155. Concordantly, the results demonstrated for the first time that SOX6 is a direct target of miR-155. Further analysis revealed that SOX6 reduced cell growth by up-regulating p21waf1/cip1 expression in a p53-dependent manner. In addition, a decline in p21waf1/cip1 expression caused by miR-155 could be reversed by SOX6 expression.

The current data indicated that SOX6 is a novel target of miR-155 and that miR-155 enhances liver cell tumorigenesis at least in part through the novel miR-155/SOX6/p21waf1/cip1 axis. These findings suggest that miR-155 may be a potential target for HCC treatment.",cell_line_tumor,0,10,8860.254,7496.935,7578.184,15575.54,14492.48,14807.77,3961.938
"The regulation of cytokine gene transcription and biosynthesis involves the reduction-oxidation (redox)-sensitive nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), whose activation is mediated by an upstream kinase that regulates the phosphorylation of inhibitory-kappaB (IkappaB). It was hypothesized that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced biosynthesis of interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in vitro is regulated by redox equilibrium. In alveolar epithelial cells, we investigated the role of L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO), an irreversible inhibitor of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, the rate-limiting enzyme in GSH biosynthesis, 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), which inhibits glutathione oxidized disulfide reductase, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an antioxidant/prooxidant thiuram, and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), an antioxidant and GSH precursor, in regulating LPS-induced cytokine biosynthesis and IkappaB-alpha/NF-kappaB signaling. BSO blockaded the phosphorylation of IkappaB-alpha, reduced its degradation, and inhibited NF-kappaB activation, besides augmenting LPS-mediated biosynthesis of cytokines. BCNU up-regulated LPS-induced release of cytokines, an effect associated with partial phosphorylation/degradation of IkappaB-alpha and inhibition of the DNA binding activity. PDTC, which partially affected LPS-induced IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation/degradation, otherwise blockading NF-kappaB activation, reduced LPS-dependent up-regulation of cytokine release. Pretreatment with BSO did not abolish the NAC-dependent reduction of LPS-induced cytokine release, despite the fact that NAC marginally amplified IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation/degradation and suppressed NF-kappaB activation. These results indicate that cytokines are redox-sensitive mediators and that the IkappaB-alpha/NF-kappaB pathway is redox-sensitive and differentially implicated in mediating redox-dependent regulation of LPS-induced release of proinflammatory cytokines.",signal_transduction,0,10,19640.42,18974.53,18575.05,25817.5,28159.6,28194.95,11163.93
"Modulation of tumorigenicity has been considered to be a reflection of the (nuclear) genetic and cellular aberrations present in tumor cells. Recent studies have suggested that cytoplasmic elements can also contribute to the malignant phenotype of cancer, and that mitochondria may be important in this process. We, therefore, undertook a study to evaluate the effects of depletion of functional mitochondria on the tumorigenic phenotype. Brain and breast tumor cells were depleted of mitochondrial DNA [rho(-)] by treatment with ethidium bromide. These rho(-) respiratory-deficient cells showed a distinct change in the tumorigenic phenotype, including loss of ability to grow in an anchorage-independent fashion and, interestingly, a substantial increase in sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs (1,3-bis-chloroethyl-1-nitrosourea and cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)). Reversion to the tumorigenic phenotype was accomplished with transfer of normal mitochondria into the diminished tumorigenic rho(-) cells. No changes in expression of the apoptosis genes bcl-2 and bax, nor the drug resistance genes mdr1, mrp, or O6-alkyltransferase was found in any of the cell types (de novo, rho(-), or cybrid). Further, the type of cell death remained the same, i.e., cells with and without mitochondria underwent apoptosis in response to exposure to cytotoxic agents. Our results indicate that mitochondria/mitochondrial DNA play a direct role in modulating aspects of the tumorigenic phenotype, although they are not necessarily a sine qua non for apoptotic cell death. This is particularly interesting because most tumor tissues are more dependent upon glycolysis for energy production, rather than mitochondrially mediated oxidative phosphorylation. Creation of rho(-) cells will be useful to study the mitochondrial processes involved in tumorigenesis.",neoplasms,0.2,7,6636.278,4753.436,4732.775,10053.56,8251.199,8306.34,3372.841
"Moraxella catarrhalis is an important cause of otitis media, sinusitis, and lower respiratory tract infections in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The purified outer membrane of M. catarrhalis contains a 29 kDa band, previously named outer membrane protein G1 (OMP G1). Polyclonal antiserum to the OMP G1 band was used to screen a genomic lambda phage library and the gene for OMP G1a was cloned and sequenced. Analysis of outer membrane by isoelectric focusing and amino-terminal protein sequence of the 29 kDa band revealed that the band is actually two individual proteins designated OMP G1a and OMP G1b. OMP G1a is a lipoprotein with an isoelectric point of 4. OMP G1b contains an unblocked amino-terminus and has an isoelectric point of 9. Analysis of the sequence of OMP G1a and OMP G1b from 25 clinical isolates revealed a high degree of conservation among strains. The sequence conservation of OMP G1a and OMP G1b among strains, combined with previous observations that OMP G1a and OMP G1b contain epitopes on the bacterial surface, indicate that OMP G1a and OMP G1b are potential vaccine antigens for M. catarrhalis.",molecular_sequence_data,0.2,6,12066.47,11449.53,11645.32,19426.67,19275.99,19797.85,6011.58
"Depression has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP) has also been identified as an independent predictor of short- and long-term cardiovascular disease events. Inflammation may influence the relationship between depression and cardiovascular disease.

The objective of this study was to investigate the association between symptoms of depression and high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) in an obese clinical population. We also sought to determine whether this relationship was different in men and women, given prior reports of a gender effect.

Symptoms of depression and hs-CRP were measured in 390 participants enrolled in a weight loss intervention trial that was delivered in a primary care setting. Symptoms of depression were evaluated with the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8), in which a score â¥ 10 is consistent with major depression.

A total of 58 (15.2%) participants reported a PHQ-8 score â¥ 10. The median (interquartile range) hs-CRP concentration was significantly higher in participants with symptoms consistent with major depression (7.7 (4.2-13) mg l(-1)) compared with those without depression (5.1 (3-9.7) mg l(-1); P&<.01). Symptoms consistent with major depression were significantly associated with log-transformed hs-CRP concentrations in an analysis adjusted for age, gender, obesity class and other metabolic variables (P=0.04). When interaction by gender was examined, this relationship remained significant in men (P&<.01) but not in women (P=0.32).

Symptoms consistent with major depression were significantly associated with hs-CRP in men only, even after adjusting for age, obesity class, metabolic variables and medications known to affect inflammation. This finding suggests that there are biologic differences between men and women that may modify the relationship between hs-CRP and depression. Further studies are needed to elucidate the biologic basis for these findings.",obesity,0.2,8,6883.222,3866.263,3765.707,13110.43,12628.64,12400.83,3292.977
"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with cognitive impairments in working memory (WM). Neuronal activation during WM tasks can be indirectly assessed by blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI). The purpose of this study was to describe BOLD-fMRI responses during 2 separate working memory tasks and a finger tapping task in men with OSA. A secondary aim was to explore the possible relation between OSA severity (apnea/hypopnea index) and BOLD-fMRI signal patterns.

Nine treatment-naÃ¯ve men (mean age [+/- SD] of 45.7 [+/- 6.6] years) with OSA underwent BOLD fMRI testing on a research-dedicated university-based MRI scanner. During BOLD-fMRI subjects performed a Paced Auditory Serial Addition task (PASAT), an auditory N-Back task (2-BACK) task, and an alternating finger tapping.

PASAT and 2-BACK tasks produced similar patterns of increased bilateral activation in posterior parietal, prefrontal and cerebellar regions. BOLD signal deactivations were observed within posterior cingulate, retrosplenial and inferior frontal regions during PASAT and 2-BACK, but not during tapping. With increased disease severity, BOLD activation patterns were increased in the right parietal lobe, but decreased in the cerebellar vermis.

These preliminary findings suggest that the severity of OSA may correlate with neural activation during tasks of working memory, potentially reflecting compensatory neural responses in severe disease.",magnetic_resonance_imaging,0.2,6,18778.9,17773.1,18084.37,29743.3,34018.83,34615.89,6539.567
"Regulatory and signaling networks coordinate the enormously complex interactions and processes that control cellular processes (such as metabolism and cell division), coordinate response to the environment, and carry out multiple cell decisions (such as development and quorum sensing). Regulatory network inference is the process of inferring these networks, traditionally from microarray data but increasingly incorporating other measurement types such as proteomics, ChIP-seq, metabolomics, and mass cytometry. We discuss existing techniques for network inference. We review in detail our pipeline, which consists of an initial biclustering step, designed to estimate co-regulated groups; a network inference step, designed to select and parameterize likely regulatory models for the control of the co-regulated groups from the biclustering step; and a visualization and analysis step, designed to find and communicate key features of the network.

"Studies in B cells from Lyn-deficient mice have identified Lyn as both a kinetic accelerator and negative regulator of signaling through the BCR. The signaling properties of bone marrow-derived mast cells from Lyn(-/-) mice (Lyn(-/-) BMMCs) have also been explored, but their signaling phenotype remains controversial. We confirm that Lyn(-/-) BMMCs release more beta-hexosaminidase than wild-type BMMCs following FcepsilonRI cross-linking and show that multiple mast cell responses to FcepsilonRI cross-linking (the phosphorylation of receptor subunits and other proteins, the activation of phospholipase Cgamma isoforms, the mobilization of Ca(2+), the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, the activation of the alpha(4)beta(1) integrin, VLA-4) are slow to initiate in Lyn(-/-) BMMCs, but persist far longer than in wild-type cells. Mechanistic studies revealed increased basal as well as stimulated phosphorylation of the Src kinase, Fyn, in Lyn(-/-) BMMCs. Conversely, there was very little basal or stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation or activity of the inositol phosphatase, SHIP, in Lyn(-/-) BMMCs. We speculate that Fyn may substitute (inefficiently) for Lyn in signal initiation in Lyn(-/-) BMMCs. The loss of SHIP phosphorylation and activity very likely contributes to the increased levels of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and the excess FcepsilonRI signaling in Lyn(-/-) BMMCs. The unexpected absence of the transient receptor potential channel, Trpc4, from Lyn(-/-) BMMCs may additionally contribute to their altered signaling properties.",signal_transduction,0.2,8,10859.5,11582.08,11588.1,16184.67,17094.27,17232.21,5755.052
"Resolution of displacement measurements based on ultrasound pulse-echo techniques is limited by the center frequency of the transmitted wave, echo sampling rate, quantization errors, and electronic noises in the measurement system. We developed a new method utilizing the clutter signal in coded excitations to determine the displacement of an object or a desired region of an object with much improved resolution. The method includes transmitting a pair of Golay complementary sequences, receiving echoes from the object or a region of the object, compressing the pulse, eliminating the main lobe, and determining the object displacement between the two transmissions from the residual clutter signal around the main lobe of the compressed pulse. Results of computer simulations showed that the new method improved the resolution by several orders of magnitude and was more robust to noise than traditional pulse-echo methods. The new method was also evaluated using an experimental ultrasound system (10 MHz center frequency, 100 MHz sampling rate, and 8-bit sampling precision).

21 patients diagnosed as GCTB were included in this study. All cases took recurrence after intralesional curettage. 9 cases were confirmed as SMGCTB and 12 cases were confirmed as RBGCTB. Cases were divided into four groups: group A, GCTB (n=9); group B, SMGCTB (n=9); group C, GCTB (n=12); group D, RBGCTB (n=12). Enhancement index(EI) of lesions on DCEMRI was calculated using formula: EI(t)=[S(t)-S(0)]/S(0), where S(0) was signal intensity of lesion on non-contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images and S(t) was signal intensity of lesion on DCEMRI (t=30, 60, 180s). Enhancement index of each group in each phase was compared using One-Way ANOVA analysis. Slope values of time-intensity curve were compared by the same way.

Time-intensity curve of SMGCTB was characterized by a steep upward slope followed by an early and rapid washout phase. Time-intensity curve of GCTB and RBGCTB was characterized by a steep slope followed by a relatively slow washout phase. No significant difference in enhancement index was found in the first phase (p>0.05). There was significant difference in the second and the third phase (p<0.05).

"Osteocalcin (OC) is a major noncollagenous bone matrix protein and an osteoblast marker whose expression is limited to mature osteoblasts during the late differentiation stage. In previous studies we have shown osteosarcomas to lose p53 function with a corresponding loss of osteocalcin gene expression. Introduction of wild type p53 resulted in re expression of the osteocalcin gene. Using gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a putative p53 binding site within the rat OC promoter region and observed an increase in OC promoter activity when p53 accumulates using a CAT assay. The p53 inducible gene Mdm2 is a well-known downstream regulator of p53 levels. Our results showed a synergistic increase in the OC promoter activity when both p53 and MDM2 were transiently overexpressed. We further demonstrate that p53 is not degraded during overexpression of MDM2 protein. Increased OC expression was observed with concomitantly increased p53, VDR, and MDM2 levels in ROS17/2.8 cells during treatment with differentiation promoting (DP) media, but was significantly decreased when co-treated with DP media and the small molecule inhibitor of MDM2-p53 interaction, Nutlin-3. We have also observed a dramatic increase of the OC promoter activity in the presence of p53 and Mdm2 with inclusion of Cbfa-1 and p300 factors.

To evaluate child and parent weight status across neighborhoods in King County (Seattle metropolitan area) and San Diego County differing in GIS-defined physical activity environment (PAE) and nutrition environment (NE) characteristics.

Neighborhoods were selected to represent high (favorable) versus low (unfavorable) on the two measures, forming four neighborhood types (low on both measures, low PAE/high NE, high PAE/low NE, and high on both measures). Weight and height of children aged 6-11 years and one parent (n=730) from selected neighborhoods were assessed in 2007-2009.

A total of 78 randomly chosen FNA smears (31 carcinomas, 24 lymphomas, and 23 sarcomas) was sent around and read ""blindly"" by six cytopathologists. Each pathologist completed a list of 16 criteria for every case. Histology was used as a reference standard. A statistical analysis led to the selection of three criteria: ""lymphoglandular bodies,"" ""well-defined clusters,"" and ""spindle-cell nuclei,"" associated with lymphoma, carcinoma, and soft-tissue sarcoma, respectively. Given the scores on these criteria, the probabilities to be assigned to the three diagnostic categories can be read from a table. It turns out, as one might expect, that the classification of the most probable disease is pretty reliable if one cytologic criterion scores much higher than the other two criteria. On other cases, fuzziness appears and misclassifications are far from improbable. This study offers a general cytologic approach.

However, histologic analysis of the lesion revealed that there was no osteonecrosis but rather a subchondral microfracture with active callus formation.",magnetic_resonance_imaging,0,6,4711.752,2685.62,2255.201,7440.279,6905.527,6586.922,2487.868
"To find an accurate algorithm for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in nontraumatic chest pain patients on presentation to the emergency department.

In a prospective clinical study, we compared the diagnostic performances of clinical symptoms, presenting ECG, creatinine kinase, creatine kinase MB activity and mass concentration, myoglobin, and cardiac troponin T test results of hospital admission blood samples. By classification and regression trees, a decision tree for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction was developed.

Emergency room of a Department of Internal Medicine (University Hospital).

One hundred fourteen nontraumatic chest pain patients (median delay from onset of chest pain to hospital admission, 3 h; range, 0.33 to 22): 26 Q-wave and 19 non-Q-wave myocardial infarctions, 49 patients with unstable angina pectoris, and 20 patients with chest pain caused by other diseases.

Of each parameter taken by itself, the ECG was tendentiously most informative (areas under receiver operating characteristic plots: 0.87 +/- 0.04 [ECG], 0.80 +/- 0.08 [myoglobin], 0.80 +/- 0.04 [creatine kinase MB mass], 0.77 +/- 0.04 [creatine kinase activity], 0.69 +/- 0.06 [clinical symptoms] 0.67 +/- 0.06 [creatine kinase MB activity], 0.67 +/- 0.05 [troponin T]). In patients presenting 3 h or less after the onset of chest pain, ECG signs of acute transmural myocardial ischemia were the best discriminator between patients with and without myocardial infarction. In patients presenting more than 3 h, however, creatine kinase MB mass concentrations (discriminator value, 6.7 micrograms/L) were superior to the ECG, clinical symptoms, and all other biochemical markers tested. This algorithm for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction was superior to each parameter by itself and was characterized by 0.91 sensitivity, a 0.90 specificity, a 0.90 positive and negative predictive value, and a 0.90 efficiency.

We found an algorithm that could accurately separate the myocardial infarction patients from the others on admission to the emergency department.

"Because of unparalleled sensitivity and tolerance to protein size, mass spectrometry (MS) has become a popular method for measuring the solution hydrogen (1H/2H) exchange (HX) of biologically relevant protein states. While incorporated deuterium can be localized to different regions by pepsin proteolysis of the labeled protein, the assignment of deuteriums to individual residues is typically not obtained, thereby limiting a detailed understanding of HX and the dynamics of protein structure. Here we use gas-phase fragmentation of peptic peptides by electron transfer dissociation (ETD) to measure the HX of individual amide linkages in the amyloidogenic protein beta2-microglobulin. A comparison of the deuterium levels of 60 individual backbone amides of beta2-microglobulin measured by HX-ETD-MS analysis to the corresponding values measured by NMR spectroscopy shows an excellent correlation. The deuterium labeling pattern of beta2-microglobulin is retained in the gaseous fragment ions by employing mild declustering conditions for electrospray ionization. A recently developed model peptide is used to arrive at such ion source declustering conditions that prevent the occurrence of intramolecular gas-phase hydrogen (1H/2H) migration (i.e., hydrogen scrambling). This article demonstrates that ETD can be implemented in a mass spectrometric method to monitor the conformational dynamics of proteins in solution at single-residue resolution.",molecular_sequence_data,0,8,9719.277,8259.97,8372.213,16330.48,15492.75,15819.22,3179.316

"Candida parapsilosis has been previously shown to produce a lipase/acyltransferase (EC 3.1.1.3) that preferentially catalyses transfer reactions such as alcoholysis over hydrolysis in the presence of suitable nucleophiles other than water, even in aqueous media (aw > 0.9 ). This enzyme has been shown to belong to a new family of lipases. The present work describes the cloning of the gene coding for this lipase/acyltransferase in the yeast Pichia pastoris and the heterologous high-level expression of the recombinant enzyme. The lipase/acyltransferase gene, in which the sequence encoding the signal peptide was replaced by that of the alpha-factor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was placed under the control of the methanol inducible promoter of the alcohol oxidase 1 gene (AOX1). A transformed P. pastoris clone, containing five copies of the lipase/acyltransferase gene, was selected for the production of recombinant enzyme.

"The high potential of Superquadrics as modeling elements for image segmentation tasks has been pointed out since years in the computer vision community. In this work we employ superquadrics as modeling elements for multiple object segmentation in range images. Segmentation is executed in two stages. Firstly, a hypothesis about the values of the segmentation parameters is generated. Secondly, the hypothesis is refined locally. In both stages, object boundary and region information are considered. Boundary information is derived via model-based edge detection in the input range image. Hypothesis generation uses boundary information to isolate image regions which can be accurately described by superquadrics. Within hypothesis refinement, a game-theoretic framework is used to fuse the two information sources by associating an objective function to each information source. Iterative optimization of the two objective functions in succession, outputs a precise description of all image objects. We demonstrate experimentally that this approach substantially improves the most established method in superquadric segmentation, in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. We demonstrate the applicability of our segmentation framework in real world applications by constructing a novel robotic system for automatic unloading of jumbled box-like objects from platforms.",algorithms,0.2,4,6773.802,6292.074,6416.908,13625.16,12882.54,13279.23,2247.722
"Although regulation of chondrogenesis and cartilage development by Wnt signaling is well established, the function of Wnt in the maintenance and destruction of cartilage remains largely unknown. Here we investigated the involvement and regulatory mechanisms of Wnt signaling in cartilage destruction. We found that interleukin-1beta, the primary pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in cartilage destruction, induces expression of Wnt-5a and -7a in primary culture articular chondrocytes. The level of beta-catenin was also increased in chondrocytes of arthritic cartilage, suggesting the association of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling with arthritic cartilage destruction. In addition, our results show that Wnt-7a induces dedifferentiation and inhibits NO-induced apoptosis of primary culture articular chondrocytes. Wnt-7a induces dedifferentiation of articular chondrocytes by stimulating transcriptional activity of beta-catenin, whereas NO-induced apoptosis is inhibited via the activation of cell survival signaling, such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt, which block apoptotic signaling cascade. Our results collectively suggest that Wnt-7a is associated with cartilage destruction by regulating the maintenance of differentiation status and the apoptosis of articular chondrocytes via different mechanisms.",signal_transduction,0.2,8,10287.09,10520.05,10670.55,17463.31,18184.08,18503.34,4784.565
"Pretreatment with octreotide (OCT) in acromegaly has been reported to improve surgical outcome. The objective of this study was to analyze retrospectively the effects of a 3- to 6-month presurgical treatment with OCT in acromegalics focusing on electrocardiographic (ECG) records, blood pressure levels, glucose and lipid profile, tumor size and consistency, easy tumor removal at surgery, and morphological findings at pathology. Fifty-nine patients with acromegaly who were undergoing surgical treatment were studied randomly before surgery; 37 patients were untreated, and 22 were treated with OCT at doses ranging 150-600 micrograms/day for 3-6 months. At study entry, untreated and OCT-treated patients had similar circulating GH and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), glucose, and cholesterol levels as well as prevalence of overt diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and ECG abnormalities. In untreated and OCT-treated patients, respectively, radiological imaging documented microadenoma in 0 and 1, intrasellar macroadenoma in 10 and 6, intra- and suprasellar macroadenoma in 18 and 11, invasive macroadenoma in 9 and 4 patients. Before surgery, serum GH and IGF-I levels significantly decreased in the 22 OCT-treated acromegalics, and in 5 of them, a significant shrinkage was documented. ECG abnormalities disappeared in 7 of 11 (63.6%) OCT-treated patients. In 3 of the 7 patients with diabetes mellitus, treatment with OCT together with low carbohydrate intake normalized blood glucose levels, whereas in 2 patients, insulin could be replaced by oral antidiabetics, and in 2 patients, the insulin dose was reduced. Presurgical blood glucose, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, as well as systolic (145.2 +/- 3.4 vs. 132.9 +/- 2.5 mm Hg; P < 0.01) and diastolic (94.3 +/- 1.7 vs. 84.3 +/- 1.6 mm Hg; P < 0.001) blood pressure levels were significantly higher in untreated than in OCT-treated patients. Two weeks after surgery, circulating GH and IGF-I levels were normalized in 11 untreated (29.7%) and 12 OCT-treated (54.5%) patients (P < 0.005, by chi 2 test). Macroscopically, no difference was found between untreated and OCT-treated adenomas, whereas at pathology, a significant increases in cellular atypia (31.6% vs. 19.2%; P < 0.05) was found in OCT-treated adenomas. One patients in the untreated group died from cardiorespiratory arrest during the early postoperative period. Finally, the average duration of hospitalization after operation was longer in untreated than in OCT-treated patients (8.6 +/- 0.7 vs. 5.6 +/- 0.5 days). We conclude that a 3- to 6-month treatment with OCT before surgery for GH-secreting adenoma improved clinical conditions and surgical outcome and reduced the duration of hospitalization after operation.",magnetic_resonance_imaging,0.2,9,12491.62,12287.74,12401.09,22742.86,24866.87,24767.75,5981.727

"Signals sent through CD40 play crucial roles in B cell differentiation, including blocking apoptosis of germinal center B cells. In this study, using a murine B cell WEHI-231 line that undergoes apoptosis by the cross-linking of surface Ag receptors (sIgM), we have demonstrated that CD40 signalings are linked to induction of the Bcl-xL, Cdk4, and Cdk6 proteins whose expression was significantly suppressed by the apoptotic signal through sIgM. Mutational analyses of CD40 revealed that the domain of human CD40 required for blocking apoptosis of WEHI-231 cells coincides with that required for Bcl-xL induction. Signals through sIgM arrest cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, which is followed by apoptosis. However, while constitutive expression of Bcl-XL leads to the inhibition of apoptosis. Nevertheless, Bcl-xL fails to induce S phase entry. By CD40 signalings, both Cdk4 and Cdk6 resume their normal expression levels, which are sufficient for passing the restriction point in G1 even in the presence of the apoptotic signals mediated by sIgM. These results suggest that cooperation of Bcl-xL, Cdk4, and Cdk6 induced by CD40 signaling plays a key role in CD40-mediated selective growth of B cells.",signal_transduction,0.6,5,8158.47,7523.438,7551.857,16308.1,15293.59,15752.69,4578.947
"Melanocytes express MITF, which is crucial for the development of the melanocyte lineage and is overexpressed in malignant melanomas. Adenoviral E1A protein-expressing melanocytes are unpigmented, with the expression of MITF being silenced. We tested here a direct repression of the melanocyte-specific MITF promoter by E1A and its mutants. We found that the extreme N-terminus and conserved region 1 are required for repression. In contrast, the motif in conserved region 2 (a.a. 122-126), as well as amino acids 26-35 at the N-terminus, are not necessary. As these two later motifs mediate E1A binding to the retinoblastoma protein or to the transcriptional co-activator TRRAP, respectively, and are important for transformation by E1A in cooperation with other oncogenes, the results suggest that the transformation-defective E1A can still efficiently repress the MITF promoter. The CREB binding motif-mutated promoter had lower activity, but was also repressed by the same E1A mutants in human melanoma cells. The E1A protein is known to also exert an antitumour activity, which is associated with its transcription repression function and the ability to induce apoptosis, and is a potential antimelanoma agent. Since recent data suggest that MITF may be a survival factor for melanoma cells, the E1A mutants described here might constitute a good targeting agent for antimelanoma therapy.",cell_line_tumor,0.2,6,6123.468,4919.19,5078.011,10000.73,8377.606,8646.649,3475.971
"The workforce of the UK Atomic Energy Authority has been the subject of several previous epidemiological investigations.

To detect and investigate associations between mortality rates and employment in a substantially increased cohort size and follow up extended to 1997.

The new cohort included 51 367 employees, of whom 10 249 were dead. Mortality rates for all workers were low compared to national rates, as were rates in radiation workers and for workers monitored for internal contamination. For radiation workers all cause mortality and all cancer mortality were significantly lower than for non-radiation workers. There was no overall trend of increasing mortality with radiation dose. There was little evidence of raised mortality from leukaemia. The association of prostatic cancer with radiation dose was much less significant than in previous reports. However, the relatively high mortality from uterine cancers among radiation workers remained, though the numbers were very small. The association was with endometrial rather than cervical cancer. Mortality from cancer of the pleura was high among radiation workers, but was not correlated with dose.

Overall, radiation workers at UKAEA showed no excess mortality. The previously detected association of prostate cancer with high radiation dose may have been a statistical artefact or a risk associated with discontinued activities. Endometrial cancer occurred at higher rates in female radiation workers, but, because there was no correlation with dose, may well be due to something other than their radiation exposure. Cancer of the pleura in radiation workers was almost certainly related to past asbestos exposure.",neoplasms,0.6,7,5285.427,3929.738,3692.448,11196.6,13034.37,13108.24,3144.857
"Prediction of a protein's structure from its amino acid sequence is a key issue in molecular biology. While dynamics, performed in the space of two-dimensional contact maps, eases the necessary conformational search, it may also lead to maps that do not correspond to any real three-dimensional structure. To remedy this, an efficient procedure is needed to reconstruct three-dimensional conformations from their contact maps.

We present an efficient algorithm to recover the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its contact map representation. We show that when a physically realizable map is used as target, our method generates a structure whose contact map is essentially similar to the target. furthermore, the reconstructed and original structures are similar up to the resolution of the contact map representation. Next, we use nonphysical target maps, obtained by corrupting a physical one; in this case, our method essentially recovers the underlying physical map and structure. Hence, our algorithm will help to fold proteins, using dynamics in the space of contact maps. Finally, we investigate the manner in which the quality of the recovered structure degrades when the number of contacts is reduced.

The procedure is capable of assigning quickly and reliably a three-dimensional structure to a given contact map. It is well suited for use in parallel with dynamics in contact map space to project a contact map onto its closest physically allowed structural counterpart.",algorithms,0.2,5,5044.989,4009.592,4022.554,8600.598,9418.932,9640.367,2139.335
"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been shown to be a very useful tool to do research on psychiatric disorders, validating psychotherapeutical interventions, medication as well as disorder-specific deficits. The field of fMRI-research is examining the potential of identifying differences of activity between brains of clinical, subclinical and healthy subjects. The design of such research is drawn to evaluate the average activation to different conditions. We remark that there are still some methodological problems to face, i.e. choosing the sample with special considerations on comorbidity and medication, accounting individual differences in brain activation, complex statistical calculations etc. When evaluating therapeutical interventions it is necessary to take the placebo-effect into account. However, fMRI is a highly promising research method. For future application of fMRI in clinical practice it would be worth building standard paradigms.

"The thermal behavior of the Soret band relative to the carbonmonoxy derivatives of some beta-chain mutant hemoglobins is studied in the temperature range 300-10 K and compared to that of wild-type carbonmonoxy hemoglobin. The band profile at various temperatures is modeled as a Voigt function that accounts for homogeneous broadening and for the coupling with high- and low-frequency vibrational modes, while inhomogeneous broadening is taken into account with a gaussian distribution of purely electronic transition frequencies. The various contributions to the over-all bandwidth are singled out with this analysis and their temperature dependence, in turn, gives information on structural and dynamic properties of the system studied. In the wild-type and mutant hemoglobins, the values of homogeneous bandwidth and of the coupling constants to high-frequency vibrational modes are not modified with respect to natural human hemoglobin, thus indicating that the local electronic and vibrational properties of the heme-CO complex are not altered by the recombinant procedures. On the contrary, differences in the protein dynamic behavior are observed. The most relevant are those relative to the ""polar isosteric"" beta Val-67(E11)-->Thr substitution, localized in the heme pocket, which results in decreased coupling with low-frequency modes and increased anharmonic motions.

"The gene (cbpA) coding for a carotenoid-binding protein of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 (Anacystis nidulans R2) has been cloned and sequenced. A polyclonal antibody against the protein was used to identify immunoreactive clones from a lambda gt11 expression library of Synechococcus strain PCC 7942. The initial positive clone (lambda gtAN42) contained a 0.9-kilobase (kb) chromosomal fragment, which was used to detect a larger chromosomal fragment from a lambda EMBL3 library. The lambda EMBL3 recombinant, lambda EM109, contained an 18-kb portion of the Synechococcus strain PCC 7942 chromosome. The open reading frame of cbpA encoded 450 amino acids which give rise to a protein of 49,113 daltons. The hydrophobicity plot indicates that the protein may have a 49-residue signal sequence which is cleaved to yield a mature protein of 43,709 daltons. The protein has been localized in the cytoplasmic membrane by biochemical procedures as well as by electron microscopic immunocytochemistry. Northern (RNA) blot analysis indicates that transcription of cbpA is tightly regulated by DNA topology, light intensity, and iron concentration. Transcription is greatly induced by growth under high light intensities and repressed during growth under iron-deficient conditions. The DNA gyrase inhibitor novobiocin specifically inhibited the light-induced transcription.

"A technique is developed to minimize magnetic resonance pulse sequence dead-periods, with first and higher moment requirements, while imaging in oblique planes. Dead-period requirements of starting amplitude, ending amplitudes, area, and other moment requirements are transformed from the image coordinate system to the physical gradient coordinate system, where the waveforms are then designed. With this technique, the full capabilities of the gradient hardware are utilized. An online algorithm is presented to perform dead-period minimization and gradient waveform design when the first moment and area of the dead-period are specified. The algorithm is then used to implement three-axis flow-compensation in a fast spoiled gradient-echo sequence. This results in a minimal increase in TE and TR over an equivalent non-flow-compensated sequence, and little variation in the minimum TR over the entire range of oblique slice orientations.

"Video capsule enteroscopy (VCE) has revolutionized small bowel imaging, enabling visual examination of the mucosa of the entire small bowel, while MR enteroclysis (MRE) and CT enteroclysis (CTE) have largely replaced conventional barium enteroclysis.

The aim of this study was to determine the clinical value of subsequent MRE and CTE in patients in whom a test capsule did not present itself in due time.

Seventy-five consecutive patients were identified with a delayed or unnoticed delivery of the test capsule. Seventy patients consented to participate and underwent MRE (44) or CTE (26).

In the remaining 50 patients no VCE or other endoscopic intervention was performed indicating that the referring physician was content with the diagnostic information from MRE or CTE.

"During chronic injury a population of bipotent hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) become     activated to regenerate both cholangiocytes and hepatocytes. Here we show in human diseased     liver and mouse models of the ductular reaction that Notch and Wnt signaling direct     specification of HPCs via their interactions with activated myofibroblasts or macrophages. In     particular, we found that during biliary regeneration, expression of Jagged 1 (a Notch ligand)     by myofibroblasts promoted Notch signaling in HPCs and thus their biliary specification to     cholangiocytes. Alternatively, during hepatocyte regeneration, macrophage engulfment of     hepatocyte debris induced Wnt3a expression.

"Race is strongly associated with risk for metabolic dysfunction, but there is limited prospective data concerning the impact of race on antipsychotic metabolic outcomes among patients with schizophrenia.

Between-drug and within-drug outcomes were analyzed separately for each racial cohort across weight, lipid, and glucose parameters.

For white subjects (N = 167), olanzapine significantly worsened all metabolic parameters except high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and fasting glucose, and this was significantly different than aripiprazole for every outcome except fasting glucose. In the black/Hispanic cohort (N = 137), olanzapine treatment resulted in adverse metabolic outcomes, and these changes were significantly different from aripiprazole for adiposity, total cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol. Aripiprazole decreased the odds of endpoint metabolic syndrome compared with olanzapine for all subjects (OR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.19 to 0.55), the white cohort (OR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.41), and black/Hispanic subjects (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.25 to 1.12), but the black/Hispanic result was not statistically significant (p = .096). Within the aripiprazole group, white subjects had significantly lower risk for metabolic syndrome, but there was no significant difference in metabolic syndrome between white and black/Hispanic subjects exposed to olanzapine.

Race may be an important moderator of metabolic risk during atypical antipsychotic therapy. Olanzapine treatment is associated with greater effects on adiposity and lipids than aripiprazole in both white and black/Hispanic subjects, suggesting that antipsychotic choice and intensive monitoring are important in minimizing metabolic risk, especially in nonwhite patients.",obesity,0.4,4,12877.95,10662.18,10695.82,19610.77,20028.0,20249.97,6006.411
"Astrocyte swelling is an integral component of cytotoxic brain edema in ischemic injury. While mechanisms underlying astrocyte swelling are likely multifactorial, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are hypothesized to contribute to such swelling. We investigated the protective effects of cinnamon polyphenol extract (CPE) that has anti-oxidant and insulin-potentiating effects on cell swelling and depolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) in ischemic injury. C6 glial cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and cell volume determined using the 3-O-methyl-[3H]-glucose method at 90 min after the end of OGD. When compared with controls, OGD increased cell volume by 34%. This increase was blocked by CPE or insulin but not by blockers of oxidative/nitrosative stress including vitamin E, resveratrol, N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) or uric acid. Mitochondrial dysfunction, a key component of ischemic injury, contributes to cell swelling. Changes in DeltaPsi(m) were assessed at the end of OGD with tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE), a potentiometric dye. OGD induced a 39% decline in DeltaPsi(m) and this decline was blocked by CPE as well as insulin. To test the involvement of the mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT), we used Cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressant and a blocker of the mPT pore. CsA blocked cell swelling and the decline in DeltaPsi(m) but FK506, an immunosuppressant that does not block the mPT, did not. Our results show that CPE reduces OGD-induced cell swelling as well as the decline in DeltaPsi(m) in cultures and some of its protective effects may be through inhibiting the mPT.",cell_line_tumor,0.2,5,8480.294,6988.532,6974.908,13534.94,14721.74,14388.13,4891.007

"Tomosynthesis is a 3-dimensional mammography technique that generates thin slices separated one to the other by typically 1 mm from source data sets. The relatively high image noise in these thin slices raises the value of 1-cm thick slices computed from the set of reconstructed slices for image interpretation. In an initial evaluation, we investigated the potential of different algorithms for generating thick slices from tomosynthesis source data (maximum intensity projection-MIP; average algorithm-AV, and image generation by means of a new algorithm, so-called softMip). The three postprocessing techniques were evaluated using a homogeneous phantom with one textured slab with a total thickness of about 5 cm in which two 0.5-cm-thick slabs contained objects to simulate microcalcifications, spiculated masses, and round masses. The phantom was examined by tomosynthesis (GE Healthcare). Microcalcifications were simulated by inclusion of calcium particles of four different sizes. The slabs containing the inclusions were examined in two different configurations: adjacent to each other and close to the detector and with the two slabs separated by two 1-cm thick breast equivalent material slabs. The reconstructed tomosynthesis slices were postprocessed using MIP, AV, and softMip to generate 1-cm thick slices with a lower noise level. The three postprocessing algorithms were assessed by calculating the resulting contrast versus background for the simulated microcalcifications and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) for the other objects. The CNRs of the simulated round and spiculated masses were most favorable for the thick slices generated with the average algorithm, followed by softMip and MIP. Contrast of the simulated microcalcifications was best for MIP, followed by softMip and average projections. Our results suggest that the additional generation of thick slices may improve the visualization of objects in tomosynthesis. This improvement differs from the different algorithms for microcalcifications, speculated objects, and round masses. SoftMip is a new approach combining features of MIP and average showing image properties in between MIP and AV.",algorithms,0,7,6567.657,6236.535,6187.374,12332.42,12920.43,13148.58,2547.052
"Although a great deal has been learned about the medical aspects of intraoperative blood salvage, several fundamental medical issues remain controversial. As pressure increases to maximize the use of IBS, more research will be needed on the application of salvage techniques in cancer surgery and in the presence of bacterial contamination. The reintroduction of the use of devices that do not wash salvaged blood have reopened investigations into the effects of reinfusion of partially hemolyzed and partially clotted salvaged blood on coagulation, renal function, and cardiopulmonary performance. More studies are also needed so that empirically based standards of practice for the collection and storage of salvaged blood can be established. No longer confined to a few pioneering surgical departments, IBS is now widely practiced and likely to continue to grow rapidly.

"The proteolytic activity of Furin responsible for processing full length Notch-1 (p300) plays a critical role in Notch signaling. The amplitude and duration of Notch activity can be regulated at various points in the pathway, but there has been no report regarding regulation of the Notch-1-Furin interaction, despite its importance. In the present study, we found that the Notch-1-Furin interaction is regulated by the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, c-Src. c-Src and Notch-1 are physically associated, and this association is responsible for Notch-1 processing and activation. We also found that growth factor TGF-Î±, an EGFR ligand, and PDGF-BB, a PDGFR ligand, induce the Notch-1-Furin interaction mediated by c-Src. Our results support three new and provocative conclusions: (1) The association between Notch-1 and Furin is a well-regulated process; (2) Extracellular growth factor signals regulate this interaction, which is mediated by c-Src; (3) There is cross-talk between the plasma growth factor receptor-c-Src and Notch pathways. Co-localization of Notch-1 and c-Src was confirmed in xenograft tumor tissues and in the tissues of pancreatic cancer patients.

"Apple ( Malus x domestica Borkh.) sequences sharing homology with known resistance genes were cloned using a PCR-based approach with degenerate oligonucleotide primers designed on conserved regions of the nucleotide-binding site (NBS). Sequence analysis of the amplified fragments indicated the presence of at least 27 families of NBS-containing genes in apple, each composed of several very similar or nearly identical sequences. The NBS-leucine-rich repeat homologues appeared to include members of the two major groups that have been described in dicot plants: one possessing a toll-interleukin receptor element and one lacking such a domain. Genetic mapping of the cloned sequences was achieved through the development of CAPS and SSCP markers using a segregating population of a cross between the two apple cultivars Fiesta and Discovery. Several of the apple resistance gene homologues mapped in the vicinity, or at least on the same linkage group, of known loci controlling resistance to various pathogens.

"The effect of echoplanar imaging (EPI) acoustic background noise on blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activations was investigated. Two EPI pulse sequences were compared: (i) conventional EPI with a pulsating sound component of typically 8-10 Hz, which is a potent physiological stimulus, and (ii) the more recently developed continuous-sound EPI, which is perceived as less distractive despite equivalent peak sound pressure levels. Sixteen healthy subjects performed an established demanding visual n-back working memory task. Using an exploratory data analysis technique (tensorial probabilistic independent component analysis; tensor-PICA), we studied the inter-session/within-subject response variability introduced by continuous-sound versus conventional EPI acoustic background noise in addition to temporal and spatial signal characteristics. The analysis revealed a task-related component associated with the established higher-level working memory and motor feedback response network, which exhibited a significant 19% increase in its average effect size for the continuous-sound as opposed to conventional EPI. Stimulus-related lower-level activations, such as primary visual areas, were not modified. EPI acoustic background noise influences much more than the auditory system per se. This analysis provides additional evidence for an enhancement of task-related, extra-auditory BOLD activations by continuous-sound EPI due to less distractive acoustic background gradient noise.",magnetic_resonance_imaging,0.2,7,14097.92,11416.11,11774.05,24222.48,23179.49,23630.57,5154.64
"Phytocannabinoids from the plant Cannabis sativa induce a variety of physiological and pharmacological responses in living systems, including anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, anti-ulcer and antitumor activities. The discovery of the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 led to the development of agonists and antagonists of these receptors for the treatment of a variety of diseases. Nabilone, a synthetic derivative of Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta9-THC), which is the main natural psychotropic constituent of C sativa, was approved by the US FDA for the treatment of nausea and as an anti-emetic for patients undergoing chemotherapy. Delta9-THC and related cannabinoids are involved in a variety of signal transduction pathways; thus, reducing or removing the psychotropic effects of these compounds would enhance their therapeutic spectra. Compound synthesis and qualitative SAR studies are time-consuming activities; however, microbes are effectively the most inventive synthetic chemists because of their metabolic plasticity.

"Adult neural stem cells (NSCs) are known to exist in a few regions of the brain; however, the entity and physiological/disease relevance of adult hypothalamic NSCs (htNSCs) remain unclear. This work shows that adult htNSCs are multipotent and predominantly present in the mediobasal hypothalamus of adult mice. Chronic high-fat-diet feeding led to not only depletion but also neurogenic impairment of htNSCs associated with IKKÎ²/NF-ÎºB activation. In vitro htNSC models demonstrated that their survival and neurogenesis markedly decreased on IKKÎ²/NF-ÎºB activation but increased on IKKÎ²/NF-ÎºB inhibition, mechanistically mediated by IKKÎ²/NF-ÎºB-controlled apoptosis and Notch signalling. Mouse studies revealed that htNSC-specific IKKÎ²/NF-ÎºB activation led to depletion and impaired neuronal differentiation of htNSCs, and ultimately the development of obesity and pre-diabetes.

"Radiolabelling of leukocytes using labelled phagocytosed technetium-99m (99mTc) colloidal radiopharmaceuticals has been reported as a method for imaging infection. This in vivo study compares the use of leukocytes labelled using 99mTc stannous fluoride colloid with leukocytes labelled using indium-111 (111In) oxinate. A total of 26 patients (10 male, 16 female; mean age 52 years, range 23-88 years) referred for the investigation of possible infection were studied using both leukocyte labelling methods simultaneously. Images were acquired 4h and 24h after re-injection of the labelled cells. The images were evaluated qualitatively by two nuclear medicine physicians. The results show a high degree of concordance between the techniques: 11 of the 28 images showed a focus of leukocyte accumulation with both techniques at 24h, and 13 out of 28 showed a normal appearance at 24h with both methods. In four cases the results were discordant; the 99mTc stannous fluoride colloid labelled leukocytes gave a false positive appearance at 24h in three patients and a false negative in one. In conclusion, colloid labelling of leukocytes offers a sensitive method for the detection of infective foci coupled with the high resolution imaging offered by 99mTc.

"The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV, also called human herpesvirus 8) has been linked to KS and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) in immunocompromised individuals. We report that PEL cell lines have constitutive active alternative NF-kappa B pathway and demonstrate high-level expression of NF-kappa B2/p100 precursor and its processed subunit p52. To elucidate the mechanism of activation of the alternative NF-kappa B pathway in PEL cells, we have investigated the role of KSHV-encoded viral Fas-associated death domain-like IL- beta 1-converting enzyme inhibitory protein (vFLIP) K13. We demonstrate that stable expression of K13, but not other FLIPs, in a variety of cell lines constitutively up-regulates p100/NF-kappa B2 expression and leads to its processing into the p52 subunit. K13-induced up-regulation and processing of p100 critically depends on the I kappa B kinase (IKK)alpha/IKK1 subunit of the IKK complex, whereas IKK beta/IKK2, receptor-interacting protein, and NF-kappa B-inducing kinase are dispensable for this process. Silencing of endogenous K13 expression by siRNA inhibits p100 processing and cellular proliferation. Our results demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that KSHV vFLIP K13 is required for the growth and proliferation of PEL cells and alternative NF-kappa B pathway plays a key role in this process.

To investigate if AK isoenzymes have a comparable function in the energy-demand management of proliferating cells, AK1 and AK1beta were expressed in mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells and in human colon carcinoma SW480 cells. Glucose deprivation, galactose feeding, and metabolic inhibitor tests revealed a differential energy dependency for these two cell lines. N2a cells showed a faster proliferation rate and strongest coupling to mitochondrial activity, SW480 proliferation was more dependent on glycolysis. Despite these differences, ectopic expression of AK1 or AK1beta did not affect their growth characteristics under normal conditions. Also, no differential effects were seen under metabolic stress upon treatment with mitochondrial and glycolytic inhibitors in in vitro culture or in solid tumors grown in vivo.

"It is unclear whether the increased risk of colon cancer associated with obesity differs for men and women, by distribution of body fat, or by location of the tumor. The primary goal of this study was to address these questions.

Eligible subjects from the Framingham Study cohort were classified according to body mass index (BMI) and waist size during two age periods: 30-54 y (n=3764) and 55-79 y (n=3802). All eligible men and women were cancer-free at baseline and had complete information on the following potential confounders: age, sex, education, height, activity, smoking, and alcohol. There were 157 incident lifetime cases of colon cancer among those followed beginning at 30-54 y of age and 149 lifetime cases among those whose follow up began at 55-79 y. Subjects were stratified further by gender, activity, and tumor location. The Cox Proportional Hazards Models were used to adjust for possible confounding by the above-described factors.

A BMI&>/=30 led to a 50% increased risk (95% CI: 0.92-2.5) of colon cancer among middle-aged (30-54 y) and a 2.4-fold increased risk (95% CI: 1.5-3.9) among older (55-79 y) adults. The BMI effect was stronger for men than for women and for cases occurring in the proximal colon. These adverse effects generally diminished when waist was added to the multivariable models. A larger waist size &>/=99.1 cm (39 in) and 101.6 cm (40 in) for women and men, respectively) was associated with a two-fold increased risk of colon cancer; this risk increased linearly with increasing waist size and was evident for both proximal and distal colon cancer. There was no attenuation of these effects when BMI was added to the multivariable models. A larger waist had a particularly adverse effect among sedentary subjects (relative risk (RR)=4.4 for middle-aged adults; RR=3.0 for older adults).

"For many years, bacterial cells were considered primarily as selfish individuals, but, in recent years, it has become evident that, far from operating in isolation, they coordinate collective behaviour in response to environmental challenges using sophisticated intercellular communication networks. Cell-to-cell communication between bacteria is mediated by small diffusible signal molecules that trigger changes in gene expression in response to fluctuations in population density. This process, generally referred to as quorum sensing (QS), controls diverse phenotypes in numerous Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Recent advances have revealed that bacteria are not limited to communication within their own species but are capable of 'listening in' and 'broadcasting to' unrelated species to intercept messages and coerce cohabitants into behavioural modifications, either for the good of the population or for the benefit of one species over another. It is also evident that QS is not limited to the bacterial kingdom.

Prior analyses have demonstrated that the enhancer contains a 28-bp core region and local adjacent augmentative cis elements. We now show that the core contains a single critical c-Myb binding site. In both transiently cotransfected human cells and stable chromatin-integrated yeast cells, c-Myb strongly transactivated reporter constructs that contained polymerized core sequences. c-Myb protein was strongly evident in T lymphoblasts in which the enhancer was active and was localized within discrete nuclear structures. Fetal murine thymus exhibited a striking concordance of endogenous c-myb expression with that of mouse ADA and human ADA LCR-directed transgene expression.

"Lipids form a diverse group of water-insoluble molecules that include triacylglycerides, phosphoglycerides, sterols and sphingolipids. They play several important roles at cellular and organismal levels. Fatty acids are the major building blocks for the synthesis of triacylglycerides, which are mainly used for energy storage. Phosphoglycerides, together with sterols and sphingolipids, represent the major structural components of biological membranes. Lipids can also have important roles in signalling, functioning as second messengers and as hormones. There is increasing evidence that cancer cells show specific alterations in different aspects of lipid metabolism. These alterations can affect the availability of structural lipids for the synthesis of membranes, the synthesis and degradation of lipids that contribute to energy homeostasis and the abundance of lipids with signalling functions.

Analysis of thrombotic risk showed that 61% of cancer patient group had venous thrombosis without classic thrombotic risk, as compared to 32% in non cancer patient group, showing the direct role of cancer in thrombosis (p &lt; 0.01). The cancer was often aggressive and metastatic adenocarcinoma of various origins. The effect of chemotherapy is not clear, only hormonotherapy seemed to be responsible in two cases. Cancer hypercoagulability, defined by clinical characteristics, is a real risk factor of venous thrombosis but of low frequency. Indeed, the incidence of venous thrombosis in oncologic unit is rare (0.4%). Finally, thromboembolic disease in cancer patients is not different than in no cancer patients, Trousseau's syndrome is unfrequent. Prognosis is poor (40% death with 44.5 days of median survival), and antithrombotic therapy complications are frequent (bleeding 16%, oral anticoagulants resistance 20%).",neoplasms,0.4,4,7193.102,6027.557,6086.985,12500.41,11339.85,11508.81,3458.262

"Genome-wide analyses such as DNA microarray, RNA sequencing and RNA interference-based high-throughput screening are prevalent to decipher a biological process of interest, and provide a large quantity of data to be processed. An ultimate goal for researchers must be extrapolation of their data to human diseases. We have conducted functional genome-wide screenings to elucidate molecular mechanisms of the inflammation amplifier, a NFÎºB/STAT3-dependent machinery that potently drives recruitment of immune cells to promote inflammation. Using a public database of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we recently reported the reverse-direction method by which our mass screening data were successfully linked to many human diseases. As an example, the epiregulin-epidermal growth factor receptor pathway was identified as a regulator of the inflammation amplifier, and associated with human diseases by GWAS. In fact, serum epiregulin levels were higher in patients with chronic inflammatory disorders. The reverse-direction method can be a useful tool to narrow mass data down to focus on human disease-related genes.",signal_transduction,0,7,7411.429,6313.571,6395.46,13423.85,12447.91,12664.99,2733.189
"The androgen receptor (AR) plays a central role in the development and progression of prostate cancer. AR expression is maintained throughout the progression of prostate cancer and is also associated with an aggressive, castration-resistant (CR) phenotype. Despite the critical roles of AR expression in prostate cancer progression, the exact signaling mechanism regulating AR expression remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that AR expression was increased by a low-affinity leukotriene B(4) receptor (BLT2)-linked pathway. We found that BLT2 was overexpressed in AR-positive prostate cancer cells, such as LNCaP cells, and BLT2 inhibition, using an inhibitor or siRNA knockdown, clearly attenuated AR expression and triggered apoptosis in these cells. These results suggest a role for BLT2 in AR expression and the survival of AR-positive prostate cancer cells. Moreover, we found that the NADPH oxidase family protein, Nox4, lay downstream of BLT2 and mediated the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent NF-ÎºB stimulation, thereby inducing AR expression. Taken together, our results demonstrate that BLT2 plays a critical role in AR expression via a Nox4-ROS-NF-ÎºB-linked pathway, thereby mediating the survival of AR-positive prostate cancer cells. Our findings point to BLT2 as a key regulator of AR expression and will contribute to the development of novel therapies for AR-positive prostate cancers, including androgen-responsive and CR prostate cancers.",cell_line_tumor,0.4,8,10781.61,7646.651,7714.665,18302.63,18187.58,18586.66,4516.979
"Autoimmune disease is a disorder of immune system due to the over-reaction of lymphocytes against one's own body tissues. Anti-Nuclear Antibody (ANA) is an autoantibody produced by the immune system directed against the self body tissues or cells, which plays an important role in the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases. Indirect ImmunoFluorescence (IIF) method with HEp-2 cells provides the major screening method to detect ANA for the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases. Fluorescence patterns at present are usually examined laboriously by experienced physicians through manually inspecting the slides with the help of a microscope, which usually suffers from inter-observer variability that limits its reproducibility. Previous researches only provided simple segmentation methods and criterions for cell segmentation and recognition, but a fully automatic framework for the segmentation and recognition of HEp-2 cells had never been reported before. This study proposes a method based on the watershed algorithm to automatically detect the HEp-2 cells with different patterns. The experimental results show that the segmentation performance of the proposed method is satisfactory when evaluated with percent volume overlap (PVO: 89%). The classification performance using a SVM classifier designed based on the features calculated from the segmented cells achieves an average accuracy of 96.90%, which outperforms other methods presented in previous studies. The proposed method can be used to develop a computer-aided system to assist the physicians in the diagnosis of auto-immune diseases.",algorithms,0.2,9,5785.471,4662.367,4673.915,10580.78,8505.096,8967.161,1967.3
The Philadelphia chromosome associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has been linked to a hybrid BCR/ABL protein product that differs from that found in chronic myelogenous leukemia. This implies that the molecular structures of the two chromosomal translocations also differ. Localization of translocation breakpoints in Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL has been impeded due to the only partial characterization of the BCR locus. We have isolated the entire 130-kilobase BCR genomic locus from a human cosmid library. A series of five single-copy genomic probes from the 70-kilobase first intron of BCR were used to localize rearrangements in 8 of 10 Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALLs. We have demonstrated that these breakpoints are all located at the 3' end of the intron around an unusual restriction fragment length polymorphism caused by deletion of a 1-kilobase fragment containing Alu family reiterated sequences. This clustering is unexpected in light of previous theories of rearrangement in Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia that would have predicted a random dispersion of breakpoints in the first intron in Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL. The proximity of the translocation breakpoints to this constitutive deletion may indicate shared mechanisms of rearrangement or that such polymorphisms mark areas of the genome prone to recombination.,molecular_sequence_data,0.2,9,6383.866,4634.63,4766.573,11574.07,9867.882,10371.95,3616.889
"Diabetes is a multi-organ disease and diabetic cardiomyopathy can result in heart failure, which is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. In the liver, insulin resistance contributes to hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia, which further worsens the metabolic profile. Defects in mTOR signalling are believed to contribute to metabolic dysfunctions in diabetic liver and hearts, but evidence is missing that mTOR activation is causal to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. This study shows that specific mTORC1 inhibition by PRAS40 prevents the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. This phenotype was associated with improved metabolic function, blunted hypertrophic growth and preserved cardiac function. In addition PRAS40 treatment improves hepatic insulin sensitivity and reduces systemic hyperglycaemia in obese mice. Thus, unlike rapamycin, mTORC1 inhibition with PRAS40 improves metabolic profile in diabetic mice. These findings may open novel avenues for therapeutic strategies using PRAS40 directed against diabetic-related diseases.",obesity,0,7,12277.39,10302.87,10237.56,20976.52,24122.69,24577.98,4763.607
"Joubert syndrome is characterized by episodic hyperpnea and apnea, developmental delay, hypotonia, truncal ataxia, ophthalmologic abnormalities, and vermian dysgenesis. We studied 15 patients with the diagnosis of Joubert syndrome to (1) more fully define the syndrome's clinical features, and (2) correlate the clinical features with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. Eight of 15 patients had a history of episodic hyperpnea and apnea. All patients had developmental delay and hypotonia. Of the 13 patients receiving detailed neuro-ophthalmologic evaluations, three had optic nerve dysplasia, pendular nystagmus, and gaze-holding nystagmus. All 13 patients had a normal vestibulo-ocular reflex based on head thrust, but had absent to poor ability to cancel the vestibulo-ocular reflex horizontally and vertically. Twelve of 13 patients had impaired smooth pursuit. Twelve of 13 patients had defects in initiation of saccades and quick phases. Two of the most consistent radiologic features were absent or hypoplastic posterior cerebellar vermis, and deformed midbrain and pontomesencephalic junction, which based on ocular motor physiology correlate with the vestibulo-ocular reflex cancellation/ pursuit defect and saccade initiation defect, respectively. As a result of midbrain, vermian, and superior cerebellar peduncle abnormalities, axial neuroimaging showed a unique ""molar tooth"" appearance of these structures.

"External loop 5 (EL5) of serotonin transporter was analyzed by mutating each of the residues from Thr-480 to Ala-511, one at a time, with cysteine. Cysteine was well-tolerated at most positions, although G485C, Y495C, and E508C had low transport activities. Replacement with cysteine rendered mutants G484C-P499C sensitive to partial or complete inactivation by [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate and (2-sulfonatoethyl) methanethiosulfonate. Within this sensitive region, the rates of reaction varied by over 2 orders of magnitude.

"Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is recognized as an important factor involved in the tumor malignancy progression. Our previous study has indicated that the hepatocarcinoma cell line with 75% of LNM (Hca-F)-cell-induced neoplasia and the hepatocarcinoma cell line with 25% of LNM-induced neoplasia are accompanied with high (75%) and low (25%) incidences of LNM. In the current study, 62 and 54 protein spots were observed up-regulated and down-regulated in Hca-F cell relative to the hepatocarcinoma cell line with 25% of LNM by 2-D DIGE. Totally, 113 unique proteins were identified by HPLC-nano ESI-MS/MS analysis. The expression levels of Annexin A7, Ulch3, and ER protein 29 were validated by Western blotting analyses. The abnormally regulated proteins were categorized and annotated by protein analysis through evolutionary relationships analysis with the aid of the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery tool. Seventeen gene candidates concordantly expressed both at mRNA and protein levels. By making a challenge, we detected expression levels of Annexin A7 in primary gastric cancer (GC) and primary GC cancer tissues with LNMs by immunohistochemisty. Higher ratio of positive and strong expressions Annexin A7 in GC might correlate with the tumor progression.

"DNA methylation is important in cancer development and is a promising biomarker for cancer detection. An epigenomic approach used in our previous work showed that LMX-1A is methylation-silenced in cervical cancer. LMX-1A, a LIM-homeobox gene, is known to participate in developmental events; however, there are at present no data on the role of LMX-1A in cancers. In this study, we characterized the function of this transcription factor by examining cell lines, animal models and human cervical neoplastic tissues, and found that over-expression of LMX-1A does not affect cell proliferation or the cell cycle of cervical cancer cell lines but significantly inhibits colony formation and invasion in vitro. Analysis of changes in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, such as CDH1, CDH2, VIMENTIN, SNAIL, SLUG and TWIST, revealed involvement of the EMT in LMX-1A-mediated cancer invasion; this result was validated in a stable transfectant over-expressing LMX-1A with RNA interference. Xenograft studies using immunocompromised mice confirmed the suppressor effects of LMX-1A on tumour formation and distant metastasis in cervical cancer cell lines. LMX-1A immunohistochemical staining of tissue arrays containing the full spectrum of cervical neoplasms, including normal cervix, low-grade cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN), high-grade CIN, locally invasive and distant metastatic cancers, demonstrated the critical role of LMX-1A in invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, we found by analysing TGFbeta-BMP signalling that BMP4 and BMP6 are down-regulated by LMX-1A.

"Lipids form a diverse group of water-insoluble molecules that include triacylglycerides, phosphoglycerides, sterols and sphingolipids. They play several important roles at cellular and organismal levels. Fatty acids are the major building blocks for the synthesis of triacylglycerides, which are mainly used for energy storage. Phosphoglycerides, together with sterols and sphingolipids, represent the major structural components of biological membranes. Lipids can also have important roles in signalling, functioning as second messengers and as hormones. There is increasing evidence that cancer cells show specific alterations in different aspects of lipid metabolism. These alterations can affect the availability of structural lipids for the synthesis of membranes, the synthesis and degradation of lipids that contribute to energy homeostasis and the abundance of lipids with signalling functions. Changes in lipid metabolism can affect numerous cellular processes, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and motility.

These drugs trigger apoptosis through apparently early gene signalling-independent pathways.

Prior analyses have demonstrated that the enhancer contains a 28-bp core region and local adjacent augmentative cis elements. We now show that the core contains a single critical c-Myb binding site. In both transiently cotransfected human cells and stable chromatin-integrated yeast cells, c-Myb strongly transactivated reporter constructs that contained polymerized core sequences. c-Myb protein was strongly evident in T lymphoblasts in which the enhancer was active and was localized within discrete nuclear structures. Fetal murine thymus exhibited a striking concordance of endogenous c-myb expression with that of mouse ADA and human ADA LCR-directed transgene expression. Point mutation of the c-Myb site within the intact 2.3-kb LCR severely attenuated enhancer activity in transfections and LCR activity in transgenic thymocytes.

DNA from wild-type H. pylori strains was resistant to digestion by SphI and NlaIII, which recognize DNA at sites containing CATG, whereas their isogenic hpyIM mutants were susceptible, indicating lack of modification. Overexpression of hpyIM in Escherichia coli rendered DNA from these cells resistant to NlaIII digestion, confirming the role of hpyIM in modifying CATG sites.

Thirty-two of 33 courses of prophylaxis and 74 of 83 courses of empirical therapy were completed with success. Overall survival was 90.8% at 3 months post-EOT.

LAMB had acceptable safety and tolerance and was useful in prevention and treatment in unselected, mostly granulocytopenic paediatric patients undergoing treatment for cancer or HSCT.",neoplasms,0,9,17587.38,18361.78,18747.77,30887.1,37690.91,38074.72,9094.677
"Oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) is the eighth most common cancer type worldwide with a dismal 5-year survival. Barrett oesophagus, the replacement of the normal squamous epithelia with glandular cells, is the first step in the pathway towards OAC. Although most patients with OAC present de novo, the presence of the easily detectable OAC precursor lesion, Barrett oesophagus, enables the possibility of early detection of high-risk patients who are more likely to progress. Currently, identification of high-risk patients depends on histopathological assessment of dysplasia with no regards to molecular pathogenesis. In the future, screening and risk stratification initiatives for Barrett oesophagus that incorporate molecular profiles might permit improved early diagnosis and intervention strategies with the possibility of preventing OAC. For the majority of patients presenting de novo at an advanced stage, combining so-called -omics datasets with current clinical staging algorithms might enable OACs to be better classified according to distinct molecular programmes, thereby leading to better targeted treatment strategies as well as cancer monitoring regimes. This Review discusses how the latest advances in -omics technologies have improved our understanding of the development and biology of OAC, and how this development might alter patient management in the future.",algorithms,0.2,8,7154.108,4979.211,5010.416,13415.85,11165.41,11029.05,3214.676
"Recent clinical studies revealed that positive results of cell transplantation on cardiac function are limited to the short- and mid-term restoration phase following myocardial infarction (MI), emphasizing the need for long-term follow-up. These transient effects may depend on the transplanted cell-type or its differentiation state. We have identified a population of cardiomyocyte progenitor cells (CMPCs) capable of differentiating efficiently into beating cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells in vitro. We investigated whether CMPCs or pre-differentiated CMPC-derived cardiomyocytes (CMPC-CM) are able to restore the injured myocardium after MI in mice.

MI was induced in immunodeficient mice and was followed by intra-myocardial injection of CMPCs, CMPC-CM, or vehicle. Cardiac function was measured longitudinally up to 3 months post-MI using 9.4 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging. The fate of the human cells was determined by immunohistochemistry. Transplantation of CMPCs or CMPC-CM resulted in a higher ejection fraction and reduced the extent of left ventricular remodelling up to 3 months after MI when compared with vehicle-injected animals. CMPCs and CMPC-CM generated new cardiac tissue consisting of human cardiomyocytes and blood vessels. Fusion of human nuclei with murine nuclei was not observed.

CMPCs differentiated into the same cell types in situ as can be obtained in vitro. This excludes the need for in vitro pre-differentiation, making CMPCs a promising source for (autologous) cell-based therapy.",magnetic_resonance_imaging,0.6,7,9103.4,6733.944,6736.535,15221.09,16249.43,16535.25,3973.483
