In order to reduce the motion artifacts in DSA, non-rigid image registration is commonly used before subtracting the mask from the contrast image. Since DSA registration requires a set of spatially non-uniform control points, a conventional MRF model is not very efficient. In this paper, we introduce the concept of pivotal and non-pivotal control points to address this, and propose a non-uniform MRF for DSA registration. We use quad-trees in a novel way to generate the non-uniform grid of control points. Our MRF formulation produces a smooth displacement field and therefore results in better artifact reduction than that of registering the control points independently. We achieve improved computational performance using pivotal control points without compromising on the artifact reduction. We have tested our approach using several clinical data sets, and have presented the results of quantitative analysis, clinical assessment and performance improvement on a GPU.
