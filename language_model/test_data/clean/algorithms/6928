In the experimental studies designed to evaluate the effects of different factors on the biomechanical properties of bone, careful selection of rats and the scientific indices is very important. The aim of this paper is to recommend some essential methods for testing and calculating the biomechanical properties of rat bone such as tension, compression, bending and torsion.
