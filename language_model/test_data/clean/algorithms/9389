The threading behavior of a zinc analogue of a previously reported processive manganese porphyrin catalyst onto a series of polymers of different lengths is reported. It is demonstrated that the speed of the threading process is determined by the opening of the cavity of the toroidal porphyrin host, which can be tuned with the help of axial ligands that coordinate to the metal center in the porphyrin.
