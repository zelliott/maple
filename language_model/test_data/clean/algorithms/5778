Large skull bone defects resulting from craniotomies due to cerebral insults, trauma or tumours create functional and aesthetic disturbances to the patient. The reconstruction of large osseous defects is still challenging. A treatment algorithm is presented based on the close interaction of radiologists, computer engineers and cranio-maxillofacial surgeons. From 2004 until today twelve consecutive patients have been operated on successfully according to this treatment plan. Titanium and polyetheretherketone (PEEK) were used to manufacture the implants. The treatment algorithm is proved to be reliable. No corrections had to be performed either to the skull bone or to the implant. Short operations and hospitalization periods are essential prerequisites for treatment success and justify the high expenses.
