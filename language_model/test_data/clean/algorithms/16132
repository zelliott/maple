Several recently developed computational approaches in comparative genomics go beyond sequence comparison. By analyzing phylogenetic profiles of protein families, domain fusions, gene adjacency in genomes, and expression patterns, these methods predict many functional interactions between proteins and help deduce specific functions for numerous proteins. Although some of the resultant predictions may not be highly specific, these developments herald a new era in genomics in which the benefits of comparative analysis of the rapidly growing collection of complete genomes will become increasingly obvious.
