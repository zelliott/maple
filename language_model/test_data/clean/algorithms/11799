It is always very difficult to process the bioelectrical signals, sampling, amplifying and quantifying because of the different sources it comes from and the mechanism it depends on. This paper mainly introduces a method of measuring the peak value of bioelectrical signals, expatiates on the structure, testing result, analysis for error and measure taken for improvement of the circuit designed by this method. At last, the paper also points out that the method is wonderful, simple, easy to carry out, and can be used in many medical systems.
