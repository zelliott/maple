A new method has been developed for measuring the volume flow rate of blood flowing through large vessels or outflow tracts of the heart. In this article we describe the principle of a method that can reduce the dependence of the Doppler angle of flow measurement by setting the sample points along a line to which every ultrasound beam is perpendicular. To evaluate the accuracy of this method, flow phantom experiments were made for both steady and pulsatile flows. The volume flow rate measured by this method agrees well with that observed by an ultrasound flowmeter (r = 0.99) when the vessel diameter is large (25 mm). However, this method overestimates by 40% when the vessel diameter is small (8 mm). To make this method applicable to small vessels, an improvement in the lateral resolution of Doppler measurement is necessary. It has been concluded that this method can be used to measure the cardiac output or volume flow rates in large vessels.
