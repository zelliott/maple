To evaluate the efficacy and safety of neural vision enhancement technology (NVC, NeuroVision, Inc.) to improve visual acuity and contrast sensitivity function in eyes with low myopia.

Singapore Eye Research Institute, Singapore, Singapore.

This noncomparative interventional case series comprised 20 Asian adults between 19 and 53 years of age with low myopia (cycloplegic spherical equivalence [SE] from -0.5 diopter [D] to -1.5 D in the worst eye; astigmatism not exceeding 0.5 D in either eye; uncorrected visual acuity [UCVA] < or =0.7 logMAR) who had NVC treatment. The main outcome measures were distance UCVA, uncorrected contrast sensitivity, refraction, accommodative amplitude, and safety.

All eyes had improvement in UCVA and contrast sensitivity. After treatment, the mean distance UCVA improved by a mean of 2.1 lines on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study logMAR chart. The mean contrast sensitivity improved over a range of spatial frequencies on sine-wave contrast sensitivity chart testing (1.5 to 18 cycles per degree). Follow-up data up to 12 months posttreatment showed that the gains were retained. Treatment did not alter refraction (mean spherical equivalent) or accommodative amplitudes. No adverse effects were reported.

Preliminary evidence suggests NVC treatment is safe and improves UCVA and uncorrected contrast sensitivity in adult patients with low myopia.
