Due to low costs and common availability, ultrasonography and computed tomography still represent the most common diagnostic tools in uroradiology. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is gaining more and more importance since this imaging modality allows for a comprehensive examination of almost the complete spectrum of urologic diseases, including congenital malformations. The most important advantages of MRI are the free choice of slice orientation, high soft tissue contrast and high resolution as well as the lack of radiation. Technical progresses in hard and software components have led to a reduction in acquisition time, allowing for real-time imaging as well as MR angiography and MR urography with a significant reduction in motion artifacts. In addition, contrast enhanced MRI represents the imaging modality of choice in patients with reduced renal function or known allergy against iodinated contrast agent.
