The aim of the present study was to examine whether amount of oral antimicrobial components, human Î²-defensin-2 (HBD-2), cathelicidin (LL-37), and immunoglobulin A (IgA), might be affected by prolonged strenuous exercise. Ten young male volunteers either exercised on recumbent ergometer at 75% [Formula: see text] for 60 min (exercise session) or sat quietly (resting session). Saliva samples were obtained at 60-min intervals during sessions for measurements of saliva antimicrobial components (HBD-2, LL-37, and IgA), saliva cortisol and osmolality. Saliva flow rate was decreased and saliva osmolality was increased during the 60-min exercise. Saliva HBD-2 and LL-37 concentrations and secretion rates were increased during and after the exercise, whereas saliva IgA concentration and secretion rates were decreased after the exercise. Saliva cortisol was increased during and after the exercise. The areas under the curve of the time courses of saliva levels of HBD-2 and LL-37 were negatively correlated with those of cortisol levels in saliva. The present findings suggested that a single bout of prolonged strenuous exercise caused a transient increase in the oral HBD-2 and LL-37 levels.
