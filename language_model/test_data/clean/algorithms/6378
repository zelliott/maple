In current practice, only one out of three components of the tissue displacement vector and one of nine components of the strain tensor are accurately estimated and imaged in ultrasound elastography. Since, only the axial component of both the displacement and strain are imaged, other important elastic parameters, such as shear strains and the Poisson's ratio, also are not imaged. Moreover, reconstruction of the Young's modulus would be significantly improved if all components of the strain tensor were available. In this paper, we describe a new method for estimating all the components of the tissue displacement vector following a quasi-static compression. The method uses displacements estimated from radiofrequency echo-signals along multiple ultrasound beam insonification directions. At each spatial location in the compressed medium, orthogonal tissue displacements in both the axial and lateral direction with respect to the direction of the applied compression are estimated by curve fitting angular displacement vector data calculated for all insonification directions. Following displacement estimation in orthogonal directions, components of the corresponding normal and shear strain tensors are estimated. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the utility of this technique for the computation of the normal and shear strain tensors.
