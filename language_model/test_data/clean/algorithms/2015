Quantitative analysis of short-axis functional cardiac magnetic resonance images can be performed using automatic contour detection methods. The resulting myocardial contours must be reviewed and possibly corrected, which can be time-consuming, particularly when performed across all cardiac phases. We quantified the impact of manual contour corrections on both analysis time and quantitative measurements obtained from left ventricular short-axis cine images acquired from 1555 participants of the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort using computer-aided contour detection methods. The total analysis time for a single case was 7.6 ± 1.7 min for an average of 221 ± 36 myocardial contours per participant. This included 4.8 ± 1.6 min for manual contour correction of 2% of all automatically detected endocardial contours and 8% of all automatically detected epicardial contours. However, the impact of these corrections on global left ventricular parameters was limited, introducing differences of 0.4 ± 4.1 mL for end-diastolic volume, -0.3 ± 2.9 mL for end-systolic volume, 0.7 ± 3.1 mL for stroke volume, and 0.3 ± 1.8% for ejection fraction. We conclude that left ventricular functional parameters can be obtained under 5 min from short-axis functional cardiac magnetic resonance images using automatic contour detection methods. Manual correction more than doubles analysis time, with minimal impact on left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction.
