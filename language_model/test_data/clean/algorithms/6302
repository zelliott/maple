Nanoparticles of poly(DL-lactic acid) (PDLLA), poly(DL-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(ethylene oxide)-PLGA diblock copolymer (PEO-PLGA) were prepared by the salting-out method. The in vitro degradation of PDLLA, PLGA and PEO-PLGA nanoparticles in PBS (pH 7.4) at 37 degrees C was studied. The particle size, molecular weight of the polymers and the amount of lactic and glycolic acids formed were followed in time. PDLLA nanoparticles gradually degraded over a period of 2 years and retain their size during that period. A faster degradation was observed for PLGA nanoparticles, which was nearly complete after 10 weeks. PLGA nanoparticles retained their size during that period. In PEO-PLGA nanoparticles, the ester bond connecting the PEO and the PLGA segments was preferentially cleaved, which led to a relatively fast decrease in molecular weight and to (partial) aggregation, as multimodal size distributions were observed. PEO-PLGA nanoparticles were almost completely degraded within 8 weeks.
