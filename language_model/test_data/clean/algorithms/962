Osteoarthrosis of the knee joint (KJA) is a most prevalent orthopedic disease. There are some questions as to the policy of treating KJA that remain to be decided. Results are analyzed of treating 3243 patients with KJA (stage I--889 individuals, stage II--1276 ones, stage III--1078 patients) over the period 1983-2000. The patients underwent nonoperative treatment, arthroscopic operations, plasty of the ligamentous apparatus, osteotomy, arthrodesis, total endoprothetics. Our scheme proposed some time ago allowed judgement about the function of the knee joint. Recommendations are given in the article, that include the following: Arthroscopic operations should be widely used during stage I and II for the debridgement of the joint to be done, the proper recovery of the ligamentous apparatus to be ensured. Correcting osteotomy is indicated in axial deformity of the joint at stage I to II. Total andoprothetics is indicated at stage III osteoarthrosis and also at stage II in case of joint instability and axial deformity.
