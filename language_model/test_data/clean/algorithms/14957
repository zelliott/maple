This paper describes morphing techniques to manipulate two-dimensional human face images and three-dimensional models of the human head. Applications of these techniques show how to generate composite faces based on any number of component faces, how to change only local aspects of a face, and how to generate caricatures and anticaricatures of faces. These techniques are potentially useful for many psychological studies because they permit realistic images to be generated with precise control.
