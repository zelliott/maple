The discontinuous patterns in neonatal magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data are quantified with a novel Hilbert phase (HP) based approach. The expert neurologists' scores were used as the gold standard. The performance of this approach was analyzed using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and it was compared with two other approaches, namely spectral ratio (SR) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) that have been proposed for the detection of discontinuous patterns in neonatal EEG. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used as a performance measure. AUCs obtained for SR, HP, and DWT were 0.87, 0.80, and 0.56, respectively. Although the performance of HP was lower than SR, it carries information about the frequency content of the signal that helps to distinguish brain patterns from artifacts such as cardiac residuals. Based on this property, the HP approach was extended to fetal MEG data. Further, using the frequency property of the HP approach, burst duration and interburst interval were computed for the discontinuous patterns detected and they are in agreement with reported values.
