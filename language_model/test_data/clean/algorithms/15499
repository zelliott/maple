Quantitative real-time PCR has proven to be an extremely useful technique in life sciences for many applications. Although a lot of attention has been paid to the optimization of the assay conditions, the analysis of the data acquired is often done with software tools that do not make optimum use of the information provided by the data. Particularly, this is the case for high-throughput analysis, which requires a careful characterization and interpretation of the complete data by suitable software. Here we present a software solution for the robust, reliable, accurate, and fast evaluation of real-time PCR data, called SoFAR. The software automatically evaluates the data acquired with the LightCycler system. It applies new algorithms for an adaptive background correction of signal trends, the calculation of the effective signal noise, the automated identification of the exponential phases, the adaptive smoothing of the raw data, and the correction of melting curve data. Finally, it provides information regarding the validity of the results obtained. The SoFAR software minimizes the time required for evaluation and increases the accuracy and reliability of the results. The software is available upon request.
