The present study analyzed the place of ultrasound in the urological diagnostic protocols. Currently, most of the patients undergo some type of ultrasonographic evaluation at the outset or at some time during follow up. Our experience concerning the results, limitations and errors of this imaging technique are presented.

We reviewed the indications for US in different pathologies and its use together with other diagnostic techniques. Simple, cost-efficient algorithms are described.

Its excellent performance permits making a correct diagnosis in many patients and remarkably simplifies evaluation in others. Its accuracy obviates the need for other explorations in certain pathologies.

Ultrasound must be included in the urological armamentarium and should be considered as an extension of physical examination. Its accuracy and efficacy have been demonstrated. Furthermore, it is simple and easy to use, low-cost, and remarkably simplifies our diagnostic algorithms.
