Ultrasound (US) imaging is an indispensible technique for detection of abdominal stones which are a serious health hazard. Segmentation of stones from abdominal ultrasound images presents a unique challenge because these images contain strong speckle noise and attenuated artifacts. In clinical situations where a large number of stones must be identified, traditional methods such as manual identification become tedious and lack reproducibility too. The necessity of obtaining high reproducibility and the need to increase efficiency motivates the development of automated and fast procedures that segment out stones of all sizes and shapes in medical images by applying image segmentation techniques. In this paper we present and compare two fully automatic and unsupervised methods for robust stone detection in B-mode ultrasound images of the abdomen. Our approaches are based on the marker controlled watershed segmentation, along with some pre-processing and post-processing procedures that eliminate the inherent problems associated with medical ultrasound images. The first algorithm (Algorithm I) utilizes the advantage of the Speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion (SRAD) technique, along with unsharp filtering and histo- gram equalization for removal of speckle noise, and the second algorithm (Algorithm II) is based on the log decompression model which too serves as a tool for minimization of speckle. Experimental results obtained from processing a set of 50 ultrasound images ensure the robustness of both the proposed algorithms. Comparative results of both the algorithms based on efficiency and relative error in stone area have been provided.
