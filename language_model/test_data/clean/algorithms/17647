Patient motion and image distortion induced by eddy currents cause artifacts in maps of diffusion parameters computed from diffusion-weighted (DW) images. A novel and comprehensive approach to correct for spatial misalignment of DW imaging (DWI) volumes acquired with different strengths and orientations of the diffusion sensitizing gradients is presented. This approach uses a mutual information-based registration technique and a spatial transformation model containing parameters that correct for eddy current-induced image distortion and rigid body motion in three dimensions. All parameters are optimized simultaneously for an accurate and fast solution to the registration problem. The images can also be registered to a normalized template with a single interpolation step without additional computational cost. Following registration, the signal amplitude of each DWI volume is corrected to account for size variations of the object produced by the distortion correction, and the b-matrices are properly recalculated to account for any rotation applied during registration. Both qualitative and quantitative results show that this approach produces a significant improvement of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data acquired in the human brain.
