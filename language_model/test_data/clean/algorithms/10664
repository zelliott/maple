In this paper, we propose a tracking technique for a micro guide wire in a sequence of fluorograms. A technique in which the region-growing technique was embedded was developed. It gives the center line of a micro guide wire. A sequence of 1,024 x 1,024 x 16 bit fluorograms (111 frames) with a carotid phantom and head phantom was obtained with a CAS-8000V (Toshiba America Medical Systems, Inc., CA, USA) C-arm angiography system and a Hi-Torque Standard micro guide wire (Advanced Cardiovascular Systems, Inc., CA, USA). To evaluate the technique, we manually traced the guide wire in each sequence frame three times, and a "true" single-width micro guide wire was created from them. The number of pixels on the true guide wire and inside the two-pixel tolerance of the center line was counted in each fluorogram, and the percentage of that count based on the number of all pixels on the true guide wire was calculated as true positive (TP). In addition, the number of pixels on the center line and outside the two-pixel tolerance of the true guide wire was counted in each frame as false positive (FP). The tracking technique has a mean TP of 94.8% and a mean FP of 5.1 pixels/frame. Several frames have low TP and high FP, but the technique could continue to track the micro guide wire until the end of the sequence. We therefore concluded that we had developed an accurate automatic tracking technique for micro guide wires in fluoroscopic sequences.
