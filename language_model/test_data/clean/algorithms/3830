A new method for 3D-surface-reconstruction from coronary ultrasound images is presented using 3D-data of a prototype volume scanner. In addition to conventional morphological and functional diagnosis of the tongue, 3D-surface-reconstruction provides remarkable information on the tongue surface, especially during articulation.
