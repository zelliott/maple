The purpose of this study was to determine how endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) with a histology confirmed biopsy protocol impacted on staging and managing esophageal carcinoma in terms of resectability and neoadjuvant therapy (chemotherapy and radiation therapy).

The records of 40 consecutive patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer referred for EUS staging were reviewed. Computed tomography (CT) scan then EUS imaging and EUS-guided FNA staging, including involvement of celiac node (M1a stage), surgical pathology, and subsequent treatment were correlated. Through-the-scope balloons were used for dilatation when needed to examine the celiac nodes.

All 40 patients followed the protocol and were successfully imaged by EUS. Sixteen of the 40 required esophageal dilatation using the through-the-scope balloon. No complications were observed from esophageal dilatation for EUS. Twenty-three (58%) met the criteria for EUS-guided FNA biopsy from a total of 40 EUS imaging procedures. Twenty (87%) of the 23 EUS-guided FNA were directed toward the celiac nodes; 18 (90%) of the 20 were positive for malignancy and were treated by chemoradiation therapy and 2 (10%) FNA were negative for malignancy and were treated by surgical resection. The CT scan was able to detect only 6 (30%) of 20 cases of suspicious celiac lymph nodes, of which 5 (83%) were positive for malignancy by FNA.

EUS-guided FNA of celiac nodes (20 patients) directed management in all patients biopsied. EUS-guided FNA is superior to CT scan for diagnosing M1a disease. Protocol-directed EUS-guided FNA is a pivotal study when used in conjunction with stage-oriented treatment protocols for esophageal carcinoma.
