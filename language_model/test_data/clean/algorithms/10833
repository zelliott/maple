Priapism has been defined by AFUD as a pathological condition which consists in a penile erection that persists moreover or is not related to sexual stimulation. Priapism pathophysiology has remained unknown until differents groups of clinical investigators began to research about this entity in patients complaining of erectile dysfunction, who where receiving treatment with intracavernosal vasoactive molecules. Priapism can be clasified into ischaemic (venocclusive): the most prevalent type, or Arterial (non-ischaemic). The purpose of this revision is to update the pathophysiology of the two types of priapism and to create an algorithm of therapeutical and diagnostic approach.
