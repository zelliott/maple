Operationalized psychodynamic diagnostics OPD-2 is a diagnostic procedure that has proven to be valuable for psychotherapy. However, to date there has been only little discussion about the application context and any necessary adaptations to various clinical fields.

The working group "Implementation of OPD in Clinical Practice" proposes an algorithm for the sequential and adapted use of OPD depending on the clinical context.

Especially for patients who are primarily not open to receiving psychotherapy, e.g., in psychiatric hospitals or general hospitals, OPD can be an important basis for structuring motivating interventions. A stepwise procedure is proposed which is adapted to the usage of OPD in such contexts. Furthermore, also for these contexts, simplified ratings are proposed and discussed for the axes relationships, conflicts and structure. However, complete OPD remains recommended when determining the focus of a psychotherapeutic treatment.
