For spectral-spatial EPR imaging, prior knowledge about the spatial support of an imaged object can be exploited in two ways. We can shrink the spatial field of view (FOV) to closely wrap the object in a sphere or reduce the sweep width in a projection dependent fashion. Use of a smaller spatial FOV with the same number of samples enhances spatial resolution by reducing voxel volume at the expense of signal-to-noise and a consequent degraded line-width resolution. We have developed another approach to define sweep width that prunes away the portions of the projection sweep with no signal. This reduces data acquisition time for the continuous wave (CW) EPR image proportional to the sweep width reduction. This method also avoids voxel volume reduction. Using the reduced-sweep method, we decreased the data acquisition time by 20% maintaining spatial and linewidth resolution.
