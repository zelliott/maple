Pharmacists may be effective health care practitioners to deliver smoking cessation interventions. This paper examines the short-term outcomes of smokers randomized to one of two models of a pharmacist-led smoking cessation intervention.

An open-label pragmatic randomized trial compared two models of a pharmacist-led behavioral intervention [Group A (3-sessions) vs. Group B (1-session)] in conjunction with 5 weeks of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Ninety-eight pharmacies in Ontario, Canada delivered the intervention. Baseline demographic and smoking behavior data were recorded, as were intervention characteristics. Self-reported, 7-day point prevalence quit rates were obtained 5-week postintervention start date.

6,987 individuals participated; 51.4% (n = 3588) randomized to Group A; 48.6% (n = 3399) to Group B. Approximately, 50% of Group A participants completed all three sessions. Quit rates were significantly higher among Group A, 3-session completers (27.7%; n = 478) compared to Group B participants (18.0%; n = 604). Multivariable results suggest that even when controlling for possible confounders and clustering across pharmacies, Group A participants who completed all three sessions were more likely to quit compared to Group B [OR = 1.72 (95% CI: 1.53, 1.94)].

Cessation outcomes are higher among participants completing three intervention sessions compared to one session; however, many do not return for follow-up sessions.
