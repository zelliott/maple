The interaction of light with multiple red blood cells was systematically investigated by the finite-difference time-domain method (FDTD). The simulations showed that the lateral multiple scattering between red blood cells is very weak and that the polarization has an almost insignificant influence on the distribution of the scattered light. The numerical results of the FDTD method were compared with the results from the Rytov approximation and the discrete dipole approximation (DDA). The agreement with the DDA was excellent.
