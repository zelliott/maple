The aim of assessing the emergency patient's threshold of consciousness is to diagnose and manage reversible and treatable conditions fast and effectively. Diagnosis and treatment procedures can be summarized on three levels. First assessment and treatment of hypoxia and shock, second: differentiation of types of coma, in order to decide further treatment measures and the choice of hospital admittance, and third: initiation of antidotes and other appropriate preclinical therapies.
