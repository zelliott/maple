Diabetic cardiomyopathy is the leading cause of mortality in type 1 diabetes. Thus study of cardiomyocyte morphology and function during early stages of diabetes using modern analytical methods is of critical importance. Therefore, using confocal microscopy, we determined metric parameters, volumes and contractility, with calcium transients in isolated left-ventricular myocytes at one week after induction of diabetes in rats. Myocyte volume analysis from 3D confocal scans was performed using an automated contour detection algorithm that took the actual shape of the myocytes into account. We showed a significant reduction in myocyte volume in diabetic animals. We also showed a significant reduction in length and width but not in thickness of the myocytes, which suggests disproportional reorganization of the structure of the heart tissue during short-term diabetes. From a functional point of view, we observed a significant decrease in cell shortening at a stimulation frequency of 0.5 Hz. This was accompanied by a decrease in calcium transient amplitude. Together, these data suggest that impaired calcium handling is one of the factors that contributes to the observed decrease in myocyte shortening during early stages of streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats.
