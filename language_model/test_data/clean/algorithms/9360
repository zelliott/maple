A hyperspectral imaging system in line scanning mode was used for measuring the absorption and scattering properties of turbid food materials over the visible and near-infrared region of 530-900 nm. An instrumental calibration procedure was developed to compensate for the nonuniform instrument response of the imaging system. A nonlinear curve-fitting algorithm for a steady-state diffusion theory model was proposed to determine absorption (mua) and reduced scattering coefficients (mu's) from the spatially resolved hyperspectral reflectance profiles. The hyperspectral imaging system provided good measurement of mua and mu's for the simulation samples made of Intralipid scattering material and three absorbers (blue dye, green dye, and black ink) with average fitting errors of 16% and 11%, respectively. The optical properties of the fruit and vegetable juices and milks were determined. Values of the absorption and reduced scattering coefficient at 600 nm were highly correlated to the fat content of the milk samples with the correlation coefficient of 0.995 and 0.998, respectively. Compared to time-resolved and frequency-domain techniques, the hyperspectral imaging technique provides a faster and simpler means for measuring the optical properties of turbid food and agricultural products.
