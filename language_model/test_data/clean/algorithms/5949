The drift behavior of spiral waves under the influence of a polarized electric field is investigated in the light that both the polarized electric field and the spiral waves possess rotation symmetry. Numerical simulations of a reaction-diffusion model show that the drift velocity of the spiral tip can be controlled by changing the polarization mode of the polarized electric field and some interesting drift phenomena are observed. When the electric field is circularly polarized and its rotation follows that of the spiral, the drift speed of the spiral tip reaches its maximal value. On the contrary, opposite rotation between the spiral and electric field locks the drift of the spiral tip. Analytical results based on the weak deformation approximation are consistent with the numerical results. We hope that our theoretical results will be observed in experiments, such as the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction.
