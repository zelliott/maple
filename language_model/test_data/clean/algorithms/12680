We report an extension of the smoothed profile method (SPM) (Y. Nakayama, K. Kim, and R. Yamamoto, Eur. Phys. J. E 26, 361 (2008)), a direct numerical simulation method for calculating the complex modulus of the dispersion of particles, in which we introduce a temporally oscillatory external force into the system. The validity of the method was examined by evaluating the storage G'(ω) and loss G"(ω) moduli of a system composed of identical spherical particles dispersed in an incompressible Newtonian host fluid at volume fractions of Φ = 0 , 0.41, 0.46, and 0.51. The moduli were evaluated at several frequencies of shear flow; the shear flow used here has a zigzag profile, as is consistent with the usual periodic boundary conditions. The simulation results were compared with several experiments for colloidal dispersions of spherical particles.
