For the neophyte, the Z-plasty maneuver can be a surgical procedure veiled in intrigue. The theoretical mechanics of Z-plasty geometry are described, establishing that the new length of the central limb in a 60-degree Z-plasty is square root(3) of its original length. Factors such as skin tension, flap thickness, and flap location can, in application, distort the desired outcome. An algorithm is established that describes the indications and simplifies the execution of this technique.
