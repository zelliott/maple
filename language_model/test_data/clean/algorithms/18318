First SPECT results using a multiplicative iterative reconstruction algorithm are presented. The superiority of the iterative technique over filtered backprojection is demonstrated in two thyroid SPECT studies. Obvious benefits of the new reconstruction technique are better defined outlines of the imaged organ and patient body as well as negligible artificial image amplitudes outside the patient.
