The paper describes microwave power absorption in a typical human being, modeled as a multilayered dielectric cylinder. Average specific absorption rate (SAR) was calculated for E- and H- polarized incident wave for different conditions of the object. Comparison with an existing method is treated, and correction of an erroneous result therein is reported.
