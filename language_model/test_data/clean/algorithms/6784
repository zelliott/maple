The aim was to compare, in terms of cost-effectiveness, two diagnostic strategies for finding out the primary site of tumors revealed by metastasis, adopting the hospital's perspective. The observed strategy reflected the usual practices of doctors at the Regional Cancer Center in Toulouse (France), and was based on a sample of 202 patients of this Center. The standardized strategy, which reflected limited diagnostic investigation, was simulated using the same sample of patients to whom we applied the recommendations of local experts. In the low assumption regarding the effectiveness of the standardized strategy, the observed strategy compared to the standardized one raised the life expectancy from 407 to 418 days at an incremental cost of $US 1,236 per patient (1996 values). In this case, one day of additional life induced a cost of $US 112 per patient. In the high assumption, the incremental effectiveness was null and the incremental cost was $US 1,236 per patient. In conclusion, the effectiveness of the observed strategy as compared to the standardized strategy was highly questionable, given that the patients' quality of life was not taken into account.
