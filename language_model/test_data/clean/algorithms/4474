A simple interface is proposed for combined quantum mechanical (QM) molecular mechanical (MM) calculations for the systems where the QM and MM regions are connected through covalent bonds. Within this model, the atom that connects the two regions, called YinYang atom here, serves as an ordinary MM atom to other MM atoms and as a hydrogen-like atom to other QM atoms. Only one new empirical parameter is introduced to adjust the length of the connecting bond and is calibrated with the molecule propanol. This model is tested with the computation of equilibrium geometries and protonation energies for dozens of molecules. Special attention is paid on the influence of MM point charges on optimized geometry and protonation energy, and it is found that it is important to maintain local charge-neutrality in the MM region in order for the accurate calculation of the protonation and deprotonation energies. Overall the simple YinYang atom model yields comparable results to some other QM/MM models.
