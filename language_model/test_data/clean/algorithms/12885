Parallel two-step phase-shifting digital holography is a technique for single-shot implementation of phase-shifting interferometry and requires only the intensity distribution of the reference wave and spatial two phase-shifted holograms. We constructed a system of parallel two-step phase-shifting digital holography and experimentally demonstrated the technique, for the first time. The system uses an originally fabricated image sensor having an array of 2 Ã— 1 micro polarizers. Each micro polarizer was attached on pixel by pixel. In the experiment, the unwanted images, the zero-order diffraction wave and the conjugate image, are removed from the reconstructed image of objects by the system, while the images superimpose on the image of objects reconstructed by Fresnel transform alone. Also the capability of single-shot and three-dimensional imaging is demonstrated by the system.
