The objective of this study was to conduct an intrasubject longitudinal study quantifying the evolution of two- and three-dimensional geometrical scoliotic descriptors. The evolution of regional and local scoliotic descriptors was analyzed between two scoliotic visits on a cohort of 28 adolescents with progressive idiopathic scoliosis. Mean age at the first visit was 12.7 +/- 1.7 years old and averaged time interval between two assessments reached 22.8 +/- 10.8 months. Scoliotic descriptors were obtained from three-dimensionally reconstructed spines. The initial thoracic Cobb angle was on average 35.3 degrees +/- 8.4 degrees (range, 14 degrees-54 degrees). The evolution of spinal curvatures and vertebral deformities was assessed statistically in terms of descriptor absolute variations, and of descriptor variations normalized with respect to time and to the increase in Cobb angle. At the thoracic level, vertebral wedging increased with curve severity in a relatively consistent pattern for most scoliotic patients and axial rotation mainly increased towards curve convexity with scoliosis severity. No consistent evolution was associated with the angular orientation of the maximum wedging. Thoracic kyphosis changes (increase and decrease) were observed in important proportions. Results of this study challenge the existence of a typical scoliotic evolution pattern and suggest that the scoliotic evolution is quite variable and patient-specific.
