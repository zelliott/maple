We demonstrate that heteronuclear decoupling using a Phase-Inverted Supercycled Sequence for Attenuation of Rotary ResOnance (PISSARRO) is very efficient at high spinning frequencies (nu(rot)=60kHz) and high magnetic fields (900MHz for protons at 21T) even with moderate radio-frequency decoupling amplitudes (nu(1)(I)=15kHz), despite the wide range of isotropic chemical shifts of the protons and the increased effect of their chemical shift anisotropy.
