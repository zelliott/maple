We present a bifurcation analysis of a normal form for traveling waves in one-dimensional excitable media. The normal form that has been recently proposed on phenomenological grounds is given in the form of a differential delay equation. The normal form exhibits a symmetry-preserving Hopf bifurcation that may coalesce with a saddle node in a Bogdanov-Takens point, and a symmetry-breaking spatially inhomogeneous pitchfork bifurcation. We study here the Hopf bifurcation for the propagation of a single pulse in a ring by means of a center manifold reduction, and for a wave train by means of a multiscale analysis leading to a real Ginzburg-Landau equation as the corresponding amplitude equation. Both the center manifold reduction and the multiscale analysis show that the Hopf bifurcation is always subcritical independent of the parameters. This may have links to cardiac alternans, which have so far been believed to be stable oscillations emanating from a supercritical bifurcation. We discuss the implications for cardiac alternans and revisit the instability in some excitable media where the oscillations had been believed to be stable. In particular, we show that our condition for the onset of the Hopf bifurcation coincides with the well known restitution condition for cardiac alternans.
