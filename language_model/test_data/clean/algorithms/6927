Based on a 3-D emulational body torso model, the influence of changes of heart position caused by deep inspiration etc. on body surface potential maps(BSPMs) was studied in forward electrocardiography. In this report, BSPMs and ECGs during QRS were provided while the heart was in the normal position, or rotated clockwise to the vertical or counterclockwise to the transverse.
