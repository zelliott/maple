Most of clinical ultrasound imaging systems use a pre-determined sound speed, mostly 1540 m/s, in transmit- and receive-beamforming while actual sound speed varies depending on tissue composition and temperature. Sound speed errors, particularly in receive-beamforming, lead to resolution degradation and sensitivity loss in ultrasound imaging. In this paper, we propose a sound speed estimation method in which an optimal sound speed, the speed that makes the echo signal delays at the transducer elements be best matched to the theoretical delays, is estimated by maximizing the beamformed echo signal amplitude with respect to the sound speed and the reflector displacement from the central axis of the ultrasound beam. Since the sound speed can be estimated from the echo signals on several scan lines, the proposed method does not require excessive computation. Experimental imaging studies of phantoms and porcine tissue with a 6 MHz 128-element linear probe and a 3 MHz 128-element convex probe have shown that spatial resolution, particularly in the lateral direction, can be improved by the proposed method.
