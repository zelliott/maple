We propose a reaction model for the palytoxin-sodium-potassium (PTX-Na(+)/K(+)) pump complex. The model, which is similar to the Albers-Post model for Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, is used to elucidate the effect of PTX on Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase during the enzyme interactions with Na(+) and/or K(+) ions. Conformational substates and reactions for the pump are incorporated into the Albers-Post model to represent enzymes with or without bound PTX. A mathematical model based on the reaction scheme is used in simulations modeling experimental studies of PTX-induced ionic currents. Our simulations suggest that (i) extracellular Na(+) as well as K(+) promotes PTX-induced channel blockage; (ii) extracellular K(+) accelerates PTX unbinding; and (iii) K(+) occlusion in the PTX-pump complex is essential for describing the PTX-induced current dynamics.
