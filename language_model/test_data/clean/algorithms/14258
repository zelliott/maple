The basic purpose of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is the reconstruction of conductivity distributions. While multifrequency measurements are of common use, the majority of reconstructed images are still conductivity distributions from one single frequency. More interesting than conductivities at each frequency are electrical tissue parameters, which describe the frequency-dependent conductivity changes of tissue. These parameters give information about physiological or electrical properties of tissues. By using this spectral information, a classification of different tissue types is possible. To get a distribution of tissue parameters, usually a posterior fitting of a tissue model to the conductivity spectra obtained with classical reconstruction algorithms at various frequencies is used. In this work, a single-step reconstruction algorithm for differential imaging was developed for the direct estimation of Cole parameters. This method is termed differential parametric reconstruction. The Cole model was used as the underlying tissue model, where only the relative changes of the two conductivity parameters sigma(0) and sigma(infinity) were reconstructed and the other two parameters of the model which are less identifiable were set to constant values. The reconstruction algorithm was tested with simulated noisy datasets and real measurement data from EIT measurements on the human thorax. These measurements were taken from healthy subjects and from patients with a serious lung injury. The new method yields a good image quality and higher robustness against noise compared to conventional reconstruction methods.
