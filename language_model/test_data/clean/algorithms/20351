We have previously shown activation of alpha1-adrenergic receptors increases Na+-K+ pump current (Ip) in guinea pig ventricular myocytes, and the increase is eliminated by blockers of phosphokinase C (PKC). In this study we examined the effect of activators of PKC on Ip. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a PKC activator, increased IP at each test potential without shifting its voltage dependence. The concentration required for a half-maximal response (K0.5) was 6 microM at 15 nM cytosolic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) and 13 nM at 314 nM [Ca2+]i. The maximal increase at either [Ca2+]i was about 30%. Another activator of PKC, 1, 2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (diC8), increased Ip similarly. The effect of PMA on IP was eliminated by the PKC inhibitor staurosporine, but not by the peptide PKI, an inhibitor of protein kinase A (PKA). PMA and alpha1-adrenergic agonist effects both were sensitive to [Ca2+]i, blocked by PKC inhibitors, unaffected by PKA inhibition, and increased Ip uniformly at all voltages. However, they differed in that alpha1-activation caused a maximum increase of 15% vs 30% via PMA, and alpha1-effects were less sensitive to [Ca2+]i than PMA effects. These results demonstrate that activation of PKC causes an increase in Ip in guinea pig ventricular myocytes. Moreover, they suggest that the coupling of alpha1-adrenergic activation to Ip is entirely through PKC, however alpha1-activation may be coupled to a specific population of PKC whereas PMA is a more global agonist.
