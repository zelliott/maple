An improved method for the high-speed assay for logD (HSLogD) employing an injection marker is described. The critical process of HSLogD is automated sampling of the water phase, which prevents contamination from the octanol phase. However, deployment of HSLogD sometimes produces incorrect and inaccurate values compared with data from closely related methods due to low solubility of compounds or instrument problems. Therefore, careful manual inspection of data is needed to confirm the results obtained by this method. To solve this problem, compounds were screened for suitability as injection markers and 2-(4-methoxyphenoxy)-4,8-dimethylquinoline was the most suitable compound examined. Introduction of the injection marker into the process successfully eliminated the need for the tedious and time-consuming manual inspection process.
