HSR-903 [(S)-(-)-5-amino-7-(7-amino-5-azaspiro[2. 4]hept-5-yl)-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1, 4-dihydro-8-methyl-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid methanesulfonate] is a newly synthesized quinolone with a potent antibacterial activity and a low toxicity. The lung concentration of unchanged HSR-903 was about nine times higher than that in plasma after oral administration (5 mg/kg) in rats. In comparative studies, HSR-903 was accumulated more efficiently than levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin in rat lung. To clarify the mechanism of the specific distribution of HSR-903 into the lung, the uptake of [14C]HSR-903 was studied using isolated rat lung cells and an isolated rat lung perfusion technique. Initial uptake of HSR-903 by isolated lung cells was temperature dependent, saturable, stereospecific, and Na+ and Cl- dependent. The Hill coefficients (1. 90 for Na+ and 1.13 for Cl-) suggest that two Na+ and one Cl- are associated with the transport of one HSR-903 molecule. The uptake of HSR-903 was inhibited by other quinolone antibacterial agents, grepafloxacin, and sparfloxacin. The extraction ratio of HSR-903 in isolated lung perfusion was temperature dependent and saturable. These findings suggest that HSR-903 is taken up by the lung cells via a carrier-mediated transport mechanism, resulting in a concentrative distribution into the lung.
