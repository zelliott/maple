The visualization of white matter tracts using tractography has previously been achieved by displaying streamlines that pass between regions of interest (ROIs). These techniques require a significant amount of user interaction, and their results are entirely dependent on the positioning of the ROIs. Furthermore, in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage secondary to intracranial vascular malformation, there is often significant cerebral edema and susceptibility artifact from the hematoma, which degrade the reliability of tractography. In this paper, the authors' objectives were to visualize the motor pathways of patients with hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic vascular malformations by using a novel semiautomated technique that functions without the need for multiple ROIs.

The authors investigated the tractography appearance of the descending motor pathways in 6 patients with intracranial vascular malformations. Of these patients 4 presented with a spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage, 2 of whom were clinically hemiparetic. Diffusion tensor imaging was performed using a 1.5-T clinical MR imaging system, and whole-brain tractography was performed after reconstruction of the data. A fractional anisotropy threshold of 0.05 was used to terminate the tractography. The semiautomatic motor pathway segmentation technique required definition of a single voxel within the corticospinal tract of the medulla from which the descending motor pathways were automatically defined by grouping together all streamlines within the entire image with a geometry similar to that of the single streamline generated from this initial voxel. The results of this segmentation were then visually assessed and compared with the patient's motor function.

The authors' semiautomatic algorithm consistently visualized the location of the descending motor pathways in patients with nonhemorrhagic and hemorrhagic vascular malformations. In 1 patient whose complete right hemiplegia (complete paralysis) was caused by a large left frontal hematoma that bisected the descending motor pathways, the authors were unable to reconstruct the motor pathways due to severe tract degeneration. However, in all cases in which motor function was intact or only mildly impaired, the technique clearly delineated the motor pathways, even in the presence of large anatomical displacement by the vascular abnormality or associated hemorrhage.

Semiautomatic tractography allows consistent and rapid demonstration of the descending motor pathways in patients with hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic intracranial vascular malformations. The technique allows the use of a comparatively low fractional anisotropy threshold and does not require the definition of multiple ROIs. These techniques may help to improve the clinical feasibility and potentially the reliability of tractography for the evaluation of patients with intracranial vascular malformations as well as other space-occupying lesions of the brain.
