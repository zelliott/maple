An efficient Q-switched dual-wavelength laser with self-frequency Raman conversion in composite Nd:YVO(4) and intracavity sum-frequency generation in BBO is reported. With an input pump power of 17.5 W, average power of 0.53 W at the first-Stokes 1176 nm and average power of 1.67 W at the sum-frequency mixed 559 nm are simultaneously generated at a pulse repetition rate of 100 kHz, corresponding to a total conversion efficiency of 12.5%.
