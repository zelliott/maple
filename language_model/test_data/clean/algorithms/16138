We introduce the general form of the continuous chirality measure (CCM), which is a quantitative estimation of the degree of chirality for a given object. The generalization makes it possible to calculate the chirality content of any mathematical description of a system by vectors, matrices, operators and functions. Another advantage of the new methodology is the ability to provide analytical expressions for the chirality measures. We apply it for specific cases, including vectors and molecules (amino acids), rotation matrices (metamaterials design), rotational potential operators (representing, for example, parity violation), and functions (the electronic structure of annulenes).
