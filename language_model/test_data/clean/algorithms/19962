This paper proposes an adaptive second order sliding mode (SOSM) controller with a nonlinear sliding surface. The nonlinear sliding surface consists of a gain matrix having a variable damping ratio. Initially the sliding surface uses a low value of damping ratio to get a quick system response. As the closed loop system approaches the desired reference, the value of the damping ratio gets increased with an aim to reducing the overshoot and the settling time. The time derivative of the control signal is used to design the controller. The actual control input obtained by integrating the derivative control signal is smooth and chattering free. The adaptive tuning law used by the proposed controller eliminates the need of prior knowledge about the upper bound of system uncertainties. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.
