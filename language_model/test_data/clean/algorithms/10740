Permeability is an underlying parameter to control drug absorption. For highly water-soluble drugs, the high correlation between their permeability and fraction absorbed in humans is reported. In the present study, to predict the absorbability of poorly water-soluble drugs in humans, a new experimental method of the permeation study was proposed and subjected to examination. Firstly, using the in vitro chamber method modified to contain 5% (final concentration) dimethyl sulufoxide (DMSO) in both compartments of the chamber (DMSO-MS), the effect of DMSO on membrane integrity was evaluated. Secondly, the correlation between the apparent permeability coefficients (Papp) obtained through DMSO-M or DMSO-MS and fractions absorbed in humans were investigated using 7 poorly water-soluble drugs. Membrane integrity of the rat intestinal tissues was maintained after using DMSO-MS, as with that after using the conventional in vitro chamber method. Papp of two paracellular markers obtained through DMSO-MS was not different from that obtained through the conventional chamber method. In the permeation study of the P-glycoprotein substrate, Papp from both mucosal to serosal and serosal to mucosal sides obtained through DMSO-MS was not significantly different from that obtained through the conventional chamber method. The correlation between Papp obtained through DMSO-MS and Fa which was expressed by the equation of Fa=1-exp (-Pappx1.38x10(5)) (r2=0.980), was more favorable than the correlation between Papp obtained through DMSO-M and Fa which was expressed by the equation of Fa=1-exp (-Pappx2.12x10(5)) (r2=0.875). These results showed that DMSO-MS was a useful method for predicting the absorbability of poorly water-soluble drugs.
