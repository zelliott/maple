Minimally invasive surgery has influenced the treatment of achalasia more than that of any other gastrointestinal disorder. Laparoscopic Heller myotomy has thus evolved to the first-line therapy in patients with achalasia and led to a significant change in the treatment algorithm of this disorder. The aim of this article is to present technical aspects and pitfalls of Heller myotomy with combined antirefluxplasty. After injection of 0.9% NaCl into the muscularis and submucosa of the distal esophagus and proximal fundus, whereby the submucosal layer can be easily separated from the mucosa, myotomy of the longitudinal and circular musculature is performed up to 6-7 cm proximally to the esophagogastric junction and completed distally by 1.5-2 cm onto the fundus. We prefer the 180 degrees anterior semifundoplication according to Dor as antirefluxplasty, which is sutured in a two-rowed manner into the two sites of the myotomy. The pitfalls are incomplete myotomy, especially at its distal, fundic site, with consecutive persistence or recurrence of symptoms, as well as occult mucosal perforations, which can be detected by intraoperative endoscopy.
