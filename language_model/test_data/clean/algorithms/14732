For data center cooling and intelligent substation systems, real time cabinet environmental monitoring is a strong requirement. Monitoring data, such as temperature, humidity, and noise, is important for operators to manage the facilities in cabinets. We here propose a sensing network, called CENet, which is energy efficient and reliable for cabinet environmental monitoring. CENet achieves above 93% reliable data yield and sends fewer beacons compared to periodic beaconing. It does so through a data-aided routing protocol. In addition, based on B-MAC, we propose a scheduling scheme to increase the lifetime of the network by reducing unnecessary message snooping and channel listening, thus it is more energy efficient than B-MAC. The performance of CENet is evaluated by simulations and experiments.
