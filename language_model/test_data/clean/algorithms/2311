The estimation of the glandular secretory rate from time-series of hormone concentration in plasma can be formulated as a deconvolution problem. In particular, the paper addresses the analysis of frequently sampled data collected in order to study spontaneous pulsatile secretion. Standard deconvolution methods do not allow for the non-negativity constraint and the presence of high-frequency components in the secretory rate. In order to overcome the intrinsic ill-conditioning of the problem, the maximum entropy method is used to obtain a probabilistic representation of the prior knowledge concerning the unknown secretory signal, thus leading to a White Exponential Noise (WEN) model. The deconvolution problem is then posed within a Bayesian framework and solved by means of Maximum-A-Posteriori estimation. The program that implements the algorithm handles non-negativity constraints, provides confidence intervals, and is computationally and memory efficient.
