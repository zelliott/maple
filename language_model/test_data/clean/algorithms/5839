The increasing cost of drug development is partially due to our failure to identify undesirable compounds at an early enough stage of development. The application of higher throughput screening methods have resulted in the generation of very large datasets from cells in vitro or from in vivo experiments following the treatment with drugs or known toxins. In recent years the development of systems biology, databases and pathway software has enabled the analysis of the high-throughput data in the context of the whole cell. One of the latest technology paradigms to be applied alongside the existing in vitro and computational models for absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicology (ADME/Tox) involves the integration of complex multidimensional datasets, termed toxicogenomics. The goal is to provide a more complete understanding of the effects a molecule might have on the entire biological system. However, due to the sheer complexity of this data it may be necessary to apply one or more different types of computational approaches that have as yet not been fully utilized in this field. The present review describes the data generated currently and introduces computational approaches as a component of ADME/Tox. These methods include network algorithms and manually curated databases of interactions that have been separately classified under systems biology methods. The integration of these disparate tools will result in systems-ADME/Tox and it is important to understand exactly what data resources and technologies are available and applicable. Examples of networks derived with important drug transporters and drug metabolizing enzymes are provided to demonstrate the network technologies.
