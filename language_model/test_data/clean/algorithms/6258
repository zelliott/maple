We sought to quantify the left ventricle systolic dysfunction by a geometric index from two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography by implementing an automated fuzzy logic edge detection algorithm for the segmentation.

The coronary injuries have repercussions on the left ventricle producing changes on wall contractility, the shape of the cavity, and as a whole changes on the ventricular function.

2D echocardiogram and M-mode recordings were performed over the control group and those with the dysfunctions. From 2D recordings, individual frames were extracted for at least five cardiac cycles and then segmentation of left ventricle was done by automated fuzzy systems. In each frame, the volumes are measured and a geometric index, eccentricity ratio (ER), was derived. The endocardial fractional shortening (FS), midwall fractional shortening (mFS), and the relative wall thickness (RWT) were also measured in each case.

Depressed value of endocardial FS (20.39 +/- 5.43 vs 34.28 +/- 9.36, P = 0.0046), mFS (33 +/- 8.3 vs 52.5 +/- 11.7, P = 0.0047), and the RWT (0.337 +/- 0.096 vs 0.525 +/- 0.119, P = 0.0002) was observed with dysfunction. ER measured at end-diastole (2.86 +/- 0.703 vs 4.14 +/- 0.38) and end-systole (3.14 +/- 0.79 vs 5.48 +/- 0.74) was found to be decreased in the dysfunction group and more significant at the end-systole (P = 0.00017 vs 6.6E-06).

This work concludes that the regional and global left ventricle systolic dysfunction can be assessed by the ER measured at end-diastole and end-systole from 2D echocardiogram and may contribute to the high rate of cardiovascular disorders.
