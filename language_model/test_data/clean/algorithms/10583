We report the intriguing dynamics of a potassium ion interacting with a 16 A carbon nanotube. The ion induces a strong dielectric response in the nanotube wall that can be described through a self-consistent tight-binding method. The polarization of the nanotube was found to play a critical role in the ion-nanotube interaction, which exhibits a low access barrier of only 1.05 kcal/mol and a deep, attractive well with a depth of about 30 kcal/mol. An ion bound in the nanotube is predicted to oscillate at a frequency of about 0.4 terahertz, dragging the electrons of the nanotube along. Besides its appealing nature in low-dimensional physics, such a nano-oscillator may serve as a room temperature terahertz wave detector.
