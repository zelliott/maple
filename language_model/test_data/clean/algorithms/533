Recently a revision of the cell theory has been proposed, which has several implications both for physiology and pathology. This revision is founded on adapting the old Julius von Sach's proposal (1892) of the Energide as the fundamental universal unit of eukaryotic life. This view maintains that, in most instances, the living unit is the symbiotic assemblage of the cell periphery complex organized around the plasma membrane, some peripheral semi-autonomous cytosol organelles (as mitochondria and plastids, which may be or not be present), and of the Energide (formed by the nucleus, microtubules, and other satellite structures). A fundamental aspect is the proposal that the Energide plays a pivotal and organizing role of the entire symbiotic assemblage (see Appendix 1). The present paper discusses how the Energide paradigm implies a revision of the concept of the internal milieu. As a matter of fact, the Energide interacts with the cytoplasm that, in turn, interacts with the interstitial fluid, and hence with the medium that has been, classically, known as the internal milieu. Some implications of this aspect have been also presented with the help of a computational model in a mathematical Appendix 2 to the paper. Finally, relevances of the Energide concept for the information handling in the central nervous system are discussed especially in relation to the inter-Energide exchange of information.
