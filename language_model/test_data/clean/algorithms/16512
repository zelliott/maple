Multidimensional radiofrequency (RF) pulses are of current interest because of their promise for improving high-field imaging and for optimizing parallel transmission methods. One major drawback is that the computation time of numerically designed multidimensional RF pulses increases rapidly with their resolution and number of transmitters. This is critical because the construction of multidimensional RF pulses often needs to be in real time. The use of graphics processing units for computations is a recent approach for accelerating image reconstruction applications. We propose the use of graphics processing units for the design of multidimensional RF pulses including the utilization of parallel transmitters. Using a desktop computer with four NVIDIA Tesla C1060 computing processors, we found acceleration factors on the order of 20 for standard eight-transmitter two-dimensional spiral RF pulses with a 64 × 64 excitation resolution and a 10-μsec dwell time. We also show that even greater acceleration factors can be achieved for more complex RF pulses.
