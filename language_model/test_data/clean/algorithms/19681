This paper outlines an optimization relaxation approach based on the analog Hopfield neural network (HNN) for solving the image change detection problem between two images. A difference image is obtained by subtracting pixel by pixel both images. The network topology is built so that each pixel in the difference image is a node in the network. Each node is characterized by its state, which determines if a pixel has changed. An energy function is derived, so that the network converges to stable states. The analog Hopfield's model allows each node to take on analog state values. Unlike most widely used approaches, where binary labels (changed/unchanged) are assigned to each pixel, the analog property provides the strength of the change. The main contribution of this paper is reflected in the customization of the analog Hopfield neural network to derive an automatic image change detection approach. When a pixel is being processed, some existing image change detection procedures consider only interpixel relations on its neighborhood. The main drawback of such approaches is the labeling of this pixel as changed or unchanged according to the information supplied by its neighbors, where its own information is ignored. The Hopfield model overcomes this drawback and for each pixel allows a tradeoff between the influence of its neighborhood and its own criterion. This is mapped under the energy function to be minimized. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated by comparative analysis against some existing image change detection methods.
