The purpose of this article is to answer key implementation questions from our translation research with a primary care-based, nurse-community health worker (CHW) team intervention to support type 2 diabetes self-management.

Descriptive data are given on intervention delivery, CHW visit content, patient safety, and intervention costs, along with statistical analyses to examine participant characteristics of higher attendance at visits.

In the intervention sample (n = 104), 74% (SD = 16%) of planned intervention visits occurred, guided by an algorithm-based protocol. Higher risk participants had a significantly lower dose of their weekly assigned visits (66%) than those at moderate (74%) and lower risk (90%). Twenty-eight percent of participants moved to a lower risk group over the year. Estimated intervention cost was $656 per person. Participants with less education were more likely to attend optimal percentage of visits.

A nurse-CHW team can deliver a culturally adapted diabetes self-management support intervention with excellent fidelity to the algorithm-based protocols. The team accommodated participants' needs by meeting them whenever and wherever they could. This study provides an example of adaptation of an evidence-based model to the Samoan cultural context and its resource-poor setting.
