An electric motor-driven ventricular assist device has been developed for long-term use inside the body. The system is composed of a pusher-plate-type blood pump and an actuator consisting of an electrical motor and a ball screw. Cyclic change of the direction of motor rotation makes a back-and-forth axial movement of the ball screw shaft. The shaft, which is detached from the pump diaphragm, pushes the diaphragm via a pusher plate to eject blood during systole; blood is sucked by the diaphragm resilience during diastole. Using the output signals from a newly designed, incremental-type, miniature optical rotary encoder mounted inside the actuator, the input voltage of the motor is optimally controlled referring to the phase difference between the current position of the moving rotor and the electrical reference signal of the rotation generated by a microprocessor-based controller. In vitro performance tests indicated that the system fulfills required specifications. The maximum efficiency was 11%, which was about twice as high as that obtained with the previous open-loop prototype system. In the air, the surface temperature of the actuator elevated to 20 degrees C above the room temperature. An acute in vivo test showed its feasibility as a left ventricular assist device. Analysis of the energy loss in each component of the system indicated that redesign and precise assembly of the mechanical parts could increase the system efficiency.
