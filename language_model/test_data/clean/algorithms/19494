Optical coherence tomography of luminal structures, such as for intravascular or gastrointestinal imaging, is performed by using a fiber-optic catheter as a beam-delivery probe. The interrogating beam is scanned angularly by rotating the fiber around a fixed central axis. Because the beam is focused only at a fixed distance from the center of the fiber, only scatterers near this distance are resolved. We present a solution of the inverse scattering problem that provides an estimate of the susceptibility of the sample for an angularly scanned Gaussian beam focused at a fixed distance from the origin. This solution provides quantitatively meaningful reconstructions while also extending the volume of the sample that is resolvable by the instrument.
