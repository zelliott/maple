This article covers nurses' job satisfaction during triage at emergency departments in Western Sweden.

Data was collected from 74 triage nurses using a questionnaire containing 37 short form open questions. The answers were analyzed descriptively and by measuring the covariance. The open questions were analyzed by content analysis.

The results showed a high degree of job satisfaction (88%). Triage as a method, the interesting nature of the work, and a certain freedom in connection with the triage tasks contributed to job satisfaction (R(2) = 0.40). The nurses found their work interesting and stimulating, although some reported job dissatisfaction due to a heavy workload and lack of competence. Most of the nurses thought that Manchester triage (MTS) was a clear and straightforward method but in need of development.

The rational modelling structure by which the triage method is constructed is unable to distinguish all the parameters that an experienced nurse takes into account. When the model is allowed to take precedence over experience, it can be of hindrance and contribute to certain estimates not corresponding with the patient's needs. The participants requested regular exercises solving and discussing patient scenarios. They also wanted to participate on a regular basis in the development of the instrument.
