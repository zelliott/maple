A highly efficient method based on Maxwell's theory was developed, which enables the calculation of the scanning of a focused beam through scattering media. Maxwell's equations were numerically solved in two dimensions using finite difference time domain simulations. The modeling of the focused beam was achieved by applying the angular spectrum of plane waves method. The scanning of the focused beam through the scattering medium was accomplished by saving the results of the near field obtained from one simulation set of plane waves incident at different angles and by an appropriate post processing of these data. Thus, an arbitrary number of focus positions could be simulated without the need to further solve Maxwell's equations. The presented method can be used to efficiently study the light propagation of focused beam through scattering media which is important, for example, for different kinds of scanning microscopes.
