Laryngopharyngeal reflux is a new term given to gastroesophageal reflux leading to atypical symptoms in the upper aerodigestive tract. The manifestations of laryngopharyngeal reflux are varied and include chronic hoarseness, globus pharyngeus, sore throat, chronic cough, asthma, paroxysmal laryngospasm, and other less common symptoms. Making the diagnosis requires accurate history taking and can be confirmed by fiberoptic examination of the pharynx and larynx, as well as by ambulatory esophageal and pharyngeal pH monitoring. Stepwise treatment regimens are very effective in treating this condition, which exacerbates or imitates many seemingly unrelated disorders.
