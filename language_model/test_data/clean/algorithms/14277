This work presents a method that allows for the assessment of 3D murine myocardial motion in vivo at microscopic resolution. Phase-contrast (PC) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 17.6 T was applied to map myocardial motion in healthy mice along three gradient directions. High-resolution velocity maps were acquired at three different levels in the murine myocardium with an in-plane resolution of 98 mum, a slice thickness of 0.6 mm, and a temporal resolution of 6 ms. The applied PC-MRI method was validated with phantom experiments that confirmed the correctness of the method with deviations of <1.7%. Myocardial in-plane velocities between 0.5 cm/s and 2.2 cm/s were determined for the healthy murine myocardium. Through-plane velocities of 0.1-0.83 cm/s were measured. Velocity data was also used to calculate the myocardial twist angle during systole at different slices in the short-axis view.
