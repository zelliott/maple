The aim of this project is to present a renderization by software algorithm of acquired volumetric data. The algorithm was implemented in Java language and the LWJGL graphical library was used, allowing the volume renderization by software and thus preventing the necessity to acquire specific graphical boards for the 3D reconstruction. The considered algorithm creates a model in OpenGL, through point primitives, where each voxel becomes a point with the color values related to this pixel position in the corresponding images.
