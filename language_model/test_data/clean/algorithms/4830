The shotgun approach has gained considerable acknowledgement in recent years as a dominant strategy in proteomics. We observed a dramatic increase of specific protein spots in two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) gels of the silkworm (Bombyx mori) embryo at labrum appearance, a characteristic stage during embryonic development of silkworm which is involved with temperature increase by silkworm raiser. We employed shotgun liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) technology to analyse the proteome of B. mori embryos at this stage. A total of 2168 proteins were identified with an in-house database. Approximately 47% of them had isoelectric point (pI) values distributed theoretically in the range pI 5-7 and approximately 60% of them had molecular weights of 15-45 kDa. Furthermore, 111 proteins had an pI greater than 10 and were difficult to separate by 2-DE. Many important functional proteins related to embryonic development, stress response, DNA transcription/translation, cell growth, proliferation and differentiation, organogenesis and reproduction were identified. Among them proteins related to nervous system development were noticeable. All known heat shock proteins (HSPs) were detected in this developmental stage of B. mori embryo. In addition, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed energetic metabolism at this stage. These results were expected to provide more information for proteomic monitoring of the insect embryo and better understanding of the spatiotemporal expression of genes during embryonic developmental processes.
