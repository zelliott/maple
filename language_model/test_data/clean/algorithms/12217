The ability of nonionic surfactants to solubilize the pesticide alachlor was studied. Two homologue series, octylphenol ethoxylates (Triton X-114, Triton X-100 and Triton X-102) and ethoxylated decyl alcohols (Neodol 91-5E, Neodol 91-6E and Neodol 91-8E) were used at concentrations 3 critical micelle concentration (CMC) and 6 CMC. The rate of solubilization of a sufficient quantity of alachlor (for saturation) in aqueous solution containing the micelles of nonionic surfactant was recorded. The experimental data were fitted to a first-order kinetic model. The rate constant, saturation concentration and enhancement factor were estimated for each surfactant system. The effect of surfactant structure, CMC concentration, pesticide structure and its physicochemical properties on the effectiveness of solubilization was determined. In terms of solubilization capability, the nonionic surfactants of each homologue series can be ranked as follows: Neodol 91-8E>Neodol 91-6E>Neodol 91-5E and Triton X-102>Triton X-100>Triton X-114. The more hydrophilic Neodol series was proved more efficient in alachlor solubilization than Triton series. The enhancement factor values ranged from 1.064 to 1.995 at 3 CMC and 1.320 to 2.919 at 6 CMC. The results will be used mainly for micellar-enhanced ultrafiltration since the extent of solubilization is a critical factor.
