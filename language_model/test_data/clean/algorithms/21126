The successful surgical treatment of arthrosis of the carpometacarpal articulation of the thumb requires a thorough understanding and evaluation of the intercalated axis of the first ray. A hyperextension/adduction deformity commonly occurs at the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb with advanced stages of carpometacarpal arthrosis. Failure to recognize and treat the metacarpophalangeal deformity may result in continued pain and poor outcomes. Additionally, the stability of the ligament reconstruction may become compromised, resulting in recurrence of deformity and longitudinal collapse. This article presents an orderly means of clinical and radiographic evaluation of this deformity and recommends surgical treatments to correct hyperextension and maximize functional outcomes. A treatment algorithm is provided.
