The management of T1G3 bladder cancer is controversial. Diagnostic methods, such as bladder mapping or second-look transurethral resection are recommended to assess risk. Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin intravesical therapy with a maintenance regimen is recommended for solitary T1G3 tumors. The timing of radical cystectomy for these patients is controversial, but early recurrence during intravesical therapy is an indication for radical cystectomy. Multifocal disease, concomitant carcinoma in situ and disease in the prostatic urethra and bladder neck also suggest aggressive disease and cystectomy should be considered in these patients.
