We study self-sustained terahertz current oscillation and chaotic dynamics in semiconducting single-walled zigzag carbon nanotubes using the time-dependent drift diffusion equations. The current oscillation under a dc voltage bias originates from the negative differential velocity of carbon nanotube which induces the motion and recycling of unstable domain. Numerical simulation indicates that different nonlinear oscillatory modes appear when an external high-frequency ac voltage is superimposed to the dc voltage bias and its driving amplitude varies. The appearance of different nonlinear oscillating modes, including periodic and chaotic, is attributed to the competition between the natural oscillation and the external driving oscillation. The transitions between periodic and chaotic states are carefully studied using chaos-detecting methods, such as bifurcation diagram, phase portraits, first return map, and Fourier spectrum. The resulting bifurcation diagram displays an interesting and complex transition picture with the driving amplitudes as the control parameter.
