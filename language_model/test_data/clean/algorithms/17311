The moving table technique for total body irradiation (MTT TBI) has some advantages in regard to dose homogeneity, patient positioning and comfort. However, divergence of the radiation field coupled with patient motion necessitates corresponding motion of the shielding blocks and verification film so that penumbra is minimized. MTT TBI system is presented, together with dose calculations, incorporating moving trays for shields and film to ensure dose delivery with minimal penumbra of the blocked field.
