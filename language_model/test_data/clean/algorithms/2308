Antigen binding of total-IgG and IgG-subclass antibodies from patients with alveolar or cystic echinococcosis (AE and CE) was assessed by immunoblotting. Antigen extracts were prepared from Echinococcus multilocularis protoscoleces (EmP) or from homogenized E. multilocularis metacestode tissue (EmCH). Antigens of approximately 44, 35, 21, 17.5 and 16.5 were recognized by total-IgG and IgG1- and IgG4-subclass antibodies in some of 50 human AE sera from China, Japan or France. The 44- and 35-kDa polypeptides, present in both EmP and EmCH extracts, were recognized by total-IgG antibodies in sera from 82% and 66% of the AE patients, respectively. However, over 30% cross-reactivity occurred between these two antigens and sera from CE and Taenia solium cysticercosis patients. The immunoblot specificities of the 27-, 21- and 17.5-kDa antigens in EmP for E. multilocularis infection were 73%, 88% and 93%, respectively. Recognition of the 17.5-kDa antigen in the EmP immunoblot was much higher for the Japanese AE cases (11/13; 85%) than for the French (9/19; 47%) or Chinese (9/18; 50%) AE cases. None of the CE cases from Uruguay or Libya, where human AE has not been reported, was seropositive for the 17.5-kDa antigen. Antibodies from three (7.3%) of the 41 Chinese CE cases recognized the 17.5-kDa antigen. Within the 13 Japanese AE sera, the combined detection by IgG1, IgG4 and total-IgG antibodies of the 27-, 21- and 17.5-kDa antigens in either EmP or EmCH immunoblots was greater than that by each class/subclass alone, increasing the overall sensitivity for AE patients. A combined ELISA/immunoblot approach, including IgG-subclass detection using E. multilocularis protocolex or cyst extracts, could be useful for the differential diagnosis of human alveolar echinococcosis. An algorithm for such an approach is given.
