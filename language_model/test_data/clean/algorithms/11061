Proton linewidths decrease with increasing magic-angle spinning (MAS) rates. However, without spin dilution by deuteration, even with the fastest MAS rates available today, the narrowest proton linewidths are obtained by using the combined rotation and multiple pulse spectroscopy (CRAMPS) method. Direct observation under windowed CRAMPS typically introduces several tens of times more noise, partly because wideband analog filters (e.g. 5 MHz) must be used or sometimes even bypassed. Here we report that it is possible to keep using narrowband analog filters (about 50 kHz cutoff frequency) in CRAMPS by taking advantage of the time delay caused by the filters, which is inversely proportional to the cutoff frequency. This delay coincides with typical CRAMPS cycle times, enabling acquisition of the data point in the next detection window. The noise of such CRAMPS spectra is only about 5 times larger than MAS-only spectra. This new method allows CRAMPS to be performed on systems that lack wideline hardware (wideband filters and fast ADCs), for example, older spectrometers originally intended for solution NMR.
