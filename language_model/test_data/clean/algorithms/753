Many current parameters to ablate vascular beds using 1,064 nm lasers are based on high-energy settings and often fail to consider vessel diameter and/or pulse width. This study attempts to define the minimal effective dosage (MED) of energy and pulse width for specific vessel diameters in an animal model.

1,064 nm Nd: YAG was used in 15 Sprague-Dawley rats. Bilateral extended dorsolateral skin flaps were elevated and vessel diameters from 0.1 to 1 mm were identified. Pulse widths (PW) in a range of 15-60 milliseconds and fluences between 70-110 J/cm2 with contact cooling at 5 degrees C (Celsius) were utilized. Results were determined clinically and histologically.

Ideal pulse width and MED for each vessel diameter were determined using a 6 mm spot size. Histology showed early hemostasis and subsequent thrombosis, which are consistent with clinical findings.

This model allows in vivo monitoring of vessel ablation. Optimal pulse width and MED levels versus vessel diameter determined in this animal model provide a useful algorithm that may allow for more effective treatment of vascular targets utilizing the 1,064 nm Nd:YAG laser.
