These recommendations are presented to enhance the safety and efficacy of AEDs intended for public access. The task force recommends that manufacturers present developmental and validation data on their own devices, emphasizing high sensitivity for shockable rhythms and high specificity for nonshockable rhythms. Alternative defibrillation waveforms may reduce energy requirements, reducing the size and weight of the device. The highest levels of safety for public access defibrillation are needed. Safe and effective use of AEDs that are widely available and easily handled by nonmedical personnel has the potential to dramatically increase survival from cardiac arrest.
