Low-frequency vibrations of the structural elements of the DNA molecule in a viscous solution were investigated. It was shown that shear, twist and extension waves can propagate along the axis of the molecule. The mutual influence of acoustic waves on each other was analyzed. Formulas for determining the sound velocity and the attenuation coefficients for these types of waves are obtained.
