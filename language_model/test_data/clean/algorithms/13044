Hemodialysis adequacy can be quantified using ultraviolet absorbance of the spent dialysate, or by analysis of dialysate conductivity at the dialyzer inlet and outlet in response to changes in dialysate electrolyte concentration. These measurements can be made at every dialysis, including initial and acute treatments and can help detect access recirculation. No disposables or reagents are required. Cost may be reduced by reducing the need for blood sampling and laboratory analysis.
