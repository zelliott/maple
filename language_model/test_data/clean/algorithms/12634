Life-threatening situations after multiple trauma which require interruption of the diagnostic algorithm and immediate surgical treatment after admission are a challenge for the multidisciplinary trauma team. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence, causes, implications and relevance of life-threatening situations for major trauma patients after admission to trauma centers.

Data of 12,971 patients listed in the German Trauma Register of the German Society for Trauma Surgery (DGU, 2002-2007) were analyzed. Patients with an injury severity score (ISS) > 16, no isolated head injury and primary admission to a trauma center were included. Data were allocated according to patients where the diagnostic algorithm in the resuscitation room was interrupted to perform emergency surgery (group Notop, n = 713, 5.5%) and patients who received early surgical care after completed diagnostics (group Frühop, n = 5,515, 42.5%). Comparative parameters were the pattern and severity of injury, physiological state and clinical outcome.

Patients receiving emergency surgery showed an average ISS score of 39 ± 15 points, whereas patients receiving early surgery showed an average ISS of 31 ± 12 points. On admission patients in the emergency surgery group (44%) suffered from hemodynamic shock considerably more often than patients in the early surgery care group (15%, p < 0.001). This was indicated by the significant differences in systolic blood pressure on admission, amount of preclinical substituted volume, base excess on admission and substituted erythrocyte concentrates in early clinical course. Mortality was 46% in the emergency surgery group and 13% in the early surgical care group (p < 0.001). Severe injuries (AIS ≥ 4) of the thorax, abdomen and extremities (including the pelvis) were encountered considerably more often in the emergency surgery group. There was no statistical difference in occurrence of severe head injuries between the groups. Emergency surgery consisted of 50.5% laparatomy, 19.8% craniotomy, 10.0% thoracotomy and 9.3% pelvic surgery.

Life-threatening situations after major trauma which require immediate surgical intervention in the resuscitation room rarely occur in Germany. Nevertheless, they are associated with a high mortality and prolonged and complex clinical course if primarily survived. Indications and decision-making processes of these challenging situations have to be practiced with standardized algorithms and should be considered for the future education of orthopedic surgeons in Germany.
