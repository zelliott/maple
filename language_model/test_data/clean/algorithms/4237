This study was to assess the Capri applicator for patients with endometrial cancer undergoing high-radiation dose treatments following external-beam radiation therapy. The Capri applicator is an inflatable vaginal cylinder with multiple channels. It is used to tailor the dose distribution to an asymmetric vaginal disease, and better spare organs at risk. Five patients with high-risk endometrial cancer were selected for this study. The patients were treated with a high dose of radiation using the Capri applicator: daily fraction of 7 Gy was prescribed for a total dose of 21Gy. The treatment plans included radiobiological parameters such as equivalent uniform dose (EUD), normal tissue complication probability (NTCP), and tumor control probability (TCP). Based on the dose-volume histograms (DVH), we also calculated four quality factors: conformity index (CI), dose homogeneity index (DHI), dose nonuniformity index (DNR), and overdose index (OI). The TCP values range from 82.26% to 95.92%. Very low values of NTCP were observed for the bladder and rectum. The EUDs to organs at risk ranged from 4.65 Gy to 18.22 Gy for the bladder, and from 3.41 Gy from to 6.56 Gy for the rectum. The mean CI was 1.05 (SD = 0.0008). The mean DNR was 0.10 (range 0.0-0.295, SD= 0.100). The mean OI was 0.019 (SD = 0.028). The DHIs were in the range of 1.0-0.754 (mean 0.886, SD = 0.116). The use of a multichannel vaginal cylinder may not only help cover extensive vaginal disease, but also reduce the dose to the rectum. This dosimetric analysis shows that rectal doses could be reduced using a multichannel cylinder. However, the dose delivered to the bladder based on EUD calculation may be higher than that obtained with other methods. Each patient must be evaluated independently to determine if a multichannel treatment is appropriate. Clinical followup will show whether this rectal dose sparing translates into a real toxicity improvement.
