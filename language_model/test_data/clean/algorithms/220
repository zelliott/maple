The measurement uncertainty budget for a clinical test-kit--an ELISA technique based on experimental data provided in the instruction manual--is presented. The proper characterization of the calibrators, within-plate homogeneity and the trueness of ELISA test-kits are identified as being major contributors to the combined uncertainty.
