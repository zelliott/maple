It is commonly accepted that larger visual objects are represented in the cerebral cortex by specific spatial patterns of neuronal activity. Self-organization is a key concept in the different explanations of such neuronal representations. We here propose as a hypothesis that fast cortical selection (FCS) is an intrinsic functional element of cortical self-organization during perception. Selection is a central concept in theoretical biology which has proved its explanatory power in different fields of our natural and cultural world. The central element in the cortical selection process is the pyramidal cell with its two types of excitatory input. In primary cortical areas one of these inputs comes from any of the sensory organs, determining the topological and typological receptive field properties of the cell and also driving it directly. The other type of input connects reciprocally neighbouring pyramidal cells by axon collaterals and only facilitates the driving input. These two functionally different inputs constitute the elementary selection system working by iterative mutual facilitation as a biological algorithm. A short simulation, based entirely on such biological facts, illustrates the dynamic of this selection process: the activity of cells responding better to the external stimulus 'grow and survive' the stimulation, whereas less responsive cells decrease their activity due to competition.
