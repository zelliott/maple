Quantitative PCR (qPCR) remains the method of choice for gene and microRNA (miRNA) expression studies. Many laboratories wish to automate some or all of the steps of medium-throughput qPCR experiments through the use of various types of liquid handling robots. However, it is not uncommon to find cases in which scripts provided by the robot supplier are too rigid for user-specific applications, do not include all the desired options, or are too complicated to be modified by a nonprofessional programmer. Here, we present Automatic Genomics, a program that allows users with a limited programming background to automate medium-throughput qPCR experiments by using commercially available liquid-handling robots. The user is able to optimize the plate design in terms of number of genes, number of samples, and controls.
