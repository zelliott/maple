The chromatographic peak profile of the analyte involved in a chemical reaction of the type A + B <--> AB is considered using method of the apparent adsorption isotherm. The apparent isotherms derived are nonlinear even under assumption of Henry isotherms of individual solutes. Nonlinearity of apparent adsorption isotherm results in peak distortion. The resulted chromatographic peak profile depends on several factors such as the equilibrium constant K(mob) and Henry constants of the solutes. Simulated peak profiles of solutes involved in the chemical reaction are presented as illustration of influence of various factors.
