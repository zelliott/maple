MAVG is a software tool for finding k non-overlapping maximum-average segments that are sufficiently long in a given sequence of real numbers, for any k > 0. It has applications in several areas of biomolecular sequence analysis including locating GC-rich regions and CpG islands in a genomic sequence, and annotating multiple sequence alignments.
