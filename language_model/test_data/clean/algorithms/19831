A candidate LC method proposed by the Expert Review Panel (ERP) for ractopamine was evaluated in a single-laboratory validation (SLV) study. The matrixes examined included bovine liver, kidney, muscle, and fat; swine liver, kidney, muscle, and fat; and turkey liver and muscle. Solution standards were shown to provide a linear response with an unweighted regression. The method demonstrated acceptable precision (HorRat, values 0.25 to 1.38) and recovery (75.4 to 88.8%) in all fortified matrixes. Method precision was verified with incurred residue tissues (bovine liver, kidney, and muscle; swine liver, kidney, and muscle; and turkey liver and muscle), which yielded RSDr values below 16% for all tissues and below 7% for most tissues. Estimated LOQ values ranged from 1.8 to 20.7 ng/g and support the utility of the method in the range of the maximum residue limits or tolerances for the various tissues. The data satisfy the requirements of the AOAC Stakeholder Panel on Veterinary Drug Residue for SLV studies, and the method was adopted Official Methods ofAnalysis First Action 2011.22 by the AOAC ERP on Veterinary Drug Residues.
