Chest compression interruptions are detrimental during the resuscitation of cardiac arrest patients, especially immediately prior to shock delivery.

To evaluate the effect of use of a new defibrillator technology, which filters compression-induced artifact and provides reliable rhythm analysis with automatic defibrillator charging during chest compressions, on preshock chest compression interruption.

Thirty subjects (20 basic life support [BLS]; 10 advanced life support [ALS]) worked in pairs to perform two randomly ordered simulated cardiac resuscitations with the defibrillator operating in either standard mode (ALS = manual; BLS = automated external defibrillator [AED]) or the new Analysis and Charging during CPR (AC-CPR) mode. During each resuscitation simulation, rescuers switched roles as chest compressor and defibrillator operator every two segments of CPR (one segment = 2 minutes of chest compressions, rhythm analysis, and shock delivery, if appropriate), for eight total segments. The participants rested ≥30 minutes between trials and received brief AC-CPR training (BLS = 30 seconds; ALS = 5 minutes). Heart rate and perceived exertion were measured with pulse oximetry and the Borg scale, respectively.

Mean (± standard deviation) preshock chest compression pause time was considerably shorter in each CPR segment with AC-CPR versus standard defibrillator operation (2.13 ± 0.99 sec vs. 10.93 ± 1.33, p < 0.0001), demonstrating effective use of AC-CPR with minimal training. Despite reduced chest compression interruption with AC-CPR, rescuer fatigue and perceived exertion did not differ in any CPR segment with standard defibrillator operation versus AC-CPR (p = 0.2-1.0).

Preshock pause time is reduced by 80% utilizing a novel technology that employs automated analysis and charging during chest compression. Although chest compression pause time is reduced with the use of the new technology, participants do not excessively fatigue.
