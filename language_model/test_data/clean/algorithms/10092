This work investigates the complex relationships between cerebrovascular dynamics, intracranial pressure (ICP), Cushing response, and short-term systemic regulation via an original mathematical model. The model has been used to analyze the effects of Cushing response on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular quantities during constant ICP elevation and during the occurrence of ICP plateau waves and to investigate the conditions leading to system instability with the formation of slow (0.05-0.1 Hz) arterial pressure waves. The model may be of value to assist clinicians in finding the balance between clinical benefits of Cushing response and its shortcomings.
