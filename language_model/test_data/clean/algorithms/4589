With increasing advances in technology, cardiac pacemakers have become highly sophisticated devices that allow diagnostic and therapeutic functions beyond conventional antibradycardic therapy. This review discusses the most promising developments in antibradycardic device therapy, such as novel diagnostic functions, telemonitoring, autoadjustment of programmed parameters, algorithms for support of intrinsic atrioventricular conduction, pacing algorithms for the prevention of atrial arrhythmias and cardiac resynchronization therapy. A short overview of the basic principles of antibradycardic device therapy is also provided.
