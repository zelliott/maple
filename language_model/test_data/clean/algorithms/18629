G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are involved in cell communication processes and with mediating such senses as vision, smell, taste, and pain. They constitute a prominent superfamily of drug targets, but an atomic-level structure is available for only one GPCR, bovine rhodopsin, making it difficult to use structure-based methods to design receptor-specific drugs. We have developed the MembStruk first principles computational method for predicting the three-dimensional structure of GPCRs. In this article we validate the MembStruk procedure by comparing its predictions with the high-resolution crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin. The crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin has the second extracellular (EC-II) loop closed over the transmembrane regions by making a disulfide linkage between Cys-110 and Cys-187, but we speculate that opening this loop may play a role in the activation process of the receptor through the cysteine linkage with helix 3. Consequently we predicted two structures for bovine rhodopsin from the primary sequence (with no input from the crystal structure)-one with the EC-II loop closed as in the crystal structure, and the other with the EC-II loop open. The MembStruk-predicted structure of bovine rhodopsin with the closed EC-II loop deviates from the crystal by 2.84 A coordinate root mean-square (CRMS) in the transmembrane region main-chain atoms. The predicted three-dimensional structures for other GPCRs can be validated only by predicting binding sites and energies for various ligands. For such predictions we developed the HierDock first principles computational method. We validate HierDock by predicting the binding site of 11-cis-retinal in the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin. Scanning the whole protein without using any prior knowledge of the binding site, we find that the best scoring conformation in rhodopsin is 1.1 A CRMS from the crystal structure for the ligand atoms. This predicted conformation has the carbonyl O only 2.82 A from the N of Lys-296. Making this Schiff base bond and minimizing leads to a final conformation only 0.62 A CRMS from the crystal structure. We also used HierDock to predict the binding site of 11-cis-retinal in the MembStruk-predicted structure of bovine rhodopsin (closed loop). Scanning the whole protein structure leads to a structure in which the carbonyl O is only 2.85 A from the N of Lys-296. Making this Schiff base bond and minimizing leads to a final conformation only 2.92 A CRMS from the crystal structure. The good agreement of the ab initio-predicted protein structures and ligand binding site with experiment validates the use of the MembStruk and HierDock first principles' methods. Since these methods are generic and applicable to any GPCR, they should be useful in predicting the structures of other GPCRs and the binding site of ligands to these proteins.
