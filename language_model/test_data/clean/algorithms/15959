Reflux nephropathy is an important cause of chronic renal failure and arterial hypertension in children. While its prognosis is favourably influenced by the early recognition and management of vesicoureteric reflux, there is a real risk of missing the diagnosis of this insidious condition. This article describes the main features of vesicoureteric reflux and associated nephropathy and presents practical recommendations, through a nonexhaustive literature review. As several aspects of this disease remain to be established, any recommendation concerning its management should be constantly reevaluated according to new data.
