Venous thromboembolic disease is a major cause of morbidity and hospital mortality worldwide. Although exact figures are unknown in Mexico, achieving uniformity of criteria among the specialties involved in the prophylaxis and treatment will offer a clearer picture and contribute to a more rational and interdisciplinary approach in order to improve the quality of care for patients and increase the level of awareness of this entity.

For the preparation of this document, a total of 11 medical specialists from Mexico City and the interior of the country met along with a highly experienced professional from Chicago, IL, USA with wide experience in the field and knowledge of methodology for the development of a management algorithm for prophylaxis in at-risk patients of venous thromboembolic disease. The expert group met in plenary working sessions, managed uniform criteria and reached consensus agreement by issuing a series of useful recommendations for the care of patients with venous thromboembolism in Mexican hospitals.

In Mexico there is the need to develop and disseminate guidelines on thromboprophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolic disease because of the wide disparity of views or simple misinformation, leading to diagnostic and treatment behaviors unique to each institution.
