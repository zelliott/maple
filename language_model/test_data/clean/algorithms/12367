EEG parameters for assessment of depth of anaesthesia are typically based on different signal processing methods, such as spectral and complexity analysis. In the present study, the parameters investigated (WSMF, qWSMF, approximate entropy and Lempel-Ziv complexity) do not correlate monotonically to depth of anaesthesia. To obtain this correlation, parameters are combined based on fuzzy inference, whereby each parameter only operates in a specific range. Fuzzy inference seems to be a suitable approach, as the indicator designed separates wakefulness from unconsciousness as well as the best single parameter does and correlates to the depth of anaesthesia.
