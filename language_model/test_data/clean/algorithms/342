The spatio-temporal dynamics of traveling waves in glycolysis as it occurs in yeast extract have been studied, both theoretically and experimentally. We describe this phenomenon with the distributed Selkov model that accounts for the reactions of phosphofructokinase, which is a key enzyme of the glycolytic reaction cascade. To describe the experimentally observed phase waves in an open spatial reactor we introduce a non-homogeneous flux of substrate in the model. The experimental observation that waves can change their direction of propagation during the experiment is considered in the model. The mechanism for such a change in wave direction is discussed.
