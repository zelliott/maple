Recent development of nanotechnology allows precise assessment of the risks workers are exposed to. To assess the risks, a specific risk assessment model has been developed with reference to workplaces where nanoparticles are present. This model allows identification and quantification of the health hazards for workers. The use of nanomaterials presents some uncertainties regarding effective level of danger, and risk assessment takes this into consideration with the help of an appropriate index. An evaluation algorithm considers both normal work conditions and abnormal/emergency situations. Evaluation outcome consists of several risk levels with several subdivisions. For each single level, it is possible to develop specific behavioral guidelines. The present evaluation model has been implemented in research laboratories. The results are middle to high-level risks.
