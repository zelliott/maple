Based on transformation optics theory, we designed a chirality switching device, such that an object hidden inside would exhibit a reversed chirality (i.e., from left-handedness to right-handedness) for an observer at the far field. Distinct from a perfect mirror which also creates a chirality-reversed image, our device makes the original object completely invisible to the far field observer. Numerical simulations are employed to demonstrate the functionalities of the designed devices in both two- and three-dimensional spaces.
