During last 20 years ultrasonography has been widely used in Europe to investigate abdominal trauma. In United States it has not been considered a reliable test especially because of its lack of sensitivity in diagnosing parenchymal injuries. Recently American surgeons reconsidered ultrasonography in trauma and codified its use into FAST (Focused Assessment for the Sonographic examination of the Trauma patients). The goal is to detect hemoperitoneum and pericardial effusion. Advantages are remarkable: ultrasound is cost-effective, fast, non-invasive, can be performed by surgeons even on unstable patients. FAST is now included in ATLS framework for examination of thoraco-abdominal trauma.
