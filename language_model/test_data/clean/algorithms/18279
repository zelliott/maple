The purpose of this paper is to study the special forms of multimode dynamics that one can observe in systems with resource-mediated coupling, i.e., systems of self-sustained oscillators in which the coupling takes place via the distribution of primary resources that controls the oscillatory state of the individual unit. With this coupling, a spatially inhomogenous state with mixed high and low-amplitude oscillations in the individual units can arise. To examine generic phenomena associated with this type of interaction we consider a chain of resistively coupled electronic oscillators connected to a common power supply. The two-oscillator system displays antiphase synchronization, and it is interesting to note that two-mode oscillations continue to exist outside of the parameter range in which oscillations occur for the individual unit. At low coupling strengths, the multi-oscillator system shows high dimensional quasiperiodicity with little tendency for synchronization. At higher coupling strengths, one typically observes spatial clustering involving a few oscillating units. We describe three different scenarios according to which the cluster can slide along the chain as the bias voltage changes.
