A method of resolving the complex conjugate ambiguity in Fourier-domain OCT is described. The complex differential spectral interferogram is obtained by simultaneous acquisition of the first and second harmonics of the ac component of the phase-modulated interferogram. The harmonics represent the imaginary and real parts of the interferogram, respectively. The complex conjugate rejection ratio is found to be at least 45 dB and is limited by background noise.
