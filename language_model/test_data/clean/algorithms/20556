In this paper, a number of existing and novel techniques are considered for ordering cloned extracts from the genome of an organism based on fingerprinting data. A metric is defined for comparing the quality of the clone order for each technique. Simulated annealing is used in combination with several different objective functions. Empirical results with many simulated data sets for which the correct solution is known indicate that a simple greedy algorithm with some subsequent stochastic shuffling provides the best solution. Other techniques that attempt to weight comparisons between nonadjacent clones bias the ordering and give worse results. We show that this finding is not surprising since without detailed attempts to reconcile the data into a detailed map, only approximate maps can be obtained. Making N2 pieces of data from measurements of N clones cannot improve the situation.
