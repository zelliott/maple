The facts that the clinical manifestations of alcohol-associated urgent conditions are polymorphic, and that terms traditionally used by doctors to characterize these conditions are diverse, determine objective difficulties in rendering medical aid in such situations. However, the number of urgent alcohol-associated conditions grows every year. Analysis of diagnostic errors demonstrates that 30% of doctor's errors are subjective. Mistaken diagnosis is followed by casual treatment, independently on its cost and length. Treatment of alcohol-associated pathology is prerogative of general practitioners, which makes knowledge of clinical picture, terminology, legal aspects of rendering medical aid, expertise of the ability to work, and therapeutic tactics in urgent alcohol-associated conditions, important to doctors of all specialties.
