Employing the small-signal analysis, we study the bidirectional operating characteristics in a Raman ring laser. Bidirectional operation is found not stable in a silicon ring because of the existence of two-photon absorption. Using polar crystals which have different forward and backward Raman gain or introducing external optical injections helps to establish stable bidirectional operation in a Raman ring laser.
