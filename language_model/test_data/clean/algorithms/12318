Facial palsy has devastating functional and psychosocial sequelae for patients, thus its treatment requires thorough understanding of state-of-the-art modalities that can optimize facial reanimation. Treatment depends on the mechanism and timing of injury, patient goals, overall health, and motivation. Because of its significant impact on patient's quality of life, both acute and long-standing deficits should be addressed. Often requiring multi-disciplinary efforts, an institution well-equipped in dealing with facial reanimation offers patients the most consistent results.
