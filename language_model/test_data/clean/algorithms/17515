The aim of this study was to propose and validate a post-hoc correction method to obtain maximal power values taking into account inertia of the flywheel during sprints on friction-loaded cycle ergometers. This correction method was obtained from a basic postulate of linear deceleration-time evolution during the initial phase (until maximal power) of a sprint and included simple parameters as flywheel inertia, maximal velocity, time to reach maximal velocity and friction force. The validity of this model was tested by comparing measured and calculated maximal power values for 19 sprint bouts performed by five subjects against 0.6-1 N kg(-1) friction loads. Non-significant differences between measured and calculated maximal power (1151+/-169 vs. 1148+/-170 W) and a mean error index of 1.31+/-1.20% (ranging from 0.09% to 4.20%) showed the validity of this method. Furthermore, the differences between measured maximal power and power neglecting inertia (20.4+/-7.6%, ranging from 9.5% to 33.2%) emphasized the usefulness of power correcting in studies about anaerobic power which do not include inertia, and also the interest of this simple post-hoc method.
