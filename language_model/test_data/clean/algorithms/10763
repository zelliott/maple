Biomedical text-mining systems have great promise for improving the efficiency and productivity of biomedical researchers. However, such systems are still not in routine use. One impediment to their development is the lack of systematic and rigorous evaluation, comparable to the approaches developed for information retrieval systems. The developers of text-mining systems need to improve both test collections for system-oriented evaluation and undertake user-oriented evaluations to determine the most effective use of their systems for their intended audience.
