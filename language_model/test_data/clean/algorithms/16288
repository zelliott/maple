The oblique projection is used widely in imaging of the lower vascular tree. Much of the evidence justifying the oblique projection is anecdotal. This study compares the sensitivity of the anteroposterior (AP) projection alone in lower limb vascular catheter angiography to that combined with the oblique projection. 110 digitally subtracted angiograms were analysed initially on AP and subsequently on oblique views. Oblique imaging increases confidence, demonstrates stenoses not seen on AP and changes the diagnosis. This supports the use of the oblique projection in lower limb vascular interventional imaging.
