Nano- and microparticles in human blood affect drastically the charge transfer CT through the viable fluid. Low-frequency dielectric properties of the blood, characterized by CT of β - dispersion type, are widely investigated with special stress on physical mechanisms. However, no publication in the literature deals with the presence of α - dispersion in human blood. In the present study, a mechanism associated with α-, β-, and γ- dispersions is presented. The dielectric losses (electrical conduction) phenomenon is also discussed with special emphasis on the distribution of relaxation times. These losses cause problems with low-frequency dielectric measurements, thus, they are correlated with the famous empirical Col-Cole factor, (1-α). A Gaussian distribution of relaxation times is suggested and found to be exponentially related with (1-α). The results suggest new diagnostic and therapeutic methods for blood disorders.
