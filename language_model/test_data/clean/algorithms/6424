There are no published reports identifying an inadequate ventilatory response to metabolic acidosis as a predictor of impending respiratory failure. Metabolic acidosis should induce a respiratory alkalosis in which the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Paco2) is (1.5 [HCO3-] + 8) +/- 2. This study examined the relation between inadequate ventilatory compensation and intubation among trauma patients.

A retrospective chart review was performed for trauma patients admitted between January 1999 and December 2000. Age, gender, Injury Severity Score and combined Trauma and Injury Severity Score, chest injury, history of cardiac or pulmonary disease, partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2), Paco2, Glasgow Coma Score, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, base deficit, and ability to compensate were analyzed with respect to intubation and need for ventilator support.

Of 140 patients with metabolic acidosis, 45 ultimately were intubated. The mean Paco2 for the unintubated patients was 34 +/- 7 mm Hg, as compared with 41 +/- 11 mm Hg for the intubated patients (p < 0.001). Only injury severity and ability to compensate for metabolic acidosis were independent predictors of intubation. Patients with inadequate compensation were 4.2 times more likely to require intubation when control was used for the Injury Severity Score (95% confidence interval, 1.8-9.7; p < 0.001).

Inability to mount an adequate hyperventilatory response to metabolic acidosis is associated with an increased likelihood of respiratory failure and a need for ventilatory support. Recognition of this relation should lead to closer monitoring of patients with this condition, and could help to avert unforeseen crisis intubations. This observation needs to be validated in a prospective study.
