A retrospective comparison of the evidence obtained at preoperative examination of 68 patients with urolithiasis operated with the use of percutaneous technologies has demonstrated that the risk of postoperative infectious-inflammatory complications depends much on the immune status of the patient. Patients with initially different states of phagocytic immunity and antibody production had different courses of the postoperative period. An algorithm of immunological prediction of an acute pyelonephritis attack after percutaneous operations for nephrolithiasis is proposed.
