In this study of the informativeness of boundary contours for the perception of natural object shape, observers viewed shadows/silhouettes cast by natural solid objects and were required to adjust the positions of a set of 10 points so that the resulting dotted shape resembled the shape of the original silhouette as closely as possible. For each object, the observers were then asked to indicate the corresponding positions of the 10 points on the original boundary contour. The results showed that there was a close correspondence between the chosen positions of the points and the locations along the boundary contour that were local curvature maxima (convexities or concavities). This finding differs from that of Kennedy and Domander (1985 Perception 14 367-370), and shows that, at least for natural objects, the original hypothesis of Attneave (1954 Psychological Review 61 183-193) is valid--local curvature maxima are indeed important for the perception of shape.
