A new algorithm is presented that provides separate water, fat, and B0 images utilizing the in-phase and opposed-phase acquisitions of the two-point Dixon (2PD) method. The accuracy of the extended method (E2PD) compares favorably with the three-point Dixon (3PD) method, and the acquisition requires 2/3 the 3PD scan time. Slightly increased mismapping may occur in pixels containing an admixture of water and fat due to reduced SNR in the B0 field map compared with the 3PD method.
