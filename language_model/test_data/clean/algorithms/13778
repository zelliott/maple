The assessment of the status of a patient and diagnosis are first made strictly algorithmically. At the same time the procedure is monitored by a physician in terms of his experience and knowledge. The dialogue is made on the basis of a model and images which reflect the pattern of blood circulation. The diagnosis is made by isolating the key pathophysiological link and interpreting it by means of a clinico-mathematical classification. The usual wording based on the evaluation of the severity and stage of a pathological process is supplemented with assessments of compensatory, protective, and other adaptive changes which greatly influence the choice of a therapy. The action of drugs is evaluated by their cumulative effects on the changes in physiological functions determining their properties, direction and magnitude of alterations of the weakest link. The clinical experience has shown that the procedure is beneficial for rapid detection of clinically significant changes, choice and assessment of therapeutical efforts just during an operation and in the early postoperative period.
