We here show the (43)Ca 5QMAS NMR spectra at high field (16.4 T) and the first 7QMAS spectrum at ultra-high field (21.8 T) for geologically important Ca-containing glasses. The high-resolution MQMAS spectra present a clear evidence of multiple Ca sites in the amorphous structures that have never been identified by other analytical methods. The present study suggests that the Ca(2+) ions are mainly in 7- and 8-fold coordination sites. This will offer valuable insights for dynamic properties of magmatic liquids. The MQMAS NMR technique at high magnetic field is a unique tool to understand the detailed structural information on a specific element in solids including organic and inorganic compounds.
