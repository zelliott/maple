The possibility of using partial correlation as a measure of genetic correlation in estimating selection indices was studied. The methods of estimation were analyzed, and the use of one of them was substantiated. The applicability of partial correlations in estimating genetic correlations was demonstrated theoretically and with an example from actual practice. The proposed algorithm was illustrated by an example.
