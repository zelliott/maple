Neutron activation analysis of UDP-galactose 4-epimerase from Escherichia coli for 53 metals shows that the enzyme does not contain any of these metals at significant levels. The substrate analog P1-5'-uridine-P2-glucose-6-yl pyrophosphate (UGP), a structural isomer of UDP-glucose with the sugar linked to UDP through the C-6 hydroxyl group, is an inactivator that irreversibly reduces epimerase.NAD+ to epimerase.NADH. The pH dependence of kobs reveals the essential involvement of an acidic group, kinetically measured pKa = 5.48 +/- 0.08, in unprotonated form and two weakly acidic or basic groups, apparent pKa values of 10.03 +/- 0.43, in protonated forms. Measurements of kobs as a function of [UGP] show that it is given by kobs = k[UGP]/(K + [UGP]) at a given pH, where K = 0.19 +/- 0.04 mM throughout the pH range 4.8-10.4. The pH-dependent first order rate constants range from 0.28 to 1.94 s-1, with the maximum value at pH 7.6 and decreasing at acidic and basic pH values. Reaction of [glucose-1-2H]UGP proceeds with kinetic isotope effects of 5.0, 2.1, 2.0, 1.9, and 3.5 at pH values 5.0, 6.2, 7.6, 9.0, and 10.0, respectively. Therefore, hydride transfer becomes rate-limiting at pH extremes but is not limiting at neutral pH, although deuteride transfer is significantly limiting at all pH values. The isotope effects facilitated correction of the kinetic pK values to the thermodynamic values 6.1-6.2 on the acid side and 9.0-9.6 on the alkaline side. We postulate that the group with pK1 = 5.5 (6.1-6.2 corrected) functions as an enzymic general base that abstracts the glucosyl C-1 hydroxyl proton in concert with transfer of the C-1 hydrogen and two electrons to NAD+. The pH dependence on the alkaline side may be related to the uridine nucleotide-dependent conformational transition that is an essential step in the reduction of epimerase.NAD+ to epimerase.NADH by sugars.
