Cushing's syndrome due to adrenal adenoma or adrenocortical carcinoma is rare. To understand better the clinical and biochemical presentation of this disorder, as well as therapy efficacy and patient survival, we conducted a retrospective review.

Between August 1971 and April 1994, 40 patients presented to our institution with adrenal Cushing's syndrome (27 adenomas and 13 carcinomas). These groups were analyzed with respect to clinical signs and symptoms preoperatively and postoperatively, biochemical analysis, length of postoperative steroid replacement therapy, disease recurrence and patient survival. Followup was obtained by chart review and telephone interviews and averaged 59.6 +/- 66.4 and 47.6 +/- 56.2 months for adenoma and carcinoma patients, respectively.

Women predominated in both groups (26 of 27 adenomas, 11 of 13 carcinomas), and tumors affected the left adrenal gland more frequently (19 of 27 adenomas, 9 of 13 carcinomas). Adenoma patients were younger than carcinoma patients (39.6 +/- 14.4 versus 51.5 +/- 16.6 years, p = 0.026) and presented with smaller tumors (3.3 +/- 1.0 versus 8.6 +/- 4.5 cm., p = 0.001). There was a trend toward increased incidence of glucose intolerance among carcinoma patients but no significant differences in clinical signs or symptoms between adenoma and carcinoma patients could be made. Similarly, while there was no significant difference in biochemical evaluation of adenoma versus carcinoma patients, 24-hour urinary free cortisol and serum lactate dehydrogenase levels tended to be higher among carcinoma patients. In addition 17-ketosteroid and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels were more elevated in carcinoma than in adenoma patients, and several adenoma patients actually had subnormal levels. Among adenoma patients mean length of steroid replacement therapy was 16.8 +/- 9.1 months. However, 7 adenoma patients (25.9%) required greater than 24 months of exogenous steroids, and only 1 of these patients was subsequently weaned off steroid replacement. There were no recurrences among adenoma patients, although there was 1 perioperative death due to hypoglycemia. Ten (76.9%) carcinoma patients had recurrences at a mean followup of 33 months. The 3 and 5-year survival rates were 41.5 and 31.2%, respectively.

While presenting signs and symptoms and hormonal analysis may suggest benign or malignant disease, only tumor size and patient age are reliable preoperative indicators of adrenal adenoma versus adrenocortical carcinoma among patients with adrenal Cushing's syndrome. Surgery is curative for adenoma patients, but lifelong steroid replacement may be required. Survival remains poor among carcinoma patients.
