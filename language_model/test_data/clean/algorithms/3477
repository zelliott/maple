Segmentation and mapping of the human cerebral cortex from magnetic resonance (MR) images plays an important role in neuroscience and medicine. This paper describes a comprehensive approach for cortical reconstruction, flattening, and sulcal segmentation. Robustness to imaging artifacts and anatomical consistency are key achievements in an overall approach that is nearly fully automatic and computationally fast. Results demonstrating the application of this approach to a study of cortical thickness changes in aging are presented.
