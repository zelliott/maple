It is shown that grisms, a grating and prism combination, are a simple way to achieve chromatic control in 3D multi-plane imaging. A pair of grisms, whose separation can be varied, provide a collimated beam with a tuneable chromatic shear from a collimated polychromatic input. This simple control permits the correction of chromatic smearing in 3D imaging using off-axis Fresnel zone plates and improved control of the axial profile of a focussed spot in multi-photon experiments.
