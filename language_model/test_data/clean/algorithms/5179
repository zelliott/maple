In the presence of analyte-background interactions and a significant background signal, both second-order multivariate calibration and standard addition are required for successful analyte quantitation achieving the second-order advantage. This report discusses a modified second-order standard addition method, in which the test data matrix is subtracted from the standard addition matrices, and quantitation proceeds via the classical external calibration procedure. It is shown that this novel data processing method allows one to apply not only parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) and multivariate curve resolution-alternating least-squares (MCR-ALS), but also the recently introduced and more flexible partial least-squares (PLS) models coupled to residual bilinearization (RBL). In particular, the multidimensional variant N-PLS/RBL is shown to produce the best analytical results. The comparison is carried out with the aid of a set of simulated data, as well as two experimental data sets: one aimed at the determination of salicylate in human serum in the presence of naproxen as an additional interferent, and the second one devoted to the analysis of danofloxacin in human serum in the presence of salicylate.
