Public exposure to ionizing radiation or contamination of the environment by radioactivity engenders intense fear. The emotional and psychologic stresses resulting from exposure should be recognized and addressed early in a radiation incident. 3. Health care providers should understand the physics, chemistry, and biology of radiation to communicate effectively about it.
