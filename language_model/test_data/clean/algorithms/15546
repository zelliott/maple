The nature of the interaction between amino acids and cholesterol was shown by reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography (RP-TLC) in the presence of monovalent cations of different concentration. The degree of interaction between amino acids and cholesterol was affected by different salt solutions and by applying cholesterol to the chromatographic plates at higher concentration. The relative strength of interaction was determined by statistical evaluation of the results in each case. The objectives of the investigations were to study the retention behaviour of biologically active amino acids on alumina supports impregnated with cholesterol and to characterize the effects of monovalent cations on the interaction between amino acids and cholesterol.
