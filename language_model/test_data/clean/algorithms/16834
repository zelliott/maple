Human visual search is an everyday activity that enables humans to explore the real world. Given the visual input, during a visual search, it is necessary to select some aspects of input to shift the gaze to next target. The aim of the study is to develop a mathematical method able to evaluate the visual selection process during the execution of a high cognitively demanding task such as the trial making test part B (TMT). The TMT is a neuro-psychological instrument where numbers and letters should be connected to each other in numeric and alphabetic order. We adapted the TMT to an eye-tracking version, and we used a vector model, the "eight pointed star" (8PS), to discover how selection (fixations) guides next exploration (saccades) and how human top-down factors interact with bottom-up saliency. The results reported a trend to move away from the last fixations correlated to the number of distracters and the execution performance.
