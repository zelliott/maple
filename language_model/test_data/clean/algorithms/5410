The congener profile of samples contaminated with dioxin and dioxin-like compounds allows identifying sources of contamination. This article studies the statistical methods of congener profile analysis reported in the literature with respect to the reliability of obtained results. The performance of customary analysis methods regarding raw data transformation and applied TEF (toxic equivalency factor) values is discussed. In particular, the method of principal component analysis and k-means cluster is taken as an example and examined in detail. Reasons for occurring inconsistencies such as the dependence of results on raw data transformation and the disregard of measurement uncertainty are described, and it is shown that they also explain inconsistencies in other methods of cluster analysis such as hierarchical cluster analysis and neural networks. It is concluded that these methods cannot be employed to reach court-proof decisions, i.e. decisions which meet court evidentiary standards. An alternative approach to analyzing congener profiles based on mathematical statistics is briefly presented, allowing reliable, court-proof decisions.
