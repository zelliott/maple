Empirical knowledge suggests that neurological disorders are common in sub-Saharan Africa. The aims of our study were to assess the hospital-based prevalence of neurological disorders in a rural African setting and to suggest a systematic approach to disease classification. Of 8676 admissions (over a period of eight months) 740 patients (8.5%) were given a neurological diagnosis; cases were grouped according to diagnostic certainty. We suggest three major categories for neurological disorders (group 1=no diagnostic uncertainties; group 2=minor diagnostic uncertainties; group 3=major diagnostic uncertainties) with clinical implications.
