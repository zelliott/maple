Pneumonias are common, life threatening complications in immunodeficient patients. A rapid, targeted diagnosis and therapy are decisive for the course of the disease. The etiological spectrum is substantially broader than for immunocompetent patients. Important indications are provided by the type and intensity of the immunosuppression, gaps in the prophylactic concept and particular exposures. For diagnostic planning, high resolution computed tomogram of the thorax is necessary. The standard method for isolating the pathogen is flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage. Indications for invasive bioptic measures depend on the individual situation, the expected spectrum of pathogens as well as risk factors and adverse effects. Non-invasive antigen and PCR tests complement the diagnostic spectrum, especially for difficult to cultivate pathogens such as fungi and Herpes viruses. The selection of the initial, targeted antimicrobial therapy is based on guidelines. The treatment should be followed after obtaining the relevant microbiological data.
