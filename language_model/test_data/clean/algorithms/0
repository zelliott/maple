Most continent geriatric patients can be managed appropriately after a clinical assessment including a history, physical examination, urinalysis and culture, and simple tests of bladder function. A subgroup will benefit from urologic, gynecologic, and formal urodynamic evaluation. Algorithms described in this chapter are being developed and tested; these algorithms will make clinical assessment more practical and cost effective.
