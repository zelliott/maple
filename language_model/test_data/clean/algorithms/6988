The metabolites of pesticides can contaminate groundwater and pose a risk to human health when this water is used for drinking. This paper reports the results of a laboratory study on aldicarb and its main metabolites, aldicarb sulfone and aldicarb sulfoxide. Aldicarb and its metabolites showed Koc values (6-31) which were lower than that of atrazine (55), indicating that they are very mobile in soil. They are less persistent than atrazine (DT50 = 25 days), with DT50 values from less than 1 day and up to 12 days. Aldicarb behaved as a non-leacher, whereas its metabolites clearly showed the characteristics of leachers. Aged residue leaching experiments showed that aldicarb can occur at high concentrations in the leachate, together with its two metabolites. The leachate composition depends on the incubation time of the parent compound. Aldicarb and its metabolites can form various mixtures in groundwater on the basis of the time elapsing between the application of the insecticide and the first significant rainfall. This study confirms the characteristics of contaminants of aldicarb and especially its metabolites, as reported in the literature.
