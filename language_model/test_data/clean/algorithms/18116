The constitutional isomerisation of single dichlorobenzene molecules adsorbed on the surfaces of Ag(111) and Cu(111) between their meta- and para-isomers is induced and investigated by means of a low temperature scanning tunneling microscope. On both substrates similar isomerisation thresholds are found indicating that the excitation mechanism of this reaction does not depend significantly on the underlying substrate. The isomerisation threshold voltage of (170 +/- 7) meV most likely corresponds to excitation of a C-C stretch mode whose gas-phase energies we calculated ab initio to lie at 174 and 172 meV for meta- and para-isomers respectively. Though the reaction is found to be localized on the submolecular scale, it depends heavily on the second substituent both in terms of excitation energy and reaction outcome.
