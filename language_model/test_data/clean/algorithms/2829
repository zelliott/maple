Accurate monitoring and control of industrial bioprocess requires the knowledge of a great number of variables, being some of them not measurable with standard devices. To overcome this difficulty, software sensors can be used for on-line estimation of those variables and, therefore, its development is of paramount importance. An Asymptotic Observer was used for monitoring Escherichia coli fed-batch fermentations. Its performance was evaluated using simulated and experimental data. The results obtained showed that the observer was able to predict the biomass concentration profiles showing, however, less satisfactory results regarding the estimation of glucose and acetate concentrations. In comparison with the results obtained with an Extended Kalman Observer, the performance of the Asymptotic Observer in the fermentation monitoring was slightly better.
