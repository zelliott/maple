Screening of stably transfected cells on multi-well plates is most efficient when a maximum number of wells contain a single colony. The multinomial distribution has been used to derive a novel equation that relates the number of wells containing a specified number of cell-lines and the total number of viable cells loaded on the plate. To test its validity, Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected with a gene coding for the M2 muscarinic cholinergic receptor and screened on 96-well plates. The observed and predicted numbers of wells containing a single cell-line were indistinguishable. This approach therefore can be used to optimize the conditions for screening transfected cells.
