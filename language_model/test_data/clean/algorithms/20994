The aim of the trial was investigation of urethral function in women with urinary stress incontinence (USI) using the method of registration of urethral retro-resistance pressure (URRP) versus such parameters in healthy women and definition of this method reproducibility. All the participants of the trial (n = 54) were divided into two groups: group 1--healthy females (n = 19); group 2--USI women (n = 35). The protocol included physical examination, gynecological examination, laboratory tests, urodynamic examination with URRP assessment. Reproducibility of URRP was tested by a repeat test 2 weeks later in group 1 the results of which were comparable with the results of the first test. A comparative analysis of the findings showed that women with URRP under 40 cm H2O. suffer from USI in 100% cases while those with RURP over 100 cm H2O had no USI. URRP proved reproducible and can be used in preoperative examination in urogynecology. To confirm diagnostic value of this method further investigations should be made.
