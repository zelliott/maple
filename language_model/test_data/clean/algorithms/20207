Because deep venous thrombosis is clinically linked with pulmonary embolism and often treated similarly, we sought to assess the usefulness of obtaining bilateral lower extremity compression sonograms when findings on ventilation-perfusion lung scans indicate a low or indeterminate probability of pulmonary embolism. Demonstration of deep venous thrombosis would provide a rationale for treating both pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis.

Two hundred twenty-three consecutive patients with suspected pulmonary embolism had ventilation-perfusion lung scans and concurrent bilateral lower extremity compression sonograms; 34 also had pulmonary arteriography.

In 75 cases, the results of ventilation-perfusion lung scanning indicated an indeterminate probability of pulmonary embolism. Evidence of thrombosis was seen on sonograms in 11 of these 75. In the remaining 64, 17 underwent pulmonary arteriography and four (24%) had pulmonary embolism. Findings on lung scans indicated a low probability of pulmonary embolism in 70 of 223 patients. Evidence of thrombosis was seen on sonograms in 11 of these 70. Five of the remaining 59 underwent pulmonary arteriography and one (20%) had pulmonary embolism. According to the 1993 Medicare Fee Schedule, if all 145 patients whose lung scans were nondiagnostic had sonography and only those with normal sonograms had pulmonary arteriography, the professional and hospital charges would be $359,552. If all 145 had pulmonary arteriography without sonography, the charges would be $395,031.

If ventilation-perfusion lung scans indicate a low or an indeterminate probability of pulmonary embolism and bilateral lower extremity compression sonography is performed, only those patients with normal sonographic findings would need further study. Thus, 15% (22/145) of patients could be spared pulmonary arteriography, and the estimated savings in cost would be 9%.
