Metabolic control analysis (MCA) was developed to quantify how system variables are affected by parameter variations in a system. In addition, MCA can express the global properties of a system in terms of the individual catalytic steps, using connectivity and summation theorems to link the control coefficients to the elasticity coefficients. MCA was originally developed for steady-state analysis and not all summation theorems have been derived for dynamic systems. A method to determine time-dependent flux and concentration control coefficients for dynamic systems by expressing the time domain as a function of percentage progression through any arbitrary fixed interval of time is reported. Time-dependent flux and concentration control coefficients of dynamic systems, provided that they are evaluated in this novel way, obey the same summation theorems as steady-state flux and concentration control coefficients, respectively.
