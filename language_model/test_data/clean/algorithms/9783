In cone beam industrial computed tomography (ICT), it is often required to inspect the large object using flat detector. If traditional helical scanning is used, the field of view (FOV) is limited due to the size of flat detector. As an alternative, a dual helical cone-beam scanning is proposed in this paper. Before each helical scanning, x-ray source and flat detector are horizontally translated a given distance, and part of the object is covered by x-ray at each view angle. Then the object function is reconstructed by use of the improved helical FDK algorithm, which does not rebin projection data. Simulations validate that the images, which are reconstructed by proposed scanning mode and improved algorithm with small flat detector, are similar to those from the conventional helical scanning and FDK algorithm with large flat detector. The improved FDK algorithm is not sensitive to translation step. Furthermore, the proposed scanning mode can extend the radius of FOV up to at least 1.7 times.
