Left ventricular (LV) dysfunction caused by ischemia secondary to coronary artery disease results not only from cardiac myocyte death but also from stunning and hibernation, which are potentially reversible phenomena. Myocardial viability testing is often used in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy to predict recovery of contractile function after revascularization. Although several observational studies have supported the use of viability testing, the Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart failure (STICH) viability substudy challenged its role in clinical decision-making, as viability testing in this study did not predict differential outcomes based on treatment type, and there was a trend toward increased survival in patients with no viability who underwent revascularization. However, the results of the STICH trial have caused controversy because of limitations in study design and implementation. Randomized controlled trials using high-resolution modalities such as positron emission tomography or delayed hyperenhancement cardiac magnetic resonance are needed to determine the incremental benefits that revascularization may afford based on myocardial viability.
