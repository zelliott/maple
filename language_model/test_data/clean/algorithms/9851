We have carried out a dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) study of proton spins of UV-irradiated solid butanol containing phenol at 0.1-1%. By the aid of butyl free radicals produced by the photolysis, the butanol sample was dynamically polarized up to the polarization of 1.4+/-0.1% at 1.5 K and 1.2 T, which is about 4000 times larger than that at the thermal equilibrium at an ambient temperature. Unlike persistent free radicals such as nitroxy and trityl free radicals commonly used for DNP, the butyl free radicals immediately decay by melting. We propose that free radicals produced by UV-photolysis are applicable to the DNP-enhanced hyperpolarized liquid-state NMR (Ardenkjaer-Larsen et al. [6]). The hyperpolarization of the UV-irradiated samples should remain longer than that of the samples having persistent free radicals, because of the absence of the free radicals after the melting in the UV-irradiated samples.
