Relative real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) has become an important tool for quantifying changes in messenger RNA (mRNA) populations following differential development or stimulation of tissues or cells. However, the best methods for conducting such experiments and analyzing the resultant data remain an issue of discussion. In this report we describe an appropriate experimental methodology and the computer programs necessary to generate a meaningful statistical analysis of the combined biological and experimental variability in such experiments. Specifically, logarithmic transformations of raw fluorescence data from the log-linear portion of real-time PCR growth curves for both target and reference genes are analyzed using a SAS/STAT Mixed Procedure program specifically designed to give a point estimate of the relative expression ratio of the target gene with associated 95% confidence interval. The program code is open-source and is printed in the text.
