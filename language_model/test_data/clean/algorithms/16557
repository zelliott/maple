The mechanosensory hair cells of many auditory receptor organs are tuned by an electrical resonance that increases their responses to stimulation over a narrow band of frequencies. The small oscillations of membrane potential characteristic of this phenomenon have previously been detectable only through intracellular electrode measurements, which are laborious and preclude analysis at the level of an entire sensory organ. We used a voltage-sensitive dye to image hair-cell electrical resonance in an intact preparation of the bullfrog's sacculus, a receptor organ sensitive to low-frequency seismic and auditory stimuli. Imaging revealed distinct populations of hair cells whose resonant response varied with the frequency of transepithelial electrical stimulation. Most of the hair cells in the saccular epithelium in vitro were electrically tuned to stimulation at 25-50 Hz. The frequency dependence of the fluorescence signal was sensitive to pharmacological blockade of large-conductance Ca(2+)-sensitive K(+) channels and to enzymatic digestion. At an elevated concentration of Ca(2+), we observed transient fluorescence signals that probably represented action potentials. The stroboscopic imaging and analysis techniques described here present a general approach for studying subthreshold oscillations in electrically excitable cells.
