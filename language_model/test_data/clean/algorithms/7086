A method for planning implants of 125I seeds has been developed. The treatment dose prescribed by the physician is delivered to the tumour, as uniformly as possible, by a minimal number of seeds. The number of seeds and their locations are derived by requesting that, at any point in the tumour, the dose will be equal to or higher than the prescribed dose. As a result, the total implanted activity is lower for small volumes and higher for large volumes, relative to other implantation protocols which derive their planning from requests on the minimum peripheral dose. Results obtained from computer simulations performed on different tumour shapes and volumes, show a linear dependence between the total implanted activity and the tumour volume. The total activity does not depend on the shape of the tumour. A description of the algorithm of our procedure and a detailed example of its application are presented.
