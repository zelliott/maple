To test the glaucoma-discriminating ability of a new method for detecting local ganglion cell loss using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT).

This study included 58 glaucomatous and 48 healthy eyes from Japanese subjects. Combined thickness of the ganglion cell layer and inner plexus layer (GCIPL) was measured on a macular cube scan in Cirrus HD-OCT. Average GCIPL thickness within a macular elliptical annulus and minimum GCIPL thickness on 360 spokes extending from the inner to the outer radius of the elliptical annulus were calculated. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AROC) to discriminate between healthy eyes and early (mean deviation [MD], ≥-6 dB)/advanced (MD, <-6 dB) glaucomatous were compared between parameters.

Forty-three were normal-tension glaucoma, and 15 were high-tension glaucoma. The mean minimum GCIPL thickness was 77.0 μm in healthy eyes and 60.6 μm in glaucomatous eyes (P < 0.001). For the intersession repeatability, the coefficients of variation for average GCIPL and minimum GCIPL were 0.98 and 1.85 in glaucomatous eyes, and 0.89 and 1.85 in healthy eyes, respectively. Minimum GCIPL thickness AROC (0.896) was significantly higher (P = 0.0062) than average GCIPL thickness (0.821) for early glaucoma, whereas minimum GCIPL AROC (0.991) was comparable (P = 0.103) to average GCIPL (0.964) for advanced glaucoma. The minimum GCIPL thickness AROC was comparable (P = 0.861) to average circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (cpRNFL) thickness (0.890) for early glaucoma.

In Japanese patients with 74.1% of normal-tension glaucoma, the minimum GCIPL on spokes may be useful for detecting early glaucoma.
