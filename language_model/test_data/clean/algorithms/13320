The decay time of luminescence from neutral nitrogen-vacancy (NV(0)) centres in synthetic diamond is reported. The intrinsic luminescence lifetime of NV (0) is measured as τ(r) = 19 ± 2 ns. Neutral substitutional nitrogen atoms (N(S)(0)) are shown to quench luminescence from NV(0) by dipole-dipole resonant energy transfer at a rate such that the transfer time would equal τ(r) if one (N(S)(0)) atom was ~3 nm from the NV(0). In chemical-vapour-deposited diamonds grown with a small nitrogen content, that are brown as a result of vacancy-cluster defects, the decay time of NV(0) equals τ(r) in the as-grown material. However, after annealing at ≥1700 °C to remove the brown colour, luminescence from the NV(0) centres is severely quenched. This effect is suggested to be a result of the destruction of NV(0) centres and the creation of new NV(0) centres localized in vacancy-rich regions of the crystals.
