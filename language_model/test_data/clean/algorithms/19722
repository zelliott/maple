Calibration of devices measuring transepidermal water loss (TEWL) is in intensive discussion. Comparative studies revealed that comparable measuring systems, e.g. open and closed chamber systems, do not always deliver the same results, even when expressing the measured values in SI units, namely in g/m(2)/h. Therefore, adequate and reliable calibration procedures need to be established. We were able to test the reliability of a multi-step calibration algorithm for an open chamber system such as Tewameter TM 300. In order to achieve reliable measurements, the maintenance of stable microclimate conditions without air turbulences is mandatory. The TEWL values should be compared with those determined gravimetrically on heated skin simulators. The reproducibility of the results is warranted by consecutive measurements on different adjacent spots of a defined area. Preheating of the probe sensors is an effective approach for shortening the measuring time and gaining a rapid steady-state. The accurate calibration of the probe can be checked under laboratory conditions any time. The critical point of the calibration and ultimately the accuracy of in vivo measurements maintain the steady functional capacity of the probes during the entire duration of continuous studies. The studied calibration procedure ensures these requirements.
