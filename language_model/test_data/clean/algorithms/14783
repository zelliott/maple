A mobile calibration technique for three-dimensional vision is presented. In this method, vision parameters are computed automatically by approximation networks built based on the position of a camera and image processing of a laser line. The networks also perform three-dimensional visualization. In the proposed system, the setup geometry can be modified online, whereby an online re-calibration is performed based on data provided by the network and the required modifications of extrinsic and intrinsic parameters are thus determined, overcoming any calibration limitations caused by the modification procedure. The mobile calibration also avoids procedures involving references, which are used in traditional online re-calibration methods. The proposed mobile calibration thus improves the accuracy and performance of the three-dimensional vision because online data of calibrated references are not passed on to the vision system. This work represents a contribution to the field of online re-calibration, as verified by a comparison with the results based on lighting methods, which are calibrated and re-calibrated via perspective projection. Processing time is also studied.
