As scoliosis requires a global and local 3D examination of the spine in standing position, stereoradiography appears as one of the most adequate 3D imaging tool for it diagnosis. Our purpose was to increase the geometry definition of the stereoradiographic reconstruction to obtain morpho-realistic models and to validate them using 41 dry vertebrae. Our results propose 2000 points 3D personalised models without any loss of accuracy in comparison to previous studies.
