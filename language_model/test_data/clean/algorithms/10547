The suicide rate among children and adolescents has increased worldwide over the past few decades, and many who attempt suicide are first seen at EDs. At Childrens Hospital Boston (CHB), an algorithm-the Risk of Suicidality Clinical Practice Algorithm-has been developed to ensure evidence-based care supported by best practice guidelines. The authors of this article provide an overview of pediatric suicide and suicide attempts; describe screening, assessment, and interventions used at CHB; and discuss the nursing implications. An illustrative case study is also provided.
