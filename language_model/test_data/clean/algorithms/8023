The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of reconstruction parameters on the measurement of global left ventricular (LV) volume and define the appropriate reconstruction parameters when using the ordered subsets expectation maximization (OS-EM) method and 3D OS-EM (Astonish) method including the collimator distance response (CDR) recovery (RC) for myocardial perfusion SPECT study.

An anthropomorphic torso phantom with a 56 ml LV part was used. The LV volume was calculated with QPS software by the Update number (iteration number x subsets number) of OS-EM and 3D OS-EM (Astonish).

LV volumes calculated with OS-EM and Astonish without attenuation and scatter corrections corresponded to the true obtained by the Update number about 32 times and 24 times when using the OS-EM and Astonish method with attenuation and scatter corrections, respectively. However, LV volumes have changed greatly in the Astonish method according to the change in the Update number. Appropriate numbers of iterations and subsets are the measurement of global LV volumes, especially when using the OS-EM algorithm with RC.
