This study aimed at determining whether non attenuation corrected (NAC) positron emission tomography (PET) images, in addition to the attenuation corrected (AC) PET images, should be included in the interpretation of fluoro-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG-PET) images in patients with lymphoma. The study included 58 patients, 35 males 23 females, mean age 55+/-16 years. There were 64 superficial and 170 deep lymph node (LN) lesions. Lesion detection, uptake intensity using a three-point scale (1-mild, 2-moderate, 3- intense) and overall clarity of each lesion were compared on both PET images. Our results showed that the detection rate for superficial LN was 100% for NAC-PET and 98.4% for AC-PET images. The degree of (18)F-FDG uptake (intense, moderate and mild uptake) was 56.3%, 31.3% and 12.5% for NAC-PET images and 23.4%, 34.4% and 40.6% for AC-PET images, respectively. The overall image clarity was significantly in favor of NAC compared to AC-PET images (89% vs 20%, P<0.01). For deep LN, lesions, detection rate was for NAC and AC-PET images 95.3% and 99.4%, respectively. (18)F-FDG uptake intensity (intense, moderate and mild uptake) was 42.4%, 27.1% and 25.9% for NAC and 52.4%, 43% and 4.1% for AC-PET images, respectively. The overall image clarity for AC-PET images was superior to NAC-PET images (81.8% vs 53% P=0.01). In conclusion, NAC-PET images appeared to be superior to AC-PET images in detecting superficial LN lesions. AC-PET images are superior to NAC-PET images with regard to the deep-seated LN lesions. Therefore, AC and NAC-PET images are complimentary to each other and require to be reviewed together in the evaluation of patients with lymphoma.
