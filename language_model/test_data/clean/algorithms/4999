We derive the operating characteristics of three-dimensional array-based testing algorithms for case identification in the presence of testing error. The operating characteristics investigated include efficiency (i.e., expected number of tests per specimen) and error rates (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values). The methods are illustrated by comparing the proposed algorithms with previously studied hierarchical and two-dimensional array algorithms for detecting recent HIV infections in North Carolina. Our results indicate that three-dimensional array-based algorithms can be more efficient and accurate than previously proposed algorithms in settings with test error and low prevalence.
