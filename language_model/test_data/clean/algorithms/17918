In recent years, confocal laser scanning microscopy has been developed into a non-invasive tool to probe intra-particle profiles of protein in chromatographic adsorbents. A necessary prerequisite when using this technique lies in the labeling of proteins with fluorescent probes. The quality of the obtained results is thus strongly dependent on the probes used, its sensitivity on experimental parameters and the change of protein characteristics upon binding. In this review, the fundamental issues when using fluorescent probes are described, before giving a critical evaluation on published literature in the field of confocal laser scanning microscopy for the analysis of chromatographic principles.
