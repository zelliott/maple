A two-stage ventricular beat 'associative' classification procedure is described. The first stage separates typical beats from extrasystoles on the basis of area and polarity rules. At the second stage, the extrasystoles are classified in self-organised cluster formations of adjacent shape parameter values. This approach avoids the use of threshold values for discrimination between ectopic beats of different shapes, which could be critical in borderline cases. A pattern shape feature conventionally called a 'fractal number', in combination with a polarity attribute, was found to be a good criterion for waveform evaluation. An additional advantage of this pattern classification method is its good computational efficiency, which affords the opportunity to implement it in real-time systems.
