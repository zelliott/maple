There is considerable interest in performing free-breathing acquisitions of the heart in order to obtain high-quality images without the need for multiple, long breathholds. In this article a 3D motion-correction method is described that is based on image registration of in-plane data and through-plane slice tracking. A number of fast radial undersampled images are acquired, each of which is free of motion artifacts. Initially, in-plane translational and rotational motion between each image was corrected before combining the data to give a fully sampled image. At the next stage, correction of in-plane deformation, in addition to translations and rotations, was performed in the image domain. Through-plane translational motion was compensated using a navigator echo to move the acquisition plane. Using this method, information on the motion of the heart was captured at the same time as acquiring the image data. No motion model, assumptions about the motion, or training data are required. The method is demonstrated on phantom data and cardiac images acquired on free-breathing volunteers.
