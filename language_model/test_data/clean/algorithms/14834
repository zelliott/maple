It is well known that the periodic cycle {x(n)} of a periodically forced nonlinear difference equation is attenuant (resonant) if av(x(n)) < av(K(n))(av(x(n)) > av(K(n))),where {K ( n )} is the carrying capacity of the environment and av(t(n)) = (1/p)∑(p−1) (i=0) ti (arithmetic mean of the p-periodic cycle {t ( n )}). In this article, we extend the concept of attenuance and resonance of periodic cycles using the geometric mean for the average of a periodic cycle. We study the properties of the periodically forced nonautonomous delay Beverton-Holt model x(n+1) = r(n)x(n)/1 + (r(n−l) − 1)x(n−k)/K(n−k), n= 0, 1, . . . , where {K ( n )} and {r ( n )} are positive p-periodic sequences; (K ( n )>0, r ( n )>1) as well as k and l are nonnegative integers. We will show that for all positive solutions {x ( n )} of the previous equation lim sup (n→∞) (∏(n−1)(i=0)xi)(1/n) ≤ ((∏(p−1)(i=0)ri)(1/p) − 1)(∏(p−1)(i=0)(ri − 1))(−1/p)(∏(p−1)(i=0)Ki)(1/p). In particular, in the case where {x(n)} is a p-periodic solution of the above equation (assuming that such solution exists) and r ( n )=r>1, the periodic cycle is g-attenuant, that is (∏(p−1)(i=0)x(i))(1/p)<(∏(p−1)(i=0)K(i))(p−1) Surprisingly, the obtained results show that the delays k and l do not play any role.
