Oxygen status from both arterial and mixed venous blood was analyzed by reliable methods in 39 cirrhotic patients. These measured data were checked with computed oxygen parameters by new calculation algorithms. Calculated oxygen contents were higher than directly measured values but there was a highly significant correlation between them. Calculated and measured 2,3-DPG mean values were not significantly different but there was no correlation between them. A large difference was observed between measured and computed evaluation of oxygen-hemoglobin affinity without correlation between P50. In hyperkinetic patients, no correlation was observed between 'compensation factor' and the increase of cardiac index. So, in these patients the new iterative equations were not valid to determine traditional oxygen parameters from only Po2 and So2 arterial measurements. Moreover the new oxygenation parameters appeared frankly inadequate.
