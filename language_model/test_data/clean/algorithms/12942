Monte Carlo method is applied for simulation of 2D optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of skin-like model. Layer boundaries in skin model feature curved shape which agrees with physiological structure of human skin. The effect of coherence properties of probing radiation on OCT image formation and speckles in the detected OCT signal is considered. The developed model is employed for image simulation both for conventional and polarization dependent time-domain OCT modalities. Simulation of polarized OCT signal is performed using vector approach developed previously for modeling of electromagnetic field transfer in turbid media.
