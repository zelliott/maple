MAPSI (Management and Analysis for Polyketide Synthase Type I) has been developed to offer computational analysis methods to detect type I PKS (polyketide synthase) gene clusters in genome sequences. MAPSI provides a genome analysis component, which detects PKS gene clusters by identifying domains in proteins of a genome. MAPSI also contains databases on polyketides and genome annotation data, as well as analytic components such as new PKS assembly and domain analysis. The polyketide data and analysis component are accessible through Web interfaces and are displayed with diverse information. MAPSI, which was developed to aid researchers studying type I polyketides, provides diverse components to access and analyze polyketide information and should become a very powerful computational tool for polyketide research. The system can be extended through further studies of factors related to the biological activities of polyketides.
