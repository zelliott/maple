The sensitivity of (31)P MRS can be increased using higher magnetic fields, but also by using (1)H to (31)P polarization transfer techniques where the sensitivity is determined by the polarization of the proton spins and thus the signal-to-noise per unit time is unaffected by the slow T(1) relaxation properties of the (31)P spins. This implies that (31)P spins can be manipulated during the T(1) relaxation of the (1)H spins without affecting the signal-to-noise of the (1)H to (31)P polarization transferred spins. It is shown here that by combining (1)H to (31)P polarization transfer with a direct (31)P detection sequence in one repetition time, one can gain more signal-to-noise per unit of time as compared to a polarization transfer sequence alone. Proof of principle was demonstrated by phantom measurements and additionally the method was applied to the human calf muscle and to the human breast in vivo at 7 T.
