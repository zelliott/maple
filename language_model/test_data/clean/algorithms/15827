From January 1988 to December 1989, 920 patients with pigmented cutaneous lesions, clinically diagnosed as suspected or certain cutaneous melanoma (CM), underwent excision under local anaesthesia as outpatients. Histological examination confirmed CM in 135 patients. Patients in this group whose initial excision was for biopsy purposes only (extending 1-2 mm beyond the lesion margin) underwent a subsequent radical excision (extending greater than or equal to 10 mm from the neoplastic margin). The second resection was carried out within 10 to 15 days of the first, on an outpatient basis if the thickness of the CM was less than or equal to 2 mm, and in hospital if it was greater than 2 mm. The clinical diagnosis proved correct in 88 cases (65%) where exeresis was the definitive surgical treatment. Outpatient surgery seems to be the best method for easing a workload dominated by the need to examine a growing number of pigmented skin lesions, without altering the prognosis for CM.
