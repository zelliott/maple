A simple neuronal network model of the baroreceptor reflex is analyzed. From a control perspective, the analysis suggests a dynamic scheduled control mechanisms by which the baroreflex may perform regulation of the blood pressure. The main objectives of this work are to investigate the static and dynamic response characteristics of the single neurons and the network, to analyze the neuromimetic dynamic scheduled control function of the model, and to apply the algorithm to nonlinear process control problems. The dynamic scheduling activity of the network is exploited in two control architectures. Control structure I is drawn directly from the present model of the baroreceptor reflex. An application of this structure for level control in a conical tank is described. Control structure II employs an explicit set point to determine the feedback error. The performance of this control structure is illustrated on a nonlinear continuous stirred tank reactor with van de Vusse kinetics. The two case studies validate the dynamic scheduled control approach for nonlinear process control applications.
