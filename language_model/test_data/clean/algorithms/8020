Psoriasis is a chronic, genetically determined and immunomediated inflammatory skin disease that affects 2%-3% of the Caucasian population. Psoriatic arthritis (PsA), which occurs in up to one-third of patients with psoriasis, has a heterogeneous pattern expressed by various manifestations, including mono-oligoarthritis, an erosive and destructive polyarthritis indistinguishable from rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and spondyloarthropathy with axial involvement or enthesitis. Early detection of inflamed joints or axial involvement in patients with PsA is important in order to reduce inflammation and prevent joint destruction, deformity, and functional disability. The treatment of moderate-severe PsA has tended to include the same disease modifying antirheumatic drugs used to treat RA, but there is much less evidence supporting their efficacy and essentially none demonstrating that they slow radiographic joint destruction in PsA. A number of clinical trials have shown that tumor necrosis factor antagonists are generally safe and efficacious in the treatment of PsA, and can inhibit the progression of radiographic damage.
