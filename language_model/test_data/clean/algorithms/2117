The need to perform a detailed work-up of microscopic hematuria is based on the following set of questions: Does the history or physical examination findings suggest systemic or renal disease? Is the patient able to acidify and concentrate urine? Is proteinuria present? Do other family members have hematuria or other renal problems? Does the microscopic analysis show casts, crystals, or WBCs? Are the RBCs eumorphic or dysmorphic? Using this scheme of questions, most children do not require laboratory tests or radiographic studies. In the case of gross or macroscopic hematuria, the initial evaluation may require only a urine culture, urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio, and renal and bladder sonography or a very detailed evaluation for renal parenchymal disease, stones, tumors, or anatomic abnormalities. In these instances, consultation with a pediatric nephrologist, urologist, or both is necessary.
