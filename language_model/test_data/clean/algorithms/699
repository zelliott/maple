The purpose of this study was to explore methods of determining an appropriate caseload for mental health case managers.

Seven factors that may impinge on case manager performance and impact on caseload were identified, having reference to published literature and service practice in Victoria and Queensland. The advantages and disadvantages of including these factors in a caseload index were evaluated.

Three caseload index methodologies are presented. Each method makes use of different data and has advantages and disadvantages. There is a trade-off between simplicity and ease of application and the comprehensive use of relevant information. Methods vary in their implications for service efficiency and equity in workload distribution.

Caseload is a key issue in service planning and staff management. Factors that have the potential to contribute to caseload can be readily identified. However, there is likely to be disagreement as to the weight assigned to any factor and the approach taken may depend on the purpose and context of the caseload calculation. A great deal more research is required to provide an empirical basis for algorithms used in caseload calculation.
