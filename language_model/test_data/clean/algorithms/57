We describe a noncontact profile correction technique for quantitative, wide-field optical measurement of tissue absorption (microa) and reduced scattering (micros) coefficients, based on geometric correction of the sample's Lambertian (diffuse) reflectance intensity. Because the projection of structured light onto an object is the basis for both phase-shifting profilometry and modulated imaging, we were able to develop a single instrument capable of performing both techniques. In so doing, the surface of the three-dimensional object could be acquired and used to extract the object's optical properties. The optical properties of flat polydimethylsiloxane (silicone) phantoms with homogenous tissue-like optical properties were extracted, with and without profilometry correction, after vertical translation and tilting of the phantoms at various angles. Objects having a complex shape, including a hemispheric silicone phantom and human fingers, were acquired and similarly processed, with vascular constriction of a finger being readily detectable through changes in its optical properties. Using profilometry correction, the accuracy of extracted absorption and reduced scattering coefficients improved from two- to ten-fold for surfaces having height variations as much as 3 cm and tilt angles as high as 40 deg. These data lay the foundation for employing structured light for quantitative imaging during surgery.
