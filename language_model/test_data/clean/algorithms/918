As a result of an analysis of data relating tissue response to radiation absorbed dose the ICRU has recommended a target for accuracy of +/- 5 for dose delivery in radiation therapy. This is a difficult overall objective to achieve because of the many steps that make up a course of radiotherapy. The calculation of absorbed dose is only one of the steps and so to achieve an overall accuracy of better than +/- 5% the accuracy in dose calculation must be better yet. The physics behind the problem is sufficiently complicated so that no exact method of calculation has been found and consequently approximate solutions must be used. The development of computer algorithms for this task involves the search for better and better approximate solutions. To achieve the desired target of accuracy a fairly sophisticated calculation procedure must be used. Only when this is done can we hope to further improve our knowledge of the way in which tissues respond to radiation treatments.
