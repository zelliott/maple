Therapeutic options for blunt hepatic trauma include both non-operative and operative management. We have reviewed our experience of the management of blunt hepatic trauma, from non-operative to liver transplantation. A total of 72 patients with blunt hepatic injury observed at the first surgical unit of Padua in a 3-year period (1998-2000) were analysed; we also included a patient who had a liver transplant in 1993 for severe liver trauma. Twenty-nine patients (39.7%) were treated conservatively, with a 93% success rate; 60.3% were treated surgically. Suture hepatorraphy was the most common procedure performed (52.3%). Advantages of non-operative management in our experience were the reduced need for transfusion (1.1U versus 4.3U) with 92% of patients not needing transfusion, and a reduced stay in the intensive care unit; there was no liver-related mortality. The overall morbidity in surgical patients was 30%, with 16% liver-related complications. Twelve surgical patients (27.2%) died, with a liver-related mortality of 18.2%. A large number of patients may present with an associated endo-abdominal injury, even in low-grade liver trauma, requiring rapid laparotomy. In high-grade hepatic trauma, the evolution toward liver failure is an indication for liver transplantation.
