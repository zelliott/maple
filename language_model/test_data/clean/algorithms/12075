Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the thorax with three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and functional quantification was evaluated as a tool for structure-function evaluation of chest-wall mechanics. Good agreement was found between the corresponding spirometric and MR imaging values of lung volumes. Fast MR imaging of the thorax with 3D reconstruction should improve the ability to evaluate the inspiratory pump in clinical and research investigations.
