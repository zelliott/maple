The accuracy of ultrasound (US) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 363 patients with cirrhosis (C) and a clinical suspicion of HCC was assessed. The ultrasonographic patterns of HCC and their relationship with AFP values were analyzed. Echographic patterns were distributed as follows: 47 patients had sonodense lesions; 30 patients had hypoechoic lesions; 47 had mixed-pattern lesions, and in four patients focal dilated intrahepatic bile ducts were demonstrated. The sensitivity of US was 90%; specificity was 93.3%. Serum AFP level greater than or equal to 500 ng/ml (RIA) was the first clue to the diagnosis in 71 patients (48.6%); specificity was 100%. In 28 patients AFP levels became significantly elevated during follow-up after US detection of HCC. No relationship between echo pattern and serum AFP levels was demonstrated. An algorithm for diagnosis of HCC is proposed.
