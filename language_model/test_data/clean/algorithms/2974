Several algorithms for measuring the cortical thickness in the human brain from MR image volumes have been described in the literature, the majority of which rely on fitting deformable models to the inner and outer cortical surfaces. However, the constraints applied during the model fitting process in order to enforce spherical topology and to fit the outer cortical surface in narrow sulci, where the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) channel may be obscured by partial voluming, may introduce bias in some circumstances, and greatly increase the processor time required. In this paper we describe an alternative, voxel based technique that measures the cortical thickness using inversion recovery anatomical MR images. Grey matter, white matter and CSF are identified through segmentation, and edge detection is used to identify the boundaries between these tissues. The cortical thickness is then measured along the local 3D surface normal at every voxel on the inner cortical surface. The method was applied to 119 normal volunteers, and validated through extensive comparisons with published measurements of both cortical thickness and rate of thickness change with age. We conclude that the proposed technique is generally faster than deformable model-based alternatives, and free from the possibility of model bias, but suffers no reduction in accuracy. In particular, it will be applicable in data sets showing severe cortical atrophy, where thinning of the gyri leads to points of high curvature, and so the fitting of deformable models is problematic.
