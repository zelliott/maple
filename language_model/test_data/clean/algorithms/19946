This paper concerns the modelling of an accumulator used in industrial elastic web processing plant to allow changing material roll while the rest of the line remains at a constant web velocity. A nonlinear model of a motor actuated accumulator is first summarized. This model is derived from the physical relationships describing web tension and velocity dynamics in each web span of this accumulator. A linear model is deduced from the nonlinear one around a working point for frequency domain analysis. Thus the effect of some mechanical accumulator parameter variations are analyzed. In a second part, multi-model industrial PI controllers, adjusted with evolutionary algorithm on our realistic nonlinear model are compared with multi-model Hâˆž controllers. Both controllers allow good robustness against mechanical parameter variations.
