The purpose of this study was to determine whether a simple ECG algorithm could be developed for predicting susceptibility to ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT) as defined by sustained spontaneous or inducible VT. Two different QT dispersion algorithms were determined by the difference between the longest and shortest QT interval measured in three orthogonal leads (I, aVF, V1; QTD3), and at least 11 of 12 leads (QTD12) from the 12-lead ECG. These QT dispersion algorithms were investigated (with and without the QRS duration from the 12-lead ECG) and compared to the signal-averaged ECG (SAECG) in order to determine their sensitivity and specificity for detecting VT. Only patients who underwent SAECG and were referred for programmed electrical stimulation were included in this study. A positive SAECG was defined by filtered QRS duration > 114 ms, and/or low amplitude signal duration > 38 ms, and/or root mean square voltage in the last 40 ms of < 20 microV. Sixty patients were enrolled in this study with a mean age of 63 +/- 2 years. Fifty-five percent of the patients had coronary artery disease. A simple ECG algorithm consisting of the sum of QTD3 plus the QRS duration had a sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 63%, respectively, wheras the SAECG had a sensitivity and specificity of 60% and 63%, respectively (P = 0.022). We conclude that a simple ECG algorithm is more sensitive than the SAECG for predicting VT. This algorithm combines two easily measured variables obtained from the 12-lead ECG, and can easily be performed without expensive computer equipment.
