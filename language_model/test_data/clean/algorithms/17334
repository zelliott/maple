The existing low and high temperature theories of methyl NMR are not linked because two conditions imposed on state functions in the low temperature theory are not compatible with the classical rotations on which the high temperature theory is based. The conditions do not occur in a geometrical theory of quantum phenomena in which particles and waves have separate roles. When applied to methyl dynamics, this theory covers the whole temperature range.
