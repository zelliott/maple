Peak instantaneous power is a prognostic index of LV function but is difficult to measure. It is relatively load independent when corrected by preload (EDV2). Easier to acquire power estimates have been proposed--including mean and simplified power. These require only echo Doppler flow and cuff pressures, but their relationship to invasively derived results has not been studied. Using a well-validated numerical model of the cardiovascular system, different estimates of power were compared for varying preload, afterload, and contractility. All power results were divided by EDV2. Estimates of power correlate with peak power over a wide range of physiology. Corrected power estimates were independent of preload and afterload, but predictably increased with contractility. Different estimates of preload corrected power can be derived from non-invasively obtained variables and correlate with corrected peak instantaneous power.
