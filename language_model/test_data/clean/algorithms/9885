An experimental study of some assorted glycerol properties is carried out in order to determine, under high static pressure, the glycerol nonlinearity parameter B/A against temperature by a modified isentropic method. The static pressure and temperature ranges exploited in this experimental investigation, of various glycerol properties, are extended respectively from 0.1 to 100 MPa and from 10 to 100 degrees C. The static pressure step of two consecutive measurements is 10 MPa and the temperature step is 10 degrees C. The measured values show that, in glycerol, the density rho(0) and the infinitesimal ultrasonic wave velocity c(0) increase monotonically with the imposed static pressure and decrease monotonically with temperature. The present investigation shows that the nonlinearity parameter B/A is a function of the imposed static pressure and temperature. The accuracy of the measured B/A values is estimated at about +/-2%.
