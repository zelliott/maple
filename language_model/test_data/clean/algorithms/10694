The International Consensus Panel on T1 bladder tumors markers reviewed the subject from a clinical perspective. From diagnosis to treatment decisions, what are the important issues in the management of a new patient? The assessment of prognostic factors for progression requires optimal resection and documentation. The role of immediate adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy after resection remains controversial. How often should the upper tract be assessed for tumor recurrence? The decision on whether to attempt bladder conservation with intravesical therapy or to perform a cystectomy is the most difficult issue in the management of superficial bladder cancer today. Finally, what therapies exist if initial intravesical bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin fails to eradicate the disease or prevent recurrence? The panel thoroughly explored all these subjects and has made recommendations with supporting evidence.
