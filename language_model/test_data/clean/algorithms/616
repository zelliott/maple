To compare the survival, morbidity, and cost of treating women with intermediate risk endometrial cancer with postoperative vaginal cuff brachytherapy versus observation followed by treatment for vaginal recurrence.

A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed comparing two treatment strategies for intermediate risk endometrial cancer (Stage IC, IG3, II-tumors limited to the uterus with greater than 50% myometrial invasion or poor differentiation or cervical metastasis). All patients undergo hysterectomy, oophorectomy, and lymphadenectomy: strategy 1-postoperative vaginal cuff brachytherapy, strategy 2-observation. Strategy 2 patients who develop vaginal recurrence undergo diagnostic work-up followed by teletherapy and brachytherapy. All six principles of cost-effectiveness analysis were employed. Importantly, actual payer costs were evaluated, not charges.

Although the treatment for vaginal cuff recurrence is expensive, since only 8% of patients develop a vaginal recurrence, there was a 31% decreased cost by not treating patients with postoperative low-dose rate brachytherapy (strategy 2). Also, although the complication rate for teletherapy is greater than brachytherapy, since only 8% of patients develop a vaginal recurrence and require teletherapy, projected complication rates for the two strategies are similar. Survival would be decreased 3% by withholding postoperative brachytherapy (strategy 2). With postoperative high-dose rate brachytherapy (strategy 1), the cost per life saved would be 38,764 US dollars.

Using a cost-effectiveness analysis, we have shown that withholding postoperative brachytherapy for patients with intermediate risk endometrial cancer results in a 31% decrease in cost, has a similar radiation complication rate, and results in a 3% decrease in survival.
