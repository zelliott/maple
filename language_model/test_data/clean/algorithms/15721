The availability of efficacious oral drugs has radically changed the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to erectile dysfunction. Complicated examinations as well as invasive treatment options have been widely abandoned. Instead the management of impotent men has become much more pragmatic and focused on the symptom. Consequently only a minority of impotent men needs to be referred to an urologist, which makes the therapy of erectile dysfunction increasingly attractive for general practitioners. However, successful treatment first of all still needs time and a genuine interest in the field of erectile dysfunction. In this article a reasonable diagnostic evaluation of impotent patients in general practice is described. Furthermore indication and use of little or non-invasive therapies are discussed.
