An algorithm is given in order to quantify the similarity of a couple's test profile in the Giessen-Test as concerns that 16 typical test profiles discovered by Brähler and Brähler (1993). The German Giessen-Test is a personality-inventory based on psychoanalysis. The Euklidian distance was chosen as a measuring unit. The identification of that typical test profile to which any couple belongs succeeds very easily, a task which is otherwise only possible with difficulty. However, any allocation is merely for reasons of description, not based on statistical decisions. As a special service, the respective computer programme is placed at everyone's disposal.
