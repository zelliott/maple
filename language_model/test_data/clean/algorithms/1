Current technology for monitoring and analyzing the ST segment allows for accurate description of ST-segment deviation, which in most cases is a valid measure of myocardial ischemia. In this article, the authors describe a new method that utilizes microprocessor analysis of the electrocardiogram to detect ST-segment deviation in ambulatory subjects. This technique results in the ability to characterize the total ischemic burden over long periods of time and to intervene acutely in order to treat myocardial ischemia and possibly to prevent complications of coronary artery disease.
