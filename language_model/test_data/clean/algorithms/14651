In this work we propose a spatial point process (SPP) approach to improve the detection accuracy of clustered microcalcifications (MCs) in mammogram images. The conventional approach to MC detection has been to first detect the individual MCs in an image independently, which are subsequently grouped into clusters. Our proposed approach aims to exploit the spatial distribution among the different MCs in a mammogram image (i.e. MCs tend to appear in small clusters) directly during the detection process. We model the MCs by a marked point process (MPP) in which spatially neighboring MCs interact with each other. The MCs are then simultaneously detected through maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of the model parameters associated with the MPP process. The proposed approach was evaluated with a dataset of 141 clinical mammograms from 66 cases, and the results show that it could yield improved detection performance compared to a recently proposed support vector machine (SVM) detector. In particular, the proposed approach achieved a sensitivity of about 90% with the FP rate at around 0.5 clusters per image, compared to about 83% for the SVM; the performance of the proposed approach was also demonstrated to be more stable over different compositions of the test images.
