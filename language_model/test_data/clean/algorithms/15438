Vanadium nitride is an important metallurgical additive and a good electrode material molecule. It is necessary to understand its intrinsic microstructure for better applications. Four groups of known experimental transition data of low-lying rotational quantum states and the analytical formula developed recently by Sun group are used to study the R(ee), P(ee), R(ff) and P(ff)-branch emission spectra of the (0, 0) band of the e(1)Π-a(1)Δ system of VN molecule respectively. The results not only reproduce all known experimental spectral lines accurately, but also generate valid data of the unknown spectral lines up to J=80 that may not be available experimentally.
