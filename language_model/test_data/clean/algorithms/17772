To determine if an unsupervised self-organizing neural network could create a clinically meaningful distinction of 'depression' versus 'no depression' based on cardiac time-series data.

A self-organizing map (SOM) was used to separate the time-series of 84 subjects into groups based on characteristics of the data alone.

Analyses included natural log transformations and two types of filtering to enhance characteristics of the data as well as classifications of unprocessed data. A Pearson chi(2) analysis was performed to determine if the SOM groups bore any relation to the binary clinical groups.

Overall correct SOM classifications ranged from 54 to 70.2% with two classifications being clinically meaningful.

SOM classifications of cardiac time-series data with enhanced ultradian variations and cardiac data recorded around the interval when a person was in bed were useful in differentiating clinically meaningful subgroups with and without depression.
