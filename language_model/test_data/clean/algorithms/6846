Large margin classifiers (such as MLPs) are designed to assign training samples with high confidence (or margin) to one of the classes. Recent theoretical results of these systems show why the use of regularisation terms and feature extractor techniques can enhance their generalisation properties. Since the optimal subset of features selected depends on the classification problem, but also on the particular classifier with which they are used, global learning algorithms for large margin classifiers that use feature extractor techniques are desired. A direct approach is to optimise a cost function based on the margin error, which also incorporates regularisation terms for controlling capacity. These terms must penalise a classifier with the largest margin for the problem at hand. Our work shows that the inclusion of a PCA term can be employed for this purpose. Since PCA only achieves an optimal discriminatory projection for some particular distribution of data, the margin of the classifier can then be effectively controlled. We also propose a simple constrained search for the global algorithm in which the feature extractor and the classifier are trained separately. This allows a degree of flexibility for including heuristics that can enhance the search and the performance of the computed solution. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of the proposed method.
