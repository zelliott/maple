The Fourier method is applied to calculate fields and electron optical phase shifts in specimens having long-range electromagnetic fields, like reverse biased p-n junctions or stripe magnetic domains. It is shown that this approach not only allows to take into account rather easily the effect of the fringing fields protruding in the space around the specimen, but also to obtain solutions to interesting models in analytical form.
