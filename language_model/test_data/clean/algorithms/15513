The electrochemical oxidative behavior of piribedil (PR) was described. It was investigated by cyclic, linear sweep, differential pulse (DPV) and square wave (SWV) voltammetric techniques. The redox behavior of PR was found irreversible. Different parameters were tested to optimize the conditions for the determination of PR. The dependence of intensities of currents and potential on pH, concentration, scan rate, nature of the buffer was investigated. Two sensitive methods for the measurement of PR were described. For analytical purposes, a very well resolved diffusion controlled voltammetric peak was obtained in 0.1 M H(2)SO(4) and pH 5.7 acetate buffer. The determination peaks are obtained at 1.27 and 0.95 V for differential pulse and 1.29 and 0.97 V for SWV in 0.1 M H(2)SO(4) and pH 5.7 acetate buffer, respectively. The linear response was obtained in the ranges of 2 x 10(-6)-1 x 10(-3) M in 0.1 M H(2)SO(4) and 2 x 10(-6)-8 x 10(-4) M in pH 5.7 acetate buffer for both techniques. The proposed techniques were successfully applied to the determination of PR in tablet dosage forms and human serum. Excipients did not interfere in the determination. The necessary statistical validation reveals that the proposed methods are free from significant systematic errors.
