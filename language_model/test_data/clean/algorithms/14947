According to theoretical considerations, the magnetic field of the earth could influence the first steps of light-induced changes in ocular photopigment, an effect that is thought to underlie the magnetic orientation of some animals. To find out whether man could be influenced in this way, we have tested the effect of an artificial fluctuation in the direction of the earth's magnetic field on oscillations of the visual sensitivity in 27 healthy subjects. The resultant spectra show a significant influence of the field fluctuations, indicating that man is sensitive to changes in the direction of the earth's magnetic field.
