Transrectal ovarian ultrasonography is a non-invasive technique that permits the real-time serial visualization of ovarian structures. Previous studies have reported correlations between serum progesterone concentrations and physical characteristics of the corpus luteum (CL) in different species. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether or not there were correlations between ultrasound image attributes of the CL and changing progesterone concentrations over time, in prolific and non-prolific ewes. Ultrasonographic images of CL were taken, once daily, from 12 Western White Face ewes and 7 Finn ewes for the duration of one luteal phase. Blood samples were collected daily prior to each scanning session and assayed to determine mean serum concentrations of progesterone. Analysis of ultrasound images was performed using a series of custom-developed computer algorithms optimized for ultrasonography on a computer graphics workstation. Both total luteal area and mean pixel values were correlated with the pattern of serum concentrations of progesterone from days 3 to 15 after ovulation in Western White Face ewes and from days 3 to 14 in Finn ewes. There was no significant correlation between progesterone concentrations and spot pixel heterogeneity for either Western White Face ewes or Finn ewes. We concluded that pixel heterogeneity is a poor indicator of progesterone secretory ability of the CL when compared to mean pixel values. However, luteal area and mean spot pixel values are better but not strong indicators of the functional status of the CL in cyclic ewes.
