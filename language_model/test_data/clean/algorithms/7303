We obtain simple exact formulas for the refracted wavefronts through plano-convex aspheric lenses with arbitrary aspheric terms by considering an incident plane wavefront propagating along the optical axis. We provide formulas for the zero-distance phase front using the Huygens' Principle and the Malus-Dupin theorem. Using the fact that they are equivalent, we have in the second method found a way to use an improper integral, instead of the usual evaluated integral, to arrive at these formulas. As expected, when the condition of total internal reflection is satisfied, there is no contribution to the formation of the refracted wavefront.
