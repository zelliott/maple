Chest compression is a vital part of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). This paper demonstrates how the compression depth can be estimated using the principles of inertia navigation. The proposed method uses accelerometer sensors, one placed on the patient's chest, the other beside the patient. The acceleration-to-position conversion is performed using discrete-time digital signal processing (DSP). Instability problems due to integration are combated using a set of boundary conditions. The proposed algorithm is tested on a mannequin in harsh environments, where the patient is exposed to external forces as in a boat or car, as well as improper sensor/patient alignment. The overall performance is an estimation depth error of 4.3 mm in these environments, which is reduced to 1.6 mm in a regular, flat-floor controlled environment.
