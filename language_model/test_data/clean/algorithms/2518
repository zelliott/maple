The discovery of an incidental adrenal mass (adrenal incidentaloma) continues to rise with the increasing use of cross-sectional imaging. Although most adrenal lesions are benign and asymptomatic, radiologists should guide evaluation of these lesions, whether benign or malignant. This article reviews the various imaging techniques used to evaluate adrenal masses and their relative strengths and weaknesses. It focuses on the most prevalent adrenal pathologies and their typical imaging characteristics, and concludes with a brief discussion of developing techniques, including diffusion-weighted imaging and dual-energy CT.
