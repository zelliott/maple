Here we present the evaluation results of the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP6) contact prediction category. Contact prediction was assessed with standard measures well known in the field and the performance of specialist groups was evaluated alongside groups that submitted models with 3D coordinates. The evaluation was mainly focused on long range contact predictions for the set of new fold targets, although we analyzed predictions for all targets. Three groups with similar levels of accuracy and coverage performed a little better than the others. Comparisons of the predictions of the three best methods with those of CASP5/CAFASP3 suggested some improvement, although there were not enough targets in the comparisons to make this statistically significant.
