Our objective was to retrospectively evaluate the ability of multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) to detect previous myocardial infarctions (MIs) and to correlate necrosis with the status of coronary arteries supplying the infarcted territory. After having clinically evaluated 187 patients referred for ECG-gated MDCT of the coronary arteries, 30 previous MIs were identified in 29 patients (9 recent and 21 chronic). MDCT data were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively by measuring attenuation values and wall thickness within the infarcted region and normal adjacent myocardium. Each MI was also assigned to the distribution territory of a coronary vessel, and morphological data were combined with MDCT angiographic findings. MDCT was able to detect 25/30 MIs showing an overall sensitivity and specificity of 83 and 91%, respectively. Quantitative analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in attenuation values between normal and infarcted regions (38.9+/-14 HU vs. 104.0+/-16 HU). Regional wall thinning was observed in chronic MIs (4.1+/-2 mm vs. 10.5+/-3.8 mm), and not in patients with recent event (7.9+/-1.6 mm vs 9.1+/-4 mm). In 22/25 cases, MDCT angiographic findings showed the presence of suspicious critical lumen narrowing (n=3), previous coronary stenting (n=14) and surgical revascularization (n=5) in the infarct-related coronary. During a single examination, MDCT might provide comprehensive imaging of MI offering a combined morphological and angiographic assessment.
