Initial steps in the development of a suite of triple-resonance (1)H/(13)C/(15)N solid-state NMR experiments applicable to aligned samples of (13)C and (15)N labeled proteins are described. The experiments take advantage of the opportunities for (13)C detection without the need for homonuclear (13)C/(13)C decoupling presented by samples with two different patterns of isotopic labeling. In one type of sample, the proteins are approximately 20% randomly labeled with (13)C in all backbone and side chain carbon sites and approximately 100% uniformly (15)N labeled in all nitrogen sites; in the second type of sample, the peptides and proteins are (13)C labeled at only the alpha-carbon and (15)N labeled at the amide nitrogen of a few residues. The requirement for homonuclear (13)C/(13)C decoupling while detecting (13)C signals is avoided in the first case because of the low probability of any two (13)C nuclei being bonded to each other; in the second case, the labeled (13)C(alpha) sites are separated by at least three bonds in the polypeptide chain. The experiments enable the measurement of the (13)C chemical shift and (1)H-(13)C and (15)N-(13)C heteronuclear dipolar coupling frequencies associated with the (13)C(alpha) and (13)C' backbone sites, which provide orientation constraints complementary to those derived from the (15)N labeled amide backbone sites. (13)C/(13)C spin-exchange experiments identify proximate carbon sites. The ability to measure (13)C-(15)N dipolar coupling frequencies and correlate (13)C and (15)N resonances provides a mechanism for making backbone resonance assignments. Three-dimensional combinations of these experiments ensure that the resolution, assignment, and measurement of orientationally dependent frequencies can be extended to larger proteins. Moreover, measurements of the (13)C chemical shift and (1)H-(13)C heteronuclear dipolar coupling frequencies for nearly all side chain sites enable the complete three-dimensional structures of proteins to be determined with this approach.
