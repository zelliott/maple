Scattering fluid flux can be quantified with coherent light, either from the contrast of speckle patterns, or from the moments of the power spectrum of intensity fluctuations. We present a theory connecting these approaches for the general case of mixed static-dynamic patterns of boiling speckles without prior assumptions regarding the particle dynamics. An expression is derived and tested relating the speckle contrast to the intensity power spectrum. Our theory demonstrates that in speckle contrast the concentration of moving particles dominates over the contribution of speed to the particle flux. Our theory provides a basis for comparison of both approaches when used for studying tissue perfusion.
