A measurement system for quantitative determination of both surface and bulk contributions to the photo-thermal absorption in DUV optics was developed. It is based upon a Hartmann-Shack wavefront sensor with a sensitivity of ~Î»/10000 rms, accomplishing precise on-line monitoring of wavefront deformations of a collimated test laser beam transmitted perpendicular through the excimer laser-irradiated site of a cuboid sample. Caused by the temperature dependence of the refractive index as well as thermal expansion, the initially plane wavefront of the test laser is distorted into a cylindrical shape, with bending ends towards the surface. Sign and magnitude depend on index change and expansion. By comparison with thermal theory, this transient wavefront distortion yields a quantitative absolute measure of bulk and surface absorption losses in the sample. First rresults for fused silica are presented.
