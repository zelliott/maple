The aim of this study was to assess the extent to which a model with pores having only net negative charges would adequately describe transdermal electroosmosis in human epidermal membrane (HEM) at neutral pH. Such information would enhance the predictive value of the modified Nernst-Planck model for transdermal iontophoresis, in addition to providing insights regarding the likelihood of significant pore charge distribution in HEM. Baseline results (the control) obtained from 0.1 to 0.4 V anodal and cathodal electroosmosis experiments with synthetic polycarbonate membranes (Nuclepore membranes), using radiolabeled urea and mannitol as the model permeants, demonstrated that such a membrane system can be modeled by the electrokinetic (electroosmosis) theory with the assumption of the pores possessing only negative charges. The studies with HEM were carried out at low voltage (</=0.5 V) where alterations in the barrier properties of HEM were minimal and at higher voltages (>/approximately = 1.0 V) where significant field-induced pore formation in HEM occurred. In both the low and high voltage studies, radiolabeled urea, mannitol, and water were employed as permeants in cathodal and anodal iontophoresis experiments. The results of the low voltage iontophoresis experiments suggest significant pore charge distribution in HEM (a significant deviation between the predictions from the single pore charge type assumption and the experimental data). Under the higher applied voltage conditions (>/approximately = 1.0 V), results from anodal and cathodal electroosmosis studies were consistent with the model in which the HEM has only pores that are net negatively charged.
