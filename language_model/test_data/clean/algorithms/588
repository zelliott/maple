Transfer RNA (tRNA)-like sequences were searched for in the nine basic taxonomic divisions of GenBank-121 (viruses, phages, bacteria, plants, invertebrates, vertebrates, rodents, mammals, and primates) by an original program package implementing a dynamic profile alignment approach for the genetic texts' analysis, in using 22 profiles of tRNAs of different isotypes. In total, 175,901 previously unknown tRNA-like sequences were revealed. The locations of the tRNA-likes were considered over the regions whose functional meaning is described by standard Feature Keys in GenBank. Many regions containing the tRNA-like sequences were recognized as known repeats. A mode of distribution of the tRNA-like sequences in a genome was proposed as expansion in a content of the various transposable elements. An analysis of the integrity of RNA polymerase III inner promoters in the tRNA-like sequences over the GenBank divisions has shown a high possibility of generating new copies of short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) repeats in all divisions, excepting primates. The numerous tRNA-likes found in the regions of RNA polymerase II promoters have suggested an adaptation of RNA polymerase III promoter to a binding of RNA polymerase II.
