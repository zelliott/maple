Parallel imaging and compressed sensing have been arguably the most successful and widely used techniques for fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Recent studies have shown that the combination of these two techniques is useful for solving the inverse problem of recovering the image from highly under-sampled k-space data. In sparsity-enforced sensitivity encoding (SENSE) reconstruction, the optimization problem involves data fidelity (L2-norm) constraint and a number of L1-norm regularization terms (i.e. total variation or TV, and L1 norm). This makes the optimization problem difficult to solve due to the non-smooth nature of the regularization terms. In this paper, to effectively solve the sparsity-regularized SENSE reconstruction, we utilize a new optimization method, called fast composite splitting algorithm (FCSA), which was developed for compressed sensing MRI. By using a combination of variable splitting and operator splitting techniques, the FCSA algorithm decouples the large optimization problem into TV and L1 sub-problems, which are then, solved efficiently using existing fast methods. The operator splitting separates the smooth terms from the non-smooth terms, so that both terms are treated in an efficient manner. The final solution to the SENSE reconstruction is obtained by weighted solutions to the sub-problems through an iterative optimization procedure. The FCSA-based parallel MRI technique is tested on MR brain image reconstructions at various acceleration rates and with different sampling trajectories. The results indicate that, for sparsity-regularized SENSE reconstruction, the FCSA-based method is capable of achieving significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy when compared with the state-of-the-art reconstruction method.
