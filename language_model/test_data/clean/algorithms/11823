An approximate expression is derived for the electrophoretic mobility of a spherical charged colloidal particle carrying low zeta potential covered with an ion-penetrable uncharged polymer layer in an electrolyte solution. This expression, which becomes Henry's mobility formula in the absence of the polymer layer, is a modification of Henry's mobility formula by taking into account the presence of the uncharged polymer layer.
