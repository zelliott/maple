Evaluation of a patient with orbital disease needs a multidisciplinary approach. Clinical examination should seek to glean information regarding pathophysiologic effect and location and to evaluate consequences of this disease on cosmetic, vision and ocular motility. Procedures of imaging are based on the implied complementary exams that should be done according to the suspected clinical location and characters help to characterize the underlying process. Imaging can define the location, size, limits and relationship of the disease to other tissues and especially to the vascular system. It may be completed by blood test. The final diagnosis is based on several arguments and can appeal for a diagnostic biopsy in the most difficult cases.
