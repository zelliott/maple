The authors have developed a method of assessment of the degree of the enteral insufficiency syndrome (EIS). The method was used in 2006 peritonitis patients on the basis of 42 clinical-laboratory indices expressed by 10 score scale. A formula for establishing the coefficient of EIS is proposed in cases of the absence of all the indices, the average intervals of its possible degrees are shown. An express formula was developed for the calculation of the prognostic coefficient and its degree intervals. Randomization in the approaches to diagnosis and treatment allowed lethality to be reduced from 26.9% to 12.9%, the frequency of complications--from 12.7% to 7.2%.
