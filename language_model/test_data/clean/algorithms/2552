Many epidemiological studies have investigated the associations between polymorphisms of interleukin-1 (IL1) and interleukin-6 (IL6) genes and risk of ischemic stroke (IS), but no conclusions are available because of conflicting results. The aim of this study was to assess the relationships by meta-analysis. The databases of Pubmed, Embase and Wangfang, updated to August 1st, 2011, were retrieved. Odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) as effect size were calculated by a fixed- or random-effect model. In total, three case-control studies for IL1α-889C/T, eight studies for IL1β-511C/T, eight studies for IL1-Ra and seven studies for IL6-147G/C were included in this meta-analysis. Combined analysis indicated that IL1β-511C/T polymorphism was not overall associated with risk of IS [OR (95% CI)=1.22 (0.85-1.87) for TT vs. CC]. However, when subgroup analyses for countries were conducted, the results indicated that T allele was associated with increased risk of IS for Polish and associated with a trend of increased risk of IS for Chinese although it did not reach statistical significance [TT vs. CC: OR (95% CI)=1.97 (1.22-3.17) for Polish and 1.40 (0.99-1.99) for Chinese]. In addition, overall and subgroup analyses indicated that IL1α-889C/T, IL1-Ra and IL6-147G/C polymorphisms were also not associated with risk of IS [OR (95% CI)=1.21 (0.86-1.70) for TT vs. CC of IL1α-889C/T, 1.22 (0.85-1.75) for RN2/RN2 vs. RN1/RN1 for IL1-Ra and 1.09 (0.84-1.40) for G carriers vs. C carriers for IL6-147G/C]. This study inferred that IL1β-511C/T polymorphism might be moderately associated with increased risk of IS, but no sufficient evidence was available to support any associations between IL1-Ra and IL6-147G/C polymorphisms and IS. We could not draw a conclusion between IL1α-889C/T polymorphism and risk of IS based on the limited data, and further large sample-sized studies were required.
