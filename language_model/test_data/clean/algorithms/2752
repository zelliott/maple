The QT interval on the electrocardiogram is an increasingly important measurement, especially in relation to drug action and interaction. The QT interval varies inversely as the heart rate and numerous rate correction formulae have been proposed. It is difficult to compare the effect of applying different formulae at different heart rates and for different measured QT intervals. A simple graphical display of the results from different formulae is proposed. This display is dependent on the concept of the absolute correction factor. This graphical presentation is useful (a) in comparing the effect of the application of different formulae and (b) in directly reading the correction produced by any individual formula.
