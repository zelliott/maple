Network structure strongly constrains the range of dynamic behaviors available to a complex system. These system dynamics can be classified based on their response to perturbations over time into two distinct regimes, ordered or chaotic, separated by a critical phase transition. Numerous studies have shown that the most complex dynamics arise near the critical regime. Here we use an information theoretic approach to study structure-dynamics relationships within a unified framework and show that these relationships are most diverse in the critical regime.
