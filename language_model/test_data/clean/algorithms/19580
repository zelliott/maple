Numerical solutions of the differential equations system describing the transitions between energy levels can help in the understanding of the physical mechanisms governing thermoluminescence (TL) emission but they are not suitable for the analysis of complex experimental TL glow curves. On the other hand, simplified descriptions, as mixed or general order kinetics, require many additional assumptions that may limit the validity of the results or are mostly empirical. In this paper, the accuracy of such approximations has been evaluated for different retrapping-recombination ratios and it has been found that differences between the fitted and the simulated parameters arise from the simplification of the models because quasi-equilibrium condition seems to be valid in all the considered cases.
