Reconstruction of electron spectra of medical accelerators from measured depth dose distributions is an attractive tool for commissioning of a Monte Carlo treatment planning system. However, the reconstruction method is an inverse radiation transport problem which is poorly conditioned, in the sense it may become unstable due to small perturbations in the input data. Predicting the sharp (delta-like) peak in the electron spectrum provides an additional challenge for the numerical reconstruction technique. To improve efficiency and robustness of the reconstruction technique, we developed an algorithm based on a separation of the electron spectrum into singular and regular components. We approximate the singular peak of the spectrum by a narrow weighted Gaussian function. The parameters of this Gaussian function are sought using only the fall-off and toe regions of the depth-dose curve. Analytical representation of the spectral peak by a Gaussian has benefit since only one weight and the mean and variance must be derived from the depth-dose curve instead of multiple spectra weights. The regular part of the spectrum is reconstructed from the residual depth-dose distribution using a variational method combined with a regularization technique to avoid the nonphysical oscillations. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by comparing predictions to "benchmark" spectra and depth-dose distributions from Monte Carlo simulation of medical accelerators.
