Time-critical care of seriously injured patients is gaining more and more significance. The availability of the multi-slice CT allows a complete diagnostic assessment of injured patients in 90-240 s, but is presently carried out only at the conclusion of basic diagnostics. We investigated the effects of a clinical algorithm using multi-slice CT scanning ahead of other measures in the clinical care of seriously injured patients.

Availability of a trauma admitting room with integrated multi-slice CT scanner enabled a new algorithm for patient care. We prospectively examined the time taken to reach established benchmarks in clinical care (completion of diagnosis, completion of resuscitation, exit from the trauma room) under this new approach. Data were collected for consecutive patients with serious injury (estimated injury severity score >15), and compared to historical data from the previous 2 years.

The new algorithm was employed in 139 patients with a mean ISS of 26.93. CT scanning was initiated 8 min (S.D. 5.7) after patient arrival, and concluded 13 min (S.D. 8.4) after patient arrival. Stabilising measures (initial resuscitation) were completed an average of 36 min from patient arrival. The length of stay in the trauma room was reduced to an average of 38 min (S.D. 19.1). Four patients required life-saving interventions after admission to the trauma room but before CT scanning began.

A new algorithm for trauma patient care that integrates high resolution CT scanning into the early diagnostic protocol reduces the length of stay in the trauma room markedly, and will facilitate rapid therapeutic intervention in patients with unstable haemorrhagic shock or neurosurgical emergencies.
