We present a model for predicting the transport of biofunctional magnetic nanoparticles in a passive magnetophoretic system that consists of a fluidic chamber positioned above a rare-earth magnet. The model is based on a drift-diffusion equation that governs the particle concentration in the chamber. We solve this equation numerically using the finite volume method. We apply the model to the magnetofection process wherein the magnetic force produced by the magnet attracts magnetic carrier particles with surface-bound gene vectors toward the bottom of the chamber for transfection with target cells. We study particle transport and accumulation as a function of key variables. Our analysis indicates that the particles are magnetically focused toward the center of the chamber during transport, and that the rate of accumulation at the base can be enhanced using larger particles and/or by reducing the spacing between the magnet and the chamber. The model provides insight into the physics of particle transport at the nanoscale and enables rapid parametric analysis of particle accumulation, which is useful for optimizing novel magnetofection systems.
