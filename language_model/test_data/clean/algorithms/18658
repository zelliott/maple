This review of the original works on computer analysis of the human genome considers the development of methods to predict the exon-intron structure of genes and analysis of alternative splicing. Prediction of the gene structure is based on homology between the gene product and a known protein or between the genomic sequences of the gene and its homolog from another organism. The methods were tested and proved highly efficient. Human gene splicing was analyzed with original methods and EST databases. Genes with alternative splicing were for the first time shown to account for no less than 35% total genes. Alternative splicing was compared for the human and mouse genomes. Species-specific isoforms were demonstrated for 50% alternatively spliced genes (25% total genes).
