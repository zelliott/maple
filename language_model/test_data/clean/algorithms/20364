Eight-noded quadrilateral boundary elements are applied to the electrocardiographic inverse problem as an example for high-order boundary elements. It is shown that the choice of the shape functions used for approximation of the potentials has a remarkable influence on the solution obtained if the number of electrodes is smaller than the number of primary source points (under-determined equation system). Three different formulations are investigated considering a concentric spheres problem where an analytic solution is available: (a) the isoparametric formulation; (b) the quasi-first-order formulation; and (c) the pseudo-subparametric formulation as a new method. In a second step the pseudo-subparametric formulation (which provided the best results in the test problem) is applied to real word data. The transmembrane potential pattern of a 40 years old female suffering from severe heart failure and ventricular tachycardia after large anterior wall myocardial infarction is reconstructed for one time instant. Furthermore, an algorithm for the calculation of the transfer matrix is presented which avoids restrictions to the boundary element mesh caused by the placement of the electrodes.
