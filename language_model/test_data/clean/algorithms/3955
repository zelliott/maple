We reviewed the outcome of patients who had been treated operatively for symptomatic peri-acetabular metastases and present an algorithm to guide treatment. The records of 81 patients who had been treated operatively for symptomatic peri-acetabular metastases between 1987 and 2010 were identified. There were 27 men and 54 women with a mean age of 61 years (15 to 87). The diagnosis, size of lesion, degree of pelvic continuity, type of reconstruction, World Health Organization performance status, survival time, pain, mobility and complications including implant failure were recorded in each case. The overall patient survivorship at five years was 5%. The longest lived patient survived 16 years from the date of diagnosis. The mean survival was 23 months (< 1 to 16 years) and the median was 15 months. At follow-up 14 patients remained alive. Two cementoplasties failed because of local disease progression. Three Harrington rods broke: one patient needed a subsequent Girdlestone procedure. One 'ice-cream cone' prosthesis dislocated and was subsequently revised without further problems. We recommend the 'ice-cream cone' for pelvic discontinuity and Harrington rod reconstruction for severe bone loss. Smaller defects can be safely managed using standard revision hip techniques.
