The automated interpretation of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis images used in protein separation and analysis presents a formidable problem in the detection and characterization of ill-defined spatial objects. We describe in this paper a hierarchical algorithm that provides a robust, high-sensitivity solution to this problem, which can be easily adapted to a variety of experimental situations. The software implementation of this algorithm functions as part of a complete package designed for general protein gel analysis applications.
