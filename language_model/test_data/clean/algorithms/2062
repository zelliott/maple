The interpretation of cardiotocograms still relies primarily on visual analysis. This form of monitoring remains labour intensive and, being dependent on the training and experience of the specialist responsible, also subject to erroneous interpretation. Computer-aided cardiotocogram analysis has, in spite of encouraging successes, still not found wide application in everyday clinical routine. To achieve this, the programming system must be easy to operate, userfriendly and reliable. A program system for fully automatic cardiotocogram analysis is envisioned which runs on standard commercially-available personal computers. A clear graphic representation of the traces also permits visual assessment on the computer screen. The system described integrates the main assessment criteria of cardiotocogram analysis which can then be extended owing to the open system architecture used in the programming. Completely new analysis algorithms have given the evaluating system the capability of fully-automatic pattern recognition of fetal heart rate signals and uterine motility. An essential requirement of computer-aided cardiotocogram analysis is thereby fulfilled. Work is now focusing on the exact classification of the various types of deceleration and an extension of the capabilities of tocogram analysis. There should be nothing to hinder integration of the system into everyday clinical routine and connect it to obstetrical databases.
