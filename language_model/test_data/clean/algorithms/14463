Noise disturbances and time delays are frequently met in cellular genetic regulatory systems. This paper is concerned with the disturbance analysis of a class of genetic regulatory networks described by nonlinear differential equation models. The mechanisms of genetic regulatory networks to amplify (attenuate) external disturbance are explored, and a simple measure of the amplification (attenuation) level is developed from a nonlinear robust control point of view. It should be noted that the conditions used to measure the disturbance level are delay-independent or delay-dependent, and are expressed within the framework of linear matrix inequalities, which can be characterized as convex optimization, and computed by the interior-point algorithm easily. Finally, by the proposed method, a numerical example is provided to illustrate how to measure the attenuation of proteins in the presence of external disturbances.
