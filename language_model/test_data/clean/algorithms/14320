A study was conducted to determine if aflatoxin and fumonisin are concentrated in the poor-quality grade components of shelled corn. Four 1.0 kg test samples were each taken from 23 lots of shelled corn marketed in North Carolina. Inspectors from the Federal Grain Inspection Service divided each test sample into 3 grade components: (1) damaged kernels (DM), (2) broken corn and foreign material (BCFM), and )3) whole kernels (WH). The aflatoxin and fumonisin concentration was measured in each component and a mass balance equation was used to calculate the total concentration of each mycotoxin in each test sample. Averaged across all test samples, the aflatoxin concentrations in the DM, BCFM, and WH components were 1300.3, 455.2, and 37.3 ppb, respectively. Averaged across all test samples, the fumonisin concentrations in the DM, BCFM, and WH components were 148.3, 51.3, and 1.8 ppm, respectively. The DM and BCFM components combined accounted for only 5.0% of the test sample mass, but accounted for 59.8 and 77.5% of the total aflatoxin and fumonisin mass in the test sample, respectively. Both aflatoxin mass (ng) and aflatoxin concentration (ng/g) in the combined DM and BCFM components had high correlations with aflatoxin concentration in the lot. The highest correlation occurred when aflatoxin mass (ng) in the combined DM and BCFM components was related to aflatoxin concentration in the lot (0.964). Similar results were obtained for fumonisin. This study indicated that measuring either aflatoxin or fumonisin in the combined DM and BCFM grade components could be used as a screening method to predict either aflatoxin or fumonisin in a bulk lot of shelled corn.
