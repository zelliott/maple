Advances in refractive surgery have been limited by the measurement technology for determining corneal thickness and curvature. A measurement technique is needed that can provide a detailed corneal thickness and curvature model without contacting the cornea or obstructing the view of the surgeon or surgical equipment. The authors present preliminary results of a method to remotely measure the thickness and curvature of the human cornea at a single point. The method combines ray tracing and interferometry to estimate thickness and curvature in two orthogonal planes in an area less than 100 microns in diameter. This technique has been successfully used to provide very accurate estimates of several thin-shelled test objects. Based upon these results, recommendations are given for further improvement of the technique and extension to a multipoint cornea-modeling system.
