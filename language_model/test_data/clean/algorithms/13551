The diagnostic of optic neuropathy (ON) is a clinical diagnostic, relying on a detailed medical history, and a thorough clinical examination. In some cases, the attribution of the vision loss to a lesion of the optic nerve can be challenging, and further work-up is required to confirm the optic neuropathy. Once the diagnostic of optic neuropathy is stated, the pathophysiological mechanism of the ON has to be determined so that the appropriate therapeutic strategy can be initiated as promptly as possible. The diagnostic work-up must be as targeted as possible, oriented by the clinical examination. The different steps leading to the positive diagnostic of ON, and the etiologic work-up are detailed hereafter in order to achieve the most targeted work-up as possible. Differentials and current pitfalls are being reviewed.
