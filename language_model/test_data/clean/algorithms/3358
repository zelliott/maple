The computerized translation of "Handbook of glandular tissue doses in mammography" (HHS publication FDA 85-8239) is presented. It is registered on floppy disk and suitable for use in MS-DOS on IBM personal computer, Olivetti or compatible. The manual collects data published by many authors and suggests a method to estimate the dose released to the glandular tissue (considered at risk for breast cancer) in the most commonly used conditions for mammography. Besides translation manual, the program holds an algorithm developed by the authors, which allows the dose to the glandular tissue to be evaluated, given the following data: projection: craniocaudal or mediolateral; compression level: firm or moderate; breast size: small, medium or large; breast composition: percentage of glandular tissue content (by weight); X-ray beam quality: HVL mm Al. The algorithm is obtained from a bidimensional fit of the original data and is based on the terms contained in the manual. The program flow is guided by menus that make the procedure suitable for inexperienced operators too, both for consulting and printing and for computing program.
