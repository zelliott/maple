The importance and usefulness of local doublet parameters in understanding sequence dependent effects has been described for A- and B-DNA oligonucleotide crystal structures. Each of the two sets of local parameters described by us in the NUPARM algorithm, namely the local doublet parameters, calculated with reference to the mean z-axis, and the local helical parameters, calculated with reference to the local helix axis, is sufficient to describe the oligonucleotide structures, with the local helical parameters giving a slightly magnified picture of the variations in the structures. The values of local doublet parameters calculated by NUPARM algorithm are similar to those calculated by NEWHELIX90 program, only if the oligonucleotide fragment is not too distorted. The mean values obtained using all the available data for B-DNA crystals are not significantly different from those obtained when a limited data set is used, consisting only of structures with a data resolution of better than 2.4 A and without any bound drug molecule. Thus the variation observed in the oligonucleotide crystals appears to be independent of the quality of their crystallinity. No strong correlation is seen between any pair of local doublet parameters but the local helical parameters are interrelated by geometric relationships. An interesting feature that emerges from this analysis is that the local rise along the z-axis is highly correlated with the difference in the buckle values of the two basepairs in the doublet, as suggested earlier for the dodecamer structures (Bansal and Bhattacharyya, in Structure & Methods: DNA & RNA, Vol. 3 (Eds., R.H. Sarma and M.H. Sarma), pp. 139-153 (1990)). In fact the local rise values become almost constant for both A- and B-forms, if a correction is applied for the buckling of the basepairs. In B-DNA the AA, AT, TA and GA basepair sequences generally have a smaller local rise (3.25 A) compared to the other sequences (3.4 A) and this seems to be an intrinsic feature of basepair stacking interaction and not related to any other local doublet parameter. The roll angles in B-DNA oligonucleotides have small values (less than +/- 8 degrees), while mean local twist varies from 24 degrees to 45 degrees. The CA/TG doublet sequences show two types of preferred geometries, one with positive roll, small positive slide and reduced twist and another with negative roll, large positive slide and increased twist.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
