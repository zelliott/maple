A three-image method to extract absorption, refraction and scattering information for hard x-ray grating interferometry is presented. The method comprises a post-processing approach alternative to the conventional phase stepping procedure and is inspired by a similar three-image technique developed for analyzer-based x-ray imaging. Results obtained with this algorithm are quantitatively comparable with phase-stepping. This method can be further extended to samples with negligible scattering, where only two images are needed to separate absorption and refraction signal. Thanks to the limited number of images required, this technique is a viable route to bio-compatible imaging with x-ray grating interferometer. In addition our method elucidates and strengthens the formal and practical analogies between grating interferometry and the (non-interferometric) diffraction enhanced imaging technique.
