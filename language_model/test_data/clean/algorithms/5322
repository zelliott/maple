We investigate the effect of topological disorder on a system of forced threshold elements, where each element is arranged on top of complex heterogeneous networks. Numerical results indicate that the response of the system to a weak signal can be amplified at an intermediate level of topological disorder, thus indicating the occurrence of topological-disorder-induced resonance. Using mean field method, we obtain an analytical understanding of the resonant phenomenon by deriving the effective potential of the system. Our findings might provide further insight into the role of network topology in signal amplification in biological networks.
