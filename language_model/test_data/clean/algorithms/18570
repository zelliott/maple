We purpose to find a new beneficial method for accelerating the Decision-Making and classifier support applied on imprecise data. This acceleration can be done by integration between Rough Sets theory, which gives us the minimal set of decision rules, and the Cellular Neural Networks. Our method depends on Genetic Algorithms for designing the cloning template for more accuracy. Some illustrative examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, whose advantages and limitations are also discussed.
