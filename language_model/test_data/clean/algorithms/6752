Inductive logic programming (ILP) has been applied to automatically discover protein fold signatures. This paper investigates the use of topological information to circumvent problems encountered during previous experiments, namely (1) matching of non-structurally related secondary structures and (2) scaling problems. Cross-validation tests were carried out for 20 folds. The overall estimated accuracy is 73.37+/-0.35%. The new representation allows us to process the complete set of examples, while previously it was necessary to sample the negative examples. Topological information is used in approximately 90% of the rules presented here. Information about the topology of a sheet is present in 63% of the rules. This set of rules presents characteristics of the overall architecture of the fold. In contrast, 26% of the rules contain topological information which is limited to the packing of a restricted number of secondary structures, as such, the later set resembles those found in our previous studies.
