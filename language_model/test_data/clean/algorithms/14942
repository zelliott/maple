An algorithm for determining of protein domain structure is proposed. Domain structures resulted from the algorithm application have been obtained and compared with available data. The method is based on entirely physical model of van der Waals interactions that reflects as illustrated in this work the distribution of electron density. Various levels of hierarchy in the protein spatial structure are discerned by analysis of the energy interaction between structural units of different scales. Thus the level of energy hierarchy plays role of sole parameter, and the method obviates the use of complicated geometrical criteria with numerous fitting parameters. The algorithm readily and accurately locates domains formed by continuous segments of the protein chain as well as those comprising non-sequential segments, sets no limit to the number of segments in a domain. We have analyzed 309 protein structures. Among 277 structures for which our results could be compared with the domain definitions made in other works, 243 showed complete or partial coincidence, and only in 34 cases the domain structures proved substantially different. The domains delineated with our approach may coincide with reference definition at different levels of the globule hierarchy. Along with defining the domain structure, our approach allows one to consider the protein spatial structure in terms of the spatial distribution of the interaction energy in order to establish the correspondence between the hierarchy of energy distribution and the hierarchy of structural elements.
