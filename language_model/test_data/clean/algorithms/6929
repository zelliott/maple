We have constructed an expert sub-system for diagnosing pulmonary heart disease with back-propagation (BP) model of typical artificial neural network and BP-Hamming. The system can obtain and represent clinical data, and it has solved the problems such as obtaining automatic knowledge, representation and self-learning. The results of testing demonstrate that the method of neural network can be regarded as an expert sub-system to make intelligent diagnosis of pulmonary heart disease.
