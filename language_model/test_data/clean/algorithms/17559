This paper formulates and studies a model of periodic delayed neural networks. This model can well describe many practical architectures of delayed neural networks, which is generalization of some additive delayed neural networks such as delayed Hopfield neural networks and delayed cellular neural networks, under a time-varying environment, particularly when the network parameters and input stimuli are varied periodically with time. Without assuming the smoothness, monotonicity and boundedness of the activation functions, the two functional issues on neuronal dynamics of this periodic networks, i.e. the existence and global exponential stability of its periodic solutions, are investigated. Some explicit and conclusive results are established, which are natural extension and generalization of the corresponding results existing in the literature. Furthermore, some examples and simulations are presented to illustrate the practical nature of the new results.
