Transformation optics is a powerful concept for designing novel optical components such as high transmission waveguides and cloaking devices. The selection of specific transformations is a non-unique problem. Here we reveal that transformations which allow for all dielectric and broadband optical realizations correspond to minimizers of elastic energy potentials for extreme values of the mechanical Poisson's ratio ν. For TE (Hz) polarized light an incompressible transformation ν = 1/2 is ideal and for TM (Ez) polarized light one should use a compressible transformation with negative Poissons's ratio ν = -1. For the TM polarization the mechanical analogy corresponds to a modified Liao functional known from the transformation optics literature. Finally, the analogy between ideal transformations and solid mechanical material models automates and broadens the concept of transformation optics.
