The examination including filling cystometry, urethral profilometry, uroflowmetry, perineal ultrasonography was made in 62 females aged from 29 to 66 years with a clinical diagnosis of mixed urine incontinence (MUI). Irrespective of the verified diagnosis, the treatment started with conservative methods. Surgical intervention was performed if moderate and severe MUI persisted after conservative therapy. The diagnosis of MUI was confirmed in 66.1% examinees. Stress urine incontinence and hyperactive urinary bladder were diagnosed in 9.7 and 24.2% cases, respectively. The conservative treatment resulted in disappearance of the symptoms of MUI in 43.9%, in partial response in 34.1% patients. 22% patients were treated surgically. Urodynamic and ultrasonic indices helping choice of surgical policy in MUI were not determined. Thus, the principle of staged and comparative assessment of clinical, urodynamic and ultrasound findings improves diagnosis of MUI. Pathogenetic conservative treatment, as the first stage of MUI therapy, provides indications for surgery.
