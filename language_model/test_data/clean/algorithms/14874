Drop colorimetric reactions were studied for group identification of microorganisms referring to as viral rickettsial bacterial vegetative and bacterial sporal taxonomic groups. For their determination, the authors proposed a number of well-known reactions for preliminary detection of microorganisms if there was protein or protein components in a sample, as well as a series of reactions characteristic of some groups of microorganisms and their vital activity. The list was proposed to include not only tests for dehydrogenase and peroxidase activities and for inorganic phosphates, but also those for the ability of suspension production, etc, which were specific signs of the presence and vital ability of microorganisms. Drop reactions were made with eight indicator papers and a set of reagents used for control of the reactions, and with a set of wetting solutions for liquid-phase reactions. A set of reagents and accessories provided the identification of 40 samples of microorganisms, the analysis of one unknown sample took less than an hour. The authors developed an algorithm for the sequence of tests depending on the combination of positive and negative effects of indicator means, namely an algorithm for relating microorganisms to the above taxonomic groups.
