A system with interchangeable constraints for studying skillful human movements via haptic displays is presented. It is shown how this system can be applied to the analysis of reaching movements in the manipulation of flexible objects. In the experiment, progress in arm motor training is considered for several subjects. Experimental data are obtained for slow, moderate, and fast movements. Future applications of the system and its limitations are discussed.
