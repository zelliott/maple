Pulmonary complications are important cause of mortality and morbidity after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, in 30% to 60% of the patients. Improvements in prophylaxis and treatment of infectious complications have been increasing the rate of non-infectious complications. Early diagnosis and treatment of those complications can significantly change the evolution of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation receptors. The objective of this study is to review the most frequent non-infection complications associated to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation since the first bone marrow transplantation performed in 1957. A systematic literature review was performed, using the PICO strategy to ask the questions. The descriptors hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, non-infectious pulmonary complications, systematic review, in portuguese and their english correspondents, were used to access the following databases: MEDLINE, EBM, Embase, Cocrane Library, LILACS and SciELO. In this review, 263 studies were identified, from which 31 were selected for full analyzis. The non-infection pulmonary complications most frequently found were: bronchiolitis obliterans, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, pulmonary edema, idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, delayed pulmonary toxicity syndrome, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, engrafment syndrome and pulmonary cytolitic thrombi.
