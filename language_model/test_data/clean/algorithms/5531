This in vitro research verified the possibility of eliminating staining caused by coffee and red wine in five composite resins, after being submitted to thermal cycling. Thirty-six specimens were prepared and immersed in water at 37°C for 24 hours. After polishing, specimen color was measured in a spectrophotometer Cintra 10 UV (Visible Spectrometer, GBC, Braeside, VIC, Australia). All specimens were submitted to thermal cycling at temperatures of 5 and 55°C with a dwell time of 1 minute, for 1,000 cycles in a 75% ethanol/water solution. After thermal cycling, the specimens were immersed in water at 37°C until 7 days had elapsed from the time the specimens were prepared. All specimens were then taken to the spectrophotometer for color measurement. The specimens were divided into three groups (N = 12): distilled water (control), coffee, and red wine. For the staining process to occur on only one surface, all the sides, except one, of the surfaces were isolated with white wax. The specimens were immersed in one of the solutions at 37°C for 14 days. The specimens were dried and taken to the spectrophotometer for color measurement. After this, the specimens were submitted to 20 µm wear three times, and the color was measured after each one of the wear procedures. Calculation of the color difference was made using CIEDE2000 formula. According to the methodology used in this research, it was concluded that the staining caused by coffee and red wine was superficial and one wear of 20 µm was sufficient to remove the discoloration.
