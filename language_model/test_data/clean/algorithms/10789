The Desired Sensation Level (DSL) Method was originally developed in the early 1980s to provide clinicians with a systematic, science-based approach to pediatric hearing instrument fitting that ensures audibility of amplified speech by accounting for factors that are uniquely associated with the provision of amplification to infants and young children who have hearing loss. This review identifies and describes several of the primary factors that have been considered in the development of the DSL Method. Specifically, the issues discussed relate to: (1) the definition and measurement of relevant acoustic, electroacoustic and audiometric variables; (2) how the external ear acoustics of infants and young children are accounted for in the DSL Method for both audiometric assessment and in the fitting of amplification; and (3) how the DSL Method has evolved concurrently with developments in hearing instrument and electroacoustic measurement technologies. Finally, current issues in the field are identified that have motivated the development of version 5.0 of the DSL Method for hearing instrument fitting.
