The purpose of this study was to perform texture analysis of high-resolution CT images obtained from human vertebral specimens and to correlate these parameters with the biomechanical stability of the specimens. In addition, structure data were compared with bone mineral density (BMD) assessed by quantitative CT (QCT).

High-resolution CT images and standard QCT sections were obtained in 36 vertebral motion segments, each consisting of two vertebrae with intact ligaments and intervertebral disc. The trabecular structure in the CT images was assessed using three texture analysis techniques: Trabecular threshold area ratio (TTAR), fractal dimension without thresholding (OTS) and fractal dimension with thresholding (ITS). Finally, the maximum compressive strength (MCS) was determined using a biomechanical testing device.

A correlation of r = 0.76 (p < 0.01) was obtained for TTAR versus MCS, of r = 0.83 (p < 0.01) for ITS versus MCS, and of r = 0.35 (p > 0.01) for OTS versus MCS, while r = 0.76 (p < 0.01) was found for BMD versus MCS. Best results were obtained by combining structure measures and BMD (r = 0.85, p < 0.01).

This in vitro study showed a significant correlation between structure measures and biomechanical strength, which was comparable to BMD and strength. However, best correlations were obtained by combining both measures. Using both BMD and structure measures therefore may improve the prediction of biomechanically determined bone strength.
