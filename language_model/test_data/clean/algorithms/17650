In echo-planar-based diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), the evaluation of diffusion parameters such as apparent diffusion coefficients and anisotropy indices is affected by image distortions that arise from residual eddy currents produced by the diffusion-sensitizing gradients. Correction methods that coregister diffusion-weighted and non-diffusion-weighted images suffer from the different contrast properties inherent in these image types. Here, a postprocessing correction scheme is introduced that makes use of the inverse characteristics of distortions generated by gradients with reversed polarity. In this approach, only diffusion-weighted images with identical contrast are included for correction. That is, non-diffusion-weighted images are not needed as a reference for registration. Furthermore, the acquisition of an additional dataset with moderate diffusion-weighting as suggested by Haselgrove and Moore (Magn Reson Med 1996;36:960-964) is not required. With phantom data it is shown that the theoretically expected symmetry of distortions is preserved in the images to a very high degree, demonstrating the practicality of the new method. Results from human brain images are also presented.
