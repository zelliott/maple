Frequently, the assessment of the physical condition of a sportsman depends on the evaluation of different tests, based on biomechanical performance. The data acquisition in these tests is usually hand made, because its automatization is difficult. But when movements are constrained by means of their specific nature, simple tools can be used to achieve that data acquisition. In this paper, a simple and inexpensive system is described to make use of the timing capabilities of a personal computer (PC) to use it as a timer, with applications in biomechanics and sport training. The data acquisition method is based on a PC that, using a specific programming dealing with event timing, gets signals through the printer port, from a receptor device that detects cuts in an infrared cell beam. Low level procedures are provided that can be used in higher level algorithmic designs, problem dependent, to build specific systems. The case of the evaluation of the Wingate Anaerobic Test is discussed.
