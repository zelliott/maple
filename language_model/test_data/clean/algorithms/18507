A wide range of biophysical systems are described by nonlinear dynamic models mathematically presented as a set of ordinary differential equations in the Cauchy explicit form: [formula: see text] Fij(X1(t),..,XN(t),t), (i = 1,...,N, j = 1,...,M), where Fij (X1(t), ..., XN(t), t) is a set of basis functions satisfying the Lipschitz condition. We investigate the problem of evaluation of model constants aij (the system identification) using experimental data about the time dependence of the dynamic parameters of the system Xi(t). A new method of system identification for the class of similar nonlinear dynamic models is proposed. It is shown that the problem of identifying an initial nonlinear model can be reduced to the solution of a system of linear equations for the matrix of the dynamic model constants [aj]i. It is proposed to determine the set of dynamic model constants aij using the criterion of minimal quadratic discrepancy for the time dependence of the set of dynamic parameters Xi(t). An important special case of the nonlinear model, the quadratic model, is considered. Test problems of identification using this method are presented for two nonlinear systems: the Van der Pol type multiparametric nonlinear oscillator and the strange attractor of Ressler, a widely known example of dynamic systems showing the stochastic behavior.
