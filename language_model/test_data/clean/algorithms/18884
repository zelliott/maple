The equation of state for the monolayer with a fluid (G, LE)/condensed (LC) phase transition derived earlier (Fainerman, V.B.; Vollhardt, D. J. Phys. Chem. B 1999, 103, 145) in the framework of a quasichemical approach is generalized. A term is added that takes into account the entropy nonideality of mixing of the monomers and clusters of amphiphilic molecules. The results calculated from the proposed equations agree well with the experimental Pi-A isotherms obtained for various types of amphiphilic monolayers. The values of molecular areas of the amphiphilic molecules estimated from the fitting of experimental data to the proposed equation are quite similar to the real values. Another equation of state capable of describing the fluid state of insoluble monolayers and based on equations for the chemical potential of the solvent in the bulk phase and in the surface layer (Fainerman, V. B.; Vollhardt, D. J. Phys. Chem. B 2006, 110, 10436) is also generalized to be extended to the fluid/condensed phase transition region (A < A(c)), taking into account entropy nonideality for mixing solvent molecules, monomers, and clusters of amphiphilic molecules. The values calculated on this basis agree also well with the experimental data.
