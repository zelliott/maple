The aims of this study were to determine the predictors of CD4 count below 200 cells/microL and to propose an algorithm for antiretroviral therapy initiation; and to assess the determinants of immune response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in CÃ´te d'Ivoire.

A total of 615 consecutive patients attending an HIV/AIDS day hospital were enrolled in the study. We constructed a score system based on the results of a multivariate logistic regression analysis of the predictors of CD4 count <200 cells/microL with the intention of proposing an algorithm able to accurately designate patients eligible for HAART. We also identified factors associated with a short-term increase in CD4 count >50 cells/microL after HAART initiation.

Total lymphocyte count <1200 cells/microL (P<0.0001), lower haemoglobin levels (P<0.0001), and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) clinical stages C (P=0.005) and B (P=0.045), as compared with stage A, were associated with CD4 count <200 cells/microL. Nonetheless, no accurate algorithm for HAART initiation was found. Three hundred and three of the 615 patients were treated. Of these 303 patients, 79.5% showed an increase of >50 cells/microL in CD4 count 6 months after HAART initiation (median increase 128 cells/microL). Adherence >or=95% (P=0.022) and increase in absolute total lymphocyte count during follow-up (P<0.0001) were associated with a short-term positive immune response.

Our results support the effectiveness of generic drug combinations in sub-Saharan Africa. In order to enhance the management of HIV disease in sub-Saharan Africa, efforts should target the development of low-cost CD4 cell count laboratory tests.
