Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT) has been growing significantly in the past two decades as a promising tool for in-vivo and non-invasive imaging of tissues using near-infrared light. It can improve our ability to probe complex biologic interactions dynamically and to study disease and treatment responses over time in near real time. Recent advances on the transfer of techniques from laboratory to clinics have led to the development of various diagnostic applications such as imaging of the female breast and infant brain. The potential value of the promising tool, however, can be limited by the reconstruction time for tomographically imaging tissue optical properties. The current solution procedure in DOT consumes a considerable amount of time due to discretization of the problem domain and nonlinear nature of tissue optical properties. It is becoming ever more important to develop faster imaging tools as measurement data sets increase in size as a result of the application of newer generation instruments. Here we provide a fast solution strategy that significantly reduces imaging effort for DOT. The fast imaging strategy adopts advanced model-order reduction (MOR) techniques for reducing system complexity, while preserving (to the greatest possible extent) system input-output behavior for the forward problem. Our results demonstrate that the MOR-based imaging method can be an order of magnitude faster than the conventional approach while maintaining a relatively small error tolerance. The goal is to develop inexpensive, noninvasive imaging system that can run at patient's bedside in real time and produce data continuously over a long period of time.
