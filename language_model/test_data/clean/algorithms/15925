The description of a lifting strategy is typically provided in qualitative terms. A quantitative static descriptor or index differentiates the starting postures but not the primary moving segments. This technical note proposes an index that quantitatively characterizes different dynamic postural strategies employed during sagittal plane lifting. Dynamic lifting strategies are modeled in the velocity domain as different schemes of partitioning postural changes between the torso and leg segments. The index consists of two parameters, assigned to two leg segments, quantifying their contributions relative to the torso. Given a measured lifting movement, its index parameters values, ranging from 0.1 to 10, are estimated through an enumeration search process with the objective of minimizing the fitting error. The use of this index is illustrated by applying it to 24 lifting movements performed by six subjects assuming either a back-lift or a leg-lift strategy. Results indicate that a lifting strategy, in terms of whether the leg or the back is generally the prime mover, can be differentiated and visualized using this simple two-parameter index. In addition, indistinct intermediate strategies are also discerned, as the involvement of each segment in a lifting movement is quantified. The index is however limited in that it does not accommodate arm motion contributions to a lift nor possible time-dependent strategic changes during a lift. Potential future applications include time-efficient movement prediction and simulation for computerized biomechanical or ergonomic analysis.
