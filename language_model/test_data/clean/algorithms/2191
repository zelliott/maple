The obstetrics/gynecology department of York Hospital (York Health System, York, Pennsylvania) initiated a program to improve the processes of care and control costs for common women's and newborns' health care services. Twelve clinical policies were established between June 1993 and February 1995. CONDUCTING THE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT (QI) PROJECTS: Using the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) improvement cycle method, the QI group established clinical pathways for high-volume conditions or procedures known to have low rates of complications and clinical guidelines for those conditions or procedures not requiring coordinated efforts of a group of health care professionals. EXAMPLE--PYELONEPHRITIS IN PREGNANCY: The literature had indicated that the prevalence of pyelonephritis can be decreased by identifying and treating asymptomatic bacteriuria early in prenatal care. After the validity of the clinical policy was demonstrated in the resident service, the policy was extended to all private obstetric practices. Dissemination of the finding that most of the admissions for pyelonephritis were for referred patients (for whom we had no control over prenatal care) or for patients referred by private physicians who were not yet following the guidelines quickly led to complete compliance by our obstetricians and other health care providers referring patients to the York Health System.

The 12 clinical policies resulted in the elimination of 113 admissions and 5,595 inpatient days and in the reduction of the cost of patient care by $1,306,214 for the years 1994-1995 and 1995-1996 combined, without apparent adverse effects on patient health.

A voluntary clinical policies program can change the culture of a department and lead to cost-effectiveness and better quality of patient care.
