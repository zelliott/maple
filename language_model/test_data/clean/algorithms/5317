A system identification methodology based on Chebyshev spectral operators and an orthogonal system reduction algorithm is proposed, leading to a new approach for data-driven modeling of nonlinear spatiotemporal systems on nonperiodic domains. A continuous model structure is devised allowing for terms of arbitrary derivative order and nonlinearity degree. Chebyshev spectral operators are introduced to realm of inverse problems to discretize that continuous structure and arrive with spectral accuracy at a discrete form. Finally, least squares combined with an orthogonal system reduction algorithm are employed to solve for the parameters and eliminate the redundancies to achieve a parsimonious model. A numerical case study of identifying the Allen-Cahn metastable equation demonstrates the superior accuracy of the proposed Chebyshev spectral identification over its finite difference counterpart.
