The existence of a cutaneous pressure-induced vasodilation (PIV) has recently been reported. This paper proposes a signal processing methodology to improve PIV knowledge. Temporal variations of laser Doppler signals rhythmic activities are first analyzed on anesthetized rats. The results lead to a method that provides a better PIV understanding.
