The present report presents the final results of an empirical investigation initiated to establish operational definitions for schizophrenia and other non-affective psychoses of classical French nosology. For each category, the authors provide diagnostic criteria and algorithms. In addition, they propose a decision tree for the differential diagnosis of psychotic features included in the French classification of mental disorders.
