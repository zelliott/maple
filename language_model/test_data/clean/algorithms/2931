Globally, over half a million people develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) each year and an almost equal number die of it. Some aspects of HCC remain disappointingly unchanged. For example, hepatitis B infection, for which an effective safe vaccine has been developed, remains responsible for a substantial proportion of cases worldwide. Further, the overall survival of patients with HCC remains very low. Nevertheless, the past few years have witnessed several important advances in our understanding of risk factors, screening, as well as treatment of HCC; these advances may change some of the current realities for HCC. In this paper, we will review the epidemiology, screening, diagnosis, and treatment of HCC with special emphasis on recent developments such the role of fatty liver disease, obesity, and coffee may play in causing HCC, the recent guidelines in screening and diagnosis, and state-of-the-art treatment algorithms.
