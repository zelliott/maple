Abdominal wall dehiscence in renal transplantation patients risks the survival of the transplanted organ. No clear treatment algorithm exists in the literature for this group of patients.

Between 1992 and 2001, the Division of Plastic Surgery at the University of Maryland treated 41 of 2499 renal transplant patients. Based on a retrospective review of these patients, an algorithm was developed to guide the management of midline and lower quadrant abdominal wall defects.

Most lower quadrant defects were repaired with tensor fascia lata grafts. Most midline defects were repaired with the component separation technique. Use of a single- or multi-staged repair was based on the extent of infection. Hernia recurrence was 22% over 21 months. 80% of the transplant kidneys were functioning following repair.

An algorithm for the repair of abdominal wall defects after kidney transplantation is presented taking into account the location and the extent of infection.
