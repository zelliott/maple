Point distribution models (PDM) are one of the most extended methods to characterize the underlying population of set of samples, whose usefulness has been demonstrated in a wide variety of applications, including medical imaging. However, one important issue remains unsolved: the large number of training samples required. This problem becomes critical as the complexity of the problem increases, and the modeling of 3D multiobjects/organs represents one of the most challenging cases. Based on the 3D wavelet transform, this paper introduces a multiresolution hierarchical variant of PDM (MRH-PDM) able to efficiently characterize the different inter-object relationships, as well as the particular locality of each element separately. The significant advantage of this new method over two previous approaches in terms of accuracy has been successfully verified for the particular case of 3D subcortical brain structures.
