In recent years, displays and lighting require color temperature (CT) conversion function because observers have different preferences. This paper proposes effective methods to determine the optimal converting point of CT conversion for display and lighting application. For display application, the concepts of center of gravity and isotemperature line are applied to determine the optimal converting point. The maximal enhancement of luminance between the optimal and average is 18%. For lighting application, this paper proposes two methods to determine the optimal converting point in the CT quadrangle which complies with ANSI C78. 377. The enhancement of luminance in two CT modes (5700K and 6500K) are 14.2% and 23.6%, respectively.
