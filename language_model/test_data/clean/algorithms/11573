Functional limitation and scarring use to be common sequelaes of a burns injury in children. We report our initial experience with silicone gel (silastic gel shetting) in the treatment of 15 children with hypertrophic scars, without success to other alternatives therapies. Improvements in texture, colour and height of the lesion were noted in all cases.
