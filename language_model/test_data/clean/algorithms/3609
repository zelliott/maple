Batch and column kinetics of methylene blue and red basic 22 adsorption on CaCl(2) treated beech sawdust was investigated, using untreated beech sawdust as control, in order to explore its potential use as a low-cost adsorbent for wastewater dye removal. The adsorption capacity, estimated according to Freundlich's model, and the adsorption capacity coefficient values, determined using the Bohart and Adams' bed depth service model indicate that CaCl(2) treatment enhanced the adsorption properties of the original material.
