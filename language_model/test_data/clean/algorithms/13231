This paper describes an easy-to-implement three-dimensional (3-D) real-time shape measurement technique using our newly developed high-speed 3-D vision system. It employs only four projection fringes to realize full-field phase unwrapping in the presence of discontinuous or isolated objects. With our self-designed pattern generation hardware and a modified low-cost DLP projector, the four designed patterns can be generated and projected at a switching speed of 360 Hz. Using a properly synchronized high-speed camera, the high-speed fringe patterns distorted by measured objects can be acquired and processed in real-time. The resulting system can capture and display high-quality textured 3-D data at a speed of 120 frames per second, with the resolution of 640 Ã— 480 points. The speed can be trebled if a camera with a higher frame rate is employed. We detail our shape measurement technique, including the four-pattern decoding algorithm as well as the hardware design. Some evaluation experiments have been carried out to demonstrate the validity and practicability of the proposed technique.
