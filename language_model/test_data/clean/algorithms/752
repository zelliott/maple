Asthma is a common chronic disease that carries considerable costs both to the individual and to the NHS, despite the availability of effective treatments. All nurses will encounter patients with asthma during their professional careers; therefore, a basic understanding of asthma and its management is required. Asthma responds well to treatment, yet asthma deaths still occur. The variability of asthma symptoms requires the patient to bear the responsibility of disease management from day to day. Patient education is needed if asthma is to be managed well and, while inhaler devices provide an effective delivery system, inhaler technique needs to be taught and devices used correctly if maximum benefit is to be achieved. Personal asthma action plants improve asthma control, yet are currently underused. While compliance with long-term treatment is poor and the reasons for this are complex, understanding among healthcare professionals when managing asthma.
