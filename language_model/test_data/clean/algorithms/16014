The epidemiology and clinical pattern of sigmoid volvulus are well defined. Although clinical manifestations of acute volvulus are often clear-cut, diagnostic doubt is not uncommon and, if gangrene supervenes, mortality rises appreciably. While gangrene requires resectional surgery, the management of the viable colon related to a volvulus episode has a variety of options. These, particularly non-resectional alternatives, require more critical reappraisal in the light of advances in minimally invasive techniques.
