The application of 3D radial sampling of the free-induction decay to proton ultrashort echo-time (UTE) imaging is reported. The effects of T2 decay during signal acquisition on the 3D radial point-spread function are analyzed and compared to 2D radial and 1D sampling. It is found that in addition to the use of ultrashort TE, the proper choice of the acquisition-window duration TAQ is essential for imaging short-T2 components. For 3D radial sampling, a maximal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with negligible decay-induced loss in spatial resolution is obtained for an acquisition-window duration of TAQ approximately 0.69 T2. For 2D and 1D sampling, corresponding values are derived as well. Phantom measurements confirm the theoretical findings and demonstrate the impact of different acquisition-window durations on SNR and spatial resolution for a given T2 component. In vivo scans show the potential of 3D UTE imaging with T2-adapted sampling for musculoskeletal imaging using standard MR equipment. The visualization of complex anatomy is demonstrated by extracting curved slices from the isotropically resolved 3D UTE image data.
