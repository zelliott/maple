We study the effects of chaotic dynamics on atomic tunneling between two weakly coupled Bose-Einstein condensates driven by a double-frequency periodic field. Under the Melnikov's chaos criterion, we divide the parameter space into three parts of different types, regular region, low-chaoticity region, and high-chaoticity region, and give the accurate boundaries between the different regions. It is found that the atomic tunneling can be enhanced in the presence of chaos. Particularly, in the high-chaoticity regions, the chaos-induced inversion of the population imbalance is observed numerically.
