In vessels whose diameter is smaller than the length of the range cell or measurement volume, the maximum blood velocity is often calculated from the maximum frequency of the Doppler spectrum, using the classical Doppler equation. It is shown that the accuracy of this procedure is significantly improved at large beam-to-flow angles, if a correction for transit time broadening is made. This finding is based on the demonstration that the maximum frequency of the Doppler spectrum depends only on the maximum velocity passing through the measurement volume, but in a manner which is a function both of the Doppler shift frequency as well as the transit time broadening associated with the passage of scatterers through the beam width.
