A variety of chemicals are produced upon pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass. Aliphatic acids, aromatic acids, aldehydes, and phenolic compounds are of particular interest due to their presumed inhibitory influence on downstream enzymatic or microbial steps in biomass-to-ethanol conversion. Herein, we describe a series of analytical protocols that collectively enable quantitative monitoring of 40 potential fermentation inhibitors in biomass pretreatment samples. Solid samples are accommodated by first employing pressurized fluid extraction to generate an aqueous "wash stream." Sample preparation for liquids involves an initial precipitation-filtration step, followed by liquid-liquid extraction and reconstitution of extracts in water. Samples are analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in combination with ultraviolet (UV) absorbance and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) detection. A standard addition approach is utilized for quantitation to alleviate complications arising from co-extracted sample matrix.
