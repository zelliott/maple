Haemodynamic instability and respiratory failure are common in critically ill patients, with sepsis being a frequent cause. Echocardiography is a useful, practical and safe bedside tool for diagnosis and management of these problems. It provides real-time two-dimensional structural and functional imaging of the heart and vascular system. With Doppler techniques, it provides blood and tissue velocity information from which to derive haemodynamic data equivalent to those provided by conventional invasive haemodynamic monitoring. Its use can help determine whether, and when, continuous haemodynamic monitoring should be instituted. It is the best monitor for the management of sepsis because of its broad clinical utility and as a reference for the judicious use of invasive monitoring.
