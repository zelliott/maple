To determine how duration of observation affects estimation of incidence and prevalence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

SLE incidence and prevalence estimates from data periods as brief as 3 years (2001-2003) were compared to estimates from a 15-year period (1989-2003).

The 15-year period incidence was 5.6/100,000 (95% CI 5.0-6.1) and the prevalence was 59.1/100,000 (95% CI 57.4-60.8). When a 3-year period was used, incidence was overestimated by 238.1% and prevalence underestimated by 66.0%.

SLE incidence and prevalence estimates vary considerably according to the observation period; more than 5 years of data is likely required.
