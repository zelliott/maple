To evaluate the effect of cataract extraction on Swedish Interactive Thresholding Algorithm (SITA) perimetry in patients with coexisting cataract and glaucoma.

This is a retrospective noncomparative interventional study. Thirty-seven consecutive patients with open-angle glaucoma who had cataract extraction alone or combined with trabeculectomy were included. All patients had SITA-standard 24-2 visual fields before and after the surgery. The main outcome measures were changes in mean deviation (MD) and pattern standard deviation (PSD). Additionally, changes in best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and number of glaucoma medications were also studied.

Visual field tests were performed 3.9+/-4.4 months before surgery and 4.1+/-2.8 months after surgery. Mean visual acuity improved after the surgery, from 0.41+/-0.21 to 0.88+/-0.32 (P<0.001). After cataract extraction, SITA-standard mean MD improved from -12.3+/-5.8 to -11.1+/-6.3 (P=0.023), whereas the change in mean PSD was statistically nonsignificant (from 7.2+/-3.0 to 7.3+/-3.6; P=0.84).

In glaucoma patients examined with SITA-standard, MD improved but PSD change was statistically nonsignificant, after the cataract surgery. SITA-standard PSD can be used to monitor glaucoma progression in patients with coexisting glaucoma and cataract.
