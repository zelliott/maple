The D-bar algorithm based on Nachman's 2-D global uniqueness proof for the inverse conductivity problem (Nachman, 1996) is implemented on a chest-shaped domain. The scattering transform is computed on this chest-shaped domain using trigonometric and adjacent current patterns and the complete electrode model for the forward problem is computed with the finite element method in order to obtain simulated voltage measurements. The robustness and effectiveness of the method is demonstrated on a simulated chest with errors in input currents, output voltages, electrode placement, and domain modeling.
