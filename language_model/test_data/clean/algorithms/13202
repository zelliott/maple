Osteoporosis and hypogonadism are common in men with HIV infection. Ageing Male Symptoms (AMS) scale measures symptoms related to hypogonadism. FRAX provides 10-year probability of major fractures. We investigated the role of AMS scale combined with FRAX without bone mineral density (BMD), in identifying HIV men with bone fragility.

Cross-sectional observational study.

Fifty HIV-positive men treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy and 27 controls underwent hormonal evaluation, BMD scan and spine X-ray. The AMS questionnaire was administered.

Osteoporosis was found in 24·0% of HIV patients and in 3·7% of controls (P = 0·05). In HIV patients, 9 radiological vertebral fractures were found (none in controls, P = 0·04). Calculated free testosterone suggested hypogonadism in 26% of HIV patients vs 4% of controls (P = 0·04); an abnormal AMS score (≥27) was found in 62% HIV patients compared with 41% controls (P = 0·04). ROC curves showed that FRAX for major fracture had a 23% sensitivity and a 100% specificity in identifying HIV patients with bone fragility (P = 0·002, with the threshold of 7% at which bisphosphonate therapy is cost-effective). Considering a value of AMS ≥27, we obtained an 82·6% sensitivity and a 42·9% specificity (P = 0·04). The combination of AMS and FRAX score achieved a 77·3% sensitivity and a 69% specificity (P = 0·02, cut-off 34).

Combination of FRAX (without BMD) and AMS improved sensitivity of FRAX alone in identifying HIV patients at fracture risk, at the expense of reduced specificity.
