In ultrasonic non-destructive testing of materials with a coarse-grained structure the scattering from the grains causes backscattering noise, which masks flaw echoes in the measured signal. Several filtering methods have been proposed for improving the signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper we present a comparative study of methods based on the wavelet transform. Experiments with stationary, discrete and wavelet packet de-noising are evaluated by means of signal-to-noise ratio enhancement. Measured and simulated ultrasonic signals are used to verify the proposed de-noising methods. For comparison, we use signal-to-noise ratio enhancement related to fault echo amplitudes and filtering efficiency specific for ultrasonic signals. The best results in our setup were achieved with the wavelet packet de-noising method.
