The primary aim of this study was to determine whether optimized photodynamic therapy (PDT) treatment planning (seeking optimized positions, lengths, and strengths of the light sources to satisfy a given dose prescription) can improve dose coverage to the prostate and the sparing of critical organs relative to what can be achieved by the standard PDT plan. The Cimmino algorithm and search procedures based on that algorithm were tested for this purpose. A phase I motexafin lutetium (MLu)-mediated photodynamic therapy protocol is ongoing at the University of Pennsylvania. PDT for the prostate is performed with cylindrical diffusing fibers of various lengths inserted perpendicular to a base plate to obtain longitudinal coverage by a matrix of parallel catheters. The standard plan for the protocol uses sources of equal strength with equal spaced (1-cm) loading. Uniform optical properties were assumed. Our algorithms produce plans that cover the prostate and spare the urethra and rectum with less discrepancy from the dose prescription than the standard plan. The Cimmino feasibility algorithm is fast enough that changes to the treatment plan may be made in the operating room before and during PDT to optimize light delivery.
