This paper intends to an integrated view of the spectral analysis techniques in the detection of arterial disorders. The paper includes illustrative information about feature extraction from signals recorded from arteries. Short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and wavelet transform (WT) were used for spectral analysis of ophthalmic arterial (OA) Doppler signals. Using these spectral analysis methods, the variations in the shape of the Doppler spectra as a function of time were presented in the form of sonograms in order to obtain medical information. These sonograms were then used to compare the applied methods in terms of their frequency resolution and the effects in determination of OA stenosis. The author suggest that the content of the paper will assist to the people in gaining a better understanding of the STFT and WT in the detection of arterial disorders.
