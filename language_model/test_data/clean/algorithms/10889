The follow-up of renal cancer is essentially based on thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT). The duration of this follow-up and the frequency of examinations depend on the patient's level of risk. Early detection of metastases has a limited therapeutic value at the present time, apart from tumours with a good prognosis or for the management of complications. Recent publications on targeted treatments raise new hopes and may lead to a modification of follow-up guidelines.
