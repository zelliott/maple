Growing interest in stratified medicine is leading to increasing importance of subgroup analyses in confirmatory clinical trials. Conventionally, confirmatory clinical trials either focus on a subgroup identified in advance or assess subgroup effects once the trial is completed. The focus of this article is methodology for adaptive clinical trials that both identify whether a treatment is particularly effective in a predefined subgroup, potentially enabling alteration of recruitment, and assess the effectiveness in the subgroup and/or whole population. Methods for such adaptive trials are described and compared, and the logistical and regulatory issues associated with such approaches are discussed.
