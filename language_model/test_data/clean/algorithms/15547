In general, a detailed history and examination of the patient provides sufficient information for diagnosis. The pattern, frequency, and natural history of ulcer episodes are helpful. The presence or absence of associated features and the site of oral involvement guides most physicians accurately in the diagnosis. Additional investigations, including blood tests, and occasionally the use of oral cultures or biopsy, are needed to make a definitive diagnosis. A multispecialty approach is often necessary to evaluate patients with other systemic features. Most acute oral ulcers heal spontaneously without specific therapy being necessary, but an understanding of the cause of the ulcer is reassuring to the patient and guides the clinician in management to prevent recurrent episodes of oral ulceration, or chronicity of ulcers.
