In this paper, we consider the pinning control problem of fractional-order weighted complex dynamical networks. The well-studied integer-order complex networks are the special cases of the fractional-order ones. The network model considered can represent both directed and undirected weighted networks. First, based on the eigenvalue analysis and fractional-order stability theory, some local stability properties of such pinned fractional-order networks are derived and the valid stability regions are estimated. A surprising finding is that the fractional-order complex networks can stabilize itself by reducing the fractional-order q without pinning any node. Second, numerical algorithms for fractional-order complex networks are introduced in detail. Finally, numerical simulations in scale-free complex networks are provided to show that the smaller fractional-order q, the larger control gain matrix D, the larger tunable weight parameter beta, the larger overall coupling strength c, the more capacity that the pinning scheme may possess to enhance the control performance of fractional-order complex networks.
