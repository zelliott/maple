A computer simulation has been performed to study the influence of the pulse pressure variation on the arterial compliance readings in regard to different calculation techniques and arterial wall elastic properties. We applied the derivative- and amplitude-based (delta-based) calculation techniques to the model of the pressure vs. arterial lumen area relationship of different arteries. The simulated pulse pressure increase resulted in an essential reduction of the delta-based compliance in its near maximum region, and in an increase or no change outside this region. In the case of the relationship of a lower steepness the alterations were smaller.
