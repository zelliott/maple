To propose an algorithm for the preoperative management of patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and review the surgical outcomes in such patients.

This prospective cohort study involved 71 patients with OSAS who underwent presurgical upper airway endoscopy and cephalometry before being assigned to treatment categories based on the site(s) of obstruction, the pattern of collapse, the characteristics of the soft tissue, the air space between the base of the tongue and the posterior wall of the pharynx, and the severity of OSAS. Six months after surgery, they were followed up using polysomnography and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The pre- and postsurgical data were compared using a paired Student t test.

The mean preoperative apnea/hypopnea index of the 71 patients (61 male and 10 female) was 40.98 events/hour (range, 14.7 to 87.6 events/hr), and the mean postoperative apnea/hypopnea index was 13.96 events/hour (range, 0 to 20 events/hr). The difference was statistically significant (P < .001).

This algorithm was developed on the principle that every patient with OSAS should be considered individually. In the authors' opinion, taking into account the number, site(s), pattern, and degree of the collapse/obstruction is a reasonable means of ensuring the correct diagnosis and treatment.
