Effective programming of the rate-drop response algorithm requires careful attention to the heart rate and blood pressure responses seen during diagnostic tilt testing. In order to undertake effective programming, additional tilt testing procedures may be necessary, and it is vital that the protocol should be identical on each occasion and very careful note taken of exact times of onset of symptoms and relative timing of onset of changes in heart rate and blood pressure. The algorithm settings in the Thera DR generator as delivered (factory or "shelf" parameter settings) must be considered nontherapeutic (an unusual situation for a pacemaker algorithm) and will require adjustment for each individual patient. Effective therapeutic settings are likely to result in an excess of pacing interventions; these, however, tend to be less symptomatic than the syncope or presyncope suffered by the patient and are generally well tolerated or not noticed.
