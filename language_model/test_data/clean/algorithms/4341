Preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) guided wire localization is a frequently used tool to target MR-only visible breast lesions. Different techniques are available. Targeting can be performed using automated software or a manual approach. Aim of this study therefore was to compare manually and automated software assisted wire localization of suspicious breast lesions regarding to image time and accurate positioning.

60 females with suspicious breast lesions underwent MR-guided wire localization. In 30 patients a manual target calculation and in another 30 patients a software calculated approach was used. Time measurements for MR imaging as well as calculation of the target coordinates were performed. Furthermore size measurements of (i) lesions, (ii) distance to wire anchor as well as, (iii) distance to skin were performed. A Mann-Whitney-test was used for statistical evaluation.

Total imaging time was shorter for the automated software calculated approach but failed to show a statistical significant difference (p=0.13). Time for localization of the lesions was significantly shorter for the software based method (p<0.001). Lesion sizes, distances to wire anchor and skin showed no statistically significant differences.

Preoperative MR-guided wire localization of suspicious lesions that are accessible horizontally, a manually or automated software generated target calculation can be used. As MR guided wire localization of breast lesions needs its time in total, a minimal time consuming approach and therefore an automated software calculated targeting (if available) should be preferred.
