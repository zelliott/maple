As the needs for various kinds of body surface information are wide-ranging, we developed an imaging-sensor integrated system that can synchronously acquire high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) far-infrared (FIR) thermal and true-color images of the body surface. The proposed system integrates one FIR camera and one color camera with a 3D structured light binocular profilometer. To eliminate the emotion disturbance of the inspector caused by the intensive light projection directly into the eye from the LCD projector, we have developed a gray encoding strategy based on the optimum fringe projection layout. A self-heated checkerboard has been employed to perform the calibration of different types of cameras. Then, we have calibrated the structured light emitted by the LCD projector, which is based on the stereo-vision idea and the least-squares quadric surface-fitting algorithm. Afterwards, the precise 3D surface can fuse with undistorted thermal and color images. To enhance medical applications, the region-of-interest (ROI) in the temperature or color image representing the surface area of clinical interest can be located in the corresponding position in the other images through coordinate system transformation. System evaluation demonstrated a mapping error between FIR and visual images of three pixels or less. Experiments show that this work is significantly useful in certain disease diagnoses.
