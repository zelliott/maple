Logic models are graphic representations of the relationship between program activities and their intended effects and are used for both program planning and evaluation. Logic models can provide an important foundation for program evaluation by identifying evaluation questions that most appropriately assess program processes and outcomes and by guiding measurement decisions. We demonstrate how logic models can be used to plan program evaluation by describing the adoption of logic modeling by the Washington State Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention Program (WaHDSPP) and by specifying the changes in process and use of logic models since the program's initial funding. Our paper describes how a logic model was used in generating the program evaluation plan for the WaHDSPP, including the identification of evaluation questions and development of indicators to track progress effectively. We describe the use of evaluation results, as well as steps state programs can take to use logic models in program evaluation.
