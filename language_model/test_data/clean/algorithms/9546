Lead fracture is one of the major complications in implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy often leading to a series of inadequate shocks and thus greatly impairing quality of life of patients. The novel lead integrity alert algorithm by Medtronic (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) is addressing this problem. We report a case of a lead failure being correctly predicted by shifting lead impedances about 4 weeks before the first episode of oversensing. Additionally, our case illustrates the new problem of how to clinically handle a patient with a highly probable, but not completely certain, ICD-lead failure.
