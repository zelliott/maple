The contemporary virtual engineering environment enables a wide range of optimization procedures. The geometrical shape optimization is one of the most important tasks in this area. In the paper the trabecular bone surface remodeling process is formulated in terms of structural optimization and on the basis of this formulation the optimization algorithm useful in mechanical design is proposed. The developed system, based on the functional adaptation phenomenon is able to mimic trabeculae topology evolution, and enables investigations concerning different scenarios of bone remodeling. Some computation results of trabecular bone functional adaptation as well as mechanical design optimization, using the developed system are presented.
