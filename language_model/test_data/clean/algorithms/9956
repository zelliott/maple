An empirical model was developed to interpret differences in the experimentally measured reflectance and fluorescence spectra of freshly excised human pancreatic tissues: normal, adenocarcinoma, and pancreatitis (inflammation). The model provided the first quantitative links between spectroscopic measurements and histological characteristics in the human pancreas. The reflectance model enabled the first (to our knowledge) extraction of wavelength resolved absorption and reduced scattering coefficients for normal and diseased human pancreatic tissues. The fluorescence model employed reflectance information to extract attenuation free "intrinsic" endogenous fluorescence spectra from normal pancreatic tissue, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and pancreatitis. The method developed is simple, intuitive, and potentially useful for a range of applications in optical tissue diagnostics. This approach is potentially applicable to in vivo studies, because it can account for the absorptive effects of blood in tissues.
