In the present study we evaluated the performance of a flow cytometry-based algorithm as a new serological approach to detect antibodies to T. gondii and specific IgG avidity to diagnose acute toxoplasmosis. The results showed that using FC-AFTA-IgM assay, all serum samples from patients with acute toxoplasmosis demonstrated seropositivity, whereas 90% of patients with chronic infection and 100% of non-infected individuals presented negative results. Thus, only 10% of patients with chronic toxoplasmosis showed residual IgM, in contrast with other methodologies used to diagnosis acute toxoplasmosis. On the order hand, FC-AFTA-IgG assay as well as FC-AFTA-IgG subclasses is unlikely to discriminate acute from chronic toxoplasmosis. We have also evaluated the performance of FC-AFTA-IgG avidity as a tool to exclude chronic toxoplasmosis in patients with positive FC-AFTA-IgM. Our data showed an excellent performance of FC-AFTA-IgG avidity employing the cut-off of 60% for Avidity Index (AI) with sensitivity and specificity of 100%. All serum samples from patients presenting acute toxoplasmosis showed low avidity index (AIâ‰¤60%), whereas all chronic patients showed high avidity index (AI>60%). The outstanding performance indexes of this novel flow cytometry-based algorithm support its use as a non-conventional alternative serological approach to diagnose human acute toxoplasmosis.
