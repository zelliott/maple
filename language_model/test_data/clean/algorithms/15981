The inhibition of the catechol oxidase activity exhibited by three dinuclear copper(II) complexes, derived from different diaminotetrabenzimidazole ligands, by kojic acid [5-hydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)-gamma-pyrone] has been studied. The catalytic mechanism of the catecholase reaction proceeds in two steps and for both of these inhibition by kojic acid is of competitive type. The inhibitor binds strongly to the dicopper(II) complex in the first step and to the dicopper-dioxygen adduct in the second step, preventing in both cases the binding of the catechol substrate. Binding studies of kojic acid to the dinuclear copper(II) complexes and a series of mononuclear analogs, carried out spectrophotometrically and by NMR, enable us to propose that the inhibitor acts as a bridging ligand between the metal centers in the dicopper(II) catalysts.
