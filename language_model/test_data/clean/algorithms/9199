In recent years, development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) drug therapy has been more directly targeted to counteract specific mechanisms of inflammation, and it is now believed that early aggressive treatment with disease modifying drugs is important to inhibit future structural joint damage. The development of these new treatments has increased the need for methodologies to assess disease activity in RA and monitor the effectiveness of drug therapy. Unlike X-ray, which shows only structural bone damage, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can depict soft tissue damage and synovitis, the primary pathology of RA. Recent studies have also indicated that MRI is sensitive to pathophysiologic changes that may predate radiographic erosions and may predict future joint damage. In this study, we have developed a computer automated analysis technique for MR wrist images that provides an objective measure of RA synovitis. This method applies a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model to every voxel of a dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) dataset and outputs resulting parametric images. The aim of this technique is to not only objectively quantify the severity of rheumatoid synovitis, but to also locally determine where areas of serious disease activity are situated through kinetic modeling of blood-tissue exchange. Preliminary results show good correlation to early enhancement rate, which has previously been shown to be a useful clinical marker of RA activity. However, the use of tracer kinetic modeling methods potentially provides more specific information regarding underlying RA physiology. This approach could provide a useful new tool in RA patient management and could substantially improve RA therapeutic studies by calculating objective biomarkers of the disease state.
