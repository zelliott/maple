In the clinical practice, diagnostics with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with knee trauma is performed at different times after the injury. This is due to the limited availability of MRI. Related causes, but also clinical considerations, cause the performing of arthroscopy in a different time from the MRI examination. To assess whether the time that elapses between the injury and MRI has an impact on the magnetic resonance diagnostic ability and whether it is affected by the time interval between MRI and arthroscopy. The results of the MRI and arthroscopy were analyzed in the group of 128 patients, 56 (44%) women and 72 (56%) men aged 12.9-62.5 years (mean 30.6) after the knee trauma. Next, the group of patients was divided depends on whether MRI examination was performed in shorter or longer time then 6 weeks after the trauma, into two subgroups: 52 patients (21 women and 31 men) with recent injury and 76 patients (35 woman and 41 men) with inveterate injury. Moreover, the group of patients was divided into two subgroups: 60 patients (26 women and 34 men) with the time between MRI examination and arthroscopy no longer than 30 days and group of 68 patients (30 women and 38 men) with time of waiting for arthroscopy longer than 30 days. Damage to the structures of the knee observed in MRI were classified in terms of location and severity. We compared the diagnostic ability of MRI and arthroscopy in the presence and severity of posttraumatic lesions of the knee. The statistical significance of presence of the injury in MRI and arthroscopy was estimated by the X2 test. Statistical analysis of the structures of the knee joint which are most commonly damaged after the trauma, which means both menisci and the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) - was performed in whole group and separately in each subgroup. The results were compared between corresponding subgroups, and also between each subgroup and whole group. The diagnostic efficacy indices were compared using the test for differences between two structure indicators. The estimation of statistically significant differences was performed at the level of p<or=0.05. There was no statistically significant differences betweeen the indicators of the efficacy of MRI in recent and inveterate injuries, and also with increased delay between the MRI and arthroscopy examinations. Increasing the time between the injury and the MRI examination does not reduced the diagnostic efficacy of this methods. Increasing the time inverval between MRI and arthsroscopy does not matter about the compatibility of the results received in both techniques.
