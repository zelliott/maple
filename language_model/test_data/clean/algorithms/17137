An algorithm developed for diagnostic invasive sonography is presented. It was used in examining 350 patients. 385 manipulations were performed under ultrasound control in relation to 371 pathologic objects. A technical efficiency ranging from 97 to 100% was achieved for the various manipulations. This algorithm helps in finding the specific approach to each case on the basis of clinical data available, the characteristic of the pathologic object, and its localisation by organs and regions thus avoiding any risks and complications and achieving the planned target for the chosen manipulation.
