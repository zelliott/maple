Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, -C, -B, -DRB1 and -DQB1 alleles were typed in 200 Polish healthy volunteers recruited for stem cell donor registry, using sequence-specific primer (SSP) and direct sequencing-based methods. Enhanced Bayesian approach of expectation maximization algorithm provided by phase platform was used for extended HLA haplotype inferences. The numbers of identified alleles (four-digit resolution) were 23, 23, 44, 27 and 18 alleles in HLA-A, -C, -B, -DRB1 and -DQB1 loci, respectively, of both northern and southern European frequency characteristics. The most frequent extended haplotypes were Cw*0701-B*0801-DRB1*0301-DQB1*0201 and Cw*0702-B*0702-DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602, found in 25 and 23 copies, respectively, in 400 tested chromosomes. The extended haplotype found in the Polish population with higher frequency than in other European population was A*2501-Cw*1203-B*1801-DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 (six copies) and especially its class I fragment (14 copies). The neighbour-joining and correspondence analyses showed Central and northern European genetic affinities of Polish population. In most cases, the observed European allele and haplotype gradients display smooth topography around Polish population. Poles along with Western Slavs have their specific contribution in the demographic history of Europe. Our results will intensify the use of population data in stem cell donor search and can potentially improve current algorithms, facilitating selection of acceptable donors for patients in need of stem cell transplant.
