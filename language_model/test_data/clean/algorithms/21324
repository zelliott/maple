Changes in the concentration of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were examined by the push-pull perfusion method after intravenous (i.v.) administration of the peptide in conscious and pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. The concentration of endogenous TRH in the perfusate was not changed during the 160-min perfusion period and was similar to that in the CSF (0.92 +/- 0.26 ng/ml) collected before the perfusion in conscious as well as in anesthetized rats. After i.v. administration of TRH (5 mg/kg) to the conscious rats, the peptide concentration in the perfusate increased to 42.23 +/- 14.33 ng/ml during the first 20 min and gradually returned to the basal level 2 hr after administration. The total amount of TRH detected in the perfusate was 20.0 ng. It was reduced by 75% in the anesthetized animals. The increases in blood pressure and heart rate, seen after i.v. as well as intracerebroventricular administration of TRH in the conscious rats, was significantly inhibited in the anesthetized rats. These results indicate that systemically administered TRH exerts its cardiovascular effect at central site(s), and that the transportation and the effect of the peptide is suppressed by pentobarbital anesthesia.
