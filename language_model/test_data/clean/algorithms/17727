To use the social welfare function to decide on allocation of resources between smoking cessation methods and lovastatin treatment of hypercholesterolaemia for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease.

Three smoking cessation therapies (medical advice, nicotine gum and nicotine patch) were considered in smokers, and lovastatin 20, 40 and 80 mg/day was considered in individuals with hypercholesterolaemia (total cholesterol > 7.24 mmol/L [> 270 mg/dL]). Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to obtain parameter epsilon determining the exact form of the social welfare function in Catalonia, Spain. The preferable strategy was to give higher priority to the intervention that used one smoking cessation method and lovastatin treatment for hypercholesterolaemia and that was associated with a value of epsilon consistent with the social welfare function.

A value of 1.58 (95% CI: 0.75-2.84) was obtained for parameter epsilon of the social welfare function, showing a nonutilitarian form. A higher priority should be given, based on the social welfare function, to the intervention using medical advice for smoking cessation and lovastatin 20-80 mg/day for hypercholesterolaemia, since this approach was associated with epsilon values of 2.8-2.9 in men and 1.8-2.4 in women, while interventions using nicotine substitution therapies were associated with epsilon values of < 0.9 in men and < 0.4 in women. The cost of treating all smokers and individuals with hypercholesterolaemia was 35% lower using medical advice for smoking cessation and lovastatin 20 mg/day, which was associated with epsilon values of 2.9 in men and 2.4 in women, than using a utilitarian solution consisting of nicotine patches for smoking cessation and lovastatin 20 mg/day.

These results show that higher priority should be given to lovastatin treatment of hypercholesterolaemia than to nicotine substitution treatments for smoking cessation, based on cost effectiveness and the social welfare function. The study also showed the applicability of this method to decisions about resource allocation between competing treatments when society has a nonutilitarian social welfare function.
