In this paper, we use an adapted multi-objective version of the differential evolution (DE) metaheuristics for the design and generation of reliable DNA libraries that can be used for computation. DNA sequence design is a very relevant task in many recent research fields, e.g. nanotechnology or DNA computing. Specifically, DNA computing is a new computational model which uses DNA molecules as information storage and their possible biological interactions as processing operators. Therefore, the possible reactions and interactions among molecules must be strictly controlled to prevent incorrect computations. The design of reliable DNA libraries for bio-molecular computing is an NP-hard combinatorial problem which involves many heterogeneous and conflicting design criteria. For this reason, we modelled DNA sequence design as a multiobjective optimization problem and we solved it by using an adapted multi-objective version of DE metaheuristics. Seven different bio-chemical design criteria have been simultaneously considered to obtain high quality DNA sequences which are suitable for molecular computing. Furthermore, we have developed the multiobjective standard fast non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) in order to perform a formal comparative study by using multi-objective indicators. Additionally, we have also compared our results with other relevant results published in the literature. We conclude that our proposal is a promising approach which is able to generate reliable real-world DNA sequences that significantly improve other DNA libraries previously published in the literature.
