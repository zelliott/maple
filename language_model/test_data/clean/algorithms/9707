A recent clinical trial revealed that highly purified eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, reduces the incidence of cardiovascular diseases. However, the detailed mechanism underlying the anti-atherogenic effect of EPA is still poorly understood. In this study, we examined the effect of EPA on cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI), a new index of arterial stiffness that is less influenced by blood pressure (BP), as well as on serum amyloid A-low-density lipoprotein (SAA-LDL), an oxidized LDL (oxLDL), in the metabolic syndrome. Ninety-two obese Japanese subjects with metabolic syndromes were randomly divided into two groups (n=46): the EPA-treated group (1.8 g administered daily for 3 months) and the control group. Measurements were taken to assess the changes in glucose-lipid metabolism, SAA-LDL, C-reactive protein (CRP), leptin, adiponectin and pulse wave velocity (PWV), and CAVI. EPA treatment significantly reduced the levels of immunoreactive insulin, triglycerides, SAA-LDL, CRP, PWV and CAVI and increased the levels of adiponectin relative to the control group for 3 months (P<0.05). Stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that the only significant determinant for a decrease in CAVI by EPA is a reduction in SAA-LDL (P<0.05). Moreover, the EPA-induced reduction of SAA-LDL was only significantly correlated with a decrease in total cholesterol and an increase in adiponectin (P<0.05). This study is the first demonstration that EPA improves arterial stiffness and is less influenced by BP, possibly through the suppression of SAA-LDL, thereby leading to a reduction in the frequency of cardiovascular disease development in metabolic syndrome.
