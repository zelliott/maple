Cone-beam (CB) computed tomography (CT) is widely used in the field of medical imaging for guidance. Inspired by Betram's directional interpolation (BDI) methods, directional sinogram interpolation (DSI) was implemented to generate more CB projections by optimized (iterative) double-orientation estimation in sinogram space and directional interpolation. A new CBCT was subsequently reconstructed with the Feldkamp algorithm using both the original and interpolated CB projections. The proposed method was evaluated on both phantom and clinical data, and image quality was assessed by correlation ratio (CR) between the interpolated image and a gold standard obtained from full measured projections. Additionally, streak artifact reduction and image blur were assessed. In a CBCT reconstructed by 40 acquired projections over an arc of 360 degree, streak artifacts dropped 20.7% and 6.7% in a thorax phantom, when our method was compared to linear interpolation (LI) and BDI methods. Meanwhile, image blur was assessed by a head-and-neck phantom, where image blur of DSI was 20.1% and 24.3% less than LI and BDI. When our method was compared to LI and DI methods, CR increased by 4.4% and 3.1%. Streak artifacts of sparsely acquired CBCT were decreased by our method and image blur induced by interpolation was constrained to below other interpolation methods.
