Although evidence-based practice exists to apply the principles of safe patient handling and movement (SPHM) to prevent nursing musculoskeletal injuries in the workplace, nurses and nursing staff continue to use "body mechanics" when moving, lifting, and transferring patients. In this day of a nursing shortage, one that will continue to worsen, valued professionals must remain on the job and free from preventable, work-related injuries. As states enact laws requiring health care facilities to develop and institute SPHM programs, hospitals will be held to task to produce SPHM policies, procedures, plans, and protocols in their institutions.
