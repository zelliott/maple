Cytochrome P4503A4 (CYP3A4) is the principal drug-metabolizing enzyme in human liver. Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) caused by induction of CYP3A4 can result in decreased exposure to coadministered drugs, with potential loss of efficacy. Immortalized hepatocytes (Fa2N-4 cells) have been proposed as a tool to identify CYP3A4 inducers. The purpose of the current studies was to characterize the effect of known inducers on CYP3A4 in Fa2N-4 cells, and to determine whether these in vitro data could reliably project the magnitude of DDIs caused by induction. Twenty-four compounds were chosen for these studies, based on previously published data using primary human hepatocytes. Eighteen compounds had been shown to be positive for induction, and six compounds had been shown to be negative for induction. In Fa2N-4 cells, all 18 positive controls produced greater than 2-fold maximal CYP3A4 induction, and all 6 negative controls produced less than 1.5-fold maximal CYP3A4 induction. Subsequent studies were conducted to determine the relationship between in vitro induction data and in vivo induction response. The approach was to relate in vitro induction data (E(max) and EC(50) values) with efficacious free plasma concentrations to calculate a relative induction score. This score was then correlated with decreases in area under the plasma concentration versus time curve values for coadministered CYP3A4 object drugs (midazolam or ethinylestradiol) from previously published clinical DDI studies. Excellent correlations (r(2) values >0.92) were obtained, suggesting that Fa2N-4 cells can be used for identification of inducers as well as prediction of the magnitude of clinical DDIs.
