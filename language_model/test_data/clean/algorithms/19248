As a tool in clinical decision making, algorithms deserve careful consideration. The potential use or abuse of algorithms in rationing health care renders such consideration essential. In radiology and medical imaging, algorithms have been applied as teaching tools in the conference room setting. These teaching decision trees, however, may not be applicable in the clinical situation. If an algorithmic approach to clinical radiology is pursued, several issues should be considered. Specifically, the application, design, designer, economics, and universality of the algorithms must be addressed. As an alternative to the wide dissemination of clinical algorithms, the authors propose the development of consensus opinions among specialists and the promulgation of the principle of radiologist-consultant-decision maker. A decision team is preferable to a decision tree.
