Long-term experience of acupuncture applications at 9 specialized centers, and analysis of over 30,000 cases have allowed development of original algorithms for prescribing acupuncture therapy on the principles of "energetic" balance of meridians, functional indicators and specific effects of acupoints, anatomical location, segmental sensory innervation of pathological foci, and optimal combination of the corporeal acupoints with the microacupuncture systems. This served as the basis for the creation of computer software to increase the efficiency of acupuncture treatment used by a wide range of practitioners.
