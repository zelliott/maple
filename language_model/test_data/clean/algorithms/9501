In this article, we demonstrate a single-scan method to measure an average flow velocity vector along an arbitrary direction. This method is based on the MMME sequence and utilizes static and pulsed magnetic field gradients along multiple directions for the optimal determination of flow velocity components in three-dimensional space. Experimentally measured average flow velocities from the flow induced phase shift with a single-scan MMME sequence show excellent agreements with the known flow rate, and the signal decay of each echo due to a velocity distribution is also quantitatively verified with known laminar flow patterns.
