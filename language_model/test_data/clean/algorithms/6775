We report initial results of a new method for obtaining mass spectra of involatile compounds: laser desorption electron attachment time-of-flight mass spectrometry. With this approach, laser desorbed neutral molecules are entrained in a molecular beam and subsequently ionized by low energy electron attachment. Mass analysis is carried out by a linear time-of-flight. We present a description of the apparatus and a number of examples of our early results on: van der Waals condensates of SF6, Fullerenes, derivatized Fullerenes, perfluorinated polyethers, polyphenylethers, and 5-bromouracil.
