A adaptive robust control of postoperative hypertension is presented to reduce the mean arterial blood pressure using vasoactive drugs. It is shown that the control algorithm provides stability-guaranteed regulation subject to infusion rate saturation. Simulation results under clinical conditions show that the control system exhibits strong robustness and is capable of reducing blood pressure.
