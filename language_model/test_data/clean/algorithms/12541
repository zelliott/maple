In addition to evoked responses, which are phase-locked to the stimuli, the stimulation may also change the ongoing EEG in a time-locked manner. This change has been investigated in event-related synchronization/desynchronization (ERS/ERD) studies by comparing the spectra before and during stimulation or alternatively by using the intertrial variance method (IVM). In the present work, a technique based on the coherence estimate (kappa(y)(2)(f)) between the stimulation signal and the EEG is proposed for separating the ongoing EEG activity spectrum from that of the evoked responses. Furthermore, a statistical criterion is applied to reduce spurious spectral peaks. The performance of this procedure was assessed through simulation and illustrated with EEG during photic stimulation. For simulated data (signal-to-noise-ratio of 0.995 within 10-12.5 Hz) kappa(y)(2)(f) led to a non-phase-locked spectrum estimate with an average normalized error of 12.4%, which is reduced to only 0.2% after applying the statistical criterion. The methodology proposed is asymptotically equivalent to the IVM but it does not require previous filtering the EEG data. Kappa(y)(2)(f) together with the statistical correction criterion allows investigating the entrainment within a narrow-band range, particularly in frequencies close to that of the alpha peak. Hence it is useful in ERS/ERD studies. Moreover, it can be also used for characterizing frequencies within the gamma band.
