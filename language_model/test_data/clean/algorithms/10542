Approximately 85% of all malignant tumors of the kidney are renal cell carcinomas (RCC). Sonography is the leading examination for early detection of kidney tumors. The treatment of RCC has been enriched in recent years by new therapeutic options for localized and metastatic cancer. The classification of RCC is based on TNM and UICC criteria. The so-called Motzer criteria are being increasingly employed to assess prognosis and monitor therapy and as the basis for reaching decisions on choosing the type of systemic treatment.
