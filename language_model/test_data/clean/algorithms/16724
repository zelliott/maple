In application of the (31)P selectively refocused insensitive nuclei enhanced polarization transfer (srINEPT) technique to the detection of phosphomono- and diesters in tissues, homonuclear couplings between the CH(2)O protons and the NCH(2) protons seriously attenuate the sensitivity. These couplings can be conventionally removed by two soft 180° pulses in the (1)H evolution period which selectively invert the NCH(2) magnetizations. However, the srINEPT pulse sequence can be simplified by replacing the pulse train "soft 180°-hard 180°-soft 180°" with a single soft 180° pulse that selectively inverts the CH(2)O magnetizations. Theoretical analysis in this study demonstrates the correctness of this approach in principle. Validation on a milk phantom allowed us to investigate and discuss advantages and disadvantages of the proposed srINEPT with respect to the original srINEPT. Furthermore, comparison of different selective pulses made it possible to demonstrate that the proposed srINEPT experiment is not sensitive to errors in pulse length, offset, and B(1) field strength of the selective pulse when ReBurp pulse is used for selective refocusing.
