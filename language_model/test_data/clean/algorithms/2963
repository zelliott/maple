A set of sensitive methyl-detected 'out-and-back' NMR experiments for simultaneous assignments of Alabeta and Ilegamma2 methyl positions in large proteins is described. The developed methodology is applied to an 82-kDa enzyme Malate Synthase G. Complete alanine beta and isoleucine gamma2 1H-13C methyl chemical shift assignments could be obtained from the set of new methyl-detected 'out-and-back' 3D experiments. The described methodology for methyl assignments should be applicable to protein molecules within approximately 100-kDa molecular weight range irrespective of the labeling strategy chosen to produce selectively protonated Alabeta and Ilegamma2 13CH3 sites on a deuterated background.
