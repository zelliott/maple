This paper presents the results obtained in a comparison of three neutron spectrum unfolding procedures based on the SAND, MINCHI and UNFANA computer programs. The calculations were performed with data obtained previously from measurements using the PTB Bonner sphere spectrometer and taken from the literature; the neutron dosimetry was done with the Leake rem-meter. The evaluation of some spectrum hardness quantifiers is also reported. The codes give comparable neutron spectrum results. Relative to ambient dose equivalent derived from the Bonner sphere system, as a function of the unfolding code used, the Leake calculated readings were typically 1.16 to 1.91 and 1.58 to 2.69 times larger for the environment of a transport cask with spent fuel elements (Clab) and inside the containment building of a pressurised water reactor (Ring-G), respectively, depending on the calibration fields.
