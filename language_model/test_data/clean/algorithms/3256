This study suggests a method to compute the material parameters for arteries in vivo from clinically registered pressure-radius signals. The artery is modelled as a hyperelastic, incompressible, thin-walled cylinder and the membrane stresses are computed using a strain energy. The material parameters are determined in a minimisation process by tuning the membrane stress to the stress obtained by enforcing global equilibrium. In addition to the mechanical model, the study also suggests a preconditioning of the pressure-radius signal. The preconditioning computes an average pressure-radius cycle from all consecutive cycles in the registration and removes, or reduces, undesirable disturbances. The effect is a robust parameter identification that gives a unique solution. The proposed method is tested on clinical data from three human abdominal aortas and the results show that the material parameters from the proposed method do not differ significantly (p < 0.01) from the corresponding parameters obtained by averaging the result from consecutive cycles.
