Valinomycin-induced potassium diffusion potential (delta psi, inside negative) in the liposomes made of phosphatidylcholine and various amounts of cholesterol was measured by uptake of 86Rb+, tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+) or triphenylmethylphosphonium (TPMP+). In any liposome, the values of membrane potential obtained by 86Rb+ uptake (delta psi Rb) agreed well with those calculated from the imposed potassium concentration gradient using the Nernst equation, and were not affected by the presence of cholesterol. However, both delta psi TPP and delta psi TPMP showed smaller values than delta psi Rb when the cholesterol content in liposomes increased. delta psi TPMP at a stationary state was much smaller than delta psi TPP. The orientational order parameter of the lipids' bilayer with various cholesterol content was estimated from fluorescence polarization of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene. The results indicated that the permeation of TPP+ or TPMP+ into liposomes containing a large amount of cholesterol is strongly restricted by the high ordering of phosphatidylcholine acyl chains.
