The scope of providing care for people with epilepsy and seizures has expanded dramatically in recent years. The tremendous growth in our understanding, along with new and innovative treatment options has increased the likelihood of seizure control and improved quality of life for many people. The ability to more accurately diagnose seizures will be enhanced by new seizure assessment guidelines. A fuller appreciation of the patient's perspective will aid nurses in their support of self-management practices. The new millennium will challenge nurses to enhance self-management education in more diverse practice settings, geographical areas, and patient populations.
