Strenuous physical work puts expectant mothers at risk of experiencing back pain during the gestational months. Pregnant women in Benin perform physically demanding occupational tasks that include the lifting and carriage of heavy loads on their heads for commercial activities. A large percentage of pregnant subjects (58%) reported having back pain episodes since the start of their pregnancy. However, the mean Oswestry score of the affected participants was relatively low with a mean score of 0.2 (SD: 0.12), on a scale form 0 to 1. An evaluation of the postural demands of the occupational activities of these women revealed that they performed on average 328 trunk flexions at angles exceeding 60°, with 66 of these flexions sustained for more than 4 s, during the average 7.9 h where trunk postures were recorded. They also spent on average 36% of the recording time at trunk flexion angles larger than 20°. These results show that the merchant pregnant women in the Porto-Novo area in Benin are at great risk for developing back disorders during pregnancy.

Results will make a first contribution to the literature by identifying the stressful postures adopted during a typical day. The findings of this study can help in the development of preventative concepts and postural modification techniques to decrease the occurrence of back pain during pregnancy for women in Benin.
