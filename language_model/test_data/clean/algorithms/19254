A method of the Poisson fitting of flow cytometry data is suggested. The estimation of distribution parameters was carried out by the steepest descent method. The phagocytosis of fluorescent latex particles by murine macrophages was used as an experimental model. The results obtained by the Poisson fitting of cytofluorograms were in good agreement with the visual estimation of macrophage distribution with regard to the amount of uptaken particles. A high value of correlation index (more than 0.99) showed the validity of the suggested fitting method. The applicability of the method to cytofluorimetric analysis of human lymphocytes was successfully demonstrated.
