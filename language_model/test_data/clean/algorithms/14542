Toxin-related seizures result from an imbalance in the brain's equilibrium of excitation-inhibition. Fortunately, most toxin-related seizures respond to standard therapy using benzodiazepines. However, a few alterations in the standard approach are recommended to ensure optimal care and expedient termination of seizure activity. If 2 doses of a benzodiazepine do not terminate the seizure activity, a therapeutic dose of pyridoxine (5Â g intravenously in an adult and 70 mg/kg intravenously in a child) should be considered. Phenytoin should be avoided because it is ineffective for many toxin-induced seizures and is potentially harmful when used to treat seizures induced by theophylline or cyclic antidepressants.
