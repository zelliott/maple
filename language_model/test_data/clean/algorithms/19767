Overactive bladder affects millions of adults, with profound personal and economic costs. Although antimuscarinic drugs can cause a reduction in voiding symptoms, the effect is modest, and many patients are intolerant of the side effects, or do not experience sufficient relief. For these patients, the modulation of bladder reflex pathways via percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) or via implanted sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) has been acknowledged as a logical next step in the algorithm of care. This review examines the mechanism of action, the relative benefits, adverse effects, and costs of percutaneous nerve stimulation compared to other treatment modalities.
