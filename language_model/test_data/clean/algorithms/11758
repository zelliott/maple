Angle closure glaucoma remains a major challenge for ophthalmologists. The three main challenges in the treatment of angle closure glaucoma are, firstly, to achieve rapid reduction of intraocular pressure in acute angle closure glaucoma, secondly, to prevent progression to chronic angle closure glaucoma, and thirdly, to manage established chronic angle closure glaucoma. Incisional surgery for angle closure glaucoma is typically required when laser surgery and/or medical therapy fail to control the intraocular pressure or control progressive synechial closure. The role for surgical iridectomy and emergency trabeculectomy in the modern management of acute angle closure glaucoma is diminishing. Trabeculectomy, goniosynechialysis, cyclodestructive procedures, and glaucoma implant are effective surgical options for chronic angle closure glaucoma, but none of them have been shown to be more effective than the others with proper comparative clinical trials. Trabeculectomy and goniosynechialysis are often combined with cataract extraction, which appears to offer additional pressure-control benefits to patients with chronic angle closure glaucoma.
