Lower urinary tract symptoms are a common clinical symptom among men and a frequent reason for referring to a urologist. The most important information comes from the patient history because evaluation of symptoms is fundamental in the diagnosis and treatment planning for LUTS. Other aspects of the initial evaluation, such as the physical examination and initial laboratory values, can provide valuable additional information about the severity of the disease and the need for treatment. If treatment is warranted based on this information, additional diagnostic tests may be appropriate to set a pretreatment baseline, rule out other conditions, and plan treatment approach. Fortunately, a variety of effective medical and surgical treatments are available to treat this common disease.
