The role of modern instrumental analysis in today doping control procedures is described. With reference to the analytical methods, to the requirements of the International Olympic Committee for laboratory accreditation and to the regulations for substantiating a positive result, we show how a laboratory for doping control is functioning. The limits of today analyses are shown, making it obvious that the analytical results from an accredited laboratory are not the weak point in doping control.
