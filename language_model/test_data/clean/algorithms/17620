A method for calculation of the retention time of a compound in a temperature-programmed mode of GC analyses is proposed. The method is based on a detailed consideration of thermodynamics of chromatographic process and account of the actual state of a capillary column. The suggested approach permits estimation of probability of a poisonous agent in tests by means of information stored in the database, eliminating a need for reference standard of such an agent.
