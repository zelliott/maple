Identification of simple signs and symptoms that predict severe illness needing referral for admission of young infants is critical for reducing mortality in developing countries. Infants <2 months of age presenting to two hospitals in La Paz, Bolivia (n=1082) were evaluated by nurses for signs and symptoms, and independently by physicians for the need for admission. In young neonates, sensitivity of individual clinical signs was >35% for measured temperature ≥ 37.5° C (65%); all signs had specificity >85%. Odds ratios (ORs) for association of individual clinical signs with need for urgent hospital management were highest (>5) for history of difficulty feeding, not feeding well and fever. Clinical signs or symptoms are useful for primary healthcare workers to identify young infants with serious illness needing admission, and have been incorporated into the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness algorithm for use in Bolivia and elsewhere in Latin America.
