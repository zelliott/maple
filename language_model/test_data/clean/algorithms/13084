The packing of submicrometer sized silica beads inside a microchannel was enabled by a novel method which avoids the complication and limitations of generating a frit using conventional approaches and the restriction of flow using a submicrometer sized weir. A micrometer sized weir and two short columns of 5 μm and 800 nm silica beads packed in succession behind the weir together functioned as a high pressure frit to allow the construction of a primary packed bed of 390 nm silica beads. This packed bed microchannel was tested as an EOF pump, wherein it exhibited superior performance with regards to pressure tolerance, i.e., sustaining good flow rate under extremely high back pressure, and maximal pressure generation. Under a modest applied electric field strength of 150 V/cm, the flow rate against a back pressure of 1200 psi (∼8.3 MPa) was 40 nL/min, and the maximal pressure reached 1470 psi (∼10 MPa). This work has demonstrated that it is possible to create a high performance packed bed microchannel EOF pump using nanometer sized silica beads, as long as proper care is taken during the packing process to minimize the undesirable mixing of two different sized particles at the boundaries between particle segments and to maximize the packing density throughout the entire packed bed.
