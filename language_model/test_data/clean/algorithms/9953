We present an approach to the problems of weak plume detection and sub-pixel target detection in hyperspectral imagery that operates in a two-dimensional space. In this space, one axis is a matched-filter projection of the data and the other axis is the magnitude of the residual after matched-filter subtraction. Although it is only two-dimensional, this space is rich enough to include several well-known signal detection algorithms, including the adaptive matched filter, the adaptive coherence estimator, and the finite-target matched filter. Because this space is only two-dimensional, adaptive machine learning methods can produce new plume detectors without being stymied by the curse of dimensionality. We investigate, in particular, the utility of the support vector machine for learning boundaries in this matched-filter-residual space, and compare the performance of the resulting nonlinearly adaptive detector to well-known alternatives.
