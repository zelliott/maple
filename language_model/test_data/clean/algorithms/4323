Early diagnosis and assessment in children with type 1 laryngeal cleft are essential in preventing aspiration and associated comorbidity. Appropriate use of conservative and surgical interventions in an evidence-based management strategy can improve overall outcome.

To evaluate the management of care for children with type 1 laryngeal cleft in our practice and develop an updated management algorithm.

We performed a review of medical records at a tertiary pediatric aerodigestive center. During a period of 7 years (July 18, 2005, to July 18, 2012), 1014 children younger than 18 years were evaluated for aspiration, choking, cough, or recurrent pneumonia. Of these, 44 children (4.3%) had a type 1 laryngeal cleft. Two were lost to follow-up; thus, 42 children were included in our final sample (28 males, 14 females).

The care of 15 patients (36%) was managed conservatively, and 27 patients (64%) underwent endoscopic surgical repair of their laryngeal cleft.

Assessment of our current management strategy.

Success was defined as improving when a child was able to tolerate a feeding without aspirating or resolved when the child had transitioned to tolerating thin liquids. All patients received a trial of conservative therapy. Fifteen of the 42 patients (36%) had an anatomic cleft and were able to maintain the feeding regimen; thus, conservative treatment was successful in this group. The remaining 27 patients (64%) received surgical intervention. Overall operative success rate was 21 of the 27 patients (78%). The age of the child (P < .01) and comorbid conditions (P < .001) affected the outcomes of conservative measures and surgical repair. Only 6 patients did not demonstrate resolution, 5 of whom had significant comorbidities.

Age, comorbidity status, severity of aspiration, and the ability to tolerate a feeding regimen should be taken into account when deciding on conservative or surgical management for children with a type 1 laryngeal cleft. A clinical pathway for conservative and surgical management is presented.
