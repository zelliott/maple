Two years ago, CE certified interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) were launched on the German market (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube and T-SPOT-TB). Since this time, a multitude of studies have analysed these assays. Guidelines have been elaborated by national expert committees of England, the USA and Switzerland. However, standards of tuberculosis diagnostics and management may vary from country to country. This statement provides practice relevant recommendations for indications, pre-analytics and the interpretation of IGRA test results under different clinical conditions. The IGRA are integrated into existing guidelines for the management of tuberculosis.
