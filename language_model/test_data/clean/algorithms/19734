Continuously-moving-table MRI, in contrast to traditional multistation techniques, potentially can improve the scan time efficiency of whole-body applications and provide seamless images of an extended field of view (FOV). Contrast-enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA) in particular requires high spatial resolution and at the same time has rigid scan time constraints due to the limited arterial contrast window. In this study a reconstruction method for continuously acquired 3D data sets during table movement was combined with a self-calibrated partial parallel imaging algorithm (generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions (GRAPPA)). The method was applied to peripheral CE-MRA and compared with a standard continuously-moving-table MRA protocol. The gain in scan time was used to increase the data acquisition matrix and decrease the slice thickness. The method was evaluated in five healthy volunteers and applied to one patient with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD). The protocols were intraindividually compared with respect to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in selected vessel segments, as well as overall vessel depiction. The combination of the continuously-moving-table technique with parallel imaging enabled the acquisition of seamless peripheral 3D MRA with increased resolution and an overall crisper appearance.
