In this paper, the question about automatic brightness control for x-ray imaging systems based on CCD camera is discussed, and the structure and principle of an auto brightness control loop are analyzed along with the working procedure of the x-ray imaging system. A kind of digital brightness controller about a typical device and the designing idea of the computer brightness intelligent control software is introduced.
