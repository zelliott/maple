Porosities of set and burnout compacts of phosphate-bonded investments were determined. A gas pycnometer was used to measure the volumes, and hence the densities, of fine powders and porous compacts. Porosities of set and burnout compacts were then obtained from these data for as-received powders and dry set compacts by a numerical simulation method, subsequently leading on to the estimated compositions of conventional and rapid-heating investments used in this study. Excess water content in the hardening investment compact was evaluated as a function of setting time elapsed from the start of mixing. Porosities were about 24-32% for set compacts and 43% for burnout compacts, which well agreed with the numerically computed results. It was concluded that the functional composition of investment powder needed to achieve the optimal porosity as well as process parameters such as water-powder (W/P) ratio and keeping time of mixed investment casting slurry before heat treatment could be determined using the numerical simulation method developed in this study.
