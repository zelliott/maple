Thoracic traumas are frequent and potentially fatal, because of the associated neurological and abdominal lesions. They are observed in car crashes, combat environments and urban terrorist bombings. The mechanisms of the traumatic injury are complex and account for the diversity of the lesions. The management of a chest trauma patient is a model of multidisciplinary collaboration where the chest physician can make a significant contribution.
