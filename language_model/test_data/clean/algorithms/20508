The method of continuously measuring arterial blood saturation (pulse oximetry) has been recently intensively developed. The paper proposes a new schematic design of pulse oximeters based on the current multiple-digit sigma-delta transducers which reduces expenses connected with device operation, simplifies the regimen and algorithms of control, increases the quality of data reading.
