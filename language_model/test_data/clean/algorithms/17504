This paper presents a method for robust tolerance design in terms of Process Capability Indices (PCI). The component tolerance and the suitable manufacturing processes can be selected based on the real manufacturing context. The robustness of design feasibility under the effect of uncertainties is also discussed. A comparison between the results obtained by the proposed model and other methods indicates that robust and reliable tolerance can be obtained.
