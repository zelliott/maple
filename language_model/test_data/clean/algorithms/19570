Optically stimulated luminescence dating has been used to investigate the chronological development of the outer barrier spit forming Chilika Lake (Orissa, India), the largest brackish-water lagoon in Asia. Sixteen samples were examined, and these yielded equivalent doses of between 153 +/- 3 mGy and 2.23 +/- 0.07 Gy, corresponding to ages from approximately 40 y at the top of the spit to approximately 300 y at the bottom. The youngest ages are consistent with the age of the overlying vegetation, and modern material taken from the sub-tidal beach gave a dose of 4 +/- 2 mGy (corresponding to an age of 0.7 +/- 0.4 y), confirming that any previous potential luminescence signal in the source sediment is completely set to zero before incorporation into the spit. A clearly defined period of >2.5 m of barrier construction approximately 40 y ago is identified; prior to that the deposition rate was relatively constant for approximately 300 y.
