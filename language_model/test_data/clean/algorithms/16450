This paper proposes a new approach to improve the amount of information extracted from the speech aiming to increase the accuracy of a system developed for the automatic detection of pathological voices. The paper addresses the discrimination capabilities of 11 features extracted using nonlinear analysis of time series. Two of these features are based on conventional nonlinear statistics (largest Lyapunov exponent and correlation dimension), two are based on recurrence and fractal-scaling analysis, and the remaining are based on different estimations of the entropy. Moreover, this paper uses a strategy based on combining classifiers for fusing the nonlinear analysis with the information provided by classic parameterization approaches found in the literature (noise parameters and mel-frequency cepstral coefficients). The classification was carried out in two steps using, first, a generative and, later, a discriminative approach. Combining both classifiers, the best accuracy obtained is 98.23% Â± 0.001.
