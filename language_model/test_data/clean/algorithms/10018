With the numerical calculation of the spectrum of single bubble sonoluminescence, we find that when the maximum temperature inside a dimly luminescing bubble is relatively low, the spectral lines are prominent. As the maximum temperature of the bubble increases, the line spectrum from the bright bubble weakens or even fades away relative to the background continuum. The calculations in this paper effectively interpret the observed phenomena, indicating that the calculated results, which are closely related to the spectrum profile, such as temperature and pressure, should be reliable. The present calculation tends to negate the existence of a hot plasma core inside a sonoluminescing bubble.
