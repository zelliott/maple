Tobacco dependence is the most overlooked and undertreated preventable cause of chronic disease in the developed world. Three barriers to effective treatment must be overcome: the reluctance of nicotine addicts to seek help; inadequate training of health professionals to treat hard core smokers; and a health care system that does not acknowledge the need for professional treatment of nicotine addiction. Effective physicians are equipped with the knowledge and skills to identify high-risk smokers who need more assistance to quit. All smokers should be engaged in a tailored office intervention based on their needs. Adoption of simple clinical protocols can eliminate the barriers that prevent effective counseling and treatment in the office setting.
