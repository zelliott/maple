This paper presents the derivation, under a minimal set of assumptions, of a general expression for the steady-state fractional modification of an interconvertible protein involved in four different schemes of monocyclic enzyme cascade systems. From this general expression we derive, as particular cases, other, simpler expressions by applying additional assumptions and which have, therefore, a smaller range of validity. Some of these particular expressions coincide with those already obtained in previous contributions on individualised analyses. We discuss the relationships between the kinetic parameters and the concentrations needed for the fulfilment of the additional assumptions. The goodness of the analysis was tested by reference to the shape in the steady-state of the simulated time progress curves obtained by numerical integration.
