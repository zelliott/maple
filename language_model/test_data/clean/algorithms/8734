Similarities and differences between amino acids define the rates at which they substitute for one another within protein sequences and the patterns by which these sequences form protein structures. However, there exist many ways to measure similarity, whether one considers the molecular attributes of individual amino acids, the roles that they play within proteins, or some nuanced contribution of each. One popular approach to representing these relationships is to divide the 20 amino acids of the standard genetic code into groups, thereby forming a simplified amino acid alphabet. Here, we develop a method to compare or combine different simplified alphabets, and apply it to 34 simplified alphabets from the scientific literature. We use this method to show that while different suggestions vary and agree in non-intuitive ways, they combine to reveal a consensus view of amino acid similarity that is clearly rooted in physico-chemistry.
