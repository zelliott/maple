The system is designed for the long-term monitoring of critical patients with acute abdominal abnormalities at the intensive care and resuscitation units. It ensures input and long-term storage of history, anthropometric, and clinical data and laboratory and instrumental findings. The system allows a physician to have both primary information on the patient and results from examinations of the patient's circulation, respiration, and acid-base balance. The patient's major homeostatic systems were studied by using the original algorithms developed by means of mathematical statistic methods and an expert approach. Conclusions are produced on the display screen and printer in textual and graphic forms. Presenting all qualitative information as linear trends and polar diagrams makes it possible to contract data for visual control. The system evaluates the patient's status through prediction of odds ratio of good and poor prognoses.
