Blind-deconvolution microscopy, the simultaneous estimation of the specimen function and the point-spread function (PSF) of the microscope, is an underdetermined problem with nonunique solutions that are usually avoided by enforcing constraints on the specimen function and the PSF. We derived a maximum-likelihood-based method for blind deconvolution in which we assume a mathematical model for the PSF that depends on a small number of parameters (e.g., less than 20). The algorithm then estimates the unknown parameters together with the specimen function. The mathematical model ensures that all the constraints of the PSF are satisfied, and the maximum-likelihood approach ensures that the specimen is nonnegative. The method successfully estimates the PSF and removes out-of-focus blur. The PSF estimation is robust to aberrations in the PSF and to noise in the image.
