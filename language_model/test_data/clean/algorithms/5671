Malnutrition concerns up to 50% at in-hospital admission. Its diagnosis and treatment are fundamental parts of the surgical approach because nutritional status directly influences the clinical outcome. The Nutritional Risk Score (NRS-2002) represents the recommended screening tool by the European Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ESPEN). Patients with a score > or = 3 and aged > 70 years old, should receive a nutritional support during 7-14 day before surgery. Depending on patient's clinical conditions, the enteral route of administration should be preferred. Despite strong evidence in favor of nutritional supplementation, much effort must be done to implement these supportive strategies in the everyday clinical practice.
