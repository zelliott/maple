We have designed, fabricated and characterized poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) single-mode rib waveguides. PDMS was chosen specifically for the core and cladding. Combined with the soft lithography fabrication techniques, it enables an easy integration of microoptical components for lab-on-a-chip systems. The refractive index contrast, of 0.07% between the core and cladding for single-mode propagation was achieved by modifying the properties of the same base material. Alternatively, a higher refractive index contrast, of 1.18% was shown by using PDMS materials from two different manufacturers. The fabricated rib waveguides were characterized for mode profile characteristics and confirmed the excitation of the fundamental mode of the waveguide. The propagation loss of the single-mode rib waveguide was characterized using the cutback measurement method at a wavelength of 635 nm and found to be 0.48 dB/cm for of 0.07% and 0.20 dB/cm for of 1.18%. Y-branch splitter of PDMS single-mode rib waveguide was further demonstrated.
