A finite element-based nonlinear inversion scheme for magnetic resonance (MR) elastography is detailed. The algorithm operates on small overlapping subzones of the total region of interest, processed in a hierarchical order as determined by progressive error minimization. This zoned approach allows for a high degree of spatial discretization, taking advantage of the data-rich environment afforded by the MR. The inversion technique is tested in simulation under high-noise conditions (15% random noise applied to the displacement data) with both complicated user-defined stiffness distributions and realistic tissue geometries obtained by thresholding MR image slices. In both cases the process has proved successful and has been capable of discerning small inclusions near 4 mm in diameter. Magn Reson Med 42:779-786, 1999.
