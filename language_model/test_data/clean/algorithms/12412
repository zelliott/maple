MAGOS is a web server allowing automated protein modelling coupled to the creation of a hierarchical and annotated multiple alignment of complete sequences. MAGOS is designed for an interactive approach of structural information within the framework of the evolutionary relevance of mined and predicted sequence information.

The web server is freely available at http://pig-pbil.ibcp.fr/magos.
