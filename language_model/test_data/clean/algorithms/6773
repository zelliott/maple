A tandem FAIMS-FAIMS system for ion trapping at room temperature and atmospheric pressure is described. The first FAIMS device consisted of a side-to-side configuration (sFAIMS) suitable for ion separation, whereas the second FAIMS device was appropriate for ion trapping (tFAIMS). Ions pre-selected by the sFAIMS entered the tFAIMS and were captured by virtual trapping fields at the hemispherical tip of the inner electrode. The use of the sFAIMS, with wider electrode diameters, and consequently better ion separation efficiency than the tFAIMS, lowered the number of background ions captured in the trapping region of tFAIMS, and thus reduced the space charge effects in the trap. This tandem device was coupled to a laboratory built time-of-flight mass spectrometer and was evaluated using the electrospray generated [M + 2H]2+ ion of gramicidin S. The half-time (t1/2) of the exponential decay of the ion cloud in tFAIMS, determined by monitoring the residual intensity of ions extracted from the ion trapping region of tFAIMS after various delay times, was about 2 s.
