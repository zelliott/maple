We give a simple two-transition model of Faraday modulation spectrometry (FAMOS) addressing the electronic X(2)Π(ν('') = 0) - A(2)Σ(+)(ν(') = 0) band in nitric oxide. The model is given in terms of the integrated line strength, S, and first Fourier coefficients for the magnetic-field-modulated dispersive line shape function. Although the two states addressed respond differently to the magnetic field (they adhere to the dissimilar Hund coupling cases), it is shown that the technique shares some properties with FAMOS when rotational-vibrational Q-transitions are targeted: the line shapes have a similar form and the signal strength has an analogous magnetic field and pressure dependence. The differences are that the maximum signal appears for larger magnetic field amplitudes and pressures, ∼1500 G and ∼200 Torr, respectively.
