The search for cluster structure in microarray datasets is a base problem for the so-called "-omic sciences". A difficult problem in clustering is how to handle data with a manifold structure, i.e. data that is not shaped in the form of compact clouds of points, forming arbitrary shapes or paths embedded in a high-dimensional space, as could be the case of some gene expression datasets.

In this work we introduce the Penalized k-Nearest-Neighbor-Graph (PKNNG) based metric, a new tool for evaluating distances in such cases. The new metric can be used in combination with most clustering algorithms. The PKNNG metric is based on a two-step procedure: first it constructs the k-Nearest-Neighbor-Graph of the dataset of interest using a low k-value and then it adds edges with a highly penalized weight for connecting the subgraphs produced by the first step. We discuss several possible schemes for connecting the different sub-graphs as well as penalization functions. We show clustering results on several public gene expression datasets and simulated artificial problems to evaluate the behavior of the new metric.

In all cases the PKNNG metric shows promising clustering results. The use of the PKNNG metric can improve the performance of commonly used pairwise-distance based clustering methods, to the level of more advanced algorithms. A great advantage of the new procedure is that researchers do not need to learn a new method, they can simply compute distances with the PKNNG metric and then, for example, use hierarchical clustering to produce an accurate and highly interpretable dendrogram of their high-dimensional data.
