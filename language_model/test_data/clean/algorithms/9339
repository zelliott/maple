In certain radiographic images, fuzziness exists due to the vague nature of image characteristics and limitations of visual perception. Accordingly, a gap exists between the information content of an image and the information that can be retrieved. In this paper, a new fuzzy logic based intensification operator has been proposed for enhancement of images. For applying the operator effectively, selection of crossover point is critical. In this paper, the concept of fuzzy entropy has been proposed for objective selection of crossover point. Owing to semantic nature of information content, the methodology has a provision to change levels of enhancement interactively, to help in retrieving the information as required. The effectiveness of the methodology has been demonstrated. Comparison of the results with the Zadeh's INT operator and conventional histogram equalization techniques has established its superiority.
