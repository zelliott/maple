We investigate a two-level model with a large number of open decay channels in order to describe avoided level crossing statistics in open chaotic billiards. This model allows us to describe the fundamental changes in the probability distribution of the avoided level crossings compared with the closed case. Explicit expressions are derived for systems with preserved and broken time-reversal symmetry. We find that the decay process induces a modification at small spacings of the probability distribution of the avoided level crossings due to an attraction of the resonances. The theoretical predictions are in complete agreement with the recent experimental results of Dietz [Phys. Rev. E 73, 035201 (2006)].
