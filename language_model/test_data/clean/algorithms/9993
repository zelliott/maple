A thermal lattice Boltzmann (LB) model is presented for axisymmetric thermal flows in the incompressible limit. The model is based on the double-distribution-function LB method, which has attracted much attention since its emergence for its excellent numerical stability over the multispeed LB method. Compared with the existing axisymmetric thermal LB models, the present model is simpler and retains the inherent features of the standard LB method. Numerical simulations are carried out for the thermally developing laminar flows in circular ducts and the natural convection in an annulus between two coaxial vertical cylinders. The Nusselt number obtained from the simulations agrees well with the analytical solutions and/or the results reported in previous studies.
