Pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) are a continuum and are difficult to diagnose clinically. Combined CT venography and pulmonary angiography (CTVPA) is a single examination that combines multidetector CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) and CT venography (CTV) of the abdomen, pelvis, and lower extremities, providing "one-stop shopping" for venous thromboembolism without additional venipuncture or i.v. contrast, and it adds only a few additional minutes to scanning time. CTVPA rapidly and accurately examines the deep veins, reveals the presence, absence, and extent of deep venous thrombosis, serves as a baseline, and helps guide patient management. Multiple investigators have reported a high degree of accuracy when CTV is compared with venous ultrasound. There are some pitfalls in image interpretation, especially with regard to mixing artifacts, and there are continuing controversies as to exactly which parts of the abdomen, pelvis, and legs should be scanned routinely, the ideal timing of CTV acquisition relative to contrast injection, and the slice thickness and gap, if any, that should be used.
