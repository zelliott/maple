Minicolumns are thought to be the smallest cortical modules within the hierarchical organization of the isocortex. Several reports suggest alterations in minicolumnar morphometry may be involved in psychiatric disorders such as autism, dyslexia, and schizophrenia. Thus far anatomical studies of minicolumns have primarily relied on measurements of pyramidal cell arrays. This study expands on a recursive trace line segmentation method used to define morphometric measures for myelinated axon bundles. The results were compared against those of pyramidal cell arrays derived from immediately adjacent serial sections. Width estimates based on cell somas and myelinated axon bundles were highly correlated (r=0.9888). Histograms of signal intensity using the recursive trace line method produced expected features of myeloarchitectonics; that is, bundles of Meynert and intervening interradiary plexus. The close correspondence of derived values for myelinated axon bundles and pyramidal cell arrays suggests their participation and interaction within the same modular arrangement of the isocortex.
