We propose a simple dynamical system to interpret the gait time series from patients affected by three neurodegenerative diseases: Parkinson, Huntington and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. The model is shown to reproduce the main aspects of the experimental time series. Within this scenario, quantitative differences in specific indicators are detected thus opening up the perspective for innovative, non invasive, diagnosis procedures from direct measurements of gait dynamics.
