Nasopharyngeal carcinoma cases are not frequently encountered in our environment. Local stages are treated with radiotherapy. For advanced local stages, the association of chemotherapy with radiotherapy improves the rates of survival. In the case of metastatic disease stages, treatment requires platinum-based chemotherapy and patients may achieve a long survival time.
