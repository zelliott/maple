Conjugation to macromolecular carriers is a proven strategy for improving the pharmacokinetics of drugs, with many stable polyethylene glycol conjugates having reached the market. Stable conjugates suffer several limitations: loss of drug potency due to conjugation, confining the drug to the extracellular space, and the requirement for a circulating conjugate. Current research is directed toward overcoming such limitations through releasable conjugates in which the drug is covalently linked to the carrier through a cleavable linker. Satisfactory linkers that provide predictable cleavage rates tunable over a wide time range that are useful for both circulating and noncirculating conjugates are not yet available. We describe such conjugation linkers on the basis of a nonenzymatic β-elimination reaction with preprogrammed, highly tunable cleavage rates. A set of modular linkers is described that bears a succinimidyl carbonate group for attachment to an amine-containing drug or prodrug, an azido group for conjugation to the carrier, and a tunable modulator that controls the rate of β-eliminative cleavage. The linkers provide predictable, tunable release rates of ligands from macromolecular conjugates both in vitro and in vivo, with half-lives spanning from a range of hours to >1 y at physiological pH. A circulating PEG conjugate achieved a 56-fold half-life extension of the 39-aa peptide exenatide in rats, and a noncirculating s.c. hydrogel conjugate achieved a 150-fold extension. Using slow-cleaving linkers, the latter may provide a generic format for once-a-month dosage forms of potent drugs. The releasable linkers provide additional benefits that include lowering C(max) and pharmacokinetic coordination of drug combinations.
