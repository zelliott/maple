This paper describes the results of a project that explores the use the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) for knowledge-driven tasks, such as browsing a computer-based patient record (CPR). The project consisted of a number of steps: the mapping between CPR terms and UMLS concepts, the development of an algorithm that explores the CPR data using this mapping and the implementation of a first prototype browser that visualizes 'found' data. A second task addressed in this project has been the direct access to online medical literature (MEDLINE) using the UMLS concepts found in the CPR data. In this project, we used a preliminary version of the Open Records for Patient Care (ORCA) CPR that consisted only of the history and physical examination data of patient suffering from heart failure.
