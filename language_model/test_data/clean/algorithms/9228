Scopira facilitates the development of high-performance applications by providing many useful subsystems, flexible and efficient data models, low-level tools such as memory management and serialization, GUI constructs, high-level visualization modules, and the ability to implement parallel algorithms with MPI. Scopira plug-in extensions have been developed to enable Matlab scripts to easily call any Scopira module, thus facilitating the migration of prototypes to highly efficient C++ applications. Scopira is continuously under development and future capabilities will include the ability to develop distributed programs using agents, applicable to grid-computing data mining applications. Scopira has proven to be a successful programming framework for implementing high-performance biomedical data analysis applications. It is based on C++, an efficient object-oriented language, and the source code is available as an open-source project for other researchers to use and adapt to their own research endeavours. Scopira has been compiled to work on Linux and Windows XP operating systems with a port to the Mac OS under development. Scopira, EvIdent and RDP are freely available for download from www.scopira.org.
