Pancreatic panniculitis is a rare entity, occurring in less than 2% of patients with pancreatic disorders. Skin manifestations may precede the diagnosis of a pancreatic disease by many months. When treatable, correction of the underlying pancreatic disorder may lead to prompt resolution of the panniculitis.

We present the case of a 74-year-old-man with a history of chronic pancreatitis who presented with an acute onset of tender, nonulcerating nodules. The clinical and histologic features of pancreatic panniculitis are discussed, with a brief review of the differential diagnosis and clinical approach to panniculitis.

Pancreatic panniculitis is a recognizable clinical entity with characteristic histologic features that may resolve with treatment of the underlying pancreatic disorder. The algorithm-based clinical approach to panniculitis presented in this study is a practical tool designed to guide clinicians in ordering investigations and determining the appropriate management for patients presenting with subcutaneous nodules.
