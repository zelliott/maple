Fractal dimensions always involve some averaging with respect to the given geometrical object. The classical geometrical description includes overly detailed geometrical information, rendering the precise formulation of equations ineffective. The problems associated with the functionality and growth of biological systems according to their observed geometrical shape require a specific approach.

The material consists of 50 brains, 4th to 8th month of fetal life, length C.-R. 83-220 mm. The material was examined using the Pickworth method, computer image analysis (Imtronic, Scion for Windows 1998, and Elf v. 4.2), and fractal analysis. Various transformations were applied: numeric filters, statistical filters, binary geometrical transformations, arithmetical operations. Fractal analysis employs the 'box-counting' fractal dimension.

The cortex vein net maintains the fetal character, with a large number of anastomoses, also present in adults. The size of cortex branches amounts to 100-200 microm. The reduction of some of the anastomoses during the early stages of evolution comes from an increase in the vessels' caliber. During the 4th month, the fractal dimension is 1.26, increasing to 1.53 at month 5. Rapid growth of the fractal dimension has been observed until the 6th and 7th months. This means an increased complexity level and feed volume in the brain.

Fractals constitute a promising and effective tool to estimate the structures of brain vessels. The fractal dimension varies during the fetal period. This shows the close correspondence between the structure and functionality.
