Institution of cardiopulmonary bypass after commencement of "off-pump" coronary artery bypass surgery is known as conversion. This may be an emergency or elective process. The phenomenon of conversion, although widely reported, remains under-emphasized. Emergency conversion may lead to poorer patient outcomes and therefore warrants serious consideration. The rate of conversion may influence the results of randomized controlled trials, and be considered a surrogate performance indicator of surgical competence in off-pump coronary artery bypass. Several causes and predictors of conversion are reported in published literature. This article aims to examine the phenomenon of conversion in off-pump coronary artery bypass and proposes a framework for its prevention.
