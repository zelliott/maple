Selective saturation of bound nuclei attenuates the MR visible CH(2) and the CH(3) signal of total creatine (tCr) in rat brain in vivo. The low contrast to noise ratio achieved during the limited experiment time makes it difficult to quantify the effect. It is shown that by combining data from continuous-wave and pulsed saturation experiments, quantitation is possible using the standard magnetization transfer model. The model parameters obtained are the transverse relaxation time of the bound spin fraction B, T2R = 31 +/- 8 micros, the exchange rate r(x) = 0.36 +/- 0.04 s(-1), and the concentration ratio of bound nuclei taking part in the exchange to free tCr magnetization, f = M0B/M0A = 0.04 +/- 0.01. The phenomenon can be explained by either an intermolecular exchange of free and bound creatine molecules or by through-space interaction with bound nuclei showing not necessarily the same chemical shift.
