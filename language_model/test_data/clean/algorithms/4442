Theoretically, an appropriately designed and implemented multimodal pain protocol should reduce postoperative pain levels, need for narcotic medication, and adverse events while improving functional recovery including ambulation, discharge from hospital, range of motion, and return to work. A complete, perioperative multimodal pain protocol for total hip replacement and total knee replacement, including use of a novel periarticular injection, has been described and early clinical results are reported.
