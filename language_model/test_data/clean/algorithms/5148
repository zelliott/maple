An HIV/AIDS and TB coinfection model which considers antiretroviral therapy for the AIDS cases and treatment of all forms of TB, i.e., latent and active forms of TB, is presented. We begin by presenting an HIV/AIDS-TB coinfection model and analyze the TB and HIV/AIDS submodels separately without any intervention strategy. The TB-only model is shown to exhibit backward bifurcation when its corresponding reproduction number is less than unity. On the other hand, the HIV/AIDS-only model has a globally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium when its corresponding reproduction number is less than unity. We proceed to analyze the full HIV-TB coinfection model and extend the model to incorporate antiretroviral therapy for the AIDS cases and treatment of active and latent forms of TB. The thresholds and equilibria quantities for the models are determined and stabilities analyzed. From the study we conclude that treatment of AIDS cases results in a significant reductions of numbers of individuals progressing to active TB. Further, treatment of latent and active forms of TB results in delayed onset of the AIDS stage of HIV infection.
