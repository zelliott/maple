Several existence theorems were established for a nonlinear fourth-order two-point boundary value problem with second derivative by using Leray-Schauder fixed point theorem, equivalent norm and technique on system of integral equations. The main conditions of our results are local. In other words, the existence of the solution can be determined by considering the "height" of the nonlinear term on a bounded set. This class of problems usually describes the equilibrium state of an elastic beam which is simply supported at both ends.
