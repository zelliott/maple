In this article, we propose a simple calculation to project quantitatively the number of consultations implied by a systematic follow-up protocol for arthroplasty surgery. In France, this surveillance schedule has become mandatory and will have a pertinent impact on health care expenditures. The longevity of implanted prostheses as well as patient life expectancies can be used to estimate the number of consultations necessary for a regular follow-up. For example, a surgeon who performs 200 arthroplasty procedures per year will have to see 17 patients per week 20 years later.
