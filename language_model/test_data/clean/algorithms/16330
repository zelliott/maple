There are sometimes occasions when ultrasound beamforming is performed with only a subset of the total data that will eventually be available. The most obvious example is a mechanically-swept (wobbler) probe in which the three-dimensional data block is formed from a set of individual B-scans. In these circumstances, non-blind deconvolution can be used to improve the resolution of the data. Unfortunately, most of these situations involve large blocks of three-dimensional data. Furthermore, the ultrasound blur function varies spatially with distance from the transducer. These two facts make the deconvolution process time-consuming to implement. This paper is about ways to address this problem and produce spatially-varying deconvolution of large blocks of three-dimensional data in a matter of seconds. We present two approaches, one based on hardware and the other based on software. We compare the time they each take to achieve similar results and discuss the computational resources and form of blur model that each requires.
