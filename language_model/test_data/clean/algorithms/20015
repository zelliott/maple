To investigate the frequency and characteristics of the mandibular accessory buccal foramen (ABF) with CT.

A retrospective study was carried out using the CT records of 504 patients referred to the Erciyes University Medical School (Kayseri, Turkey) between 2007 and 2010. Presence, location, diameter, area and number of ABFs and their continuity with mandibular canal and distance to the mental foramen were evaluated using axial, sagittal and three-dimensional CT images. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS® v. 15 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL), and t-tests were used for statistical analysis.

14 ABFs were observed in 10 (2%) of 504 patients. The frequency of ABFs was found to be 2.6% in males and 1% in females. The mean distance between the ABF and the mental foramen was 5.0 mm [standard deviation (SD) ± 2.48]. The mean long axis of the ABFs was 1.4 mm (SD ± 0.4) and the mean area of them was 1.5 mm(2) (SD ± 0.8). The mean area of the mental foramen on the side with the ABF was 4.1 mm(2) (SD ± 2.71).

This study presents a relatively lower frequency of ABFs than that in the literature. These foramina could have more complex neurovascular structures than was previously thought. Thus, in special cases where a direct surgical exploration during the planned surgery is not indicated, CT or cone beam CT examination to determine the possible presence of ABFs may be indicated.
