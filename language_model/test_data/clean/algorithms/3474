The objective of this study was to evaluate the viscoelastic functions of packable composite resins with the use of a resonant dynamic mechanical analysis technique in torsion. The materials tested were: Alert (Jeneric Pentron), Prodigy Condensable (Kerr Corporation), Surefil (Dentsply DeTrey), and Filtek P60 (3M Dental Products). Dynamic torsional loading was conducted in the frequency range from 1 to 150 Hz. Composite specimens were tested after storage in water at 37 degrees C for 24 h. One group was thermal cycled for 3000 cycles with temperatures of 5-37-50 degrees C. Measurements were taken at 21 degrees C dry, and at 37 and 50 degrees C wet. Storage modulus, loss tangent, and other viscoelastic parameters were determined from the amplitude/frequency curves. Data for storage modulus and loss tangent of the materials were analyzed by means of ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls test (alpha = 0.05). It was found that there were significant differences (P < 0.001) in storage modulus and loss tangent among the packable composites tested. The highest value of storage modulus, in measurements at 21 degrees C, was for Alert (10.3 GPa), followed by Filtek P60 (9.31 GPa), Surefil (7.29 GPa), and Prodigy Condensable (6.74 GPa). There were significant differences (P < 0.001) in storage modulus and loss tangent among the four different conditions tested. Storage modulus decreased at higher temperatures, whereas the loss tangent increased. Thermal cycling increased storage modulus and decreased loss tangent. The results showed that both monomer and filler composition and filler loading of the materials significantly affect their viscoelastic functions, and the mechanical properties of the products cannot be characterized from the packability alone.
