The pulmonary artery (PA) wall, which has much higher hydraulic conductivity and albumin void space and approximately one-sixth the normal transmural pressure of systemic arteries (e.g, aorta, carotid arteries), is rarely atherosclerotic, except under pulmonary hypertension. This study constructs a detailed, two-dimensional, wall-structure-based filtration and macromolecular transport model for the PA to investigate differences in prelesion transport processes between the disease-susceptible aorta and the relatively resistant PA. The PA and aorta models are similar in wall structure, but very different in parameter values, many of which have been measured (and therefore modified) since the original aorta model of Huang et al. (23). Both PA and aortic model simulations fit experimental data on transwall LDL concentration profiles and on the growth of isolated endothelial (horseradish peroxidase) tracer spots with circulation time very well. They reveal that lipid entering the aorta attains a much higher intima than media concentration but distributes better between these regions in the PA than aorta and that tracer in both regions contributes to observed tracer spots. Solutions show why both the overall transmural water flow and spot growth rates are similar in these vessels despite very different material transport parameters. Since early lipid accumulation occurs in the subendothelial intima and since (matrix binding) reaction kinetics depend on reactant concentrations, the lower intima lipid concentrations in the PA vs. aorta likely lead to slower accumulation of bound lipid in the PA. These findings may be relevant to understanding the different atherosusceptibilities of these vessels.
