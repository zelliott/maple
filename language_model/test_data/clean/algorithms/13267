Jones matrix optical coherence tomography can fully characterize depth-resolved polarization properties in tissue. In this report, we described a simple single-camera based implementation of full-range spectral domain Jones matrix optical coherence tomography. The Jones matrix reconstruction algorithm was described in detail and system calibration was demonstrated with comprehensive examples. In addition to the conventional structural image, the images of retardance, optical axis and relative attenuation can be obtained from the measured Jones matrix image. Both in vitro and in vivo image examples were presented to demonstrate the polarization imaging ability of the system.
