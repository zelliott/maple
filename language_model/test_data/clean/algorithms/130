Emergent life-saving treatment is required for high-energy pelvic fracture with associated hemorrhage and hemodynamic instability. Advances in prehospital, interventional, surgical, and critical care have led to increased survival rates. Pelvic binders have largely replaced military antishock trousers. The availability and precision of interventional angiography have expanded considerably. External pelvic fixation can be rapidly applied, often reduces the pelvic volume, and provides temporary fracture stabilization. Pelvic packing, popularized in Europe, is now used in certain centers in North America. The use of standardized treatment algorithms may improve decision making and patient survival rates. Active involvement of an experienced orthopaedic surgeon in the evaluation and care of these critically injured patients is essential.
