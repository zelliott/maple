This review addresses the concept that human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibody specificity should be determined to HLA epitopes rather than HLA antigens.

HLAMatchmaker is a computer algorithm that considers small configurations of polymorphic residues referred to as eplets as essential components of HLA epitopes. This overview describes recent developments that have increased our understanding of structural epitope antigenicity, that is, reactivity with specific antibody and immunogenicity, that is, its ability to induce an antibody response.

A determination of the repertoire of immunogenic epitopes is important for HLA compatibility testing and the identification of acceptable mismatches for sensitized patients.
