We offer a tool, denoted VISTAL, for two-dimensional visualization of protein structural alignments. VISTAL describes aligned structures as a series of matched secondary structure elements, colored according to the three-dimensional distance of their Calpha atoms.

VISTAL can be downloaded from http://trantor.bioc.columbia.edu/~kolodny/software.html.
