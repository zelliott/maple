A comprehensive acute coronary syndrome (ACS) protocol was developed to improve the quality of care for patients admitted with definite or probable ACS. These protocols were constructed to streamline the practice for diverse clinicians who care for ACS patients across a variety of clinical settings. They are applicable in the emergency department, the cardiac catheterization laboratory, and the inpatient settings for hospitals with primary percutaneous coronary intervention capability. These protocols standardized the care by selecting the best therapy for each clinical scenario based on available established guidelines to insure the safest and highest value (quality/cost) medical care.
