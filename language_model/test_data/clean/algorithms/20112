Sustained intracranial hypertension and acute brain herniation are "brain codes," signifying catastrophic neurological events that require immediate recognition and treatment to prevent irreversible injury and death. As in cardiac arrest, evidence supports the organized implementation of a stepwise management algorithm. Because there are multiple etiologies and many treatments that can potentially reverse cerebral herniation, intracranial hypertension and herniation was chosen as an Emergency Neurological Life Support (ENLS) protocol.
