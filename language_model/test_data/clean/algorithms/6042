Visual interpretation of angiographic images has been shown to be inadequate for assessing the severity of intermediate coronary stenoses. An approach for evaluating both the anatomic and functional impact of a stenosis is needed. An automated technique for determining both coronary blood flow and lumen volume based on a first-pass analysis (FPA) of coronary angiograms and a template matching algorithm was evaluated.

Coronary angiograms of a swine animal model were obtained during power injections of contrast material into the left coronary ostium. Background anatomy was subtracted with an automated phase matching program. A template matching algorithm and first-pass analysis were then used to quantify coronary blood flow and lumen volume. Coronary blood flow and lumen volume measurements were validated with a transit-time ultrasound flow probe and a polymer cast of the coronary arteries, respectively.

In 14 independent comparisons, the mean coronary blood flow measured with FPA showed strong correlation with the mean flow measured with the ultrasound flow probe (Q(FPA) = 0.88Q(probe) - 1.99; r = 0.977; standard error of estimate = 3.23 mL/minute). The lumen volumes determined with FPA and cast measurements demonstrated excellent correlation and can be related to each other by V(FPA) = 0.95V(C) - 0.01 (r = 0.997; standard error of estimate = 0.01 mL).

The proposed automated method for accurate determination of coronary blood flow and lumen volume can supplement visual evaluation of coronary anatomy with quantitative physiologic data. This automated technique potentially offers a clinically feasible method of quantifying coronary blood flow and lumen volume in conjunction with routine cardiac catheterization.
