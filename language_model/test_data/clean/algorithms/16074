Several authors have employed finite element analysis for stress and strain analysis in orthopaedic biomechanics. Unfortunately, the definition of three-dimensional models is time consuming (mainly because of the manual 3D meshing process) and consequently the number of analyses to be performed is limited. The authors have investigated a new patient-specific method allowing automatically 3D mesh generation for structures as complex as bone for example. This method, called the mesh-matching (M-M) algorithm, generated automatically customized 3D meshes of anatomical structures from an already existing model. The M-M algorithm has been used to generate FE models of 10 proximal human femora from an initial one which had been experimentally validated. The automatically generated meshes seemed to demonstrate satisfying results.
