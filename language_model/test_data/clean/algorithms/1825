AL amyloidosis is a systemic disease characterised by pathogenetic proteins produced by malignant plasma cells and the deposition of them in different organs of the body. Amyloidogenic protein is the light chain of the monoclonal immunoglobulin, which becomes water insoluble, precipitates and deposites in the extracellular space resulting damage of organ function. AL amyloidosis belongs to plasma cell dyscrasias or it can associate to other monoclonal B-cell diseases. Diagnosis - such as in case of other types of amyloidosis - is based on histology. Identification of the amyloidogenic protein often needs special examinations. The goal of the therapy is the eradication of the malignant cell clone. Therapeutical armamentarium has been largely flared in the past few decades, several drugs with new mechanisms of action are available (thalidomide, lenalidomide, bortezomib). The standard treatment is high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation in case of eligible patients. Transplantation uneligible patients can be treated with a low dose alkylating agent with or without dexamethasone, or with the new agents. The therapeutical decision must be preceded by very thorough risk assessment. Early diagnosis and the prompt beginning of the treatment has great significance because the evolving functional abnormalities of parenchymal organs (mainly cardiac failure) prevents the effectivity of the treatment. Amyloidosis is an orphan disease, special centers play a significant role in the field of clinical trials.
