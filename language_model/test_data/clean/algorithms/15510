To evaluate segmented reconstruction algorithms for spiral multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) that use data from two cardiac cycles to improve temporal resolution (tau) for imaging of the heart.

An initial group of 78 cardiac patients (heart rates [HR] = 63-167 beats per minute [bpm]) were imaged on a 4-slice, 500 ms gantry rotation time scanner (scanner 1). Images were reconstructed with a single-segment algorithm using data from one cardiac cycle with a reconstruction window of fixed length (tau = 250 ms). Images were also reconstructed with two variants of a multi-segment algorithm using data from two cardiac cycles where only one end of the reconstruction window was fixed and the other end was freely moveable to allow adjustment of tau according to HR: (1) "2-segment fixed start" with fixed start of reconstruction, (2) "2-segment fixed end" with fixed end of reconstruction (for both, tau = 125-250 ms). The resulting image sets were ranked from best to worst (1-3, respectively) in a side-by-side, blinded comparison by two independent readers. A second group of 26 patients (HR = 74-90 bpm) were imaged on a 12-slice, 420 ms gantry rotation time scanner (scanner 2). Data were reconstructed with a single-segment algorithm (tau = 210 ms) and a "2-segment fixed start" algorithm (tau = 105-210 ms) and image sets were ranked from best to worst (1-2, respectively).

There was no clear evidence that any one technique is superior for imaging on scanner 1. Reader 1 ranked single-segment images the highest for all HRs, but statistically significant differences among the three algorithms were only found for the lowest HRs (< 80 bpm), where reader 1 preferred single-segment over "2-segment fixed end" techniques (p = 0.048). The highest rankings given by reader 2 varied according to HR: single-segment images were superior for lowest HRs, while "2-segment fixed start" images were superior for HRs > 80 bpm; none of these comparisons reached statistical significance. Improved performance of 2-segment reconstruction was found with scanner 2. Both readers ranked "2-segment fixed start" images the highest (p < 0.01).

The added value of 2-segment cardiac reconstruction algorithms for spiral MSCT was not demonstrated for a 4-slice, 500 ms gantry rotation time scanner but shown to be beneficial for a 12-slice, 420 ms gantry rotation time scanner in the crucial HR range of 74-90 bpm.
