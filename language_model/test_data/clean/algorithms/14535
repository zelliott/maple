A new horn for high displacement amplification is developed. The profile of the horn is a cubic BÃ©zier curve. The ultrasonic actuation of the horn exploits the first longitudinal displacement mode of the horn. A design method of the horn using an optimization scheme and finite element analyses is developed. Prototypes of the horns are manufactured by a numerical control machining process. Performances of the proposed horn have been evaluated by experiments. Experimental results of the harmonic response of the fabricated horn confirm the effectiveness of the design method. The displacement amplification of the proposed horn is 71% higher than that of the traditional catenoidal horn with the same length and end surface diameters.
