The metabolic syndrome denotes a clustering of specific risk factors for both cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, whose underlying pathophysiology is believed to include insulin resistance. It has been widely reported that the syndrome is a simple clinical tool to identify people at high long term risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. However, its clinical importance is under debate. There are substantial uncertainties about the clinical definition of the syndrome, as to whether the risk factors clustering indicates a single unifying disorder, whether the risk conferred by the condition as a whole is higher risk than its individual components, and whether its predictive value of future cardiovascular events or diabetes is greater than established predicting models such as the Framingham Risk Score and the Diabetes Risk Score. We undertook an extensive review of the literature. Our analysis indicates that current definitions of the syndrome are incomplete or ambiguous, more than one pathophysiological process underlies the syndrome, although the combination of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are related to most cases; the risk associated with the syndrome is no greater than that explained by the presence of its components, and the syndrome is less effective in predicting the future development of cardiovascular events and diabetes than established predicting models. Although the syndrome has some importance in understanding the pathophysiology of cardiovascular and diabetes risk factors clustering, its use as a clinical syndrome is not justified by current data.
