The present study employs a computer simulation of the timing of normal and abnormal ventricular activation according to a re-entry model. A wide variety of arrhythmia patterns similar to those obtained in clinical settings may be simulated by using an algorithm which is based on parameters such as the sinus RR interval (RR), the refractory period, the coupling interval between normal activation and re-entry and the coupling interval between one re-entry and a subsequent re-entry (CV). By varying RR and CV the results of the simulation may show transition between different types of arrhythmia such as ventricular tachycardia, bigeminy, trigeminy and more widely separated ventricular ectopic beats such as in concealed bigeminy. The algorithm provides a basis for the study of re-entry, a major mechanism in the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias.
