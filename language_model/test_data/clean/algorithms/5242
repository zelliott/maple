The minicolumn derives from the radial migration of neurons along glial scaffoldings during gestation. Investigators have presumed the minicolumn to be a single-cell wide structure based on their rectilinear migratory origin. The present study measures the width of minicolumnar cores in both supra- and infra-granular layers. Postmortem tissue was obtained from 9 brain areas in 7 normative individuals. Examined tissues were celloidin embedded and Nissl stained. Digital images were denoised and then analyzed with a step-wise algorithm involving region growing and recursive line tracing. Significant differences were noted between the minicolumnar core widths of supra- and infra-granular layers. A review of the literature on corticogenesis provides some ideas as to how these laminar differences in minicolumnar core width are engendered.
