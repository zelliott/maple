A-315675 is a novel, pyrrolidine-based compound that was evaluated in this study for its ability to inhibit A and B strain influenza virus neuraminidases in enzyme assays and influenza virus replication in cell culture. A-315675 effectively inhibited influenza A N1, N2, and N9 and B strain neuraminidases with inhibitor constant (K(i)) values between 0.024 and 0.31 nM. These values were comparable to or lower than the K(i) values measured for oseltamivir carboxylate (GS4071), zanamivir, and BCX-1812, except for the N1 enzymes that were found to be the most sensitive to BCX-1812. The time-dependent inhibition of neuraminidase catalytic activity observed with A-315675 is likely due to its very low rate of dissociation from the active site of neuraminidase. The half times for dissociation of A-315675 from B/Memphis/3/89 and A/Tokyo/3/67 (H3N2) influenza virus neuraminidases of 10 to 12 h are significantly slower than the half times measured for oseltamivir carboxylate (33 to 60 min). A-315675 inhibited the replication of several laboratory strains of influenza virus in cell culture with potencies that were comparable or superior to those for oseltamivir carboxylate and BCX-1812, except for the A/H1N1 viruses that were found to be two- to fourfold more susceptible to BCX-1812. A-315675 and oseltamivir carboxylate exhibited comparable potencies against a panel of A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 influenza virus clinical isolates, but A-315675 was found to be significantly more potent than oseltamivir carboxylate against the B strain isolates. The favorable in vitro results relative to other clinically effective agents provide strong support for the further investigation of A-315675 as a potential therapy for influenza virus infections.
