We describe a useful method for the efficient ionization and relative quantification of peptides containing serine/threonine phosphorylation sites. This method is based on beta-elimination of the phosphate group from serine/threonine phosphorylation sites under alkaline conditions, followed by Michael addition reaction with N-(2-mercaptoethyl)-6-methylnicotinamide (MEMN). As a result of the derivatization reaction, the negatively charged phosphate group is substituted with the nicotinoyl moiety to improve the ionization efficiency of the derivatized peptide. The combination of d(3)-labeled MEMN (d(3)-MEMN) and MEMN (d(0)-MEMN) generates a 3 Da mass difference between d(3)-MEMN-labeled and d(0)-MEMN-labeled peptides, which is a useful signature for the identification of peptides containing serine/threonine phosphorylation sites in the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrum. Moreover, the mass difference is useful for the quantitative analysis of serine/threonine phosphorylation in proteins. In this paper, we describe the synthesis of d(0)/d(3)-labeled MEMN and an application of our approach to model peptides and proteins.
