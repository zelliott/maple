To evaluate long-term results of custom laser epithelial keratomileusis (LASEK) for correction of myopia and hyperopia using the Custom Ablation Transition Zone (CATz) software and hyaluronic acid masking fluid (Laservis) for final corneal smoothing.

We conducted a prospective study of 297 eyes of 167 patients. All eyes had LASEK for correction of myopia or hyperopia. The Nidek EC-5000 excimer laser, FinalFit software, and CATz ablation profile was used in all eyes. Laservis was used as masking fluid to remove corneal micro-irregularities during the final phase of the treatment.

Mean preoperative spherical equivalent refraction was -5.46 +/- 2.57 D (range -14.13 to +3.50 D). At 1 year after LASEK, mean spherical equivalent refraction was -0.15 +/- 0.50 D (range -4.00 D to +1.00 D).

LASEK with the Nidek EC-5000 excimer laser, FinalFit and Custom Ablation Transition Zone (CATz) software, with corneal smoothing, was safe and effective at 1 year after surgery.
