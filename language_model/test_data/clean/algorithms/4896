Microwave ablation (MWA) is a minimally invasive technique increasingly used for thermal therapy of liver tumors. Effective MWA requires efficient interstitial antennas that destroy tumors and a margin of healthy tissue, in situ, while minimizing damage to the rest of the organ. Previously, we presented a method for optimizing MWA antenna designs by coupling finite element method models of antennas with a real-coded, multiobjective genetic algorithm. We utilized this procedure to optimize the design of a minimally invasive choke antenna that can be used to create near-spherical ablation zones of adjustable size (radius 1-2 cm) by adjusting treatment durations and a sliding structure of the antenna. Computational results were validated with experiments in ex vivo bovine liver. The optimization procedure yielded antennas with reflection coefficients below -30 dB, which were capable of creating spherical ablation zones up to 2 cm in radius using 100 W input power at 2.45 GHz with treatment durations under 2 min.
