Continuing education is a right and a duty for all professionals working in the healthcare system, and the Ministry of Health, has recently developed and introduced an experimental program for Continuing Education in Medicine (ECM) throughout Italy.

The guiding principles and values of ECM are to assure the quality of educational events and to ensure that professionals can choose from among several opportunities for gaining credits. Although promoted by regional healthcare authorities, the educational program must be homogeneous throughout the national territory.

Over the last few months, the National Commission for ECM has defined the role and responsibilities of different organisms and authorities involved in the ECM program. Each professional is expected to gain a total score of at least 150 credits over a 5-year timespan. Moreover, the Commission has established criteria for the accreditation of educational initiatives, the verification of their quality, and the evaluation of the educational benefit participants have from them.

The ECM program in Italy is here to stay. It provides professionals with the opportunity to improve the quality of their knowledge, competence, and skills. Medical associations can now reevaluate their role and commitment to improving the quality of healthcare by providing all professionals with a better education and qualifications.
