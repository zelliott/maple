EEG/MEG source localization based on a "distributed solution" is severely underdetermined, because the number of sources is much larger than the number of measurements. In particular, this makes the solution strongly affected by sensor noise. A new way to constrain the problem is presented. By using the anatomical basis of spherical harmonics (or spherical splines) instead of single dipoles the dimensionality of the inverse solution is greatly reduced without sacrificing the quality of the data fit. The smoothness of the resulting solution reduces the surface bias and scatter of the sources (incoherency) compared to the popular minimum-norm algorithms where single-dipole basis is used (MNE, depth-weighted MNE, dSPM, sLORETA, LORETA, IBF) and allows to efficiently reduce the effect of sensor noise. This approach, termed Harmony, performed well when applied to experimental data (two exemplars of early evoked potentials) and showed better localization precision and solution coherence than the other tested algorithms when applied to realistically simulated data.
