Investigation into the effects of foot structure on foot function, and the risks of injury, has been at the core of many studies, sometimes with conflicting results. Often different methods of foot type classification have been used, making comparison of the results and drawing sound conclusions impossible. This article aims to critically review current methods of foot type classification. It is concluded that if a classification method combines data on structure with information on foot function in dynamic loading situations, it should relate more closely to the functional behaviour of the foot during locomotion.
