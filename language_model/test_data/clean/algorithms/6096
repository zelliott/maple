We present a discrete model for a metapopulation of a single species with overlapping generations. Based on the dynamical behavior of the system in absence of dispersal, we have shown that a migration mechanism which depends only on age can not stabilize a previously unstable homogeneous equilibrium, but can drive a stable uncoupled system to instability if the migration rules are strongly related to age structure.
