The detection of dysplasia in the gastrointestinal tract can be performed using optical microsensors based on thin-film optical filters and silicon photodiodes. This paper describes two optical microsensors that can be used for spectroscopy data collection in two different spectral bands (one in the violet/blue region and the other in the green region) for which two optical filters were designed and fabricated. An empirical analysis of gastrointestinal spectroscopic data using these specific spectral bands is performed. The obtained results show that it is possible to accurately differentiate dysplastic lesions from normal tissue, with a sensitivity and specificity of 77.8% and 97.6%, respectively. Therefore, the developed filters can be used as a tool to aid in diagnosis. The small size of the optical microsensors can enable, in the future, integration in endoscopic capsules.
