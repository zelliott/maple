A computer system, based on IBM PC, was designed for the cerebrospinal compensatory model identification. The intracranial pressure (ICP) signal, registered during the lumbo-lumbar infusion test is analyzed by means of the spectral analysis algorithm in order to measure precisely the pulse wave amplitude. The amplitude and the mean ICP level, calculated repetetively within the period of about 8 seconds, are stored on the disk and form the basis for further model identification. Three different methods of identification were applied. They enable one to estimate the fundamental model parameters, such as: resistance to the cerebrospinal fluid resorption, pressure-volume index, baseline pressure, rate of formation of the cerebrospinal fluid. Statistical evaluation of the results of the infusion test analysis obtained by means of the system described in two groups of hydrocephalic patients (children and adults) is presented.
