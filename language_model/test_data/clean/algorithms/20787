A 3-D optical imaging system based on active stereo vision and motion tracking is built to track the motion of patient and to register the time-sequenced images of cervix recorded during colposcopy. The imaging system is evaluated by examining human subjects in vivo before routine colposcopy examination procedures. The system tracks the motion of patient accurately. The temporal kinetics of the acetowhitening process in the area of interest can be quantitatively measured. The results demonstrate that the kinetics of acetowhitening may be potentially used for accurately differentiating the precancerous lesions from the normal and benign lesions, and grading the precancerous lesions.
