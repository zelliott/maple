The estimation of the post mortem period, in cases where death occurred under suspicious circumstances, is usually attempted using temperature measurements taken at a single body site. Early investigations of the validity of such an approach use the abdominal skin surface, the axilla and the rectum as measurement sites (B.H. Knight, Forensic Sci. Int., 36 (1987) 47-55). However, it has recently become more common to use the rectum alone, though the ear and the nasal passages have also been utilized. Whatever site is employed, the estimates are frequently found to be inaccurate. There are several fundamental reasons for these inaccuracies, the most prominent being the unknown variation in the ambient temperature between the time of death and the commencement of measurements, and the unknown body temperature at the time of death. This paper proposes a method of overcoming the above difficulties by taking a series of measurements concurrently at a number of body sites, a technique used by several previous workers (B.H. Knight, Forensic Sci. Int., 36 (1987) 47-55). Initial investigations have shown that an improved estimation of post mortem period is obtainable by the application of a suitable decision-making algorithm.
