Computed tomographic (CT) imaging has become the modality of choice for the assessment of patients with urological malignancies. Recently, multi-slice CT imaging was introduced, providing faster acquisition times and higher resolution leading to improved image quality. Several studies show that thin-slice, high-resolution acquisition strategies lead to an improved accuracy for T-staging, especially of renal cell carcinomas. Three-dimensional post-processing techniques for the visualization of the vascular supply as well as the ureter (CT-angiography and CT-urography) are helpful for surgical planning. Compared to conventional imaging strategies unenhanced CT images render higher sensitivities and specificities for detecting stone disease in patients with acute flank pain. In the USA unenhanced CT imaging has almost replaced conventional urography, as no contrast agent is administered and the examination time is shorter. PET/CT examinations provide information on the morphology and function of tumors in one examination. However, there are only few data available for the assessment of urologic tumors.
