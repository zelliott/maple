This paper examines the effect of water content, water activity, and glass transition temperature (T(g)) on the deamidation of an asparagine-containing hexapeptide (VYPNGA; Asn-hexapeptide) in lyophilized poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) at 50 degrees C. The rate of Asn-hexapeptide deamidation increases with increasing water content or water activity and, hence, decreasing T(g). The rate of deamidation is more sensitive to changes in these parameters in PVA than in PVP. Deamidation is clearly evident in the glassy state in both formulations. In the glassy state, the peptide is more stable in PVA than in PVP formulations but is less stable in the rubbery state. No single variable (water content, water activity, or T(g)) could account for the variation in deamidation rates in PVA and PVP formulations. Deamidation rates were correlated with the degree of plasticization by water (distance of T(g) from the dry intrinsic glass transition temperature); coincident curves for the two polymers were obtained with this correlation. Deamidation in PVA and PVP was closely correlated with the extent of water-induced plasticization experienced by the formulation relative to its glass transition at 50 degrees C, suggesting that the physical state of formulations could be used to predict chemical stability.
