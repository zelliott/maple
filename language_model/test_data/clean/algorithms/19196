Depth dependent broadening of the axial point spread function due to dispersion in the imaged media, and algorithms for postprocess correction, have been previously described for both time domain and frequency domain optical coherence tomography. We show that homogeneous media dispersion artifacts disappear when frequency domain samples are acquired with uniform spacing in circular wavenumber, as opposed to uniform sampling in optical frequency. We further explicate the source of this point spread broadening and simulate its magnitude in aqueous media. We experimentally demonstrate media dispersion compensation in high dispersion glass by choosing sample frequencies at equal intervals of media index of refraction divided by vacuum wavelength, and we recover unbroadened reflections without an additional postprocessing step.
