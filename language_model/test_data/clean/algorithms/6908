This paper describes algorithms for signal extraction for use as a front-end of telecommunication devices, speech recognition systems, as well as hearing aids that operate in noisy environments. The development was based on some independent, hypothesized theories of the computational mechanics of biological systems in which directional hearing is enabled mainly by binaural processing of interaural directional cues. Our system uses two microphones as input devices and a signal processing method based on the two input channels. The signal processing procedure comprises two major stages: (i) source localization, and (ii) cancellation of noise sources based on knowledge of the locations of all sound sources. The source localization, detailed in our previous paper [Liu et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 108, 1888 (2000)], was based on a well-recognized biological architecture comprising a dual delay-line and a coincidence detection mechanism. This paper focuses on description of the noise cancellation stage. We designed a simple subtraction method which, when strategically employed over the dual delay-line structure in the broadband manner, can effectively cancel multiple interfering sound sources and consequently enhance the desired signal. We obtained an 8-10 dB enhancement for the desired speech in the situations of four talkers in the anechoic acoustic test (or 7-10 dB enhancement in the situations of six talkers in the computer simulation) when all the sounds were equally intense and temporally aligned.
