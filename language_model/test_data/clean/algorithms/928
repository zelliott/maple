1. Although secondary structure predictions are only 60% correct, the computer programs provide some idea as to peptide conformation. 2. The detection of hydrophobic domains in membrane-bound proteins allowed the identification of membrane insertional domains in the polypeptide. 3. A combination of computer analyses of protein conformation and the identification of functional domains in polypeptides must be substantiated by experimental data. 4. Computer analyses of membrane proteins may provide a theoretical approach to the selection and development of antibiotics capable of interfering with the insertion and function of viral proteins in cellular membranes.
