Seven rounds of CAPRI predictions with a total of 14 targets were held in the period June 2007-November 2009. In addition to protease/inhibitor complexes and complexes with G-proteins, some of the targets displayed novel features presenting new challenges to the predictors: a complex with RNA, a leucine zipper to be built ab initio, and a human-designed protein. Nine targets were unbound or required model building; the other five had a bound component. Thirteen were assessed, and the results show that the predictor and scorer groups submitted two- or three-star (medium or high quality) models for eight of them, one-star (acceptable) models for three but failed on the unbound RNA complex and another unbound target.
