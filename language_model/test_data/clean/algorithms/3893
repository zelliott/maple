In this paper, some new algorithms are proposed to estimate parameter functions in nonlinear age-dependent population models by practical data. These algorithms together with a numerical method are applied to compute the human population using the data provided by the United Nations Demographic Yearbook.

Numerical algorithms and parameter estimations using statistical data are integral components of mathematical population models and their numerical  solutions for the projection of population growth or decline.  Data from the UN Demographic Yearbook are used to estimate parameters in the nonlinear age-dependent population models proposed by Gurtin and McCamy.  The population of Japan was chosen for prediction of population changes.  The numerical techniques applied could also be used for any population provided the requisite data sets are available.  The data considered for parameters functions encompassed 25 years from 1955 to 1979 derived from the data set of 1955-85.  The logistic model was also used for estimation of population with a much larger margin of error between actual and predicted population size:  in 1985 the actual figure was 121,048, 920 vs. 121,381,544 predicted by the age-dependent model, an error of .2748%.  In contrast, the logistic model predicted 133,582,824, an error of 10.354412%.  The actual newborn population of Japan in 1985 was 1,429,658, and the age-dependent model predicted 1,425,068, and error of .3211%.  Such information was not available from the logistic model.  The algorithms could become more refined with further experimentation.
