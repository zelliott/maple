Ultrasonography (US) and mammography are the two basic techniques for routine imaging in the diagnosis of breast diseases. A wide variety of breast conditions such as lipoma, hamartoma, cyst, fibroadenoma, phyllodes tumour, haematoma, abscess and carcinoma can result in solitary or multiple giant masses. These conditions may appear similar on physical examination. The clinical significance of these entities is that some lesions necessitate mastectomy but some lesions may require only local excision, aspiration or even conservative management. Imaging has enhanced our ability to characterise these lesions. The purpose of this pictorial review is to illustrate the causes of giant breast masses, and the role of US and mammography in diagnosis of these lesions.
