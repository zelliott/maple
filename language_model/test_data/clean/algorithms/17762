A novel instrumental method for angle and wavelength modulated surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy is applied to the problem of spectral selectivity in SPR experiments. For transparent analytes, SPR reflectivity data are reduced to a two-dimensional (2D) spectrum of resonance wavelength versus incident angle, lambdaSPR(theta). This spectrum encodes the refractive index (RI) dispersion of the analyte and illustrates the increased SPR spectral shift per unit RI change at longer wavelengths (lower angle). For the absorbing analyte magnesium phthalocyanine (MgPc), the 2D data reduction method is complicated by the way the SPR and MgPc-based spectral peaks mix. Fresnel reflectivity models support experimental observations of spectral branching and qualitative fingerprints in the form of branched spectra, and difference reflectivity deltaR(lambda, theta) contour plots are presented.
