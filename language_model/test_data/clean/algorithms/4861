Using average Hamiltonian (AH) theory, we analyze recently introduced homonuclear dipolar recoupling pulse sequences for exciting central-transition double-quantum coherences (2QC) between half-integer spin quadrupolar nuclei undergoing magic-angle-spinning. Several previously observed differences among the recoupling schemes concerning their compensation to resonance offsets and radio-frequency (rf) inhomogeneity may qualitatively be rationalized by an AH analysis up to third perturbation order, despite its omission of first-order quadrupolar interactions. General aspects of the engineering of 2Q-recoupling pulse sequences applicable to half-integer spins are discussed, emphasizing the improvements offered from a diversity of supercycles providing enhanced suppression of undesirable AH cross-terms between resonance offsets and rf amplitude errors.
