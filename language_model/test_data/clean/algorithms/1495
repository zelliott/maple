Bubbles oscillating at resonance frequency dramatically enhance nonlinearity of a bubbly liquid. A second-order nonlinear wave equation taking account of bubble pulsation is solved. Numerical calculations based on the equation are compared favorably with experimental results. Possible biological significance of the highly nonlinear medium is also discussed.
