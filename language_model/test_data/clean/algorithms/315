A CW interstitial diffuse optical tomography has been developed to characterize the in-vivo optical properties of prostate gland during photodynamic therapy. The spatial distributions of light fluence rate can be described by the diffusion equation. Optical properties of the prostate are reconstructed by solving the inverse problem with an adjoint method. The 3D reconstructed in-vivo optical properties for a human prostate is illustrated and compared with the results generated by a well-established point-by-point method. Moreover, the calculated fluence rate using the reconstructed optical properties matches the measured data.
