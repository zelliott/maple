Venous thromboembolism remains one of the most frequent and threatening acute cardiovascular syndromes. Its incidence has remained constant over the last several years, both in Europe and the United States, accounting for approximately 1.5 cases per 1000 inhabitants per year. Every year about 100 cases of venous thromboembolism per 100,000 inhabitants are admitted to the hospital, and 10% of these patients die during the hospital stay. Particularly alarming is the fact that in 50-70% of all patients who die from an acute pulmonary embolism the diagnosis is only made after death. These facts emphasize not only the relevance of the problem of "acute pulmonary embolism," but also the need for optimization of current diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Rapid identification of acute cor pulmonale with echocardiography and cardiac biomarkers has recently proven to be especially helpful in this regard.
