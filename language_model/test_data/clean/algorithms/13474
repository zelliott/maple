In vivo electroporation is used as an effective technique for delivery of therapeutic agents such as chemotherapeutic drugs or DNA into target tissue cells for different biomedical purposes. In order to successfully electroporate a target tissue, it is essential to know the local electric field distribution produced by an application of electroporation voltage pulses. In this study three-dimensional finite element models were built in order to analyze local electric field distribution and corresponding tissue conductivity changes in rat muscle electroporated either transcutaneously or directly (i.e., two-plate electrodes were placed either on the skin or directly on the skeletal muscle after removing the skin). Numerical calculations of electroporation thresholds and conductivity changes in skin and muscle were validated with in vivo measurements. Our model of muscle with skin also confirms the in vivo findings of previous studies that electroporation "breaks" the skin barrier when the applied voltage is above 50 V.
