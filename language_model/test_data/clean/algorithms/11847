Compositional distributions in three different codon positions as well as codon usage biases of all available DNA sequences of Buchnera aphidicola genome have been analyzed. It was observed that GC levels among the three codon positions is I>II>III as observed in other extremely high AT rich organisms. B. aphidicola being an AT rich organism is expected to have A and/or T at the third positions of codons. Overall codon usage analyses indicate that A and/or T ending codons are predominant in this organism and some particular amino acids are abundant in the coding region of genes. However, multivariate statistical analysis indicates two major trends in the codon usage variation among the genes; one being strongly correlated with the GC contents at the third synonymous positions of codons, and the other being associated with the expression level of genes. Moreover, codon usage biases of the highly expressed genes are almost identical with the overall codon usage biases of all the genes of this organism. These observations suggest that mutational bias is the main factor in determining the codon usage variation among the genes in B. aphidicola.
