The structural properties of the cluster series Me(m)Si(7-m) (Me = Cu and Li, m < or = 6) are studied by density functional theory (DFT) employing a plane wave basis. The equilibrium geometries and energetic properties of these clusters are obtained by use of the simulated annealing procedure in conjunction with the NosÃ© thermostat algorithm. The lowest energy isomer thus obtained is analyzed by density functional theory at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level including all electrons. Pentagonal ground state structures derived from the D(5)(h) equilibrium geometries of both Si(7) and Cu(7) are obtained for Cu(m)Si(7-m) with m < 6. The Li(m)Si(7-m) clusters, in contrast, tend toward adsorption geometries where m Li atoms are attached to a Si(7-m)framework with pronounced negative charge. For both Li(m)Si(7-m) and Cu(m)Si(7-m), a marked decrease of the energy gap is found as the number of metal atom constituents increases.
