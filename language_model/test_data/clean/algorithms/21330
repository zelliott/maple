Interferon gamma induces striking phenotypic alterations in confluent cultures of human vascular endothelial cells (HEC), including cell shape change from polygonal to elongated and cytoskeletal actin rearrangement from dense peripheral bands to longitudinal bundles of stress fibers. Since many transmembrane proteins, including class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins, interact with cytoskeletal actin, an interferon-gamma-induced anisotropic arrangement of stress fibers might cause anisotropic lateral diffusion of HEC class I MHC proteins. To test this hypothesis, we adapted the fluorescence photobleaching recovery technique to allow measurement of anisotropic diffusion of fluorescently labeled molecules on two-dimensional surfaces. A highly eccentric elliptical Gaussian laser beam was used to photobleach the sample and to monitor fluorescence recovery. In this technique, named "line fluorescence photobleaching recovery," lateral diffusion is measured along that axis of the sample that is perpendicular to the major axis of the elliptical beam. The lateral diffusion coefficient and fractional mobility are obtained by fitting the experimental data to a theoretical recovery curve, the form of which is determined by the solution to a modified version of the diffusion equation in which a tensor is used to describe diffusion in two orthogonal directions. Fluorescein-conjugated murine monoclonal antibodies were used to label class I MHC proteins on interferon-gamma-treated HEC and human dermal fibroblasts. These two cultured human cell types were found to be similar in their elongated shape and anisotropic stress fiber organization. Class I MHC protein lateral mobility was compared to that of fluorescein-labeled phosphatidyl-ethanolamine, a membrane phospholipid probe. Class I MHC proteins diffused anisotropically on human dermal fibroblasts, whereas fluorescein-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine diffused isotropically on this cell type. In contrast, both class I MHC proteins and fluorescein-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine diffused isotropically on interferon-gamma-treated HEC. These data suggest that neither elongated shape nor anisotropic stress fiber arrangement is sufficient to induce anisotropic diffusion of proteins on the HEC plasma membrane.
