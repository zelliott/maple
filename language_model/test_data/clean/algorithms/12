This paper describes research conducted by the Atlanta VA Medical Center in the area of visual impairment and computer usage--in particular, work on the design of a device that reformats computer video output for use by persons with limited usable vision. The objective of the current project is to design, build, and test a video/video control interface that can be connected to and will reformat the video data of any general-purpose computer/word processor. The objectives of this work are to complete a human factors analysis of types of tasks performed on computers/word processors, and to design and build a universal interface that implements the results of the aforementioned study.
