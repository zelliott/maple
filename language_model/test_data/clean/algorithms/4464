Three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography is challenging due to limitation of the data acquisition rate caused by the speed of sound. ECG-gated stitching of data from several cardiac cycles is a possible technique to achieve higher resolution. The aim of this work is two-fold: it is, firstly, to provide a method for real-time presentation of stitched echocardiographic images acquired over several cardiac cycles and, secondly, to demonstrate that the geometrical distortion of the images is decreased when stitching is applied to 3D ultrasonic data of the left ventricle (LV). We present a volume stitching algorithm that merges data from N consecutive heart cycles into an assembled data volume. The assembly is performed in real time, making immediate volume rendering of the full volume possible. In-vivo images acquired with this technique are presented. Through simulations with a kinematic model of the LV wall, geometrical distortion and volume estimation errors due to long image capture time was quantified for 3D recordings of the LV. Curves showing the variation throughout the cardiac cycle of the maximal geometrical distortion in the LV walls are presented, as well as curves showing the volume estimates compared with the true LV volume of the model. We conclude that real-time display of stitched 3D ultrasound data is feasible and that it is an adequate technique for increasing the volume acquisition rate at a given spatial resolution. Furthermore, the geometrical distortion decreases substantially for data with higher volume rate and, for a full scan of the LV, stitching over at least four cycles is recommended.
