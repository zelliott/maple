Unnecessary right ventricular pacing has deleterious effects and becomes more significant when cumulative percent ventricular pacing (Cum%VP) exceeds 40% of time. The Managed Ventricular Pacing (MVP) mode has been shown to significantly reduce the percent ventricular pacing compared to the DDD/R mode. This study assessed the percent of ventricular pacing in a standard pacemaker population programmed to MVP and for which patients it is possible to achieve a Cum%VP < or = 40%.

Unselected, consecutive patients were implanted with a dual chamber pacemaker with a mean follow-up period of 76 days. The Cum%VP was calculated from device diagnostics between pre-hospital discharge (PHD) and the 1-month post implant visit. The median Cum%VP of 107 patients (age 67.2 +/- 14 years; 53% male) who were programmed to MVP was 3.9%. The median Cum%VP was 1.4% in patients with sinus node disease (SND) and 28.8% in patients with AV block (AVB). Cum%VP < or = 40% was observed in 72% of all patients, in 50% of AVB patients, and in 86% of SND patients.

The MVP mode is capable of achieving a low percent of ventricular pacing in a standard pacemaker population with SND and AVB. In addition, 72% of patients in MVP mode demonstrated Cum%VP < or = 40%.
