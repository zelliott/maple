Metal ions serve many purposes in natural proteins, from the stabilization of tertiary structure to the direction of protein folding to crucial roles in electron transfer and catalysis. There is considerable interest in creating metal binding sites in designed proteins to understand the structural role of metal ions and to design new metalloproteins with useful functions. The de novo design of metalloproteins and the role of metals in the folding of designed proteins are reviewed here, with particular focus on the design, folding, and activities of the [M(bpy-peptide)(3)](2+) structure. This maquette is constructed by the covalent attachment of 2,2'-bipyridine to the N-termini of amphiphilic peptides, and it is assembled into a folded trimeric coiled coil by the addition of a six-coordinate transition metal ion and the resulting hydrophobic collapse of the peptides. The [M(bpy-peptide)(3)](2+) structure has been employed in diverse applications, ranging from electron transfer pathway studies to the study of optimal hydrophobic packing in a virtual library to the construction of receptors and biosensors.
