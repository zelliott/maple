Simulation of intragastric bleeding due to an accidental cut by the surgeon is an important component of a virtual laparoscopic herniorrhaphy trainer. We present a method for simulating bleeding during laparoscopic hemiorrhaphy here. The various approaches used in previous research work are reviewed and our present approach is justified. Physically based fluid models used in computer graphics are used to simulate bleeding.
