In a recent study, the existence of distinct vascular patterns with prognostic impact has been described in glioblastomas. The bizarre angiogenic subtype was associated with shorter postoperative survival times whereas the classic angiogenic subtype ("microvascular sprouting"; evenly distributed branching capillaries in major tumor parts resembling classic angiogenesis) was associated with a significantly more favorable outcome. Evaluation of angiogenic subtypes of glioblastomas may be relevant for anti-angiogenic therapy strategies. To this end, a method is needed for standardized evaluation of vascular patterns in glioblastomas. Here, we provide a simple algorithm for the standardized assessment of angiogenic patterns in anti-CD34-immunostained glioblastoma specimens, which can be used for research and in the routine diagnostic setting.
