Gallbladder cancer (GBC), characterised by rapid progression and a poor prognosis with a high mortality rate, is a complex disease to treat. Incidental gallbladder carcinoma (IGBC) is defined as carcinoma of the gallbladder suspected for the first time during cholecystectomy or accidentally found on histological examination of the gallbladder. With the increasingly widespread acceptance of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and difficulties in diagnosing GBC preoperatively, the number of cases of IGBC during and after LC has increased. However, management of IGBC is a difficult issue in the absence of established guidelines. Problems associated with IGBC related to LC are the decisions of whether, when and how to perform additional surgery. Controversy remains regarding the effectiveness of additional resection in different stages of GBC. This review gives an overview of IGBC related to LC, and further discusses the preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative diagnosis and management of IGBC during LC.
