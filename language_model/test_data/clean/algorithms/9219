A novel pulse compression technique is developed that improves the axial resolution of an ultrasonic imaging system and provides a boost in the echo signal-to-noise ratio (eSNR). The new technique, called the resolution enhancement compression (REC) technique, was validated with simulations and experimental measurements. Image quality was examined in terms of three metrics: the eSNR, the bandwidth, and the axial resolution through the modulation transfer function (MTF). Simulations were conducted with a weakly-focused, single-element ultrasound source with a center frequency of 2.25 MHz. Experimental measurements were carried out with a single-element transducer (f/3) with a center frequency of 2.25 MHz from a planar reflector and wire targets. In simulations, axial resolution of the ultrasonic imaging system was almost doubled using the REC technique (0.29 mm) versus conventional pulsing techniques (0.60 mm). The -3 dB pulse/echo bandwidth was more than doubled from 48% to 97%, and maximum range sidelobes were -40 dB. Experimental measurements revealed an improvement in axial resolution using the REC technique (0.31 mm) versus conventional pulsing (0.44 mm). The -3 dB pulse/echo bandwidth was doubled from 56% to 113%, and maximum range sidelobes were observed at -45 dB. In addition, a significant gain in eSNR (9 to 16.2 dB) was achieved.
