Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is one of the most common diseases of aging men. It is estimated that by age 60 years, greater than 50% of men will have histologically documented evidence of the disease. Therapy for this disease has evolved considerably from its inception. Recent data from long-term population-based studies have shed new light on the treatment of this common problem in aging men. The authors review the current state of diagnosis of BPH and medical therapy for this condition in the primary care setting.
