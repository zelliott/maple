Early detection and treatment of alcoholism benefits patients. Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound (GHC) charged a committee with identifying ways to improve this area of care within their organization. The results of the Committee's investigation led to the recommendation for use of the CAGE screening tool. Follow-up activities included the development of a practice guideline on the early detection, referral and treatment of alcoholism.
