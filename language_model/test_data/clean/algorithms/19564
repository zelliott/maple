Problems of synthesis of devices for detection of medico-biological parameters are considered. A classification of the devices and their functional units is proposed. An algorithm for synthesis of detectors of medico-biological parameters on the basis of multiple-use functional units is suggested. The algorithm is based on analysis of functional unit modifications providing optimization of the device characteristics.
