The authors of this publication developed and then implemented a standard clinical test procedure to be applied in circumstances as those described above. A statistical analysis of the implemented algorithm based on clinical cases hospitalized in 2008-2010 at the Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine, Department of Occupational Diseases and Toxicology, Toxicology Unit (DODTTU) has been also performed.

This paper reports the first attempt to implement, in a hospital ward, the algorithm intended to ensure comprehensive and honest procedure to be applied when institution responsible for issue and/ or re-confirming of driving licenses must be notified by a hospital ward worker to the concerned institution that the examined patient should not, for medical reasons, be permitted to
