The ILM web server provides a web interface to two algorithms, iterated loop matching and maximum weighted matching, for efficiently predicting RNA secondary structures with pseudoknots. The algorithms can utilize either thermodynamic or comparative information or both, and thus can work on both aligned and individual sequences. Predicted secondary structures are presented in several formats compatible with a variety of existing visualization tools. The service can be accessed at http://cic.cs.wustl.edu/RNA/.
