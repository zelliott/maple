Microfabrication techniques were combined with fractal algorithms to realize polymeric scaffolds resembling capillary networks. The scaffolds were seeded with human endothelial cells in monoculture as well as in coculture with human fibroblasts. To enhance the process of angiogenesis, endothelial cells were transfected with an adenoviral vector carrying the gene for human tissue kallikrien. The results demonstrate that both the presence of a structured scaffold as well as fibroblasts in coculture contribute synergically to the promotion of a metabolically active network. The fractal scaffolds have several possible applications for example in vascularized tissue engineering and therapeutic angiogenesis. A broader implication of these results is that cell-extra cellular matrix and cell-cell interactions cooperate dynamically both at a biochemical as well as microstructural level.
