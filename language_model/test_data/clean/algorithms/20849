Injuries to the scapholunate joint are the most frequent cause of carpal instability and account for a considerable degree of wrist dysfunction, lost time from work, and interference with activities. The complex arrangement and kinematics of the 2 rows of carpal bones allows for an enormous degree of physiologic motion, and a hierarchy of primary and secondary ligaments serves to balance an inherently unstable structure. Although insufficient to cause abnormal carpal posture or collapse on static radiographs, an isolated injury to the scapholunate interosseous ligament may be the harbinger of a relentless progression to abnormal joint mechanics, cartilage wear, and degenerative change. Intervention for scapholunate instability is aimed at arresting the degenerative process by restoring ligament continuity and normalizing carpal kinematics. In this review, we discuss the anatomy, kinematics, and biomechanical properties of the scapholunate articulation and provide a foundation for understanding the spectrum of scapholunate ligament instability. We propose an algorithm for treatment based on the stage of injury, degree of secondary ligamentous damage, and arthritic change.
