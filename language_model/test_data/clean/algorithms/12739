Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) has been considered as one of the attractive drug targets for allergic diseases including asthma. We have been able to identify five novel TNF-α inhibitors with a drug-design protocol involving the structure-based virtual screening and in vitro cell-based assay for antagonistic activity. Because the newly discovered inhibitors are structurally diverse and have the desirable physicochemical properties as a drug candidate, they deserve a further investigation as anti-asthmatic drugs. The interactions of the identified inhibitors in the binding site of TNF-α dimer are addressed in detail to understand the mechanisms for the stabilization of the inactive dimeric form of TNF-α.
