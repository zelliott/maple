Depression is an independent risk factor in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease and it is a prevalent disorder after cardiovascular disease associated with negative outcome in terms of mortality and morbidity. It is a dangerous condition requiring adequate screening and treatment, however, it often remains undiagnosed and thus untreated. Non-psychiatric healthcare workers, like nurses, general practitioners, physiotherapists and cardiologists are the health providers most closely involved in the management of patients with cardiovascular disease. They can play an important role in screening cardiovascular patients for depressive symptoms and in referring them for treatment. The purpose of this article therefore is to provide an evidence-based framework, aiming to educate non-psychiatric healthcare providers on depressive disorder in the context of chronic cardiovascular disease. In this paper, an overview of the definition, prevalence and consequences of depression will be discussed. Moreover, an overview of measurement methods and treatment modalities for depression will be provided. In addition, a step-by-step guide is provided in order to help non-psychiatric healthcare providers in dealing with depressed patients.
