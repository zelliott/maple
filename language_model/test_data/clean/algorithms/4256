Patients with spinal cord injuries suffer not only from sensory and motor deficits, but from failure of the autonomic nerve system which in consequence involves many organs and metabolic pathways. These deficits lead to a different approach to these patients and their medical, psychological and social problems. Three examples will illustrate the different approaches to typical medical problems of these patients. Regularly ambulatory long term follow up visits in specialized centres in close collaboration with general practitioners help to diminish complications and rehospitalisations. Facing the now ageing population with a spinal cord injury we need evidence based guidelines in follow up and preventive strategies for these patients. We updated these recommendations recently. The brochure is available on the webside oft he swiss society of paraplegia www.ssop.ch.
