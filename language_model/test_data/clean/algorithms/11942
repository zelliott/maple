This paper presents a method for designing tremor suppression systems that achieve a specified reduction in pathological tremor power through controlling the impedance of the human-machine interface. Position, rate, and acceleration feedback are examined and two techniques for the selection of feedback coefficients are discussed. Both techniques seek a desired closed-loop human-machine frequency response and require the development of open-loop human-machine models through system identification. The design techniques were used to develop a tremor suppression system that was subsequently evaluated using human subjects. It is concluded that nonadaptive tremor suppression systems that utilize impedance control to achieve a specified reduction in tremor power can be successfully designed when accurate open-loop human-machine models are available.
