B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) assay is a useful tool in order to diagnose dyspnea due to congestive heart failure (CHF). On the other hand many other diseases could affect BNP levels. The aim of this study was to investigate a group of elderly patients admitted to an Internal Medicine unit because of dyspnea.

NT-proBNP was assessed in 132 consecutive patients aged 80±6 years because of dyspnea. History data, anthropometric, clinical and biochemical parameters were collected. Renal function was assessed by the CKD-EPI formula. Diagnosis of pulmonary disease such as infections and chronic obstructive disease was considered and was analyzed as a single parameter. Statistical analysis was carried out dividing patients with high NT-proBNP from those with normal NT-proBNP according to the Januzzi cut-off.

NT-proBNP was higher than the normal reference values in 68.7% of patients and its levels increased in the 5 different stages of chronic kidney disease. Subjects with high NT-proBNP had lower haemoglobin levels (11.6±2.1 vs 12.8±1.9 g/dl, p=0.003), higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation (54.3 vs 25%, p=0.001), and lower prevalence of pulmonary diseases (29.7 vs 57.5%, p=0.005). Logistic regression analysis showed that NT-proBNP levels were independently associated with haemoglobin (OR 1.307 95% CI 1.072-1.593, p=0.008) and pulmonary diseases (OR 3.069 95% CI 1.385-6.801, p=0.006).

A disease different from CHF appears to affect NT-proBNP plasma levels. Therefore, determination of its levels does not seem to help clinicians in the definition of dyspnea in elderly people with different comorbidities.
