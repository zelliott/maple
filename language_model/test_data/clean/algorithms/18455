We report a methodology for comparing and combining dose information from external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and interstitial brachytherapy (IB) components of prostate cancer treatment using the biological effective dose (BED). On a prototype early-stage prostate cancer patient treated with EBRT and low-dose rate I-125 brachytherapy, a 3-dimensional dose distribution was calculated for each of the EBRT and IB portions of treatment. For each component of treatment, the BED was calculated on a point-by-point basis to produce a BED distribution. These individual BED distributions could then be summed for combined therapies. BED dose-volume histograms (DVHs) of the prostate, urethra, rectum, and bladder were produced and compared for various combinations of EBRT and IB. Transformation to BED enabled computation of the relative contribution of each modality to the prostate dose, as the relative weighting of EBRT and IB was varied. The BED-DVHs of the prostate and urethra demonstrated dramatically increased inhomogeneity with the introduction of even a small component of IB. However, increasing the IB portion relative to the EBRT component resulted in lower dose to the surrounding normal structures, as evidenced by the BED-DVHs of the bladder and rectum. Conformal EBRT and low-dose rate IB conventional dose distributions were successfully transformed to the common "language" of BED distributions for comparison and for merging prostate cancer radiation treatment plans. The results of this analysis can assist physicians in quantitatively determining the best combination and weighting of radiation treatment modalities for individual patients.
