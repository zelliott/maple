The polychromatic Laue technique has been applied in 100 ps delay synchrotron pump-probe experiments of the triplet excited state of a Rh(I) dinuclear complex. The observed contraction of the Rh-Rh distance of 0.154 (13) Ã… is less than predicted by a series of theoretical calculations, a difference attributed to the constraining effect of the crystal lattice.
