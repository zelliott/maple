We describe a pseudo-outbreak of Acinetobacter lwoffii infection that was recognized early. The pseudo-outbreak involved 16 patients and occurred 3.5 months after the GNS-506 Vitek automated system was introduced in the microbiology laboratory. Prompt confirmation of incomplete use of the automated system's algorithm as the point source of the misidentified A. lwoffii clinical isolates averted a full outbreak investigation and excess use of infection control resources.
