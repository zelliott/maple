Harmonic distortion (HD) is a simple approach to analyze lung tissue nonlinear phenomena. This study aimed to characterize frequency-dependent behavior of HD at several amplitudes in lung tissue strips from healthy rats and its influence on the parameters of linear analysis. Lung strips (n = 17) were subjected to sinusoidal deformation at three different strain amplitudes (Δε) and fixed operational stress (12 hPa) among various frequencies, between 0.03 and 3 Hz. Input HD was <2% in all cases. The main findings in our study can be summarized as follows: 1) harmonic distortion of stress (HD) showed a positive frequency and amplitude dependence following a power law with frequency; 2) HD correlated significantly with the frequency response of dynamic elastance, seeming to converge to a limited range at an extrapolated point where HD=0; 3) the relationship between tissue damping (G) and HD(ω=1) (the harmonic distortion at ω=1 rad/s) was linear and accounted for a large part of the interindividual variability of G; 4) hysteresivity depended linearly on κ (the power law exponent of HD with ω); and 5) the error of the constant phase model could be corrected by taking into account the frequency dependence of harmonic distortion. We concluded that tissue elasticity and tissue damping are coupled at the level of the stress-bearing element and to the mechanisms underlying dynamic nonlinearity of lung tissue.
