A high-resolution large-array (HRLA) SEMG system comprising 256 separate channels has been developed. SEMG signals are detected by a "bracelet" active electrode array connected to a stack of newly designed biopotential instrumentation amplifiers. A stand-alone data logger acquires and stores the array EMG activity at high sampling rates. A RISC multiprocessor network supports computationally-intensive array signal processing and analysis algorithms. In addition, an improved optoelectronic system for the measurement of human body kinematics has been associated to the HRLA SEMG system to provide the related mechanical characteristics of muscle activity. Analysis results demonstrate that high-resolution muscle fibre conduction velocity histograms can be obtained even from skeletal muscles in which a large number of motor units are simultaneously activated.
