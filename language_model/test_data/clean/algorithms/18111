Hypercalcemia is an occasional clinical problem in outpatient and in patient pediatrics. If undiagnosed and untreated, it can cause significant sequelae. While the differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia is expansive, the clinician can isolate the cause with their patients if a step-wise approach is taken clinically and biochemically. Here we present the case of an adolescent female with symptomatic hypercalcemia and a family history of hypercalcemia. Next we discuss each cause within the differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia, and provide an algorithm for evaluating patients. We then revisit the case to identify the cause with the proband.
