The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel bears two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2) that control its ATP-dependent gating. Exactly how these NBDs control gating is controversial. To address this issue, we examined channels with a Walker-A lysine mutation in NBD1 (K464A) using the patch clamp technique. K464A mutants have an ATP dependence (EC(50) approximate 60 microM) and opening rate at 2.75 mM ATP (approximately 2.1 s(-1)) similar to wild type (EC(50) approximate 97 microM; approximately 2.0 s(-1)). However, K464A's closing rate at 2.75 mM ATP (approximately 3.6 s(-1)) is faster than that of wild type (approximately 2.1 s(-1)), suggesting involvement of NBD1 in nucleotide-dependent closing. Delay of closing in wild type by adenylyl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), a non-hydrolysable ATP analogue, is markedly diminished in K464A mutants due to reduction in AMP-PNP's apparent on-rate and acceleration of its apparent off-rate (approximately 2- and approximately 10-fold, respectively). Since the delay of closing by AMP-PNP is thought to occur via NBD2, K464A's effect on the NBD2 mutant K1250A was examined. In sharp contrast to K464A, K1250A single mutants exhibit reduced opening (approximately 0.055 s(-1)) and closing (approximately 0.006 s(-1)) rates at millimolar [ATP], suggesting a role for K1250 in both opening and closing. At millimolar [ATP], K464A-K1250A double mutants close approximately 5-fold faster (approximately 0.029 s(-1)) than K1250A but open with a similar rate (approximately 0.059 s(-1)), indicating an effect of K464A on NBD2 function. In summary, our results reveal that both of CFTR's functionally asymmetric NBDs participate in nucleotide-dependent closing, which provides important constraints for NBD-mediated gating models.
