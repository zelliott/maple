The index of refraction structure constant, Cn2 indicates how strongly the index of refraction varies in a region of the atmosphere. These variations usually arise through turbulent motions, creating an inhomogeneous distribution of species, density, temperature and pressure. Because the index of refraction also depends on wavelength, the measured value of Cn2 will depend on wavelength. This Cn2 difference generally becomes more pronounced as the difference in wavelength increases. This paper describes a technique for converting between measurements of Cn2 at different wavelengths, and gives an example for converting from centimeter to visible and near IR wavelengths.
