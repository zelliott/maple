The Narcotrend (MonitorTechnik, Bad Bramstedt, Germany) is an EEG monitor designed to measure the depth of anaesthesia. It has been developed at the University Medical School of Hannover, Germany, has been commercially available for 5 years and has meanwhile received US Food and Drug Administration approval. The Narcotrend algorithm is based on pattern recognition of the raw electroencephalogram (EEG) and classifies the EEG traces into different stages from A (awake) to F (increasing burst suppression down to electrical silence). The newest Narcotrend software version includes a dimensionless Narcotrend index from 100 (awake) to 0 (electrical silence). The raw EEG signal can be recorded by standard electrocardiogram electrodes for single- and double-channel registration. The Narcotrend monitor provides a vast amount of information: the actual Narcotrend stage and index, the trend ('cerebrogram'), the raw EEG signal and a power spectrum and several derived EEG parameters. Multiple clinical and validation studies are available for the Narcotrend monitor, including comparisons with the BIS monitor (Aspect Medical Systems, Natick, USA).
