In conventional spoiled gradient echo imaging utilizing quadratic radio frequency (RF) spoiling, nonideal signal intensities are often generated, particularly when repetition time is short and/or excitation flip angle (FA) becomes larger. This translates to significant errors in various quantitative applications based on T(1)-weighted image intensities. In this work, a novel spoiling scheme is proposed, based on random gradient moments and RF phases. This scheme results in a non-steady-state condition, but achieves ideal mean signal intensity. In order to suppress artifacts created by the inter-TR signal variations and at the same time attain the ideal signal intensity, radial data acquisition is utilized. The proposed method achieves ideal spoiling for a wide range of T(1), T(2), TR, and FAs. Phantom and in vivo experiments demonstrate improved performance for T(1) mapping and FA correction when compared with conventional RF spoiling methods.
