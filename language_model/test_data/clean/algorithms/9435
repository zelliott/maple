The results of treatment for congenital malformations requiring emergency interventions depend on the timeliness and correctness of diagnosis of a defect, on the performance of resuscitative and surgical interventions, the correct evaluation of a neonate's condition at different stages of treatment. The score rating of the patient's condition is objective and may be an evidence-based medicine tool. Prior to the emergence of the universal scale, many authors used their own developments. On the basis of achievements made by pediatric surgeons, anesthesiologists, resuscitators in the context of statistical analysis, the specific features of neonatology, microbiology, and clinical pharmacology, the authors of the paper have developed a neonatal severity rating scale with inclusion criteria, such as a body weight of more than 2 kg; intensive care unit (ICU) stay, artificial ventilation of at least 2 days of life. Life-threatening periods have been defined in neonatal infants treated at ICU; the main causes of their critical condition have been indicated in certain developmental malformations before and after surgery, the causes of death have been revealed from the material available in their case histories and from morphological charts. The purpose of the present study was to develop an algorithm of therapy for the newborn with severe developmental malformations at ICU and to define a promising line for increasing the survival rates in neonatal infants with these defects.
