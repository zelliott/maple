For the diagnosis of reactive arthritis, there is no single test. A combination of different parameters such as clinical presentation and laboratory parameters is necessary. Here we suggest a procedure for clinical practice of which tests should be performed when, based on the individual situation. To assess the clinical value of a test, it is not only necessary to know the specificity and sensitivity of a test but also the assumed likelihood of the disease (pretest probability).
