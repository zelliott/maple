The worldwide uptake of FRAX is described.

The aim of this report was to determine the usage of FRAX worldwide over a 1-year period from 1 May 2012.

The number of FRAX calculations from each country was assessed over a 1-year period and expressed as calculations per million of the population aged 50Â years or more. Countries were colour coded according to usage to populate a world map.

Over the index year, there were estimated to be 2,391,639 calculations sourced from 173 counties. Uptake was high in North America, the Antipodes and most countries of Europe; intermediate in Latin America and the Middle East; and very low in Africa and much of South East Asia.

It is expected that the comparative data will encourage the development of new FRAX models and the uptake of FRAX into assessment guidelines.
