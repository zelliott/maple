In histocompatibility testing some genotype ambiguities are almost always resolved into the genotype with the most common alleles. To achieve unambiguous assignments additional unwieldy tests are performed. The American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics formed a committee to define what human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes do not need to be resolved in external proficiency testing. The tasks included detailed analysis of large datasets of high-resolution typing and thorough review of the pertinent scientific literature. Strict criteria were used to create a catalogue of common and well-documented (CWD) alleles. In total, 130, 245, 81, and 143 of the highly polymorphic HLA-A, -B, -C, and DRB1 loci fell into the CWD category; these represent 27%-30% of all alleles recognized. For the loci DRB3/4/5, DQA1, DQB1, and DPB1, a total of 29, 16, 26, and 52 CWD alleles were identified. A recommendation indicated that an acceptable report should only include one possible genotype; multiple genotypes can only be reported if only one of these includes two alleles of the CWD group. Exceptions in which resolution is not necessary are ambiguities involving functional alleles with identical sequences in the antigen recognition site. The criteria were established for proficiency testing, which could be a valuable tool when making clinical histocompatibility decisions.
