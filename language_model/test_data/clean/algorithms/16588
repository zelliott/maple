To compare parameters describing left ventricular (LV) diastolic function obtained with three-dimensional (3D) three-directional velocity-encoded (VE) MRI with retrospective valve tracking and two-dimensional (2D) one-directional VE MRI in patients with ischemic heart failure. Second, to compare classification of LV diastolic function, and in particular for discriminating restrictive filling patterns, with both MRI techniques versus Doppler echocardiography.

The 3D and 2D VE MRI early (E) and atrial (A) peak flow rate indices, determined from transmitral waveform analyses, were compared. Also, net forward flow volume per cycle and transmitral regurgitation fraction were determined. Agreement in classifying diastolic filling patterns between 3D and 2D VE MRI versus Doppler echocardiography was evaluated using kappa statistics.

The 3D three-directional VE MRI with retrospective valve tracking was statistically significantly different from 2D one-directional VE MRI for net forward flow volume and regurgitation fraction through the mitral valve and all parameters describing the diastolic waveform filling pattern, except for the E deceleration time and E/A filling ratio. Kappa-agreement between 3D three-directional VE MRI with retrospective valve tracking and echocardiography for classifying diastolic filling patterns was superior to 2D one-directional VE MRI and echocardiography (i.e., κ = 0.91 versus κ = 0.79, respectively).

The 3D three-directional VE MRI with retrospective valve tracking better describes LV diastolic function as compared to 2D one-directional VE MRI in patients with ischemic heart failure.
