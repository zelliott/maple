A BASIC program has been developed for self-evaluation and testing of an individual's knowledge of main categories in biochemistry. The computer tests permit sequential or random distribution of items, random distribution of answers in each item at each new run, effective feedback control with the student, use of a program clock to determine different time allowance, precise and quick analysis and grading of student's answer thus saving the time and labour of examiners. Editing, deleting and appending of new items is easily achieved. Information is obtained for verifying the quality of the test itself. Examination versions of tests in ten categories have been combined into an annual computer test in biochemistry.
