This paper describes a number of improvements to a method, developed in this laboratory and described in J. Magn. Reson. 85 (1989) 111-113, which makes it possible to determine values of long-range 13C-1H coupling constants from heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) spectra. First, it is shown how pulsed-field gradients can be introduced into the HMBC experiment without perturbing the form of the cross-peak multiplets; a one-dimensional version of the experiment is also described which permits the rapid measurement of a small number of couplings. Second, the experiment is modified so that one-bond and long-range cross-peaks can be separated, and so that the one-bond cross-peaks have more reliable intensities. Finally, it is shown how these one-bond cross-peaks can be used to advantage in the fitting procedure.
