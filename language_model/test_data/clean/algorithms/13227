We extend coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) to a high numerical aperture reflection mode geometry for the first time. We derive a coordinate transform that allows us to rewrite the recorded far-field scatter pattern from a tilted object as a uniformly spaced Fourier transform. Using this approach, FFTs in standard iterative phase retrieval algorithms can be used to significantly speed up the image reconstruction times. Moreover, we avoid the isolated sample requirement by imaging a pinhole onto the specimen, in a technique termed apertured illumination CDI. By combining the new coordinate transformation with apertured illumination CDI, we demonstrate rapid high numerical aperture imaging of samples illuminated by visible laser light. Finally, we demonstrate future promise for this technique by using high harmonic beams for high numerical aperture reflection mode imaging.
