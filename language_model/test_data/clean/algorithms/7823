Spot matching is considered as one of key elements in protein identification based on 2-DE while it is a difficult problem. We propose a novel simple and accurate method for matching spots in 2-DE images. The method, inspired from the principle of attraction, is based on the simultaneous exploitation of multiple information such as spot distance, spot intensity, and spot pattern information. The proposed method was evaluated using both simulated and real 2-DE images of the Escherichia coli proteome, and was also compared with the traditional Demons, thin-plate spline, and B-spline registration methods. The results show that the proposed method allows matching accurately and automatically spots in 2-DE images, and presents significantly improved performance compared to traditional registration methods.
