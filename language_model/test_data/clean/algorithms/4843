The problem of assessing agreement between two devices occurs with great frequency in the medical literature. If it can be demonstrated that a new device agrees sufficiently with a device currently in use, then the new device can be approved for general use. This work discusses how a prediction interval can be used to estimate the whether a future difference between two devices will be within acceptable limits with reasonable confidence. The method is illustrated with an example involving measurements of peak expiratory flow.
