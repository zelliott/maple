Adnexal masses complicate approximately 1/2,000 pregnancies. Teratomas are the most common ovarian neoplasms found in pregnancy, representing up to 36% of adnexal masses. However, almost all these dermoids are less than 10 cm in diameter. We present a case of a massive benign cystic teratoma complicating pregnancy. The patient initially presented with what appeared to be ascites. Imaging evaluation included ultrasound, magnetic resonance and angiography. These studies demonstrated a large teratoma. The tumor was resected without complications. Important aspects of perioperative care are discussed.
