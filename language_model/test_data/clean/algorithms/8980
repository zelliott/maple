Lung cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. More than 80 % of all newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite recent advances, 40 % of patients still have advanced disease at the moment of diagnosis.

The purpose of this article is to provide updated recommendations for the management of these patients.
