We investigate two approaches to improving the resolution of time-reversal based THz imaging systems. First, we show that a substantial improvement in the reconstruction of time-reversed THz fields is achieved by increasing the system's numerical aperture via a waveguide technique adapted from ultrasound imaging. Second, a model-based reconstruction algorithm is developed as an alternative to time-reversal THz imaging and its performance is demonstrated for cases with and without a waveguide.
