It has been shown in several studies that 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) improves the life span and aspects of life performance of laboratory animals. To obtain further details on the beneficial effects of 2-ME, a long-term study has been performed on male CBA/Ca inbred mice treated with this antioxidant. Four month-old mice were each given 4 micrograms of 2-ME in physiological saline via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection 3 x per week. Measurements were made of the following: cold tolerance (heat performance), apparent total body protein turnover (T1/2), changes in the major lipid and fatty acid compositions of the liver, superoxide dismutase activity and formation of malondialdehyde and observations on a range of pathological changes. It was found that the basal rectal temperatures of the treated mice were higher and in the oldest group, heat performance capacity was better than those of the controls. After about 1 year of age the apparent biological half-life time of total body protein (T1/2) was observed to be shorter in the treated mice. Significant increases were observed to occur in the proportions of the polyunsaturated fatty acids in the lipids of the liver in the mice injected with 2-ME. Although no differences were observed in the superoxide dismutase activities, malondialdehyde concentrations in the livers of the experimental mice were significantly increased. Autopsy data showed that Dunn-sarcomas associated with amyloidoses occurred more frequently in the untreated mice.
