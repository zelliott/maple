This paper proposes a directional design method of 2-D nonseparable linear-phase paraunitary filter banks. The proposed method is based on a lattice structure consisting of the 2-D separable DCT block and nonseparable support extension processes. Because of the nonseparability, the bases are allowed to be directional with the critically fixed subsampling, overlapping, orthogonal, symmetric, real-valued, and compact support properties. First, a novel vanishing moment (VM) condition is introduced as a suitable directional constraint, where the moment is referred to as the trend VM. The condition forces wavelet filters, i.e., high-pass and bandpass filters, to annihilate trend-surface components. Second, some theoretical properties of TVMs are discussed for general 2-D paraunitary systems, and then, the properties are applied to the lattice parameters. In order to verify the significance, several design examples are shown, the trend-surface annihilation properties are numerically confirmed, and the denoising capability is evaluated for images through shrinkage. It is shown that our proposed transforms yield perceptually preferable results.
