To enhance the precision of treatment planning for tumors which move under respiration, we developed a respiratory-correlated segment reconstruction method (RS) based on the Feldkamp--Davis--Kress algorithm (FDK) which provides high temporal resolution and a high signal-to-noise ratio. We compared full-scan (FS-FDK) and RS-FDK with regard to dose distribution in heavy ion treatment planning.

Data acquisition for RS-FDK is done using a respiratory sensing system in cine scan mode with a 256-multi-detector row CT (256-MDCT). To evaluate the accuracy of irradiation of moving tumors, dose distributions with each algorithm were compared in heavy ion treatment planning using beam parameters obtained with FS-FDK.

Images obtained using RS-FDK did not show motion artifacts and visualized the edges of the liver and pulmonary vessels more clearly than those with FS-FDK. The iso-dose distributions for FS-FDK covered the target volume; in contrast, RS-FDK with the beam parameter of FS-FDK image provided an insufficient dose to the target and a considerable dose to normal tissues around it.

The information provided by RS-FDK improves accuracy in the prescription of dose-to-target volume. Further, RS-FDK allows greater precision in the delivery of radiotherapy, including 4D radiation therapy.
