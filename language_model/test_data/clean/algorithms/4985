Physiological reactions to noxious stimuli are often used to make inferences about pain, but few studies have thoroughly examined the intra- and interindividual relationships between them. In the present study (N=104), multilevel analyses was used to assess relations between physiological (nociceptive flexion reflex magnitude [NFR], blink reflex magnitude, skin conductance response [SCR], heart rate [HR]) and subjective reactions to electrocutaneous stimuli. All physiological reactions were significant predictors of ratings when entered alone, explaining 1% (SCR) to 29% (NFR) of the variance; but only NFR, blink, and HR were significant in a multivariate predictor model. Significant interindividual variability in slopes was found for blink and HR, but not NFR. A final trimmed model that included NFR, blink, and the blink random slope explained 35% of the variance in ratings.
