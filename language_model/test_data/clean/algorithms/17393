Many clinicians are concerned that protocol supported care will become rote or "cookbook" care and will be generated without attention to the specific and changing needs of the individual critically ill patient.

In addition, the author discusses the potential advantages that this decision-support approach, with bedside computerized protocols, brings to the healthcare delivery system, and what contributions to clinical care and to clinical research might be anticipated from its widespread application.
