The role of long-range dispersal in the coexistence of sexual and asexual relatives in a population of hermaphrodite flowering plants is investigated. In these populations, growth and reproduction often occur during a sedentary stage that is then followed by dispersal of propagules. These two stages are clearly distinguishable and show strong seasonality. A modeling approach that accurately describes this kind of dynamics of mixed populations is a system of two nonlinear integro-difference equations. It is shown that this kind of model can accommodate coexistence of the two different reproductive types.
