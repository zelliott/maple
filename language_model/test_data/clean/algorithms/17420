More validity of finite element analysis (FEA) in implant biomechanics requires element downsizing. However, excess downsizing needs computer memory and calculation time. To evaluate the effectiveness of a new algorithm established for more valid FEA model construction without downsizing, three-dimensional FEA bone trabeculae models with different element sizes (300, 150 and 75 micron) were constructed. Four algorithms of stepwise (1 to 4 ranks) assignment of Young's modulus accorded with bone volume in the individual cubic element was used and then stress distribution against vertical loading was analysed. The model with 300 micron element size, with 4 ranks of Young's moduli accorded with bone volume in each element presented similar stress distribution to the model with the 75 micron element size. These results show that the new algorithm was effective, and the use of the 300 micron element for bone trabeculae representation was proposed, without critical changes in stress values and for possible savings on computer memory and calculation time in the laboratory.
