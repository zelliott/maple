Advances in image acquisition systems have made it possible to capture high-resolution images of a scene, recording considerable scene details. With increased resolution comes increased image size and geometric difference between multiview images, complicating image registration. Through Voronoi subdivision, we subdivide large images into small corresponding regions, and by registering small regions, we register the images in a piecewise manner. Image subdivision reduces the geometric difference between regions that are registered and simplifies the correspondence process. The proposed method is a hierarchical one. While previous methods use the same block size and shape at a hierarchy, the proposed method adapts the block size and shape to the local image details and geometric difference between the images. This adaptation makes it possible to keep geometric difference between corresponding regions small and simplifies the correspondence process. Implementational details of the proposed image registration method are provided, and experimental results on various types of images are presented and analyzed.
