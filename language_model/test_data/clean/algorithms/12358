Biotechnology production of xylitol is an excellent alternative to the industrial chemical process for the production of this polyalcohol. In this work the behavior of Candida guilliermondii yeast was studied when crucial process variables were modified. The K(L)a (between 18 and 40/h) and the initial cell mass (between 4 and 10 g) were considered as control variables. A response surface methodology was applied to the experimental design to study the resulting effect when the control variables were modified. A regression model was developed and used to determine an optimal value that was further validated experimentally. The optimal values determined for K(L)a and X(0) were 32.85/h and 9.86 g, respectively, leading to maximum values for productivity (1.628 g/h) and xylitol yield (0.708 g/g).
