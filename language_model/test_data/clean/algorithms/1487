Recent studies have attempted to predict the severity of regurgitant lesions from color Doppler jet size, which is a function of orifice momentum for free jets. Jets of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, however, are opposed by flows entering the atria. Despite their low velocities, these counterflows may have considerable momentum that can limit jet penetration. The purpose of this study was to address the hypothesis that such counterflow fields influence regurgitant jet size. Steady flow was driven through 2.4- and 5.1-mm-diameter circular orifices at 2 to 6 m/s. At a constant orifice velocity and flow rate, the velocity of a uniform counterflow field was varied from 5 to 30 cm/s. Jet dimensions were measured by both fluorescent dye visualization and Doppler color flow mapping. The results showed that despite its relatively low velocities, counterflow dramatically curtailed jet length and area. Jet dimensions were functions of the ratio of jet to counterflow momentum. Thus, atrial inflow may participate in determining jet size and can alter the relation between jet size and lesion severity in mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
