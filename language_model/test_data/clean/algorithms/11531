The process of freezing in healthy lung tissue and in tumors in the lung during cryosurgery was modeled using one-dimensional close form techniques and finite difference techniques to determine the temperature profiles and the propagation of the freezing interface in the tissue. A thermal phenomenon was observed during freezing of lung tumors embedded in healthy tissue, (a) the freezing interface suddenly accelerates at the transition between the tumor and the healthy lung, (b) the frozen tumor temperature drops to low values once the freezing interface moves into the healthy lung, and (c) the outer boundary temperature has a point of sharp inflection corresponding to the time at which the tumor is completely frozen.
