Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) constitutes the most used paradigm among the diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) techniques due to its simplicity and application potential. Recently, real-time estimation in DW-MRI has deserved special attention, with several proposals aiming at the estimation of meaningful diffusion parameters during the repetition time of the acquisition sequence. Specifically focusing on DTI, the underlying model of the noise present in the acquired data is not taken into account, leading to a suboptimal estimation of the diffusion tensor. In this paper, we propose an optimal real-time estimation framework for DTI reconstruction in single-coil acquisitions. By including an online estimation of the time-changing noise variance associated to the acquisition process, the proposed method achieves the sequential best linear unbiased estimator. Results on both synthetic and real data show that our method outperforms those so far proposed, reaching the best performance of the existing proposals by processing a substantially lower number of diffusion images.
