Monolayer detection on metal surface requires ultra high sensitivity. Sum Frequency Generation Spectroscopy (SFG) and Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) are regarded as two powerful techniques with submolecular sensitivity to detect adsorbents on metal surface. However, in some cases it's still challenge to characterize molecules or groups with relatively high intramolecular symmetry, such as 4-Nitrothiophenol (4NTP), on flat metal surface even combining these two techniques. Basically, this is due to that 4NTP with para-substituted phenol groups is SFG insensitive while flat metal surface is unfavorable to yield strong SERS enhancement. In this concern, a simple and efficient method, silver mirror method, was employed to facilitate the detection of 4NTP SAM on flat gold surface. Silver nanopheres with diameters around 300 nm was fabricated through silver mirror reaction and in situ formed milky overlayer on top of 4NTP SAM adsorbed on gold surface. Significant enhancement on SERS signal can be achieved with such special assembly structure of the "metal-molecule-metal" system. Generally, the silver mirror method provided a complementary approach to facilitate the spectroscopic applications of molecule level detection on various metal surfaces in situ.
