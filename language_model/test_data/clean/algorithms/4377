Brachioradial pruritus is a neuropathic form of chronic pruritus and mostly localized on the forearms. We report on a patient whose pruritus generalized 4 months after beginning on the forearms. The mechanism that leads to generalization is still unknown; multiplier factors may be involved. Systemic therapy with anticonvulsants and physical therapy measures produced improvement. This form of pruritus requires a focused, interdisciplinary diagnostic approach and therapy.
