A mathematical notation is introduced to represent, at a symbolic level, different mechanisms of DNA recombination, and a 'PCR lemma' is proven by analytically describing the combinatorial properties of the polymerase chain reaction process. This approach led to the discovery of novel techniques, based on a form of PCR which we called cross pairing PCR (briefly XPCR). They were mathematically analyzed and already experimentally proven in different contexts, such as DNA extraction and recombination. Thus, a mathematical analysis of standard methodologies may highlight novel mechanisms of DNA recombination and this can provide new technologies for DNA manipulation.
