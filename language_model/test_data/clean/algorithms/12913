In a recent publication (T. Ergin et al., Science 328, 337 (2010)), three-dimensional broadband dielectric carpet cloaks have been fabricated and experimentally characterized by optical bright-field and dark-field microscopy using unpolarized light from an incandescent lamp. A direct comparison with theory has not been provided so far. In the present work, we treat the carpet cloak as well as the entire optical microscope within the ray-optics approximation and the cloak within the effective-medium approximation. We find good qualitative agreement between experimental results and our calculations.
