The transport of the secondary electrons resulting from high-energy photon interactions is essential to energy redistribution and deposition. In order to develop an accurate dose-calculation algorithm for high-energy photons, which can predict the dose distribution in inhomogeneous media and at the beam edges, we have investigated the feasibility of applying electron transport theory [Jette, Med. Phys. 15, 123 (1988)] to photon dose calculation. In particular, the transport of and energy deposition by Compton electron and electrons and positrons resulting from pair production were studied. The primary photons are treated as the source of the secondary electrons and positrons, which are transported through the irradiated medium using Gaussian multiple-scattering theory [Jette, Med. Phys. 15, 123 (1988)]. The initial angular and kinetic energy distribution(s) of the secondary electrons (and positrons) emanating from the photon interactions are incorporated into the transport. Due to different mechanisms of creation and cross-section functions, the transport of and the energy deposition by the electrons released in these two processes are studied and modeled separately based on first principles. In this article, we focus on determining the dose distribution for an individual interaction site. We define the Compton dose deposition kernel (CDK) or the pair-production dose deposition kernel (PDK) as the dose distribution relative to the point of interaction, per unit interaction density, for a monoenergetic photon beam in an infinite homogeneous medium of unit density. The validity of this analytic modeling of dose deposition was evaluated through EGS4 Monte Carlo simulation. Quantitative agreement between these two calculations of the dose distribution and the average energy deposited per interaction was achieved. Our results demonstrate the applicability of the electron dose-calculation method to photon dose calculation.
