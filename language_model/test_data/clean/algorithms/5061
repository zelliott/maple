In order to evaluate and report the personal doses in terms of personal dose equivalent, the performance of the CaSO(4):Dy based thermoluminescence dosemeter (TLD) badge used for countrywide personnel monitoring in India is investigated using monoenergetic and narrow spectrum radiation qualities equivalent to those given in ISO standards. Algorithms suitable for evaluating H(p)(10) and H(p)(0.07) within +/- 30 % are developed from the responses of dosemeter elements/discs under different filters for normal as well as angular irradiation conditions using these beams. The algorithm is tested for TLD badges irradiated to mixtures of low- and high-energy ((137)Cs) beams in various proportions. The paper concludes with the results of test of algorithm by evaluation of badges used in the IAEA/RCA intercomparison studies and discussion on inherent limitations.
