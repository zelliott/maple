The application of phase imaging to refractive index profiling of an optical fiber slice is described. It is shown that the refractive index profile of axially symmetric and asymmetric optical fibers can be obtained from quantitative phase image of thin transverse optical fiber slices. Although this method requires careful and time consuming sample preparation, one advantage of this technique is that it can be applied to a wide range of optical fibers. In this paper results for both symmetric and non-symmetric fibers are presented and good agreement with the industry-standard refracted near-field technique demonstrated.
