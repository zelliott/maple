The available models of the microorganism growth kinetics are analyzed. The possibility of application of the Monod model is studied. It is shown that these models do not permit describing adequately the experimental data at different initial concentrations of biomass and substrate that vary in a wide range. The calculations of the static modes of operation of biochemical react ors differ greatly.
