In this paper, we evaluate the quality of zero bounds on the moduli of univariate complex polynomials. We select classical and recently developed bounds and evaluate their quality by using several sets of complex polynomials. As the quality of priori bounds has not been investigated thoroughly, our results can be useful to find optimal bounds to locate the zeros of complex polynomials.
