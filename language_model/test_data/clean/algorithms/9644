Based on the inequality analysis, matrix theory and spectral theory, a class of general periodic neural networks with delays and impulses is studied. Some sufficient conditions are established for the existence and globally exponential stability of a unique periodic solution. Furthermore, the results are applied to some typical impulsive neural network systems as special cases, with a real-life example to show feasibility of our results.
