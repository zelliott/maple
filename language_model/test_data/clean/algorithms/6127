This paper addresses two challenging issues in unsupervised multiscale texture segmentation: determining adequate spatial and feature resolutions for different regions of the image, and utilizing information across different scales/resolutions. The center of a homogeneous texture is analyzed using coarse spatial resolution, and its border is detected using fine spatial resolution so as to locate the boundary accurately. The extraction of texture features is achieved via a multiresolution pyramid. The feature values are integrated across scales/resolutions adaptively. The number of textures is determined automatically using the variance ratio criterion. Experimental results on synthetic and real images demonstrate the improvement in performance of the proposed multiscale scheme over single scale approaches.
