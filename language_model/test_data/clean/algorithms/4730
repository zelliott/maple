To probe the tertiary structure and domain organization of native methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), the recombinant human e2 isoform was purified to homogeneity and characterized by analytical ultracentrifugation, CD, and protease digestion. The location of intrinsic disorder in the MeCP2 sequence was predicted using the FoldIndex algorithm. MeCP2 was found to be monomeric in low and high salt and over a nearly 1000-fold concentration range. CD indicated that the MeCP2 monomer was nearly 60% unstructured under conditions where it could preferentially recognize CpG dinucleotides and condense chromatin. Protease digestion experiments demonstrate that MeCP2 is composed of at least six structurally distinct domains, two of which correspond to the well characterized methyl DNA binding domain and transcriptional repression domain. These domains collectively are organized into a tertiary structure with coil-like hydrodynamic properties, reflecting the extensive disorder in the MeCP2 sequence. When expressed as individual fragments, the methyl DNA binding domain and transcriptional repression domain both could function as nonspecific DNA binding domains. The unusual structural features of MeCP2 provide a basis for understanding MeCP2 multifunctionality in vitro and in vivo. These studies also establish an experimental paradigm for characterizing the tertiary structures of other highly disordered proteins.
