The hypothesis was put forward that, along with the regulation of mass center projection, the system of upright posture control stabilizes the deviation of pressure center from the position of the mass center projection. The regularities in the behavior of the trajectories of pressure center and mass center projection were analysed. Experimental evidence was obtained supporting the validity of the hypothesis. The structure of the control system that corresponds to the new understanding of the variables being regulated during the maintenance of vertical posture was considered.
