The gravitational gradient of intrapleural pressure is suggested to be less in prone posture than supine. Thus the gravitational distribution of ventilation is expected to be more uniform prone, potentially affecting regional ventilation-perfusion (Va/Q) ratio. Using a novel functional lung magnetic resonance imaging technique to measure regional Va/Q ratio, the gravitational gradients in proton density, ventilation, perfusion, and Va/Q ratio were measured in prone and supine posture. Data were acquired in seven healthy subjects in a single sagittal slice of the right lung at functional residual capacity. Regional specific ventilation images quantified using specific ventilation imaging and proton density images obtained using a fast gradient-echo sequence were registered and smoothed to calculate regional alveolar ventilation. Perfusion was measured using arterial spin labeling. Ventilation (ml·min(-1)·ml(-1)) images were combined on a voxel-by-voxel basis with smoothed perfusion (ml·min(-1)·ml(-1)) images to obtain regional Va/Q ratio. Data were averaged for voxels within 1-cm gravitational planes, starting from the most gravitationally dependent lung. The slope of the relationship between alveolar ventilation and vertical height was less prone than supine (-0.17 ± 0.10 ml·min(-1)·ml(-1)·cm(-1) supine, -0.040 ± 0.03 prone ml·min(-1)·ml(-1)·cm(-1), P = 0.02) as was the slope of the perfusion-height relationship (-0.14 ± 0.05 ml·min(-1)·ml(-1)·cm(-1) supine, -0.08 ± 0.09 prone ml·min(-1)·ml(-1)·cm(-1), P = 0.02). There was a significant gravitational gradient in Va/Q ratio in both postures (P < 0.05) that was less in prone (0.09 ± 0.08 cm(-1) supine, 0.04 ± 0.03 cm(-1) prone, P = 0.04). The gravitational gradients in ventilation, perfusion, and regional Va/Q ratio were greater supine than prone, suggesting an interplay between thoracic cavity configuration, airway and vascular tree anatomy, and the effects of gravity on Va/Q matching.
