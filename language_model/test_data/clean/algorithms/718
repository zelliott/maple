The computer-aided detection of artefacts became an essential task with increasing automation of quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis during anaesthesiological applications. The different algorithms published so far required individual manual adjustment or have been based on limited decision criteria. In this study, we developed an artificial neural networks-(ANN-)aided method for automated detection of artefacts and EEG suppression periods. 72 hr EEG recorded before, during and after anaesthesia with propofol have been evaluated. Selected parameterized patterns of 0.25 s length were used to train the ANN (22 input, 8 hidden and 4 output neurons) with error back propagation. The detection performance of the ANN-aided method was tested with processing epochs between 1 to10 s. Related to examiner EEG evaluation, the average detection performance of the method was 72% sensitivity and 80% specificity for artefacts and 90% sensitivity and 92% specificity for EEG suppression. The improvement in signal-to-noise ratio with automated artefact processing was 1.39 times for the spectral edge frequency 95 (SEF95) and 1.89 times for the approximate entropy (ApEn). We conclude that ANN-aided preprocessing provide an useful tool for automated EEG evaluation in anaesthesiological applications.
