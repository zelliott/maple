This paper proposes an efficient compression scheme for compressing time-varying medical volumetric data. The scheme uses 3-D motion estimation to create a homogenous preprocessed data to be compressed by a 3-D image compression algorithm using hierarchical vector quantization. A new block distortion measure, called variance of residual (VOR), and three 3-D fast block matching algorithms are used to improve the motion estimation process in term of speed and data fidelity. The 3-D image compression process involves the application of two different encoding techniques based on the homogeneity of input data. Our method can achieve a higher fidelity and faster decompression time compared to other lossy compression methods producing similar compression ratios. The combination of 3-D motion estimation using VOR and hierarchical vector quantization contributes to the good performance.
