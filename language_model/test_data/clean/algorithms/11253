Our objective was to estimate the correlation of echodensity and textural features, using ultrasound and digital image analysis, between plaques in patients with bilateral carotid stenosis.

Cross-sectional observational study.

Patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were recruited from Vascular Surgery at the Royal Victoria and Jewish General hospitals in Montreal, Canada. Bilateral pre-operative carotid ultrasound and digital image analysis was performed to extract echodensity and textural features using a commercially available Plaque Texture Analysis software (LifeQMedical Ltd). Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed. Partial correlation coefficients for PCA and individual imaging variables between surgical and contralateral plaques were calculated with adjustment for age, sex, contralateral stenosis, and statin use.

In the whole group (n = 104), the six identified PCA variables and 42/50 individual imaging variables were moderately correlated (r = .211-.641). Correlations between sides were increased in patients with â‰¥50% contralateral stenosis and symptomatic patients.

Textural and echodensity features of carotid plaques were similar between two sides in patients with bilateral stenosis, supporting the notion that plaque instability is determined by systemic factors. Patients with unstable features of one plaque should perhaps be monitored more closely or treated more aggressively for their contralateral stenosis, particularly if this is hemodynamically significant.
