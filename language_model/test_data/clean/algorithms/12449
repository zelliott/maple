This population-based case-finding study sought to determine asthma prevalence and characterize disease severity and burden among school-aged children in the Little Rock School District. Asthma cases were identified by validated algorithm and parental report of asthma diagnosis. The overall response rate was low. Among schools with greater than 50% response rate, prevalence of physician-diagnosed asthma was comparable to other studies in public school settings. Prevalence of symptoms in cases identified as current is suggestive of poor asthma control. Improved systems for case identification of children with asthma are needed in schools. Efforts should focus on strategies to improve asthma control.
