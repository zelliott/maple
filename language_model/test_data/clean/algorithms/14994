Through the process of habituation, the eye rotational response of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) can be reduced by prolonged exposure to a head rotational stimulus. In previous work, the goldfish VOR habituated at a single, low frequency (< or = 0.1 Hz) showed frequency specific effects at and near that frequency, and could be dishabituated when combined with a higher frequency rotation. Here we show that the goldfish VOR exposed to prolonged rotation at two frequencies in combination will still produce habituation at low frequency, and can exhibit effects specific to both frequencies. The VOR at a low frequency can be dishabituated if the combined component is switched to a different frequency. These results demonstrate dual-frequency and context specificity of VOR habituation.
