Fever is a host defense response that provides a sign of an ongoing process related to infection, inflammation, drug reactions, neoplasms, autoimmune diseases, and vascular disorders. The most frequent causes of fever in acutely ill patients are infection and inflammation, but fever may be caused by one or more of a long list of pathophysiologic processes.
