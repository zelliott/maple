Reliable monitoring of respiration plays an important role in a broad spectrum of applications. Today, there are several methods for monitoring respiration, but none of them has proved to be satisfactory in all respects. We have recently developed a bioacoustic method that can accurately time respiration from tracheal sounds. The aim of this study is to tailor this bioacoustic method for monitoring purposes by introducing dedicated signal processing. The method was developed on a material of ten patients and then tested in another ten patients treated in an intensive care unit. By studying the differences in the variation of the spectral content between the different phases of respiration, the described method can distinguish between inspiration and expiration and can extract respiration frequency, and respiration pause periods. The system detected 98% of the inspirations and 99% of the expirations. This method for respiration monitoring has the advantage of being simple, robust and the sensor does not need to be placed closed to the face. A commercial heart microphone was used and we anticipate that further improvement in performance can be achieved trough optimization of sensor design.
