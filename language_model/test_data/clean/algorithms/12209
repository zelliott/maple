Catalytic hydrodechlorination of 2,4-dichlorophenol was studied over 0.97% Pd/C, 0.98% Rh/C and 0.8% Pd-0.19% Rh/C catalysts. The catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of support and characterized by BET surface area, temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The 0.97% Pd/C catalyst, which had the largest crystallite size, was the most active and selective towards the formation of 2- and 4-chlorophenols among three catalysts in liquid phase. Hydrodechlorination activity of carbon-supported catalysts were in the order of Pd/C>Pd/Rh/C>Rh/C. The kinetic equation explained experimental data well and kinetic parameters of three catalysts were provided and discussed.
