Pulsatile secretion of growth hormone (GH) has been observed in healthy controls as well as acromegalic patients. In healthy adults, highly regulated secretory pulses of GH occur 4-8 times within 24 h. This episodic pattern of secretion seems to be related to the optimal induction of physiological effects at the peripheral level. In contrast to normal subjects, acromegalic patients demonstrate an irregular pattern of excessive GH release. This pattern of secretion is responsible for many systemic effects, such as the stimulation of connective tissue growth, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and arthritis. Standard methods for the analysis of pulsatile patterns of hormone secretion did not consistently separate the temporal dynamics of GH release in healthy controls and acromegalic patients under various study conditions. Using the cutting edge technology of artificial neural networks for time series prediction, we were able to achieve significant separation of both groups under various conditions by means of the predictability of their GH secretory dynamics. Improving the predictive results by using a more refined system of multiple neural networks acting in parallel (adaptive mixtures of local experts), we found that this system performed a self-organized segmentation of hormone pulsatility. It separated phases of secretory bursts and quiescence without any prior knowledge of the form of a GH pulse or a model of secretion. Comparing the predictive results for the GH dynamics with those for computer-stimulated stochastic processes, we were able to define the irregular pattern of GH secretion in acromegaly as a random autonomous process. The introduction of neural networks to the analysis of dynamic endocrine systems might help to expand the existing analytical approaches beyond counting frequency and amplitude of hormone pulses.
