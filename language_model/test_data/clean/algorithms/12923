The impact of the inherent optical properties (IOP) variability on the chlorophyll, Chl, retrieval from ocean color remote sensing algorithms is analyzed from an in situ data set covering a large dynamic range. The effect of the variability of the specific phytoplankton absorption coefficient, a(phy)/Chl, specific particulate backscattering coefficient, b(bp)/Chl, and colored detrital matter absorption to non-water absorption ratio, a(cdm)/a(nw), on the performance of standard operational algorithms is examined. This study confirms that empirical algorithms are highly dependent on the specifics IOP values (especially b(bp)/Chl and a(cdm)/a(nw)): Chl is over-estimated in waters with specific IOP values higher than averaged values, and vice versa. These results clearly indicate the necessity to account for the influence of the specific IOP variability in Chl retrieval algorithms.
