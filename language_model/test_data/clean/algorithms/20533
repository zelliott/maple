Prompt and accurate diagnosis of melanoma metastatic to the lymph nodes is important with respect to prognosis and treatment.

The purpose of this study was to determine the utility and diagnostic reliability of fine needle aspiration (FNA) of enlarged nodules in lymph node basins in patients with melanoma.

We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 46 patients with melanoma who underwent a total of 56 FNAs of palpable nodules in lymph node basins.

Of the 56 FNAs, 24 showed melanoma, 26 did not demonstrate melanoma, five were inadequate, and one gave inconclusive but suspect results. Findings were confirmed by open biopsy (n = 35) or clinical follow-up (n = 21). Fifty of 56 FNAs (89%) yielded a definitive diagnosis (sensitivity/specificity = 100% in these 50).

FNA biopsy of enlarged palpable nodules in nodal basins in patients with melanoma is accurate, rapid, and cost-efficient. An algorithm for management of patients with melanoma who have palpable nodes is provided.
