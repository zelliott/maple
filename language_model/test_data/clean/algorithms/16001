A three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound imaging system has been used to study spatial compounding of images acquired with different scanhead positions and orientations. A compounding algorithm has been developed that assigns regional weights depending on the local incidence angle of the ultrasound beam. Compound scans were performed of bones in vitro and the shoulder rotator cuff in volunteer subjects. Border measurements (peak value and width) were compiled as a function of ultrasound beam incidence angle and compared for single views and for maximum, mean and weighted mean compounding techniques. The weighted mean produces less variability than that of the maximum and mean for both intensity and border width. The weighted method also demonstrates less blurring of borders than the maximum and mean methods. Surfaces derived from the weighted reconstructions exhibited fewer gaps and fewer spurious connections between surfaces, which could be of particular importance for automated image analysis.
