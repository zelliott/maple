We undertook this project in response to the rapidly increasing number of protein structures with unknown functions in the Protein Data Bank. Here, we combined a genetic algorithm with a support vector machine to predict protein-protein binding sites. In an experiment on a testing dataset, we predicted the binding sites for 66% of our datasets, made up of 50 testing hetero-complexes. This classifier achieved greater sensitivity (60.17%), specificity (58.17%), accuracy (64.08%), and F-measure (54.79%), and a higher correlation coefficient (0.2502) than those of the support vector machine. This result can be used to guide biologists in designing specific experiments for protein analysis.
