Neurophysiological examinations include EEG, EMG, Evoked Potential (EP) and ENG. In this paper, EEG and EP data processing, and the diagnostic support system using these findings were discussed. The FFT and AR model for analysis of frequency, and the pattern recognition for spike or spindle detection are the technical methods for application to EEG data processing of the first order. Amplitude or phase mapping techniques, as a second order data processing, were not only applied to the diagnosis of neurological disorders, but also used for detection of electrical equivalent dipole source localization which was inversely reconstructed in the cerebral cortex from the distribution of EEG potentials on the scalp. The averaging technique was used for detection of small evoked potentials (EP) such as SEP or ABR. The following items were included in the diagnostic support system applied to data processing. 1) Topographic analysis in the brain mapping of SEP to median nerve stimulation was applied to the identification of the central sulcus during a neurosurgical procedure to maintain the QOL of patient. 2) The usefulness of EEG automatic reporting system with Japanese sentences and brain topographic mapping was described. 3) Digital EEG in a data filing system using magneto optical disks was used for data analysis and diagnostic support system after EEG examination.
