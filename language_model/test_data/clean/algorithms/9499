Continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance imaging for in vivo mapping of spin distribution and spectral shape requires rapid data acquisition. A spectral-spatial imaging technique is presented that provides an order of magnitude reduction in acquisition time, compared to iterative tomographic reprojection. The proposed approach assumes that spectral shapes in the sample are well-approximated by members from a parametric family of functions. A model is developed for the spectra measured with magnetic field modulation. Parameters defining the spin distribution and spectral shapes are then determined directly from the measurements using maximum a posteriori probability estimation. The approach does not suffer approximation error from limited sweep width of the main magnetic field and explicitly incorporates the variability in signal-to-noise ratio versus strength of magnetic field gradient. The processing technique is experimentally demonstrated on a one-dimensional phantom containing a nitroxide spin label with constant g-factor. Using an L-band EPR spectrometer, spectral shapes and spin distribution are accurately recovered from two projections and a spectral window which is comparable to the maximum linewidth of the sample.
