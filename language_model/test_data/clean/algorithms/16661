Echocardiogram is an ultrasound image of the heart that demonstrates the size, motion and composition of cardiac structures and is also used to diagnose various abnormalities of the heart including abnormal chamber size, shape and congenital heart disease. Echocardiography provides important morphological and functional details of the heart. Most of the presented automatic cardiac disease recognition systems that use echocardiograms based on defective anatomical region detection. In this paper we present a simple technique for cardiac geometry detection via echocardiogram images which conquer these borders and exploits cues from cardiac structure. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique, we present results for cardiac geometry detection through difference intensity of echocardiogram images. We have developed a simple program code for the prediction of cardiac geometry using difference intensity of echocardiogram images. With this code, users can generate node or point for detection of cardiac geometry as ventricle and atrium in size, shape and location.
