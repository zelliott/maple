Conventional methods for solving intersections between two offset parametric surfaces often include iteratively using computationally expensive SSI (surface/surface intersections) algorithm. In addition, these methods ignore the relations between the intersection curves of parametric surfaces with different offset distances. The algorithm presented in this paper, makes full use of the topological relations between different intersection loops and calculates intersection loops with the help of previously calculated intersection loops. It first pre-processes two parametric surfaces to obtain the characteristic points, called topology transition points (TTPs), which can help in the subsequent finding of the topologies of the intersection curves. Then these points are categorized into several distinct groups, and we can determine the calculation strategy for searching initial points by analyzing the properties of these TTPs on the surfaces. Hence, all intersection curves can be marched from initial points by the tracing algorithm. The proposed algorithm could calculate intersection curves robustly and effectively, and has been tested to be capable of overcoming the degenerate conditions such as loop and singularities leaking that occur frequently in conventional algorithms.
