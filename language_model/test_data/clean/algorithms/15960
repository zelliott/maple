Significant proteinuria is not an unfinding in children. Its causes are variable. When detected by dipstick examination of urine, the proteinuria must be assessed quantitatively by measuring the urinary protein/creatinine ratio in a spot sample. Orthostatic proteinuria is the most common cause of intermittent proteinuria. Persistent glomerular or tubular proteinuria are the consequences of various glomerulopathies or tubulopathies, the prognosis of which is variable. Whether glomerular or tubular, persistent proteinuria must be fully investigated, including by renal biopsy.
