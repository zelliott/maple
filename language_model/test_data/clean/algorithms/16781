Flexible docking and scoring using the internal coordinate mechanics software (ICM) was benchmarked for ligand binding mode prediction against the 85 co-crystal structures in the modified Astex data set. The ICM virtual ligand screening was tested against the 40 DUD target benchmarks and 11-target WOMBAT sets. The self-docking accuracy was evaluated for the top 1 and top 3 scoring poses at each ligand binding site with near native conformations below 2 Å RMSD found in 91 and 95% of the predictions, respectively. The virtual ligand screening using single rigid pocket conformations provided the median area under the ROC curves equal to 69.4 with 22.0% true positives recovered at 2% false positive rate. Significant improvements up to ROC AUC = 82.2 and ROC((2%)) = 45.2 were achieved following our best practices for flexible pocket refinement and out-of-pocket binding rescore. The virtual screening can be further improved by considering multiple conformations of the target.
