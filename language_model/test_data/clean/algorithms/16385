﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Stoma complications are classified and treated based on the etiology, pathology, location, and clinical presentation of the complication. Clinical assessments and descriptions of abdominal stomal topography differ among care providers, hampering interpretation and communication. Using existing literature and clinical experience at the State Scientific Centre of Coloproctology in Russia, algorithms were developed to facilitate a uniform approach to the diagnosis and choice of treatment of ostomy complications. The algorithms consist of a definite sequence of explicit step-by-step procedures, including visual inspection, digital exploration, and instrumental exploration, for determining whether complications should be categorized and treated as a stoma problem or peristomal skin disorder. The algorithm was subsequently used by nonexpert nurses for all consecutive patients who visited the clinic during a 2-year period. Of the 1,427 patients seen, 553 (38.8%) had 742 complications. Of those, 387 were stoma complications and 355 were classified as peristomal skin disorders (eg, contact dermatitis, hypergranulation of the skin, allergic dermatitis, folliculitis, psoriasis and herpes). Of the 553 patients with complications, the most frequent complications were found to be contact dermatitis (184 patients, 33.3%), parastomal hernia (97, 17.5%), and mucocutaneous separation (72, 13.0%); 176 patients were referred to surgery and 377 received conservative treatment. Although the algorithms remain to be validated, the authors believe that studying the manifestation and causes of complications will help in the selection of justified treatments, which will eventually reduce the number of complications and improve the quality of stoma care.
