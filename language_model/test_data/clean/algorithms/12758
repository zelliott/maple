Détente Instantanée contrôlée (DIC), French for Instant Controlled Pressure Drop, was performed on laboratory apparatus as well as on a pilot plant for proving its feasibility, and identifying the optimized processing conditions and recognizing the energy consumption and the quantity of water used for such an operation. GC-MS and SPME analysis of the extracts and residue material were carried out to assess the extracts and solid residues. The lavandin essential oils obtained by using the new DIC extraction process was studied, modeled and quantitatively and qualitatively compared to the conventional hydrodistillation method. The most important differences between the two essential oils were reflected in the yields, with 4.25 as against 2.3 g EO/100 g of raw matter, and in the extraction time, with 480 s as against some hours for respectively the DIC and the hydrodistillation operations. These differences have been previewed through the fundamental analysis. They can normally explain the great decreasing of energy consumption to be 662 kWh/t of raw material. The amount of water to be added was about 42 kg water/t of raw material.
