This article reviews the technical basics and the application of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography. Ultrasound contrast agents have been evaluated in various organs and have proven to be particularly useful in the detection and characterization of liver lesions. Experiences in small parts (such as breast, or lymph nodes) are so far limited, because only since recently are the technical prerequisites available for contrast-enhanced ultrasound high-frequency transducers. Ultrasound contrast media can be used for functional studies, e. g., of organ or tumor perfusion. Mathematical models were primarily developed for measuring myocardial perfusion and have recently been adapted for studying tumors. In animal experiments as well as in clinical applications, quantitative parameters of tumor perfusion have been evaluated as surrogate parameters for response to radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or treatment with anti-angiogenic agents.
