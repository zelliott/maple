Effects of supraspino-spinal feedforward-feedback (FF-FB) interactions on variability in locomotor rhythm and coordination were examined in in vitro brain-spinal cord lamprey preparations. Spinal locomotor networks were activated by applying 0.2 mM N-methyl-DL-aspartate (NMA) to three spinal pools: gill, rostral and caudal. Bathing the brain with zero Ca(2+) saline altered supraspinal-spinal drive and FF-FB interaction while spino-supraspinal feedback was changed by applying NMA to the caudal pool only. Wavelet analyses indicated a non-uniform energy distribution in ventral root (VR) activity that shifted between frequency bands on FF-FB interruption. Wavelet analysis was used to extract 300-s long epochs of low frequency burst rhythm. These were analyzed using a sliding-window time-varying covariance method. From the autocovariance in each window, the cycle period and height of the first side lobe peak were determined. Rostral VR variability (determined from standard deviation and coefficient of variation of all cycle periods and the mean peak height) was significantly higher than caudal VR variability. FF-FB interruption significantly decreased the rostral VR cycle period and variability but the rostro-caudal gradient remained. The intersegmental delay was also affected. The caudal VR rhythm with NMA in the caudal pool only was slower but more variable than with NMA over the entire cord. These results indicate that the locomotor rhythm in the presence of supraspino-spinal interactions is slower but has a higher variability. The higher variability may reflect a dynamic stability of the system. Additionally, differences in local neural organization likely contribute to rostro-caudal differences in variability of the motor output.
