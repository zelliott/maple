Joint estimation of coil sensitivities and output image (JSENSE) is a promising approach that improves the reconstruction of parallel magnetic resonance imaging (pMRI). However, when acceleration factor increases, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of JSENSE reconstruction decreases as quickly as that of the conventional pMRI. Although sparse constraints have been used to improve the JSENSE reconstruction in recent years, these constraints only use the sparsity of the output image, which cannot fully exploit the prior information of pMRI. In this paper, we use the sparsity of coil images, instead of the output image, to exploit more prior information for JSENSE. Numerical simulation, phantom and in vivo experiments demonstrate that the proposed method has better performance than the SparseSENSE method and the constrained JSENSE method using the sparsity of the output image only.
