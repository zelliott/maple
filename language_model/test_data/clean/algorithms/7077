An informative model developed by the authors for treatment of severe combined trauma is presented. Central place occupy the intellectual activities of the anesthesiologist-resuscitator, while those of the surgeon are only outlined. The construction of the informative model (presented as algorithm) takes into account the fundamental requirements for treatment of severe combined trauma. Analyzing the nature of the informative processes in the model, the authors admit that prognostication is the factor that occupies central place in the treatment of severe combined trauma. The emphasized relative value of prognosis does not underrate the importance of the other intellectual processes in the model: diagnosis, reaching a decision, choice of approach. It is considered that this informative model might be used as auxiliary means in the teaching work in postgraduate qualification courses. At the same time, it furnishes the opportunity to determine the priority in the automation of definite activities in resuscitology.
