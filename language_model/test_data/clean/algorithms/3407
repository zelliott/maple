Computer-based implementation of the ST/HR slope on Marquette CASE 12 is described. ST-segment measurement is performed with improved software for QRS detection and incremental signal updating, and on-line test calculation results from automated linear regression, leading to graphic display of the maximum ST/HR slope at the end of exercise.
