The study was based on 478 oncology patients (72.1 +/- 3.6 years old) with cardiovascular comorbidities operated from 1991 to 2008 in regards of abdominal and pelvic mainly 3rd stage tumors with multimodal general anesthesia (4.2 +/- 1.6 hours). In prospective group (n = 302) all patients received cardiovascular treatment, while in retrospective group (n = 176) only 48.9% received it. The evaluation of the cardiovascular therapy effect was based on the peri-operative and postoperative HR and BP dynamics. The occurrance of noticeable bradycardia and drop of BP lower than 90/60 mm Hg was considered as a deviation. It is revealed that the cardiovascular therapy with beta adrenoblockers and calcium antagonists leads to an intraoperative bradycardia in 59.8% and 73.7% of cases, while in patients without the aforementioned therapy in 26.6% and 46.4% of cases respectively (p < 0.05). Antiarrhythmics don't have a noticeable impact on the development of bradycardia (p = 0.204). Intraoperative hypotension on the basis of ATP inhibitor treatment developed in 92.2% of patients statistically significant (p < 0.01). Monotherapy with calcium antagonists or nitrates leads to the development of hypotension in 55.2% and 41.4% of cases respectively, though in patients without the given therapy a lot more often (p < 0.05). In the case of combined calcium antagonist/nitrate therapy hypotension develops in 55.5% of cases, and in 72.3% without the therapy (p < 0.05). For the means of prevention of cardiovascular complications during the surgical treatment it is appropriate to keep the therapy with nitrates, though vasodilatives should be canceled 12 hours before the surgery.
