The aim of this paper is to develop a multiscale hierarchical hybrid model based on finite element analysis and neural network computation to link mesoscopic scale (trabecular network level) and macroscopic (whole bone level) to simulate the process of bone remodelling. As whole bone simulation, including the 3D reconstruction of trabecular level bone, is time consuming, finite element calculation is only performed at the macroscopic level, whilst trained neural networks are employed as numerical substitutes for the finite element code needed for the mesoscale prediction. The bone mechanical properties are updated at the macroscopic scale depending on the morphological and mechanical adaptation at the mesoscopic scale computed by the trained neural network. The digital image-based modelling technique using μ-CT and voxel finite element analysis is used to capture volume elements representative of 2 mm³ at the mesoscale level of the femoral head. The input data for the artificial neural network are a set of bone material parameters, boundary conditions and the applied stress. The output data are the updated bone properties and some trabecular bone factors. The current approach is the first model, to our knowledge, that incorporates both finite element analysis and neural network computation to rapidly simulate multilevel bone adaptation.
