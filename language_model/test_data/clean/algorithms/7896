Researchers are compelled to use heuristic-based pairwise sequence alignment tools instead of Smith-Waterman (SW) algorithm due to space and time constraints, thereby losing significant amount of sensitivity. Parallelization is a possible solution, though, till date, the parallelization is restricted to database searching through database fragmentation. In this paper, the power of a cluster computer is utilized for developing a parallel algorithm, RPAlign, involving, first, the detection of regions that are potentially alignable, followed by their actual alignment. RPAlign is found to reduce the timing requirement by a factor of upto 9 and 99 when used with the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) and SW, respectively, while keeping the sensitivity similar to the corresponding method. For distantly related sequences, which remain undetected by BLAST, RPAlign with SW can be used. Again, for megabase-scale sequences, when SW becomes computationally intractable, the proposed method can still align them reasonably fast with high sensitivity.
