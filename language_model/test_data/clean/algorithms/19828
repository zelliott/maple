The aim of this study was to find objective analytical methods to study the degradation of edible oils during heating and thus to suggest solutions to improve their stability. The efficiency of Nigella seed extract as natural antioxidant was compared with butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) during accelerated oxidation of edible vegetable oils at 120 and 140 Â°C. The modifications during heating were monitored by 3D-front-face fluorescence spectroscopy along with Independent Components Analysis (ICA), (1)H NMR spectroscopy and classical physico-chemical methods such as anisidine value and viscosity. The results of the study clearly indicate that the natural seed extract at a level of 800 ppm exhibited antioxidant effects similar to those of the synthetic antioxidant BHT at a level of 200 ppm and thus contributes to an increase in the oxidative stability of the oil.
