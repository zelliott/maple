Diffuse optical tomography is an imaging technique whereby spatial maps of absorption and scattering coefficients are derived from the characteristics of multiply scattered light transmitted through the object. The system described here used four intensity-modulated light sources and measurements of the intensity and phase (relative to each source) at 16 or 20 detectors on the surface of a 10 cm diameter cylinder. An iterative Newton-Raphson algorithm was used to estimate the absorption and scattering coefficients at each pixel in a 17 x 17 array minimizing the difference between measured and calculated values of the intensity and phase at the measurement sites. Forward calculations of the intensity and phase were based on a multigrid finite-difference solution of the frequency domain diffusion equation. Numerical simulations were used to examine the resolution, contrast, and accuracy of the reconstructions as well as the effects of measurement noise, systematic uncertainties in source-detector location, and accuracy of the initial estimates for the optical properties. Experimental tests also confirmed that the system could identify and locate both scattering and absorbing inhomogeneities in a tissue-simulating phantom.
