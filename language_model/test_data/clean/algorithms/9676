According to the guidelines the indication for Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) implantation is based on the ejection fraction. However, only a fraction of patients with implanted ICD shows live threatening arrhythmic events followed by adequate shocks. For this reason, further research is needed to find a more sensitive risk stratificator for patients prone to ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Unfortunately, standard prospective studies are time consuming. An alternative approach is to perform retrospective studies on patients with already implanted ICDs. So far, an implanted ICD is an exclusion criterion for Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) studies. To overcome this problem several Blind Source Separation (BSS) algorithms have been tested to find out whether it is possible to separate the disturbances from the cardiac signals, in spite of the extreme difference in amplitude. Not all the methods are able to separate cardiac signal and disturbances. Temporal Decorrelation source Separation (TDSEP) is found to be superior both from a separation and performing point of view. For the first time it is possible to extract cardiac signals from measurements disturbed by an ICD, offering the possibility for a QRS-fragmentation analysis in patients with already implanted ICDs.
