Obtaining a stable formulation with high bioavailability of a poorly water-soluble drug often presents a challenge to the formulation scientist. Transformation of the drug into its more soluble high-energy amorphous form is one method used for improving the dissolution rate of such compounds. The present study uses the spray-drying technique for preparation of solid dispersions (SDs) of tolfenamic acid (TA) and polyvinylpyrrolidone K-30 (PVP). The SDs and TA in the form of a spray-dried powder were initially characterized and compared with a physical mixture and starting materials. Stability of the SDs was monitored over 12 weeks at 25 degrees C and 60% RH. XRPD studies revealed changes in solid state during the formation of the SDs and indicated the presence of TA in the amorphous state. FTIR, together with TGA, suggested molecular interactions (hydrogen-bonding) in the SDs. Dissolution studies proved an increase in the dissolution rate of TA from all SDs. The SDs with higher content of PVP retained TA in the amorphous state throughout the stability study. However, SDs with lower content showed recrystallization of TA after 1 week. Thus, this study reveals the possibility of preparing stable SDs of amorphous TA in PVP with improved dissolution rate.
