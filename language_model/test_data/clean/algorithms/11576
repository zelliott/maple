In the 1st part of this study, monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in layer V of the rat prefrontal cortex (PFC) were evoked by electrical stimulation of layer I. Recordings with intracellular sharp, microelectrodes showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of the EPSP by adenosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (ADP-beta-S). Pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS), when given alone depressed the EPSP and in addition antagonized the effect of ADP-beta-S. Exclusion of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) component of the EPSP by D(.)-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5) abolished the ADP-beta-S-induced depression. The pressure-application of both NMDA and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) caused reproducible depolarizations. ADP-beta-S inhibited the effect of NMDA, but did not alter that of AMPA. PPADS was also under these conditions antagonistic with ADP-beta-S. In the 2nd part of the study, NMDA-induced currents were measured by whole-cell patch-clamp pipettes. ADP-beta-S caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of the responses to NMDA. PPADS alone did not alter the NMDA-currents but again antagonized the action of ADP-beta-S; 2'-deoxy-N(6)-methyladenosine-3',5'-diphosphate (MRS 2179) also abolished the NMDA effect. The ADP-beta-S-induced inhibition persisted in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX) or guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiodiphosphate) (GDP-beta-S) applied to the external medium and the pipette solution, respectively. The 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX) moderately decreased the ADP-beta-S effect. The inhibitory function of ADP-beta-S on EPSPs and the interaction with PPADS was observed also in layer V pyramidal neurons of the parietal somatosensory cortex. In conclusion, metabotropic P2Y(1) receptors appear to exert a new modulatory influence on fast excitatory amino acid transmission in the cerebral cortex.
