In this paper, the problem of estimating the attitude of a micro-nano satellite, obtaining geomagnetic field measurements via a three-axis magnetometer and obtaining angle rate via gyro, is considered. For this application, a QMRPF-UKF master-slave filtering method is proposed, which uses the QMRPF and UKF algorithms to estimate the rotation quaternion and the gyro bias parameters, respectively. The computational complexicity related to the particle filtering technique is eliminated by introducing a multiresolution approach that permits a significant reduction in the number of particles. This renders QMRPF-UKF master-slave filter computationally efficient and enables its implementation with a remarkably small number of particles. Simulation results by using QMRPF-UKF are given, which demonstrate the validity of the QMRPF-UKF nonlinear filter.
