The purpose of this study was to design a clinically applicable classification for distal humeral fractures that would provide guidance to the surgeon with regard to surgical approach and operative management. The new classification was assessed by use of the original radiographs from a study comparing distal humeral fracture classifications undertaken in Oxford, England, and was validated by use of the exact methodology of that study. Nine independent assessors were asked to classify 33 sets of radiographs on 2 separate occasions using the classifications of Riseborough and Radin, Mehne and Jupiter, and the AO, as well as the new classification system. With the use of the kappa statistic, the level of interobserver and intraobserver agreement was determined. The new classification system was found to be both substantially reliable (kappa, 0.664) and reproducible (kappa, 0.732). The new classification achieved superior interobserver and intraobserver agreement compared with the other 3 classification systems, with a low proportion of unclassifiable fractures. Used in conjunction with a management algorithm, we believe that the new classification aids the surgical decision-making process for these complex fractures.
