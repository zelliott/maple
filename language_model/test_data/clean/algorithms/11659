Methods involving fuzzy theory have been rarely applied to genetics. We present an open platform for experimentation with fuzzy numbers as a tool to represent imprecise phenotypes in genetic modeling.

A C++ library for simulation of genetic information transmission is introduced. The study of genetic linkage was its first goal, though a design so general as possible has been meant. Fuzzy-valued phenotypes are handled by means of fuzzy numbers.
