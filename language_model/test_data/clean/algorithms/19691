Treatment of 329 patients aged 4-17 years who had first detected tuberculosis was analyzed. The clinical pattern is mainly represented by infiltrative, focal tuberculosis and tuberculosis of intrathoracic lymph nodes (94.5%) and, in single cases, by other forms of tuberculosis. Treatment was performed according to regimens I and III. The time of abacillation is 1-2 months shorter than positive X-ray changes. In this connection, the results of X-ray monitoring may be regarded as the leading criterion for completion of intensive care. Microbiological monitoring methods should be primarily used to evaluate the initial combination of chemotherapy. The active application of pathogenetic treatment modalities that promote the acceleration of reparative processes (physiotherapy in particular) generated the necessity of using 3 antituberculous agents in the phase of treatment continuation.
