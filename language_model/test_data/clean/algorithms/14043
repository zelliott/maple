We surveyed the use of adjuvant hormonal therapy in patients with endometrial stromal sarcomas.

A questionnaire was circulated among the 130 members of an Internet-based endometrial stromal sarcoma support group. The questions pertained to age at diagnosis, organs involved at diagnosis, recurrences, metastases, current disease status, and treatment protocols, with special focus on hormonal therapy.

The questionnaire was returned by 64 of 120 women (49%). At the time of the study 48 patients (mean follow-up 2.4 (range, 1-9) years) had no evidence of disease (NED) and 16 (mean follow-up 6.2 (range, 1-22) years) were alive with disease (AWD). Of the 16 women AWD, 15 (95%) were being treated with hormones as opposed to ten of 48 (21%) women with NED. Hormone treatment consisted of progestins (15 patients), aromatase inhibitors, aromatase inhibitor plus GnRH analog], or tamoxifen.

Adjuvant hormonal therapy presently appears to be used predominantly in women with advanced or recurrent endometrial stromal sarcomas but is also a potential option for patients after surgery without residual tumor.
