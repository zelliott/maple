The process of artificial rancidification of extra-virgin olive oil due to heating in an oxidizing atmosphere was studied by testing an actual kinetic model of the process and monitoring the thermal oxidative degradation of the polyphenols contained in it. To this end, a series of oxidative degradation experiments were carried out on extra-virgin olive oil samples under isothermal conditions at 98, 120, 140, 160, and 180 degrees C using a thermostatic silicon oil bath. The experimental procedure used in this study carefully followed the recommendations regarding the study of olive oil rancidification set out in the AOM procedure. The change in polyphenol concentration with time was monitored at selected temperatures using a tyrosinase biosensor operating in an organic phase (n-hexane). The activation energy for the polyphenol degradation process determined using the MacCallum method was found to be practically constant throughout most of the process. Furthermore, the application of the so-called "model-fitting" method to this process enabled the specific constant rates to be determined at the above-mentioned selected temperatures. In addition, a confirmation of the activation energy value was obtained by the "model-fitting" method and the algorithm of the kinetic model equation best-fitting the experimental curve representing the whole process was checked. Finally, further very interesting observations were made, for instance, the half-life concentration values of polyphenols at selected temperatures between 98 and 180 degrees C.
