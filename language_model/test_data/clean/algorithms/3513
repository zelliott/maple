Practical disassembly process planning is extremely important for efficient material recycling and components reuse. The research work for the process planning in literature focuses on the generation of optimal sequences based on the predictive information of products. The used products, unfortunately, exhibit high uncertainty since products may experience very different conditions during their use stage. The indeterminate characteristics associated to used products often makes the predetermined plan unrealistic. Their disassembly process has to be decided dynamically adaptive to the products' specific status. To be able to deal with uncertainty in a dynamic decision making process, this paper presents a fuzzy reasoning Petri net (FRPN) model to represent related decision making rules in disassembly process. Using the proposed fuzzy reasoning algorithm based on the FRPN model, the multicriterion disassembly rules can be considered in the parallel way to make the decision automatically and quickly. Instead of producing the disassembly sequences before disassembling a whole product, the proposed method makes intelligent decisions based on dynamically updated status of components in the product at each disassembly step. Therefore, it is adaptive to the changes that arise during the process. Finally, an example is used to illustrate the application of the proposed methodology.
