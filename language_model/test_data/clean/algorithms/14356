To produce a working clinical protocol for pulp therapy techniques in the extensively carious primary molar.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer has recently classified formaldehyde as carcinogenic to human beings. As such, a medicament that can be used to replace formocresol in clinical practice should be identified.

Part I of this paper explored the currently available alternative interventions and materials to formocresol in the form of a narrative review following an extensive literature search. Part II now presents the formation of a specialist group to establish an evidence-based protocol, for the management of the extensively carious primary molar.

A protocol and key points document have been developed to assist clinicians in their treatment planning. Areas for further postgraduate training are identified.
