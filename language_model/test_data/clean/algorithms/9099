This study compared the predicted effect-site concentration of propofol at loss and recovery of consciousness when using target-controlled infusion devices with the same pharmacokinetic model (Marsh) but a different plasma effect-site equilibration rate constant (ke0 ), the Diprifusor(TM) (ke0 0.26 min(-1) ) and Base Primea™ (ke0 1.21 min(-1) ). We studied 60 female patients undergoing minor gynaecological surgery under general anaesthesia. Although the total dose of propofol and time until loss of consciousness were comparable, the effect-site concentration at loss of consciousness was significantly lower with the Diprifusor than with the Base Primea (1.2 (0.3) μg.ml(-1) vs 4.5 (0.9) μg.ml(-1) , respectively, p < 0.001). The effect-site concentration at recovery of consciousness was significantly higher with the Diprifusor than with the Base Primea (1.8 (0.4) μg.ml(-1) vs 1.5 (0.2) μg.ml(-1) , respectively, p = 0.01). In conclusion, the effect-site concentration of propofol differs depending on the ke0 , despite the use of the same pharmacokinetic model. Therefore, the ke0 should be considered when predicting loss and recovery of consciousness based on the effect-site concentration of propofol.
