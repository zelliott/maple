For real-time visualization of the mouse heart (6 to 13 beats per second), a back-end processing system involving high-speed signal processing functions to form and display images has been developed. This back-end system was designed with new signal processing algorithms to achieve a frame rate of more than 400 images per second. These algorithms were implemented in a simple and cost-effective manner with a single field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and software programs written in C++. The operating speed of the back-end system was investigated by recording the time required for transferring an image to a personal computer. Experimental results showed that the back-end system is capable of producing 433 images per second. To evaluate the imaging performance of the back-end system, a complete imaging system was built. This imaging system, which consisted of a recently reported high-speed mechanical sector scanner assembled with the back-end system, was tested by imaging a wire phantom, a pig eye (in vitro), and a mouse heart (in vivo). It was shown that this system is capable of providing high spatial resolution images with fast temporal resolution.
