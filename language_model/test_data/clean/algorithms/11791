How to eliminate the background of other tissue and to protrude the blood vessel information is the basic requirements in DSA. Because of the complexity and non-linearity of the X-ray imaging process, the common DSA technique cannot completely remove other tissue's image which lapped over the vessels. By experiments, this paper analyses and corrects the imaging process of the actual DSA system based on the "equivalent single energy" model, and the results indicate the validity of this method.
