Two new experiments were created to characterize the elasticity of soft tissue using sonoelastography. In both experiments the spectral variance image displayed on a GE LOGIC 700 ultrasound machine shows a moving interference pattern that travels at a very small fraction of the shear wave speed. The goal of this paper is to devise and test algorithms to calculate the speed of the moving interference pattern using the arrival times of these same patterns. A geometric optics expansion is used to obtain Eikonal equations relating the moving interference pattern arrival times to the moving interference pattern speed and then to the shear wave speed. A cross-correlation procedure is employed to find the arrival times; and an inverse Eikonal solver called the level curve method computes the speed of the interference pattern. The algorithm is tested on data from a phantom experiment performed at the University of Rochester Center for Biomedical Ultrasound.
