To review the use of Open Chest Cardiac Compression (OCCC) techniques in postcardiac surgical patients in one specialist cardiothoracic centre in the UK.

A 4-year retrospective audit (April 1995--March 1999) of all cardiac arrest victims and resuscitation practice across two specialist cardiothoracic hospitals. Audit outcomes related to initial survival and survival to discharge, arrest rhythm, reasons for resternotomy, surgical procedure prior to resternotomy and time elapsed from original surgery to resternotomy.

Seventy-two patients (adult and paediatric) suffering cardiac arrest received OCCC following cardiac surgery. Thirty-three patients initially survived (46%) and 12 patients survived to discharge (17%).

In the absence of current European Resuscitation Council guidelines, we adopted recommendations for resternotomy to be performed after 5 min of unsuccessful conventional CPR and OCCC initiated. An adapted ERC algorithm incorporating these recommendations can provide much needed direction in postcardiac surgery cardiac arrest victims.
