An evolutionary optimization process involving a genetic algorithm and combinatorial chemistry was employed for the development of green phosphors which are suitable for tricolor white-light-emitting diodes. To accomplish a high luminescent efficiency at 400 nm excitation, we screened a seven-cation oxide system including Tb, Gd, Ce, Mg, Si, Al, and B. The combination of a genetic algorithm and combinatorial chemistry enhanced the searching efficiency when applied for phosphor screening. As a result, the optimized composition was Tb(0.01)Gd(0.02)Ce(0.04)B(0.1)Si(0.83)O(delta), The luminance of this borosilicate glass was 67% that of ZnS:Cu,Al at 400-nm excitation.
