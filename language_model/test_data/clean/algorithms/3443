Sedimentation field-flow fractionation (SdFFF) elution mode of micron sized particle is described generically as "Hyperlayer" and involves particle size, density, shape and rigidity. It requires the use of specific detectors of mass, size, surface, or of other characteristics of the eluted particles. Correlation of FFF retention data with such signals gives hyphenated information about particle properties. Flow cytometry (FC) is a multi dimensional particle counter, which permits specific particle property characterization using light scattering and fluorescence principles. It appears therefore as a powerful technique for micron sized species description. FC is mostly known for cell analyses, while its potential is much broader once proper calibration performed. In this report, forward angle signal (FS) is calibrated in size by using standard latex beads and produces, for a given particle sample, a number versus size histogram, describing particle size distribution. These histograms can be an alternative to Coulter counting. That methodology is tested with rice starch population (RSP) fractions obtained from FFF separation.
