We describe a method for the creation, manipulation and publication of physical human genome maps. Employing an "intelligent" document interface metaphor, our system uses a commercially available programmable document production system as an interface to primary genetic data resources and externally created mapping algorithms. Our document architecture distinguishes between primary data (usually obtained through database queries) and both manual and programmatic manipulations on these data. Our document architecture can be extended to accommodate a wide range of genetic and physical mapping problems. Because our approach is based on a widely available document preparation product, the principal focus of activity remains centered on the production of genomic maps that can be made available in a wide range of paper and electronic formats.
