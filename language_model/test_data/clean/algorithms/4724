A point prevalence survey of antimicrobial prescribing was performed in 10 Scottish hospitals using the Glasgow Antimicrobial Audit Tool (GAAT). Appropriateness of the intravenous (IV) route was determined by an infectious diseases physician (IDP) and by a computerised algorithm. The IDP also estimated IV agent appropriateness. Each hospital was surveyed on a single day. Of 3826 patients surveyed, 1079 (28.3%) received an antibiotic, 381 (35.3%) intravenously; 197 (28.2%) orally treated had prior IV therapy. Median duration of IV was 4 days (IQR 2-7 days) and oral switch was 3.5 days (2-6). IV route was appropriate in 84% (IDP) and 84.8% (algorithm). Choice of agent was appropriate in 80% (IDP). Third-generation cephalosporins (3GC) (28.3%) were most frequent, followed by co-amoxiclav (20.2%), metronidazole (19.2%) and glycopeptides (18.6%). Regional differences were seen. The study shows it is possible to coordinate, collect and compare data from UK hospitals using the GAAT. Data may usefully inform local and national audit and support prescribing initiatives.
