It is very important for patients after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma that monthly follow-up by tumor makers (AFP/PIVKA-II/AFP-L3) and abdominal ultrasound as well as dynamic CT every 4-6 months are conducted for 2 years after surgery. When recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma is detected by dynamic CT, patients should be treated with anatomic liver resection whenever possible in order to obtain good survival.
