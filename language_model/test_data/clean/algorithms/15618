Moore's Law states that the processing power of microchips doubles every one to two years. This observation might apply to the nascent field of molecular computing, in which biomolecules carry out logical operations. Incorporation of new technologies that improve sensitivity and throughput has increased the complexity of problems that can be addressed. It is an ultimate goal for molecular computers to use the full potential of massive parallelism.
