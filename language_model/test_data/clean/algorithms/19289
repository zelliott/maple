Daunorubicin (DNR) is a significant antineoplastic antibiotic, which is usually applied to a chemotherapy of acute lymphatic and myelogenous leukaemia. Unfortunately, cardiotoxicity research in animals has indicated that DNR is cardiotoxic. Therefore, it is important to quantify DNR in biological fluids. A new algorithm, the alternating fitting residue (AFR) method, and the traditional parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) have been utilized to directly determine DNR in human plasma and urine. These methodologies fully exploit the second-order advantage of the employed three-way fluorescence data, allowing the analyte concentrations to be quantified even in the presence of unknown fluorescent interferents. Furthermore, in contrast to PARAFAC, more satisfactory results were gained with AFR.
