Transient states in the evolution of electrophoretic systems comprising aqueous solutions of weak monovalent acids and bases are simulated. The mathematical model is based on the system of nonstationary partial differential equations, expressing the mass and charge conservation laws while assuming local chemical equilibrium. It was implemented using a high resolution finite-difference algorithm, which correctly predicted the behavior of the concentration, pH and conductivity fields at low computational expense. Both the regular and the irregular modes of separation in capillary zone electrophoresis and isotachophoresis are considered. It is shown that the results of separation, particularly zone order, strongly depend on pH distribution. Simulation data as well as simple analytical assessments may help to predict and correctly interpret the experimental results.
