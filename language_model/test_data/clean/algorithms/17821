Software image registration is a powerful and versatile tool that allows the fusion of molecular and anatomic information. Image registration can be applied to compare anatomic information with function, localize organs and lesions, and plan radiation therapy, biopsy, or surgery. Automatic volume-based image registration techniques have been devised for both linear and nonlinear image alignment. Challenges remain in the validation of the accuracy of software registration. Image registration has been applied clinically in neurology and oncology and may be particularly practical in radiotherapy applications. Potential new applications in cardiology could allow the combination of CT angiography with perfusion and viability images obtained by PET, SPECT, or MRI. Software methods allow versatility in the choice of modalities and facilitate retrospective and selective application. Fully automatic registration algorithms are needed for routine clinical applications. Connectivity, compatibility, and cooperation between various clinical departments are essential for the successful application of software-based image fusion in a hospital setting.
