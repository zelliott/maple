Medical management of suspected radiation casualties requires use of multiparameter biodosimetry because no single biodosimetric measurement is sufficiently robust. This report describes the design and algorithms used in a radiation exposure assessment software application that serves as a diagnostic utility for triage and medical treatment formulation, as well as to convey psychological reassurance, for early-phase assessment of radiation exposures, and for surge response assessment for mass radiological casualties.

The Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute's Biological Dosimetry Research Program developed the integrated multiparameter Biodosimetry Assessment Tool computer program using Microsoft Visual Basic 6 with various second party plug-ins and add-ons. Dose-predicting algorithms were adopted by analyzing data from merged databases of human radiation exposure incidents and normal controls (non-irradiated) volunteers. The results are summarized in user-friendly screens.

BAT algorithms are presented and compared to other previously published dose assessment algorithms based on biological indicators (i.e., onset of vomiting, lymphocyte depletion kinetics). These new algorithms are incorporated into a computer-based program that assists responders and medical providers in recording relevant diagnostic information and assessing significant radiation exposures. It promotes early-phase (<10 d) data collection after a radiation exposure incident and provides data templates for entry of diagnostic information using multiparameter indices. It allows for recording of relevant clinical information and summarizes diagnostic information such as estimated multiparameter doses. Data can be printed and archived in accordance with civilian and military guidelines.
