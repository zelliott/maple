Improvements in the ability to count time endogenously with maturation in rats depends on the normal age dynamics of anxious-phobic state and is associated with the state of the peripheral compartment of the sympatheticoadrenal system. Increases in the lengths of locomotive excursions were accompanied by decreases in anxious-phobic state and increases in the quality of time-keeping. In rats aged three and six months (but not in one-month-old rats), the ability to count time endogenously showed a parabolic relationship with initial anxious-phobic state: the most precise and efficient counting of time intervals needs a certain intermediate level of anxiety, covering a relatively narrow range. Anxious-phobic states beyond this optimum, either increases or decreases, lead to degradation of chronometric ability.
