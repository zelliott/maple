We describe a novel method of reconstructing images of an anisotropic conductivity tensor distribution inside an electrically conducting subject in magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT). MREIT is a recent medical imaging technique combining electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to produce conductivity images with improved spatial resolution and accuracy. In MREIT, we inject electrical current into the subject through surface electrodes and measure the z-component Bz of the induced magnetic flux density using an MRI scanner. Here, we assume that z is the direction of the main magnetic field of the MRI scanner. Considering the fact that most biological tissues are known to have anisotropic conductivity values, the primary goal of MREIT should be the imaging of an anisotropic conductivity tensor distribution. However, up to now, all MREIT techniques have assumed an isotropic conductivity distribution in the image reconstruction problem to simplify the underlying mathematical theory. In this paper, we firstly formulate a new image reconstruction method of an anisotropic conductivity tensor distribution. We use the relationship between multiple injection currents and the corresponding induced Bz data. Simulation results show that the algorithm can successfully reconstruct images of anisotropic conductivity tensor distributions. While the results show the feasibility of the method, they also suggest a more careful design of data collection methods and data processing techniques compared with isotropic conductivity imaging.
