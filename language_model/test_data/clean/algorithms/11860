We developed a wavelet transform-based method to extract the fetal electrocardiogram (ECG) from the composite abdominal signal. This is based on the detection of the singularities obtained from the composite abdominal signal, using the modulus maxima in the wavelet domain. Modulus maxima locations of the abdominal signal are used to discriminate between maternal and fetal ECG signals. Two different approaches have been considered. In the first approach, at least one thoracic signal is used as the a prior to perform the classification whereas in the second approach no thoracic signal is needed. A reconstruction method is utilized to obtain the fetal ECG signal from the detected fetal modulus maxima. The proposed technique is different from the classical time-domain methods, in that we exploit the most distinct features of the signal, leading to more robustness with respect to signal perturbations. Results of experiments with both synthetic and real ECG data have been presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.
