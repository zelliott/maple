In Compton cameras, the measured scattering angle is associated with an uncertainty which becomes larger as the incident gamma-ray energy decreases. Since this uncertainty degrades the spatial resolution of reconstructed images, Hirasawa and Tomitani (2003 Phys. Med. Biol. 48 1009-26) previously revised their analytical reconstruction algorithm to compensate for it. As the new algorithm improved the spatial resolution in effect, they expected an enhancement of the statistical noise. In this paper, the effect of this compensation has been analysed in view of spatial resolution (the FWHM of the noise-free reconstructed image for a point source distribution), statistical noise (the relative standard deviation of reconstructed images for an isotropic source distribution) and image quality (the roughness of reconstructed images for a phantom). The results describe not only the effect of the compensation, but also the relation between the statistical noise and three parameters, i.e., the incident gamma-ray energy, the spatial resolution and the measured total event numbers, in reconstruction with compensation. This relation should be taken into account for the design of Compton cameras with good quality images, i.e., useful image, output.
