Secondary, prespecified analysis of a single-arm, open-label study evaluating the efficacy of olmesartan medoxomil (OM) plus hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes.

After placebo run-in, 192 patients received OM 20 mg/day for 3 weeks. If blood pressure (BP) remained ≥120/70 mmHg, patients were uptitrated every 3 weeks to OM 40 mg/day, OM/HCTZ 40/12.5 mg/day, and OM/HCTZ 40/25 mg/day. Efficacy was evaluated by 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring. Secondary endpoints included changes in ambulatory systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) during daytime (08:00 to 16:00) and nighttime (22:00 to 06:00), as well as achievement of prespecified ambulatory BP targets in the total cohort and subgroups based on gender, race, hypertension severity, and age (≥65 or <65 years). Dipper status (nocturnal decrease in BP ≥10% of mean daytime BP) was assessed.

At baseline, mean ambulatory BP was 151.2 ± 12.7/87.6 ± 9.0 mmHg during the daytime and 140.3 ± 13.1/78.1 ± 8.6 mmHg during the nighttime. Mean daytime and nighttime ambulatory BP was reduced from baseline by 22.3 ± 13.7/12.0 ± 8.9 mmHg and 18.8 ± 12.4/ 10.2 ± 7.2 mmHg, respectively. The reduction in daytime ambulatory SBP was 24.4 ± 11.8 mmHg in Blacks, 21.7 ± 14.2 mmHg in non-Blacks, 23.6 ± 12.3 mmHg in females, 21.2 ± 14.8 mmHg in males, 23.4 ± 11.6 mmHg in patients aged ≥65 years, and 21.9 ± 14.4 mmHg in those aged <65 years. Ambulatory BP targets of <130/80, <125/75, and <120/80 mmHg were reached by 51.7%, 36.0%, and 32.6% of patients during the daytime and 69.8%, 60.5%, and 50.6% of patients during the nighttime. After 12 weeks of treatment, 36.4% of baseline nondippers converted to dippers.

OM ± HCTZ effectively lowered ambulatory BP in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension, enabling them to achieve ambulatory BP targets during both the daytime and nighttime.
