Swallow segmentation is a critical precursory step to the analysis of swallowing signal characteristics. In an effort to automatically segment swallows, we investigated artificial neural networks (ANN) with information from cervical dual-axis accelerometry, submental MMG, and nasal airflow. Our objectives were (1) to investigate the relationship between segmentation performance and the number of signal sources and (2) to identify the signals or signal combinations most useful for swallow segmentation. Signals were acquired from 17 healthy adults in both discrete and continuous swallowing tasks using five stimuli. Training and test feature vectors were constructed with variances from single or multiple signals, estimated within 200 ms moving windows with 50% overlap. Corresponding binary target labels (swallow or non-swallow) were derived by manual segmentation. A separate 3-layer ANN was trained for each participant-signal combination, and all possible signal combinations were investigated. As more signal sources were included, segmentation performance improved in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and adjusted accuracy. The combination of all four signal sources achieved the highest mean accuracy and adjusted accuracy of 88.5% and 89.6%, respectively. A-P accelerometry proved to be the most discriminatory source, while the inclusion of MMG or nasal airflow resulted in the least performance improvement. These findings suggest that an ANN, multi-sensor fusion approach to segmentation is worthy of further investigation in swallowing studies.
