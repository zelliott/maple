A new laser speckle-contrast analysis (LASCA) technique based on multi-exposure imaging was employed to simultaneously study pial arteriolar responses with cerebrocortical perfusion changes to various vasodilator (5-10% CO(2) ventilation, bradykinin (1-10 μM), N-methyl-D-aspartate (100 μM)) vasoconstrictor (10-100 μM noradrenaline, 1M KCl), or neutral (2.1% H(2) ventilation) stimuli as well as to asphyxia in the newborn piglet. Anesthetized, ventilated animals (n=20) were fitted with closed cranial windows. Multiple exposure laser-speckle image series (1-100 ms) were obtained using a near infrared diode laser (λ=808 nm). The autocorrelation decay time (τ) of speckle fluctuations was determined over pial arterioles and parenchymal areas to express 1/τ being proportional to blood flow velocity by two different LASCA techniques: our novel multi-exposure or a single exposure (2 and 20 ms) approach. 1/τ values yielded by different LASCA techniques were not significantly different at most points. LASCA easily detected both increases and decreases in cortical blood flow (CoBF). Cortical 1/τ changes to hypercapnia closely matched quantitative CoBF data determined previously, and were also in accordance with increases of pial arteriolar blood flow, calculated from arteriolar flow velocity and cross sectional area changes. In summary, LASCA emerges as an appealing method to simultaneously study microvascular reactivity and cortical perfusion changes in the piglet.
