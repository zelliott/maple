A number of ancillary supplies are used in the process of administering subcutaneous immunoglobulin. The particular type of ancillary supplies used (needles, tubing, and tape) may contribute to the development of issues at the local infusion site. Patient case studies demonstrate that changes in the choice of ancillary supplies can often alleviate these issues. The use of alternative ancillary supplies should be considered prior to the possibility of changing immunoglobulin replacement products in patients experiencing local infusion-site issues in order to improve outcomes and increase compliance. A treatment progression algorithm of ancillary supply adjustments has been developed.
