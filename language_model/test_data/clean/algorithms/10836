A new mathematical model, aimed at investigating the behaviors of microwave drying of traditional chinese medicine was established. It based on mass-energy consersvation law. Dioscorea opposita Thunb. was used as sample and its drying efficiency have been developed at different levels of microwave power and sample thickness. The results shown that the levels of them have a strong influence on drying process. The experimental values were approximately in accord with the calculated values by mathematical model. It explained successfully the behaviors of microwave drying of Diosorea opposita Thunb. slices.
