Toxicity studies with drugs in animals are performed to establish the toxicity profile including the no-toxic-effect-level in the animals. One of the responses used in the search for effects is organ weight. Since organ weight is related to body weight of the animal, the analysis of organ weight has to be adjusted. A traditional analysis of covariance with body weight as covariate is not always appropriate since the body weight itself can be affected by the test compound. Hence, a multivariate analysis of variance is suggested, where the correlation between organ weight and body weight is taken into account in testing an overall treatment effect. Two dimensional plots of the contour curves are used to visualize the treatment effect on organ weight and body weight simultaneously. The test procedure suggested for comparing differences between control and treated groups of animals is: start by testing hypotheses of equality of covariance matrices for the different treatment groups and then, depending on the results from the first test, test equality of the mean vectors.
