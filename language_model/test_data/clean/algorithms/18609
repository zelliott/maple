In this paper, the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium point and absolute stability of a class of neural networks with partially Lipschitz continuous activation functions are investigated. The neural networks contain both variable and unbounded delays. Using the matrix property, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium point of the neural networks is obtained. By constructing proper vector Liapunov functions and nonlinear integro-differential inequalities involving both variable delays and unbounded delay, using M-matrix theory, sufficient conditions for absolutely exponential stability are obtained.
