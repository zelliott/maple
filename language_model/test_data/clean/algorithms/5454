Lengsin is an eye lens protein with a glutamine synthetase domain. We previously identified this protein as a lung carcinoma antigen through cDNA microarray analysis. Lengsin protein is overexpressed irrespective of the histological type of lung carcinoma, but not in normal tissues other than the lens. Therefore, to significantly extend the use of Lengsin-based T-cell immunotherapies for the treatment of patients with lung carcinoma, we searched for HLA-A*0201-restricted epitopes from this protein by screening predicted Lengsin-derived candidate peptides for the induction of tumor-reactive CTLs. Four Lengsin-derived peptides were selected by computerized algorithm based on a permissive HLA-A*0201 binding motif, and were used to immunize HLA-A*0201 transgenic (HHD) mice. Two of the immunizing peptides, Lengsin(206-215)(FIYDFCIFGV) and Lengsin(270-279)(FLPEFGISSA), induced peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in HHD mice, and thus were used to stimulate human peripheral blood lymphocytes inÂ vitro. Lengsin(206-215) and Lengsin (270-279) also induced human peptide-specific CTLs, and we were able to generate Lengsin(206-215)- and Lengsin(270-279)-specific CTL clones. The Lengsin(270-279)-specific CTL clone specifically recognized peptide-pulsed T2 cells, COS-7 cells expressing HLA-A*0201 and Lengsin, and HLA-A*0201+/Lengsin+ lung carcinoma cells in an HLA-A*0201-restricted manner. On the other hand, the Lengsin(206-215)-specific CTL clone failed to recognize HLA-A*0201+/Lengsin+ target cells in the absence of cognate peptide. These results suggest that Lengsin(270-279) is naturally processed and presented by HLA-A*0201 molecules on the surface of lung carcinoma cells and may be a new target for antigen-specific T-cell immunotherapy against lung cancer.
