Persistent states are believed to be the correlate for short-term or working memory. Using a previously derived model for working memory, we show that disruption of the lateral inhibition can lead to a variety of pathological states. These states are analogs of reflex or pattern-sensitive epilepsy. Simulations, numerical bifurcation analysis, and fast-slow decomposition are used to explore the dynamics of this network.
