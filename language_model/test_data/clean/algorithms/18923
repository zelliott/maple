TimeClust is a user-friendly software package to cluster genes according to their temporal expression profiles. It can be conveniently used to analyze data obtained from DNA microarray time-course experiments. It implements two original algorithms specifically designed for clustering short time series together with hierarchical clustering and self-organizing maps.

TimeClust executable files for Windows and LINUX platforms can be downloaded free of charge for non-profit institutions from the following web site: http://aimed11.unipv.it/TimeClust.
