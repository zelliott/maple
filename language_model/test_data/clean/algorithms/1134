Laparoscopy is ideal for the diagnosis of acute pelvic pain and the treatment of gynecologic emergencies. It is as safe and effective as laparotomy for the treatment of ectopic pregnancy, ovarian cysts, dermoid cysts, and adnexal torsion. Treatment with laparoscopy results in shorter hospital stay and faster recovery. Future fertility is not compromised and in some cases may be improved with laparoscopic treatment. There are also studies suggesting that laparoscopy can be used safely for the diagnosis and treatment of gynecologic emergencies in the first and second trimester of pregnancy.
