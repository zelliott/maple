This is the first attempt devoted to the 1st-4th order statistic analysis of the complex degree of mutual polarization of biological tissues coherent images. The ensemble of diagnostic criteria (skewness and kurtosis of two-dimensional distributions of complex degree of mutual polarization) of pathological changes of muscular and connective (skin derma) tissues is defined.
