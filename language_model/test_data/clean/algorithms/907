Spectral analysis of heart rates during 24-hr ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring has been carried out to characterize the heart rate spectral components of Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) by using fast Fourier transformation (FFT). Eight patients with congestive heart failure were selected for the study. FFT analyses have been performed for 614.4 sec. Out of the power spectrum, five parameters were extracted to characterize the CSR. The low peak frequencies in eight subjects were between 0.0179 Hz (56 sec) and 0.0081 Hz (123 sec). The algorithms used to detect CSR are the followings: (i) if the LFPA/ULFA ratios were above the absolute value of 1.0, and (ii) the LFPP/MLFP ratios were above the absolute values of 4.0, then the power spectrum is suggestive of CSR. We conclude that the automatic detection of CSR by heart rate spectral analysis during ambulatory ECG monitoring may afford a tool for the evaluation of the patients with congestive heart failure.
