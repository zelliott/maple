The experience of Advanced Trauma Life Support training received by three anaesthetists is discussed with particular reference to the teaching of airway management, the grade of staff who should attend the present courses and the relevance to the British hospital system. We conclude that these courses are useful but limited by their inflexibility and failure to recognise the difference in skill mix in the British setting.
