We propose a new mathematical framework to formulate scale structures of general systems. Stack equations characterize a system in terms of accumulative scales. Their behavior at each scale level is determined independently without referring to other levels. Most standard geometries in mathematics can be reformulated in such stack equations. By involving interaction between scales, we generalize stack equations into scale equations. Scale equations are capable to accommodate various behaviors at different scale levels into one integrated solution. On contrary to standard geometries, such solutions often reveal eccentric scale-dependent figures, providing a clue to understand multiscale nature of the real world. Especially, it is suggested that the Gaussian noise stems from nonlinear scale interactions.
