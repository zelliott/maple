In radiotherapy involving thermal and epithermal neutrons, the knowledge of dose distributions, with separation of the contribution of each secondary radiation component, is of utmost importance. Layers of Fricke-Xylenol-Orange-infused gel dosemeters give the possibility of achieving such requirements because, owing to the layer-geometry, enriching or depleting the gel matrix of suitable isotopes does not sensibly alter neutron transport. The dosimetry method has been critically re-examined with the aim of improving its suitability to boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) requirements, as it applies to the protocol of measurement and analysis, the sensitivity of the method and the range of the linearity of the dosemeters. Software has been developed and studied to obtain automatically the images of the various dose components with the established separation procedure.
