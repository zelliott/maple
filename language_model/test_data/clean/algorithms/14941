Widely accepted in Europe and Asia as a screening tool for blunt abdominal trauma, sonography is gradually gaining popularity among trauma and emergency physicians in the United States. Sonography has been shown to be comparable with DPL and CT for the detection of hemoperitoneum and superior to both modalities because of its rapidity, noninvasiveness, portability, and low cost. With its ability to demonstrate the amount of intraperitoneal hemorrhage within minutes of a patient's arrival, sonography may be considered the screening modality of choice for blunt abdominal trauma.
