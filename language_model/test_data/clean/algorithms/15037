The paper describes a general set of properties that represent most apnoeas as found in an abdominal breathing signal. An apnoea is a pause in breathing during sleep, and only central apnoeas in infants are considered. Human experts are consulted to determine what properties of the signal they use to recognise apnoeas. A set of deterministic, or shape, properties is developed to represent expert opinion. An apnoea is modelled as a flat region with four properties: flatness, duration, thinness and smoothness. Mathematical descriptions of each property are formulated that discriminate between apnoea and non-apnoea events, and each description is tested for discrimination and independence. The average power of discrimination is 24% +/- 16% and the average correlation coefficient is 0.28 +/- 0.16. Applications include scoring apnoeas for sleep studies and developing standard definitions of apnoeas.
