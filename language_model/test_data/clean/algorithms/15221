Pars planitis is an intermediate uveitis with bilateral and asymmetric presentation. The etiology is unknown and pathogenesis is unclear. Treatment follows the algorithm of Foster, which includes selective photocoagulation. The mechanism of action of photocoagulation is still unknown.

An observational, longitudinal, ambispective cohort study was performed with the objective of evaluating the course of inflammation in patients with pars planitis treated with a selective argon laser.

The study included 29 patients (10 female and 19 male) diagnosed with pars planitis and were treated with selective laser. The mean age of onset was 11.77 years. Eighteen (62.1%) patients were not immunosuppressed at the time of receiving the selective laser, and 11 (37.9%) were taking immunosuppressants. Indications for selective laser were; following the algorithm, 19 (65.55%), vitreous hemorrhage 7 (24.1%), vitrectomy 2 (6.98%), and neovascularization 1 (3.4%). The mean time for inflammation reduction was 5.9 months, and 17 patients (58.6%) had no relapse. Visual acuity showed improvement post-laser (OD P=.025 and OI P=.022). There was also an improvement in vitreous cells.

Selective laser was effective in 58.6%% of patients.
