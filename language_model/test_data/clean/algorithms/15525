We developed a new algorithm that estimates locations and sizes of anomalies in electrically conducting medium based on electrical impedance tomography (EIT) technique. When only the boundary current and voltage measurements are available, it is not practically feasible to reconstruct accurate high-resolution cross-sectional conductivity or resistivity images of a subject. In this paper, we focus our attention on the estimation of locations and sizes of anomalies with different conductivity values compared with the background tissues. We showed the performance of the algorithm from experimental results using a 32-channel EIT system and saline phantom. With about 1.73% measurement error in boundary current-voltage data, we found that the minimal size (area) of the detectable anomaly is about 0.72% of the size (area) of the phantom. Potential applications include the monitoring of impedance related physiological events and bubble detection in two-phase flow. Since this new algorithm requires neither any forward solver nor time-consuming minimization process, it is fast enough for various real-time applications in medicine and nondestructive testing.
