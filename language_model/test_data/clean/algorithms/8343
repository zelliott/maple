A hypothetical model of the transmembrane (TM) protein of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is proposed that is derived from the known structure of the influenza TM protein HA2. This model is consistent with computer algorithms of predicted protein structure and with known properties of TM proteins determined by sequence homology, site-directed mutations, peptide analogs, immunochemistry, or other biologic means. It is applicable to a wide variety of retroviral TM proteins differing widely in overall molecular weight.
