An inclusion complex of hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin (HPbetaCD), an amorphous, highly water soluble derivative and aceclofenac (AC), was prepared by the kneading method. The complex was further characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray powder diffractometry (XRD), fourier-transform infra red spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and in vitro dissolution studies. The dissolution of AC from the inclusion complex studied by the dispersed powder technique showed significant dissolution enhancement in case of the kneaded product (KN) compared to pure AC. The complex possessed good compressibility and the tablets so compressed displayed good dissolution profile. The dissolution data were characterized by different model independent parameters such as dissolution efficiency (DE), difference factor (f1) and similarity factor (f2).
