The idea that dopamine mediates the reinforcing effects of stimuli persists in the field of neurosciences. The present study shows that haloperidol, a dopamine antagonist, does not eliminate the reinforcing value of food reinforcers. The ratio of reinforcers changed seven times across two levers within sessions, modeling a dynamic environment. The magnitude of the reinforcer was manipulated independently of the reinforcer ratio. Four doses of intraperitoneal haloperidol were assessed over periods of 12 daily sessions. Haloperidol did not impair the discrimination that the rats established between rich and lean levers; the response distributions favored the lever associated with the higher probability of reinforcement and the larger pellets. The parameters of the generalized matching law (bias and sensitivity) were used to estimate effects of haloperidol upon the motor system and upon the rats' motivation for food reinforcers.
