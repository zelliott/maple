This paper describes an improved spike triggered averaging technique for the assessment of control properties and conduction velocity (CV) of single motor units (MUs) of the tibialis anterior muscle during voluntary muscle contractions. The method is based on the detection of multi-channel surface EMG signals (with linear electrode arrays) and intramuscularly recorded single MU action potentials (MUAPs). Intramuscular electrodes were inserted in the muscle taking into account the MU structural properties (innervation zone, tendon locations, length of the fibers), assessed by the linear array surface EMG detection technique. An algorithm for intramuscular EMG signal decomposition is used to identify single MUAP trains. The MUAPs detected by the intramuscular EMG decomposition algorithm were used to trigger and average the multi-channel EMG signals. CV of single averaged surface MUAPs was estimated by the use of advanced signal processing methods based on multi-channel recordings which allow to consistently reduce the variance of CV estimates compared with traditional two channel delay estimators. The number of averaged potentials can thus be limited, resulting in high temporal resolution CV estimates. The developed technique was tested on recordings from the tibialis anterior muscle in 11 volunteers during fatigue. It was shown that the method allows the assessment of single MU CV changes (fatigue) as small as 0.1 m/s with less than 2 s data epochs. The method allows reliable assessment of firing rate and conduction properties of single MUs with applications for the investigation of central and peripheral fatigue mechanisms.
