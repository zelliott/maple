To describe the development of a pharmacist-managed lipid clinic within a primary care medical clinic and review its results after approximately 12 months of operation.

A pharmacist-managed lipid clinic was developed at Naval Medical Center San Diego. Administrative background, treatment algorithm development, operational issues, clinical activities, and barriers to the clinic are discussed. For intermediate outcomes, data from patients who had at least 1 intervention by the pharmacist and 1 follow-up lipid panel were analyzed for medication use, changes in lipid parameters, and percent reaching the low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) target goal. Modified National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel II guidelines were used to determine the LDL goal.

Following approximately 12 months of operation, the clinic received 204 referrals and consisted of 146 active patients. A brief study was conducted to assess clinical outcomes. Of 115 patients who were seen in the clinic and met inclusion criteria, 57% were receiving treatment with a hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) and 17% were receiving fibrates; 17% of the patients were not receiving lipid-lowering medications. Relative to baseline, LDL cholesterol concentrations decreased 20%, high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol increased 11%, and triglycerides decreased 19%. Overall, LDL goals were reached in 77% of the patients. LDL goals were attained by 63%, 79%, and 93% of patients with targets of <100, <130, and <160 mg/dL, respectively. Results are compared with other studies regarding lipid goal attainment.

A pharmacist-managed lipid clinic can be developed and integrated into a primary care medical clinic. Pharmacists can effectively manage lipid-lowering therapy, helping to achieve LDL goals.
