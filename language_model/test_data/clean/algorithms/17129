The aim of this study was to find an algorithm of better fit for early eye growth than the linear regression usually advanced.

The analysis is based on previously published around term data, the main material being axial ultrasound measurements in preterm (n = 101) and full term infants (n = 25). The postconceptional age of the infants ranged between 36 and 54 weeks. Previously published Danish data from eyes of aborted fetuses were also used, as were averaged values from the literature regarding eye size at age 1 year (20 mm), 3 years (22 mm), and a presumed 13 year endpoint of 23 mm.

A second order exponential function fitted with the basic data within a standard deviation of 2%.

A simple symbolic expression and tabulated values for eye growth in infancy and childhood were derived. This is clearly of practical value, for example, when following the development of eyes treated for congenital glaucoma or assessing other developmental anomalies and early eye diseases.
