When presented with the apparently infertile bitch, the practitioner must sort through a myriad of facts, historical events, and diagnostic tests to uncover the etiology of the problem. Many bitches that present for infertility are reproductively normal and are able to conceive with appropriate intervention and breeding management. An algorithmic approach is helpful in cases of infertility, where simple questions lead to the next appropriate step. Most bitches can be categorized as either cyclic or acyclic, and then further classified based on historical data and diagnostic testing. Each female has a unique set of circumstances that can affect her reproductive potential. By utilizing all available information and a logical approach, the clinician can narrow the list of differentials and reach a diagnosis more quickly.
