Approximation capabilities of two types of computational models are explored: dictionary-based models (i.e., linear combinations of n-tuples of basis functions computable by units belonging to a set called "dictionary") and linear ones (i.e., linear combinations of n fixed basis functions). The two models are compared in terms of approximation rates, i.e., speeds of decrease of approximation errors for a growing number n of basis functions. Proofs of upper bounds on approximation rates by dictionary-based models are inspected, to show that for individual functions they do not imply estimates for dictionary-based models that do not hold also for some linear models. Instead, the possibility of getting faster approximation rates by dictionary-based models is demonstrated for worst-case errors in approximation of suitable sets of functions. For such sets, even geometric upper bounds hold.
