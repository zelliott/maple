This paper discusses two points regarding the interpretation of dose-time effects on tumor control in head and neck data. It is shown that the sample size in many clinical series will be too small to be able to statistically detect a dose-response relationship. The results from a non-parametric regression technique applied to control rate data from a large number of institutions suggest an influence of both dose and time on the control rate and qualitatively agree with a previous analysis of these data.
