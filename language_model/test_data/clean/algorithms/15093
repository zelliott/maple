In order to predict curvature of DNA fragments, we previously developed a computer program for simply calculating a vectorial sum of all individual roll, tilt and twist wedge angles between the nearest base pairs for a given DNA fragment [Lee et al., (1991)]. Now, a new program, called Z-curve, was developed to calculate three-dimensional coordinates of the helical center of each base pair along the DNA, using helical axis deviations from B-form DNA by wedge angles. The output file of the new program was designed to become an input file for a graphics program, Insight II. Thus, we were able to obtain three-dimensional graphic presentations of DNA helical axis curvatures of any length. It visualized spatial details of the DNA curvature, where and how much it curves, and to which direction. It also allowed calculation of the three-dimensional distance between two ends of a DNA fragment, which could provide a measure of its curvature. Here, three DNA fragments, both curved and straight, were subjected to the Z-curve and Insight II programs. The results showed that their curvature details could be visualized to the level of the base pair, whether the DNA fragments contained an oligo(A) track or not. Their estimated curvatures were consistent with the experimental results of permutation gel mobility assay.
