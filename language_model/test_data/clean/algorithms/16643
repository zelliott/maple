In recent years, fiber Bragg grating (FBG), for the well-known advantages over other fiber optic sensors, has attracted more attention in ultrasonic inspection for structure health monitoring (SHM). Spectrum shift of FBG to ultrasonic wave is caused by the refractive index profile changing along the FBG, which can be attributed to nonuniform perturbation caused by strain-optic and geometric effects of ultrasonic wave. Response of FBG to the above two effects was analyzed firstly by the V-I transmission matrix model, showing high computing efficiency. Based on this model, spectra response of FBG under changing ultrasonic frequencies was simulated and discussed. In experiment, the system was able to detect a wideband ultrasonic wave ranging from 15 to 1380 kHz. These results would provide a guideline for an FBG-based acoustic detection system design in a specific ultrasonic frequency.
