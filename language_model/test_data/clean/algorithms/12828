Downloadable software upgrades are common in consumer electronics but not in implantable medical devices. Fractures of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) leads present commonly as inappropriate shocks. A lead-integrity alert (LIA) designed to reduce inappropriate shocks is the first software download approved to enhance nominally functioning, previously implanted ICDs.

We performed a prospective study to determine whether an LIA could reduce inappropriate shocks. Patients were included if they had ICD lead fractures confirmed by analysis of explanted leads. The LIA group included the first 213 patients who met the inclusion criteria after the LIA was approved who had the LIA downloaded. The LIA is triggered either by high impedance or rapid oversensing. It responds by delaying detection of ventricular fibrillation and initiating a patient alert every 4 hours. The control group included the first 213 patients who did not have the LIA downloaded. They were monitored by conventional daily impedance measurements that respond with a daily alert. The LIA group had a 46% relative reduction (95% confidence interval 34% to 55%) in the percentage of patients with ≥1 inappropriate shock (LIA 38% versus control 70%, P<0.001) and a 50% relative reduction (95% confidence interval 33% to 61%) in the percentage with ≥5 shocks (25% versus 50%, P<0.001). The LIA group also had a higher percentage of patients who either did not receive a shock or had ≥3 days of warning before the shock (72% versus 50%, P<0.001).

A software download that upgrades previously implanted ICDs without surgical revision reduces inappropriate shocks caused by lead fractures.
