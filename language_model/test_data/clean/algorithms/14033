The purpose of this study was to find out whether mandibular bone tissues on dental panoramic tomograms (DPTs) are statistically significantly different between osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic women. We wanted to develop a simple method of common DPT analysis that could represent a simple, inexpensive and readily available screening tool for osteoporosis.

DPT images of 36 women with primary osteoporosis were compared with 20 DPT images of non-osteoporotic women of the same age group. Scanned DPTs were analysed using public computer software. Mandibular atrophy was assessed by six anatomic indexes. Anatomic indexes were divided into subgroups regarding the presence of teeth. Relative bone density (RBD) was assessed using a colour histogram (CH) plugin. Nine RBD indexes were calculated as relations of CH values measured on specific sites of the mandible.

The subtractions of average values of anatomic indexes with and without a tooth were 1.5 to 2.5 times higher in the osteoporotic group of women. Average of RBD indexes differed statistically significantly between the groups (P<0.05). Three RBD indexes differed statistically significantly between groups (P<0.05).

Mandibular bone tissues on DPTs are statistically significantly different between osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic women. RBD of the mandible is statistically significantly lower in the osteoporotic group of women. We developed a simple method of common DPT analysis, which could represent a simple, inexpensive and readily available screening tool for osteoporosis.
