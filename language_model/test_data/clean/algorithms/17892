This correspondence proposes a systematic adaptive sliding-mode controller design for the robust control of nonlinear systems with uncertain parameters. An adaptation tuning approach without high-frequency switching is developed to deal with unknown but bounded system uncertainties. Tracking performance is guaranteed. System robustness, as well as stability, is proven by using the Lyapunov theory. The upper bounds of uncertainties are not required to be known in advance. Therefore, the proposed method can be effectively implemented. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.
