This chapter describes a practical procedure to dissect metabolic systems, simplify them, and use or derive enzyme rate equations in order to build a mathematical model of a metabolic system and run simulations. We first deal with a simple example, modeling a single enzyme that follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics and operates in the middle of an unbranched metabolic pathway. Next we describe the rules that can be followed to isolate sub-systems from their environment to simulate their behavior. Finally we use examples to show how to derive suitable rate equations, simpler than those needed for mechanistic studies, though adequate to describe the behavior over the physiological range of conditions.Many of the general characteristics of kinetic models will be obvious to readers familiar with the theory of metabolic control analysis (Cornish-Bowden, Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics, Wiley-Blackwell, Weinheim, 327-380, 2012), but here we shall not assume such knowledge, as the chapter is directed toward practical application rather than theory.
