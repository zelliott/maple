Radiology reports frequently contain references to image slices that are illustrative of described findings, for instance, "Neurofibroma in superior right extraconal space (series 5, image 104)". In the current workflow, if a report consumer wants to view a referenced image, he or she needs to (1) open prior study, (2) open the series of interest (series 5 in this example), and (3) navigate to the corresponding image slice (image 104). This research aims to improve this report-to-image navigation process by providing hyperlinks to images. We develop and evaluate a regular expressions-based algorithm that recognizes image references at a sentence level. Validation on 314 image references from general radiology reports shows precision of 99.35%, recall of 98.08% and F-measure of 98.71%, suggesting this is a viable approach for image reference extraction. We demonstrate how recognized image references can be hyperlinked in a PACS report viewer allowing one-click access to the images.
