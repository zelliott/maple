Helio-geomagnetic influences on the human circulation are investigated on the basis of an 11-year-long record from a clinically healthy cardiologist, 35 years of age at the start of monitoring. He measured his blood pressure and heart rate around the clock with an ambulatory monitor programmed to inflate an arm cuff, mostly at intervals of 15-30 minutes, with only few interruptions, starting in August 1987. While monitoring is continuing, data collected up to July 1998 are analyzed herein by cosinor rhythmometry and cross-spectral coherence with matching records of solar activity, gauged by Wolf numbers (WN) and of the geomagnetic disturbance index, Kp. A direct association between heart rate (HR) and WN is found to be solar cycle stage-dependent, whereas an inverse relationship between heart rate variability (HRV) and WN is found consistently. An inverse relation is also observed between WN and the variability in systolic blood pressure (SBP), and to a lesser extent, diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Moreover, HR is cross-spectrally coherent with WN at a frequency of one cycle in about 7.33 months. The results support previously reported associations on morbidity and mortality statistics, extending their scope to human physiology monitored longitudinally.
