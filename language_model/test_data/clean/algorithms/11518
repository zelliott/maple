A study was done to see how grip strength deteriorates after an extended number of grips. Eight male subjects, all right-handed and 23 to 35 years old, participated. Each subject made 200 grips on a dynamometer at his maximum strength. There were 15-sec. rests between trials. Performance dropped significantly after two trials. There were drops of about 40% and 50% at Trials 100 and 200, respectively. The grip strength/trial relationship is logarithmic as noted by Montazer and Thomas in 1991.
