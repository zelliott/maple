Sensitized renal allograft candidates face significant barriers to transplantation. While several options exist, including: kidney paired donation (KPD), desensitization, or pursuing a deceased donor kidney transplant, it is unclear from existing data what is the appropriate protocol for an individual patient. In this study, we seek to devise a balance between waiting for a paired donor and combining desensitization with KPD.
