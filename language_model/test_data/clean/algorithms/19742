This paper investigates the problem of how to partition unknown speech utterances into a set of clusters, such that each cluster consists of utterances from only one speaker, and the number of clusters reflects the unknown speaker population size. The proposed method begins by specifying a certain number of clusters, corresponding to one of the possible speaker population sizes, and then maximizes the level of overall within-cluster homogeneity of the speakers' voice characteristics. The within-cluster homogeneity is characterized by the likelihood probability that a cluster model, trained using all the utterances within a cluster, matches each of the within-cluster utterances. To attain the maximal sum of likelihood probabilities for all utterances, the proposed method applies a genetic algorithm to determine the cluster in which each utterance should be located. For greater computational efficiency, also proposed is a clustering criterion that approximates the likelihood probability with a divergence-based model similarity between a cluster and each of the within-cluster utterances. The clustering method then examines various legitimate numbers of clusters by adapting the Bayesian information criterion to determine the most likely speaker population size. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method over conventional methods based on hierarchical clustering.
