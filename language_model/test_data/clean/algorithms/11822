A simple model of deploying tree leaves is assembled in different arrangements to produce polygonal foldable membranes for use as deployable structures. One family of folding patterns exhibits a small strain mechanism, which is investigated. Variations on the basic arrangements can be used to fold membranes with a discretized curvature.
