The aim of this study was to select children with pathological lesions of the intra-articular structures from children with identical complaints but with no pathological intra-articular changes. The younger the child, the more difficult it is to make the diagnosis, and the expected distribution of pathology changes increasingly. This is particularly stressed in children aged younger than 13 years. Synovial inflammatory alterations are more frequent, and osteochondral and chondral fractures appear to be more problematic than meniscal and cruciate ligament lesions. Before establishing the indication for knee arthroscopy it is mandatory to implement the algorithm of diagnostic and conservative therapeutic procedures. The indication for knee arthroscopy is considered in cases when complaints persist after conservative treatment, a lesion of intra-articular segments is suspected, and the pathological condition is deemed arthroscopically treatable. Arthroscopy before conservative treatment is justified only in acute cases.
