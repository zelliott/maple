Parameters of the genome architecture of cell nuclei like copy number changes of genes or numerical and structural aberrations of chromosomes displayed by changes of size, shape, form and geometric arrangement of the related territories and domains play an important role in tumour diagnosis and monitoring of tumour therapy. We have defined data structures for such parameters, accompanied by meta data describing cell biology and microscopy protocols, and developed algorithms to deduce geometric data from microscopic raw images of fluorescently labelled cell nuclei. The statistical evaluation of nucleus geometry and architecture data is a valuable aid for diagnostic decisions and monitoring of cancer development, as indicated by several research case studies. The algorithms and data storage devices are presently administrated by different operating systems. Unification of workflow is being achieved for a local cluster, but gridification is still subject to problems of licensing, monitoring, and administering systems, including data security.
