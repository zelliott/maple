Morbid obesity has become an epidemic in past few decades. It has become an important aspect of public health-focused issues due its impact on several chronic diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Consequently the number of bariatric surgeries have increased in the past few years due to improved techniques and devices. A multidisciplinary approach such as surgical intervention and diet modification has yielded effective and sustainable weight loss in morbidly obese patients. However, as with as surgical procedure, immediate and long term complications may occur after bariatric surgery. Approximately 5% to 10% of patients who undergo bariatric surgery develop early complications (also known as perioperative complications), those that appear within the first 30 days of surgery, and 9% to 25% show sign of problems after the initial 30 days (late complications). Complications of bariatric surgery are related to the type of procedure performed and this review will describe the most common complication and their endoscopic management.
