The apparent viscosity of 17 commercially available alginate impression materials was examined using a rheometer. Each material was mixed for 15 s at a temperature of 23 +/- 0.5 degrees C, using a specially designed alginate mixing instrument. The water powder ratio was determined according to the manufacturer's instruction. The mixed alginate paste was immediately transferred to the sample stage of the rheometer or to a commercial perforated metal tray. Over the same time scale adjusted according to the rheometer test, a discrimination test (subjective test) was performed by 16 young dentists (each with more than 4 years experience). The apparent viscosity of all materials rose as a function of time after mixing and most of the material had properties similar to pseudoplastic fluids. The relationship between the results of the subjective test and the experimental values (objective test) with the rheometer was expressed in a quadratic equation. The maximum value of the apparent viscosity derived from this result was 1.52 x 10(3) Pa.s.
