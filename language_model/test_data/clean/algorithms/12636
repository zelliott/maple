The use of nondestructive NMR spectroscopy for enzymatic studies offers unique opportunities to identify nearly all enzymatic byproducts and detect unstable short-lived products or intermediates at the molecular level; however, numerous challenges must be overcome before it can become a widely used tool. The biosynthesis of acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) byÂ acetyl-CoA synthetase is used here as a case study for the development of an analytical NMR-based time-course assay platform. We describe an algorithm to deconvolve superimposed spectra into spectra for individual molecules, and further develop a model to simulate the acetyl-CoA synthetase enzyme reaction network using the data derived from time-course NMR. Simulation shows indirectly that synthesis of acetyl-CoA is mediated via an enzyme-bound intermediate (possibly acetyl-AMP) and is accompanied by a nonproductive loss from an intermediate. The ability to predict enzyme function based on partial knowledge of the enzymatic pathway topology is also discussed.
