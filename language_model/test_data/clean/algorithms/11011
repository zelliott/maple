Using a stepwise assessment of the exposure of Korean consumers to acesulfame K and sucralose, theoretical maximum daily intakes of the sweeteners were calculated using the Budget screening method, which resulted in values greater than the acceptable daily intakes (ADIs). Accordingly, the daily intakes of the sweeteners based on food consumption data and concentrations determined by instrumental analysis of 605 food samples were estimated for the more refined approach. The estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of all ordinary consumers were lower than the ADI, which was considered safe. However, for infants and 95th percentile high-level consumers (especially those who choose sucralose-containing foods), the EDIs of sucralose were very close to and higher than the ADI. Therefore, the sucralose concentration in sweetened beverages should be reduced; this would benefit the health of both high-level consumers and infants.
