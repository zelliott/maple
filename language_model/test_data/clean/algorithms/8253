Steep dose gradients between two planning target volumes (PTVs) as may be required for simultaneous integrated boosts (SIB) should be an option provided by IMRT algorithms. The aim was to analyse the geometry of the SIB problem and to implement the results in an algorithm for IMRT segment generation denoted two-step intensity modulated radiotherapy (2-Step IMRT). It was hypothesized that a gap between segments directed to the inner and the outer PTV would steepen the dose gradient. The mathematical relationships were derived from the individual dose levels and the geometry (diameters) of the PTVs. The results generated by means of 2-Step IMRT segments were equivalent or better than the segment generation using a commercial IMRT planning system. The dose to both the inner and the outer PTV was clearly more homogeneous and the composite objective value was the lowest. The segment numbers were lower or equal--with better sparing of the surrounding tissue. In summary, it was demonstrated that 2-Step IMRT was able to achieve steep dose gradients for SIB constellations.
