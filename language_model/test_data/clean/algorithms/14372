A novel filter termed quantized convergence index filter (QCI filter) that is capable of enhancing the conspicuity of rounded lesions is proposed as part of a CAD (computer-aided diagnosis) scheme for detecting pulmonary nodules in computed tomography (CT) images. In this filter and its predecessor, the convergence index filter (CI filter), the output at a pixel represents the degree of convergence toward the pixel shown by the directions of gray-level gradients at surrounding pixels. The QCI filter and the CAD scheme were evaluated using five clinical datasets containing 50 nodules. With the support region of 9 x 9 pixels, the QCI filter showed more selective response to the nodules than the CI filter. In the CAD scheme, intermediate nodule candidates are generated based on the QCI filter output and then classified using linear discriminant analysis of eight features that are attributed to each intermediate nodule candidate. The QCI filter output level itself was used as one of the features. The scheme achieved a sensitivity of 90% with 1.67 false positives per slice. The QCI filter output level was most effective among the features in correctly classifying intermediate nodule candidates. The QCI filter is promising as a tool of preprocessing for automated pulmonary nodule detection in CT images.
