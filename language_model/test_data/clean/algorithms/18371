Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has become a mainstay in the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease. Currently, more than one million coronary angioplasty and stent implantation procedures are performed annually. Although increasingly complex lesions and higher risk patients are being successfully treated percutaneously, restenosis and disease progression continue to cause significant morbidity. Restenosis occurs in approximately one-third of patients, one-half of who remain asymptomatic, while disease progression occurs at rates approaching 7% per year. Despite technological advances, unadjusted mortality rates have actually increased since the mid-1980s, and the current annual risk of a major adverse cardiac event following PCI is 5% to 7%. Although randomized clinical trials are needed to more definitively show a benefit, when performed six or more months following PCI, myocardial perfusion imaging reliably identifies patients most at risk of a poor long-term outcome. Directed reintervention can have a salutary impact on the prognosis of these patients. In view of recent data showing a positive impact of imaging and reintervention in patients after PCI, current guidelines should be reassessed.
