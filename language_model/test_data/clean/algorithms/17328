To define the mechanism of the protection by ecabet sodium of the gastric mucosa, the characteristics of protein binding of this drug were investigated using a quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM) method. The binding rate constants (kb) and the binding amounts (delta m) were obtained from time courses of the frequency decrease (mass increase) of the QCM. The binding constants to proteins of two ecabet analogues (G1, ecabet type and G2, non-ionic ecabet type) were dependent on the pH, leading to large kb values at the acidic region. Furthermore, the kb values of G1 with the addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and bovine serum fibrinogen (BSF) at the acid region were larger than those of G2. The difference in kb values between G1 and G2 for porcine gastric mucin (PGM) is hardly discernible. Ecabet seems to be more heavily distributed in the ulcerous areas than in the intact mucosa, judging from the large binding constants of this drug to BSA and BSF compared with those to PGM. It is suggested that ecabet is bound to proteins by hydrophobic interaction, moreover, the electrostatic interaction between this drug and proteins (BSA and BSF) occurs at acidic pH region. On account of these interactions, ecabet sodium seems to have a more protective effect on an ulcer at intraluminal acidity than sucralfate. Finally, QCM was found to be a useful technique for detecting quantitatively the time course of binding proteins with drug.
