Steroid induced ocular hypertension and glaucoma represent iatrogenic changes of pharmacogenic nature. They are mainly due to exogenous steroids following ocular periocular, intravitreal and systemic administration. Elevated ocular pressure is brought about by structural trabecular changes as well as obstruction of the outflow ways of the aqueous humor localized within the trabecular juxtacanalicular area. Although mostly raised ocular pressure spontaneously descends to basal values after ceasing the steroid therapy, progressive optic nerve damages and glaucomatous visual field defects may occur. Therapy of steroid induced ocular hypertension and glaucoma is similar to that of ocular hypertension and primary open-angle glaucoma.
