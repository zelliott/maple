We demonstrate the capability to control the ripple periodicity on polycrystalline ZnO films by applying temporally delayed femtosecond double pulses. It is shown that there is a characteristic pulse separation time for which one can switch from low- to high- spatial-frequency ripple formation. Results are interpreted based on the relation of the characteristic delay time with the electron-phonon relaxation time of the material. Our results indicate that temporal pulse shaping can be advantageously used as a mean to control the periodic nanoripples' formation and thus the outcome of laser assisted nanofabrication process, which is desirable for the applications of nanopatterned transparent semiconductors.
