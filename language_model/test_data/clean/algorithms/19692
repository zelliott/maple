To study the causes of the torpid course of intrathoracic tuberculosis in children and to develop preventive measures and effective treatment options, the authors conducted clinical, X-ray, microbiological, immunological, and biochemical studies and treated 90 children with the torpid course of intrathoracic tuberculosis. The specific features of detection and the clinical, X-ray, and laboratory characteristics of a process were studied. A procedure of chemotherapy was devised, which could achieve recovery in 55.6% of the children with minimum residual changes being observed. Analysis of the specific features of the torpid course of intrathoracic tuberculosis has revealed the main causes of this course, which are imperfection of measures for its early detection among healthy and risk-group children, which results in the late diagnosis of the process and imperfection of preventive measures.
