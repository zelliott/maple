This paper deals with the clinical application value of Kubicek formula for cardiac stroke volume calculation from the angle of Kubicek model simulation by 3-dimensional finite element method. In the process of computer simulation, we have made a comparison between the result of model simulation, the specific value of Kubicek formula for cardiac stroke volume calculation, and the theoretical value of the prescribed model. The simulation results showed that an approximately linear relationship exists between the impedance change and the blood volume change of the aorta in the model, which has proved that Kubicek formula for cardiac stroke volume calculation has great clinical application value. On the other hand, the new method has opened up a path for studying the basic theory of impedance cardiography.
