The increasing use of microarray technologies is generating large amounts of data that must be processed in order to extract useful and rational fundamental patterns of gene expression. Hierarchical clustering technology is one method used to analyze gene expression data, but traditional hierarchical clustering algorithms suffer from several drawbacks (e.g. fixed topology structure; mis-clustered data which cannot be reevaluated). In this paper, we introduce a new hierarchical clustering algorithm that overcomes some of these drawbacks.

We propose a new tree-structure self-organizing neural network, called dynamically growing self-organizing tree (DGSOT) algorithm for hierarchical clustering. The DGSOT constructs a hierarchy from top to bottom by division. At each hierarchical level, the DGSOT optimizes the number of clusters, from which the proper hierarchical structure of the underlying dataset can be found. In addition, we propose a new cluster validation criterion based on the geometric property of the Voronoi partition of the dataset in order to find the proper number of clusters at each hierarchical level. This criterion uses the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) concept of graph theory and is computationally inexpensive for large datasets. A K-level up distribution (KLD) mechanism, which increases the scope of data distribution in the hierarchy construction, was used to improve the clustering accuracy. The KLD mechanism allows the data misclustered in the early stages to be reevaluated at a later stage and increases the accuracy of the final clustering result. The clustering result of the DGSOT is easily displayed as a dendrogram for visualization. Based on a yeast cell cycle microarray expression dataset, we found that our algorithm extracts gene expression patterns at different levels. Furthermore, the biological functionality enrichment in the clusters is considerably high and the hierarchical structure of the clusters is more reasonable.
