Urinary tract infections are the most common infection early after transplantation and can affect long-term graft function. Any urinary tract infection in renal transplant recipients should be seen as "complex" with regard to consequences for diagnosis and therapy. The increase in resistance to anti-infective agents seen among uropathogens is one of the central therapeutic problems. This means for routine clinical practice that contact isolation precautions should be consistently implemented for affected patients and the duration of introducing urinary tract instruments should be minimized. Detection of pyuria and urine cultures are required to confirm infection, to identify the corresponding pathogen, and to review the antibiotic therapy.The "Essen algorithm for calculated antibiotic treatment of urinary tract infections in renal transplant patients" takes into consideration the high incidence of Gram-negative pathogens in general and the increased incidence of enterococci in the early phase after transplantation. Within the first 2Â months after transplantation quinolones should be used and later cephalosporins. In case of urosepsis, calculated antibiotic therapy should cover problematic Gram-negative pathogens such as pseudomonades. The calculated antibiotic therapy should be administered intravenously in severe infections. In any case the local and regional antibiotic susceptibility should be taken into account when deciding on the calculated antibiotic therapy.
