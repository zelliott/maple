Much of the research into the mechanisms of ventricular fibrillation (VF) employs high-resolution mapping of electrical activation and recovery patterns. We previously developed a method for analyzing electrically mapped VF patterns that was based on identifying individual VF wavefronts. We now introduce a related method designed to take into account the information on repolarization that is present in optically mapped VF data. The new method first converts raw fluorescence data to an angular variable that tracks the phase of the mapped tissue through the depolarization-repolarization cycle. We define wavefronts in this context as isolines of phase that terminate either at boundaries or at singular points within the phase field. These singularities are the pivots of functional reentry and are important determinants of VF patterns. We parameterize VF by constructing data structures that describe wavefronts and singularities and also maintain wavefront-wavefront, wavefront-singularity, and singularity-singularity relationships. We describe one important application of this parameterization, which is to identify, localize, and characterize the importance of occurrences of propagation block during VF.
