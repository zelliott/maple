We performed a prospective study to evaluate the efficacy of three physical treatments for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo: Brandt & Daroff habituation exercises, the Semont manoevre (intended as a statoconia-detachment maneuver), and the Epley maneuver (intended as a statoconia-repositioning maneuver). A total of 106 BPPV patients were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups, and responses were evaluated one week, one month and three months after the initial treatment. At the one-week follow-up, similar cure rates were obtained with the Semont and Epley maneuver (74% and 71% respectively), both cure rates being significantly higher than that obtained with Brandt & Daroff exercises (24%). By the three-month follow-up, the cure rate obtained with the Epley maneuver was higher (93%) than that obtained with the Semont maneuver (77%), though both remained higher than that obtained with the Brandt & Daroff maneuver (62%). However, the proportion of initially responding patients showing subsequent relapse was lower among patients treated by the Semont maneuver than among patients treated by the Epley maneuver. In view of these findings, we propose a treatment algorithm for patients with BPPV.
