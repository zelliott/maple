This paper reports a preliminary finding associated with an investigation of how tissues respond to mechanical stress. The stress distribution within the tissue may be the result of normal function, for example, joint forces, or it may result from interventions such as tissue suturing during or after surgery. We sought to combine electrical and mechanical computational models in order to better understand the interaction between the two. For example, if mechanical stress is applied to tissue this may change the cell arrangements within the tissue matrix and hence change the electrical properties. If this interaction could be determined, then it should be possible to use electrical impedance tomography measurements to identify stress patterns in tissues. Measurements of resistivity changes have been made in conductive silicone rubber sheets when subject to a uniaxial stress of up to 10%. Relatively large changes in resistivity are produced (up to 200%). These changes are far larger than those predicted arising from topological changes alone. It is suggested that under stress the conductive islands of carbon within the silicone rubber sheet undergo a reversible disassociation from their neighbours and that the material's electrical properties change under load. If similar stress-resistivity relationships occur within biological materials it may be possible to recover the stress fields within tissues from transfer impedance measurements and thereby predict if actions such as inappropriate suture tension will compromise tissue viability.
