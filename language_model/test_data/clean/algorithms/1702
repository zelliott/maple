Real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) provides detailed information on glucose patterns and trends, thus allowing the patients to manage their diabetes more effectively.

The aim of this study was to explore the potential beneficial effects of the use of RT-CGM on diabetes management compared with self blood glucose measurement (SBGM) in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), by means of a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched through by two independent investigators for RCTs concerning the use of RT-CGM in patients with T1DM. Only studies with a similar insulin regimen in the experimental and control groups were included in the analysis.

Seven RCTs (n=948) met the inclusion criteria. Combined data from all studies showed better HbA1c reduction in subjects using RT-CGM compared with those using SBGM (mean difference (MD) -0.25; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): from -0.34 to -0.17; P<0.001). Patients treated with insulin pump and RT-CGM had a lower HbA1c level compared with subjects managed with insulin pump and SBGM (four RCTs, n=497; MD -0.26; 95% CI: from -0.43 to -0.10; P=0.002). The benefits of applying RT-CGM were not associated with an increasing rate of major hypoglycemic episodes. The use of RT-CGM for over 60-70% of time was associated with a significant lowering of HbA1c.

RT-CGM is more beneficial than SBGM in reducing HbA1c in patients with type 1 diabetes. Further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of this system in the pediatric population, especially in very young children.
