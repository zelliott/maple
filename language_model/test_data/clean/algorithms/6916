Long double-stranded DNA molecules were separated in microfabricated hexagonal arrays in less than 1 min, several orders of magnitude faster than by using conventional technology. DNA samples were first concentrated at the entrance to the array in a thin band by entropic focusing. They were then separated by pulsed field electrophoresis. T4 (168.9 kbp) and lambda (48.5 kbp) DNAs could be resolved into two clearly separated bands in approximately 10 s in these experiments. This corresponds to a mass resolution of 6% in 11 min in a 1-cm-long array.
