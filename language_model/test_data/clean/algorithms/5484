This paper proposes an algorithm for adaptive, sequential classification in systems with unknown labeling errors, focusing on the biomedical application of Brain Computer Interfacing (BCI). The method is shown to be robust in the presence of label and sensor noise. We focus on the inference and prediction of target labels under a nonlinear and non-Gaussian model. In order to handle missing or erroneous labeling, we model observed labels as a noisy observation of a latent label set with multiple classes (â‰¥ 2). Whilst this paper focuses on the method's application to BCI systems, the algorithm has the potential to be applied to many application domains in which sequential missing labels are to be imputed in the presence of uncertainty. This dynamic classification algorithm combines an Ordered Probit model and an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The EKF estimates the parameters of the Ordered Probit model sequentially with time. We test the performance of the classification approach by processing synthetic datasets and real experimental EEG signals with multiple classes (2, 3 and 4 labels) for a Brain Computer Interfacing (BCI) experiment.
