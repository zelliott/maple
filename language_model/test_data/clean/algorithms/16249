The directional distribution of the ambient neutron dose equivalent from 145-MeV (19)F projectiles bombarding a thick aluminium target is measured and analysed. The measurements are carried out with a commercially available dose equivalent meter at 0째, 30째, 60째 and 90째 with respect to the beam direction. The experimental results are compared with calculated doses from EMPIRE nuclear reaction code and different empirical formulations proposed by others. The results are also compared with the measured data obtained from an earlier experiment at a lower projectile energy of 110 MeV for the same target-projectile combination.
