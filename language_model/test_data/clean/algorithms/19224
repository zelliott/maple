A system for three-dimensional reconstruction of dynamic (moving) vascular bed structures has been developed and is described. Input images are obtained from two-view (bi-plane or ECG correlated) X-ray angiograms. A target structure consisting of vessel branch points (nodes) and lines between the branch points is entered on the first of a sequence of images in one view. The movement of the nodes is indicated on subsequent images and on the images of the second view. The target is linearly warped according to the motion of the node points. Automatic edge detection (with subsequent operator correction) is used to detect centerlines and edges of vessels. Three-dimensional reconstruction is accomplished using a distance minimizing point matching technique. Finally, angle-corrected densitometric methods are used to refine the vessel cross section. Standard shaded surface display techniques are then used to display the moving arterial bed. Flow measurements are obtained by tracking the leading edge of the bolus down the three-dimensional arterial tree.
