UV irradiation of oligodeoxynucleotides at 254 nm generates several different types of DNA photoproducts, including cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, pyrimidine[6-4] pyrimidone photoproducts and their Dewar valence isomers, and thymine-adenine photoproducts (TA*). Studies of photoproducts in oligodeoxynucleotides require the development of suitable structure determination methods such as mass spectrometry. In an earlier study (Vollmer et al. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. Ion Processes 1997, 165/166, 487-496), we showed that fast atom bombardment and tandem sector mass spectrometry can be used to locate the site of photomodification and identify most of the photoproducts of d(TATTAT). One goal of the present research was to expand the method to the more sensitive electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) methods. A second goal was to test the generality of the methods by investigating not only the photoproducts of d(TATTAT) but also those of three other oligodeoxynucleotides, d(GTATTAT), d(GGCTATAA), and d(AATTAA). The photoproducts of these sequences were separated by HPLC and gave characteristic fragment ions in postsource decompositions of MALDI-produced ions and collisionally activated decompositions of ESI-produced ions.
