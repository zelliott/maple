A pseudostrain-energy function is proposed for describing the behavior of excised sheets of canine visceral pleura. Pseudoelastic material constants are determined from experimental biaxial data by employing a nonlinear least-squares algorithm. The agreement between theory and experiment is shown to be quite good. Furthermore, the visceral pleura studied appears to be inelastic and to exhibit in-plane isotropy. Comparison with previous works is discussed.
