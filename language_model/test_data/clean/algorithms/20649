The detection of transcription control elements in DNA sequences became both more important and more complicated by the completion of the first full genome sequencing projects. Rapid evaluation of potential regulatory elements in large amounts of sequence data requires specific methods preferably available as user-friendly computer programs. However, many more algorithms and methods have been published than programs are available, creating problems for scientists who try to select an appropriate method for their needs from the literature. The Internet provides a worldwide and relatively easy access to computer software if the user knows where to look. One of the major problems remaining is how to find the appropriate software. We have compiled a guide detailing where software is available and what is to be expected in terms of interface and data compatibility with other programs. We also show results obtained with each program for several examples. The summarized features of each program should allow scientists to select quickly the method of their choice and inform them where to download the software.
