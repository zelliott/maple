The performance of an image registration (IR) software was evaluated for automatically detecting known errors simulated through the movement of ExactCouch using an onboard imager. Twenty-seven set-up errors (11 translations, 10 rotations, 6 translation and rotation) were simulated by introducing offset up to ± 15 mm in three principal axes and 0° to ± 1° in yaw. For every simulated error, orthogonal kV radiograph and cone beam CT were acquired in half-fan (CBCT_HF) and full-fan (CBCT_FF) mode. The orthogonal radiographs and CBCTs were automatically co-registered to reference digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) and planning CT using 2D-2D and 3D-3D matching software based on mutual information transformation. A total of 79 image sets (ten pairs of kV X-rays and 69 session of CBCT) were analyzed to determine the (a) reproducibility of IR outcome and (b) residual error, defined as the deviation between the known and IR software detected displacement in translation and rotation. The reproducibility of automatic IR of planning CT and repeat CBCTs taken with and without kilovoltage detector and kilovoltage X-ray source arm movement was excellent with mean SD of 0.1 mm in the translation and 0.0° in rotation. The average residual errors in translation and rotation were within ± 0.5 mm and ± 0.2°, ± 0.9 mm and ± 0.3°, and ± 0.4 mm and ± 0.2° for setup simulated only in translation, rotation, and both translation and rotation. The mean (SD) 3D vector was largest when only translational error was simulated and was 1.7 (1.1) mm for 2D-2D match of reference DRR with radiograph, 1.4 (0.6) and 1.3 (0.5) mm for 3D-3D match of reference CT and CBCT with full fan and half fan, respectively. In conclusion, the image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) system is accurate within 1.8 mm and 0.4° and reproducible under control condition. Inherent error from any IGRT process should be taken into account while setting clinical IGRT protocol.
