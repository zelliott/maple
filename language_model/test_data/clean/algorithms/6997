Mercury sphygomanometers are being banned in many countries, but what will replace them for the routine management of clinic blood pressure is unresolved. The accuracy of the two most widely used alternatives, aneroid and oscillometric devices, is questionable. A proposed alternative is a hybrid sphygomomanometer which is based on the mercury technique, but replaces the mercury column with an electronic transducer and display. It also has the potential to eliminate terminal digit preference.
