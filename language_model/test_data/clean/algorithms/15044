Due to the limited efficacy of drug therapy in atrial fibrillation and the high rate of recurrence, strong efforts were made to find non-pharmacological strategies. For three years now, the implantable atrial defibrillator Metrix from InControl has been available as an alternative therapy. From October 1995 to the present the atrial defibrillator was implanted in 179 patients worldwide. The sensitivity of the system and its algorithms to detect atrial fibrillation is 90%; the specificity to detect sinus rhythm is 100%. In 121 of 179 patients, 748 episodes of spontaneous atrial fibrillation were treated with 2.4 shocks per episode. No proarrhythmic event or stroke was seen. A cardioversion to sinus rhythm could be achieved in 95% of patients; the overall clinical success rate was 88%. In 7% of all patients, early recurrence of atrial fibrillation (ERAF) occurred that could not be converted into stable sinus rhythm after further cardioversions and antiarrhythmic therapy. In 4.1% there were lead-related complications, in 4 patients the device had to be explanted because of ineffective therapy, and in 3 patients the device had to be changed because of loss of telemetry or early depletion of battery. In 8 patients, postoperative complications were seen (infections, pneumothorax and thrombosis of the subclavian vein). Overall, the implantable atrial defibrillator Metrix is an effective and safe alternative in treating atrial fibrillation.
