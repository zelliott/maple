This article contains a review of some of the main developments reported in 2007 on the topics of hypertension and diabetes. The most important was the publication of the European Society of Cardiology's clinical practice guidelines on the two conditions, both of which have been adopted by the Spanish Society of Cardiology. Elsewhere, we have recently been witnessing crucial debates on the use of rosiglitazone for the treatment of diabetes and on the drug's effect on cardiovascular outcomes. The evidence available up to the present time is assessed. Finally, we will review the results of the most recent large clinical trial on the prevention of vascular complications in diabetics, which employed an antihypertensive approach.
