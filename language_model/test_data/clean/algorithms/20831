Mathematical model reduction is a long-standing technique used both to gain insight into model subprocesses and to reduce the computational costs of simulation and analysis. A reduced model must retain essential features of the full model, which, traditionally, have been the trajectories of certain state variables. For biological clocks, timing, or phase, characteristics must be preserved. A key performance criterion for a clock is the ability to adjust its phase correctly in response to external signals. We present a novel model reduction technique that removes components from a single-oscillator clock model and discover that four feedback loops are redundant with respect to its phase response behavior. Using a coupled multioscillator model of a circadian clock, we demonstrate that by preserving the phase response behavior of a single oscillator, we preserve timing behavior at the multioscillator level.
