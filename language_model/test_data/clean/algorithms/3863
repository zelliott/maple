A method for quantitative analysis of hemoglobin color to estimate the oxygen saturation was developed. The method uses an image-input and -processing system composed of a 3-tube video camera and a digital image analyzer. When the system is connected to a microscope, the facilitated diffusion of oxygen in hemoglobin solutions can be observed and analyzed in a position-sensitive manner. The results led to a new transport model expressed as: J = k'CY/d, where J is the oxygen flux, C is the hemoglobin concentration, Y is the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin, d is the distance between the entrance of oxygen and the diffusion front, and k' is a constant.
