A physical theory explaining the anisotropic dispersion of water and solutes in biological tissues is introduced based on the phenomena of Taylor dispersion, in which highly diffusive solutes cycle between flowing and stagnant regions in the tissue, enhancing dispersion in the direction of microvascular flow. An effective diffusion equation is derived, for which the coefficient of dispersion in the axial direction (direction of capillary orientation) depends on the molecular diffusion coefficient, tissue perfusion, and vessel density. This analysis provides a homogenization that represents three-dimensional transport in capillary beds as an effectively one-dimensional phenomenon. The derived dispersion equation may be used to simulate the transport of solutes in tissues, such as in pharmacokinetic modeling. In addition, the analysis provides a physically based hypothesis for explaining dispersion anisotropy observed in diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTMRI) and suggests the means of obtaining quantitative functional information on capillary vessel density from measurements of dispersion coefficients. It is shown that a failure to account for flow-mediated dispersion in vascular tissues may lead to misinterpretations of imaging data and significant overestimates of directional bias in molecular diffusivity in biological tissues. Measurement of the ratio of axial to transverse diffusivity may be combined with an independent measurement of perfusion to provide an estimate of capillary vessel density in the tissue.
