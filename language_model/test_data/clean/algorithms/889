The nutritional status of single adult homeless people is often overlooked, with many of the homeless population being malnourished due to a variety of reasons. This paper looks at the government's policies relating to nutrition and at the current research concerning home-lessness and diet. It also offers various strategies for improving the nutritional intake and status of this client group. It discusses the issues surrounding the use of dietary supplements, ways to minimise the risk of misuse, and highlights possible alternatives. A guideline has been devised with the specific aim of identifying people who are at risk of malnutrition within hostels.
