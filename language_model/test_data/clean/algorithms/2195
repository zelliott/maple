A computer program has been developed for the numerical analysis of thermal conditions within the human body. In this study, a cylindrical model, which consists of internal multi-layers, is adapted for the segment of the human body. For the present concentric cylindrical model we developed a new numerical solution method using a linear combination of the modified Bessel functions. By using the present computer program the internal tissue temperatures, heat fluxes and blood temperatures of the thigh, crus and foot segments are calculated. This paper describes a new algorithm solving heat transfer equation in the human body and the example of calculated results of the combination of thigh, crus and foot segments. The calculated results show the local characteristics of each segment in the human body.
