Death in normobaric hyperoxia was related in the past to pulmonary insufficiency of the edematous lung. However, high arterial O2 tension on final collapse led to the suggestion that the heart and not the lung is the first organ that fails. We measured aortic flow, coronary flow, left ventricular pressure, affluent and effluent PO2, PCO2, and pH in the working heart excised from control and normobaric O2-exposed rats (51-63 h). The oxygen consumption (VO2) of experimental hearts was not different from control, but mechanical power output (PVAP) (calculated from pressure-volume area) was reduced as a function of O2 exposure time. Myocardial contractility indexes, maximal elastance and maximal time derivative of pressure, increased as a function of O2 exposure time, being below control values after 50 h and above control values after 60 h. The individual slopes for the regression of VO2 vs. PVAP rose as a function of exposure time from values below control after 50 h exposure to values above control after 60 h. Energetic efficiency (PVAP/VO2) decreased as a function of O2 exposure time and points to possible heart failure in the intact animal. After 50 h O2 exposure the heart was energetically more efficient than the control. Possible changes in the heart are discussed.
