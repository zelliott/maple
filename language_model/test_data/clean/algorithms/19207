A new scheme is proposed for very fast acquisition of three-dimensional NMR spectra based on minimal sampling, instead of the customary step-wise exploration of all of evolution space. The method relies on prior experiments to determine accurate values for the evolving frequencies and intensities from the two-dimensional 'first planes' recorded by setting t1=0 or t2=0. With this prior knowledge, the entire three-dimensional spectrum can be reconstructed by an additional measurement of the response at a single location (t1( *),t2( *)) where t1( *) and t2( *) are fixed values of the evolution times. A key feature is the ability to resolve problems of overlap in the acquisition dimension. Applied to a small protein, agitoxin, the three-dimensional HNCO spectrum is obtained 35 times faster than systematic Cartesian sampling of the evolution domain. The extension to multi-dimensional spectroscopy is outlined.
