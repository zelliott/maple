In this paper, we present an inverse kinematics method to determining human shoulder joint motion coupling relationship based on experimental data in the literature. This work focuses on transferring Euler-angle-based coupling equations into a relationship based on the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) method. We use analytical inverse kinematics to achieve the transferring. For a specific posture, we can choose points on clavicle, scapula, and humerus and represent the end-effector positions based on Euler angles or DH method. For both Euler and DH systems, the end-effectors have the same Cartesian positions. Solving these equations related to end-effector positions yields DH joint angles for that posture. The new joint motion coupling relationship is obtained by polynomial and cosine fitting of the DH joint angles for all different postures.
