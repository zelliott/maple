Imaging with technetium-99m sestamibi offers a non-invasive approach to detect the presence of functional P-glycoprotein (Pgp), one of the major causes of multidrug resistance, in human malignancies. A clinical role for Pgp has been suggested in the subpopulation of primary neuroblastoma without amplification of the proto-oncogene MYCN. We wanted to evaluate the usefulness of 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy in the screening of neural crest tumours for the presence of Pgp. In ten children suffering from MYCN-negative neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma or ganglioneuroma, 99mTc-sestamibi imaging was performed at initial diagnosis. All patients underwent planar imaging 20-30 min and 3.5-4 h after intravenous injection of 740 MBq/1.73 m2 99mTc-sestamibi. Tumour to normal tissue ratios, as well as washout rates, were determined and compared with in vitro flow cytometric analysis of Pgp expression and function. Pgp expression was analysed flow cytometrically with the monoclonal antibodies 4E3 and MRK16, and Pgp function was evaluated by means of rhodamine 123 uptake and efflux either in the absence or in the presence of the Pgp inhibitor verapamil. In nine of ten patients, we found that the intratumoral 99mTc-sestamibi activity was comparable to the background activity, which might be suggestive of Pgp presence. This was confirmed flow cytometrically in all but one patient. 99mTc-sestamibi enhancement was seen in the primary tumour and the bone marrow metastases of one of the ten patients, and this result was concordant with a negative Pgp status. The findings presented suggest that 99mTc-sestamibi imaging results might correlate with the presence of functional Pgp in neural crest tumours without MYCN amplification.
