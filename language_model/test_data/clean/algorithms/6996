The aim of this study was to compare the in vitro compressive strength and solubility of a black copper cement with one established restorative material (a conventional glass ionomer cement) and two temporary restorative materials (a zinc phosphate and a zinc polycarboxylate cement). The mean compressive strength of black copper cement varied with the powder: liquid ratio, with an intermediate ratio having a comparable strength to that of the zinc polycarboxylate cement (the best material in this respect). The solubility of the black copper cement at all mixing ratios was significantly greater than that of all other test materials.
