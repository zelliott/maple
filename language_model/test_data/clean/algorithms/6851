The adsorption of ethidium bromide on the synthetic double-stranded polyribonucleotide poly(G)poly(C) was investigated by adsorption spectroscopy. The adsorption isotherms were analyzed in the framework of the Crothers-Gursky model. It was shown that adsorption parameters (e.g., binding constant) may also be determined from the analysis of dispersion of some bound molecules. In some cases this method may be more convenient.
