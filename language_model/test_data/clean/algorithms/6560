We introduce a novel Matlab toolbox for microarray data analysis. This toolbox uses normalization based upon a normally distributed background and differential gene expression based on five statistical measures. The objects in this toolbox are open source and can be implemented to suit your application.

MDAT v1.0 is a Matlab toolbox and requires Matlab to run. MDAT is freely available at http://microarray.omrf.org/publications/2004/knowlton/MDAT.zip.
