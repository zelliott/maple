Techniques of image processing have been developed for the extraction of information from magnetic resonance images. The response of nuclei to a sequence of magnetic stimulations has been modeled and used to predict the effects of changing magnetic resonance parameters on signal intensity. This allows the calculation of new images from a small set of acquired data without additional acquisition. These images can be used to predict the results of new imaging techniques before actual implementation and to simulate the effects of parameter variations which are unfeasible or impractical, such as variable field strength. New forms of representation, for example, a tissue type map in which each homogeneous tissue category has been identified and labeled, can be used for more direct interpretation.
