Finite element (FE) analysis is a cornerstone of orthopaedic biomechanics research. Three-dimensional medical imaging provides sufficient resolution for the subject-specific FE models to be generated from these data-sets. FE model development requires discretisation of a three-dimensional domain, which can be the most time-consuming component of a FE study. Hexahedral meshing tools based on the multiblock method currently rely on the manual placement of building blocks for mesh generation. We hypothesise that angular analysis of the geometric centreline for a three-dimensional surface could be used to automatically generate building block structures for the multiblock hexahedral mesh generation. Our algorithm uses a set of user-defined points and parameters to automatically generate a multiblock structure based on a surface's geometric centreline. This significantly reduces the time required for model development. We have applied this algorithm to 47 bones of varying geometries and successfully generated a FE mesh in all cases. This work represents significant advancement in automatically generating multiblock structures for a wide range of geometries.
