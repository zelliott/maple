Analysis is presented for Case II drug transport with axial and radial release from cylinders. The previously reported [J. Control Release 5 (1987) 37] relationships for radial release from films and slabs are special cases of the general solution derived in this study. The widely used exponential relation M(t)/M(infinity) = kt(n) describes nicely the first 60% of the fractional release curve when Case II drug transport with axial and radial release from cylinders is operating.
