The main objective of this study was to develop a 3D X-ray reconstruction system of the spine and rib cage for an accurate clinical assessment of spinal deformities. The proposed system uses an explicit calibration technique and a new calibration object composed of: (1) a set of radiopaque markers embedded in a jacket worn by the patient during the X-ray exposures; (2) six control markers to define a reference vertical plane. Computer simulations were performed to evaluate the accuracy of the 3D reconstruction procedure when different kind of displacements were applied on a reference model. Clinical indices computed from the 3D X-ray reconstruction of the spine for 24 scoliotic subjects were compared to those obtained with the DLT method. The results of the evaluation study showed that the new system allows the patient to adopt a normal attitude without any constraint, compensating for its displacement between exposures.
