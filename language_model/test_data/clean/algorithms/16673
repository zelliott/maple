The zero-stress state of the mucosa-submucosa and two muscle esophageal layers has been delineated, but their multi-axial response has not, because muscle dissection may not leave tubular specimens intact for inflation/extension testing. The histomechanical behavior of the three-layered porcine esophagus was investigated in this study, through light microscopic examination and uniaxial tension, with two-dimensional strain measurement in pairs of orthogonally oriented specimens. The two-dimensional Fung-type strain-energy function described suitably the pseudo-elastic tissue response, affording faithful simulations to our data. Differences in the scleroprotein content and configuration were identified as a function of layer, topography, and orientation, substantiating the macromechanical differences found. In view of the failure and optimized material parameters, the mucosa-submucosa was stronger and stiffer than muscle, associating it with a higher collagen content. A notable topographical distribution was apparent, with data for the abdominal region differentiated from that for the cervical region, owing to the existence of inner muscle with a circumferential arrangement and of outer muscle with a longitudinal arrangement in the former region, and of both muscle layers with oblique arrangement in the latter region, with thoracic esophagus being a transition zone. Tissue from the mucosa-submucosa was stronger and stiffer longitudinally, relating with a preferential collagen reinforcement along that axis, but more extensible in the orthogonal axis.
