In the era of highly effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), HCV-related liver disease has emerged as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Accordingly, expert panels have recommend that coinfected patients undergo medical evaluation for HCV-related liver disease, consideration for HCV treatment and, if indicated, orthotopic liver transplantation. While the treatment of such patients is complicated by medical, and psychiatric comorbidities, HIV disease, and concurrent antiretroviral therapy, randomized controlled trials support the safety, tolerability and efficacy of HCV treatment with peginterferon alfa (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) in HIV-infected persons. Although, the available data has led to consensus among experts regarding the need to medically manage HCV disease in HIV-infected persons, uncertainty remains regarding the best treatment algorithm for coinfected patients.
