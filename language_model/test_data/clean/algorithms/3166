We evaluated the X-ray digital linear tomosynthesis reconstruction processing method for metal artifact reduction. A volumetric X-ray digital linear tomosynthesis instrument was used to image a hip prosthesis. Artifacts caused by high-attenuation features in hip prostheses were observed in digital linear tomosynthesis reconstruction due to the few projections and narrow angular range typically employed in tomosynthesis imaging. We developed artifact reduction methods based on a modified Shepp and Logan reconstruction filter kernel realized by taking into account additional weighing by direct current (DC) components in frequency domain space. Processing leads to an increase in the ratio of low-frequency components in an image. The effectiveness of the method in enhancing the visibility of a prosthetic case was quantified in terms of removal of ghosting artifacts. The potential of artifact reduction processing for digital linear tomosynthesis in the evaluation of hip prostheses was demonstrated. A modified Shepp and Logan reconstruction filter kernel causes artifact reduction and improved the quality of images affected by metal artifacts. Future investigations will study the ability of digital linear tomosynthesis to quantify the spatial relationship between the metallic components of these devices as well as the ability of the technique to identify bony changes of diagnostic significance.
