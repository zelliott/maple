A method has been developed, included in the BSS 14525-78, for measuring and assessment of the radio-frequency electromagnetic field (EMF) at the working places. In a hygienic assessment of fields, emitted from several sources with different frequencies in one premises, it cannot be applied because of the step frequency relationship of the hygienic norms. The same difficulty is encountered in the hygienic assessment of EMF in settlements, where the summing of the from several radio television and other emitters is necessary. With the non-selective measurements of the intensities of EMF (in a broad-frequency range) in such cases, the resultant field of the working place cannot de resolve into component intensities, obtained from the separate generators and hygienic assessment of the determined value cannot be performed. The same concerns also the cases when we separately measure the radiation from each separate emitter--the summing is impossible. If the electromagnetic waves are discussed as flat waves in the free space, a system of 2m equations with 3 m unknown quantities could be worked out after several approximations, where m is the number of the emitting generators in the premises. Furthermore, if consideration is given to the technical devices for measurement of EMF (type of detector), a system of 2 m equations with so many unknown quantities, could be obtained, hence a mathematical method is proposed for its solving. The expression of the intensities of the field is approximated in a polynomial and an original algorithm is proposed for the solving of the system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
