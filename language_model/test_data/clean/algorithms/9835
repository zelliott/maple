We present a novel temperature-sensing technique using thermoacoustic and photoacoustic measurements. This noninvasive method has been demonstrated using a tissue phantom to have high temporal resolution and temperature sensitivity. Because both photoacoustic and thermoacoustic signal amplitudes depend on the temperature of the source object, the signal amplitudes can be used to monitor the temperature. A temperature sensitivity of 0.15 degrees C was obtained at a temporal resolution as short as 2 s, taking the average of 20 signals. The deep-tissue imaging capability of this technique can potentially lead us to in vivo temperature monitoring in thermal or cryogenic applications.
