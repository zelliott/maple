Pollutant source emission flow rates in the workplace are typically unknown in occupational hygiene. Similarly, a restricted number of concentration measurements can provide only spatial limited information on the pollutant distribution in the room. This paper presents a numerical method to evaluate the intensities of pollutant sources and to reconstruct the associated concentration field at every point of a ventilated enclosure containing one or several pollutant sources of unknown emission rate. This reconstructed concentration field is obtained both from the geometric and ventilation characteristics of the enclosure and from a limited number of fixed-station concentration measurements. The method is currently applicable to steady situations. The predictions obtained are then compared with concentration measurements in a laboratory closed cabin under controlled ventilation. Pollutant sources generated tracer gas emissions at known flow rates. Comparisons were performed successively for three different physical configurations.
