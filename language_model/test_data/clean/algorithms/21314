We have used differential polarization microscopy, which provides images of linear dichroism, to measure the percentage of aligned hemoglobin (Hb) in 1086 deoxygenated red blood cells from subjects with sickle cell anemia. The percentage was found to be only slightly dependent on the speed of deoxygenation, thus showing that the percentage of aligned Hb was thermodynamically controlled (as has been found previously for the percentage of polymerized Hb in vitro). A slight decrease in the percentage of aligned Hb due to increasing speed of deoxygenation is primarily due to the increase in the number of cells containing no detectable aligned Hb. This class of cells was also the most variable between the different subjects studied. We were able to identify two other groups of cells that contain different numbers of domains of aligned Hb and show that these groups contain statistically different percentages of aligned Hb. The differences between these classes of cells was shown to be primarily due to different numbers of initial nucleation sites within each cell. It appears that the presence of preformed nucleation sites within cells at ambient oxygen tensions results in the thermodynamic control of aligned Hb polymer.
