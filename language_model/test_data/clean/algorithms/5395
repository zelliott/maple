Adhesions occur with a high incidence after intra-abdominal surgery but can also develop due to infections, radiation or for idiopathic reasons. The formation of adhesions is initiated by tissue damage and is the result of peritoneal tissue repair involving the activation of the inflammatory system and the coagulation cascade. Acute small bowel obstruction is one of the most common complications and should be diagnosed rapidly using clinical examination and radiological imaging. A complete obstruction is life threatening and in a high percentage of patients requires rapid surgical intervention by laparotomy or laparoscopy depending on the clinical situation and the patients history. Despite numerous investigations, there is no reliable, commonly used method to prevent intra-abdominal adhesions. Minimizing tissue damage and foreign body exposure, avoiding spillage of intestinal and biliary contents as well as a laparoscopic approach seem to have a beneficial effect on the formation of intra-abdominal adhesions.
