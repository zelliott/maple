Previously, we showed that adoptive transfer of in vivo vaccine-primed and ex vivo (anti-CD3/anti-CD28) costimulated autologous T cells (ex-T) at day +12 after transplant increased CD4 and CD8 T-cell counts at day +42 and augmented vaccine-specific immune responses in patients with myeloma. Here, we investigated the safety and kinetics of T-cell recovery after infusing ex-T at day +2 after transplant.

In this phase I/II two-arm clinical trial, 50 patients with myeloma received autografts after high-dose melphalan followed by infusions of ex-T at day +2 after transplant. Patients also received pretransplant and posttransplant immunizations using a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine only (arm B; n = 24) or the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine plus an HLA-A2-restricted microltipeptide vaccine for HLA-A2(+) patients (arm A; n = 26).

The mean number of T cells infused was 4.26 x 10(10) (range, 1.59-5.0). At day 14 after transplant, the median CD3, CD4, and CD8 counts were 4,198, 1,545, and 2,858 cells/microL, respectively. Interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-15 levels increased early after transplant and IL-15 levels correlated significantly to day 14 T-cell counts. Robust vaccine-specific B- and T-cell responses were generated. T-cell infusions were well tolerated with no effect on hematopoietic recovery. Eight patients (16%) developed a T-cell "engraftment syndrome" characterized by diarrhea and fever that was clinically and histopathologically indistinguishable from grade 1 to 3 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the gastrointestinal tract (seven patients) and/or grade 1 to 2 cutaneous GVHD (four patients).

Adoptive T-cell transfers achieve robust T-cell recovery early after transplant and induce moderate-to-severe autologous GVHD in a subset of patients.
