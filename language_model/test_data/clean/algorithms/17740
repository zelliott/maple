The objective of the present work was to detect and analyze wheezes by means of a highly sensitive time-frequency algorithm. Automatic measurements were compared with clinical auscultation for forced exhalation segments from 1.2 to 0 liters/second (l/s). Sensitivities between 100% and 71%, as a function of flow level related to wheezing segments detection, were achieved. Time-frequency wheeze parameters were measured for the flow range from 1.2 to 0.2 l/s. Wheezes were detected in both analyzed groups; asthmatics (N = 16) and control subjects (N = 15). Significant differences between groups were found for the mean number of wheezes detected at basal condition (p = 0.0003). Frequency parameter differences were also significant (0.0112 < p < 0.0307). All these parameters were also studied after applying a bronchodilator drug (Terbutaline). Significant differences between patient groups were found when studying the changes in the number of wheezes for each patient (p = 0.0195). Finally, limited bandwidth parameters, which measure the bronchodilator response, were also studied.
