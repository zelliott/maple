A computerised multiparametric procedure is developed to analyse the images of blood flow through various locations of the mesenteric arterial bifurcation of frog. The data are recorded by a video microscopic system and, after digitisation and pre-processing, are analysed by an IBM PC/AT based image processing system to obtain erythrocyte and velocity distribution profiles by axial tomographic and image velocimetry techniques, respectively. The vessel radius, haematocrit, blood flow through main and branch arteries and flow separation zones are determined from the data by various analytical procedures. In contrast to the earlier techniques the data are obtained from the same location of the vessel and thus the variability in flow parameters is minimised.
