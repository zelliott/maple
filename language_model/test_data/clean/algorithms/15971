The purpose of this study was to investigate whether transport of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II (cisplatin) across renal epithelial cell line OK cells is mediated by the organic cation transport system. OK cell monolayers cultured on permeable membranes were incubated with 100 microM cisplatin on the apical or basolateral side, and the cellular accumulation and the transport of cisplatin across the monolayer were measured. The accumulation from the basolateral medium and the basolateral-to-apical transport of cisplatin were higher than the accumulation from the apical medium and the apical-to-basolateral transport, respectively. The cell monolayers were incubated with different concentrations of cisplatin (0.02 approximately 3 mM) in the basolateral medium. The relationship between the cisplatin concentrations in the medium and in the cells revealed that cisplatin accumulation tended to be saturable. The basolateral-to-apical transport of cisplatin was increased when the pH of the apical medium was decreased, with a concomitant decrease in the accumulation of cisplatin. Coincubation of cisplatin with tetraethylammonium (TEA), a typical substrate for the organic cation transporter, significantly decreased the accumulation and transport of cisplatin from the basolateral medium. These results suggest that the uptake and basolateral-to-apical transport of cisplatin are mediated by not only simple diffusion but also by the organic cation transport system.
