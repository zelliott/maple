This paper reviews some of the recent techniques which have been used to register multiple images of the same patient. Image registration is a problem which has been receiving significant attention from the medical image processing community in recent years. A successful image registration can aid in patient diagnosis, treatment assessment, image guided interventions, surgery planning and surgery. At present the majority of work has focused on rigid body transformations of images. We shall discuss some of the approaches used and outline a key automatic method in detail. In order to allow image registration of parts of the body which do not remain rigid, either due to patient movement or a change in pathology, nonlinear deformation techniques are being developed. We shall talk of the history of these methods before explaining deformations using landmarks and a recent extension to allow the definition of rigid structures in such warps in more detail. Validation of these methods is of great importance and we shall discuss work which has already been carried out on this topic for rigid body registrations as well as ideas for the validation of deformation algorithms.
