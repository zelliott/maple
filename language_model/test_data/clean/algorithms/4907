In this paper, the packet-based control approach to networked control systems (NCSs) is extended to the continuous-time case with the use of a discretization technique for continuous network-induced delay. The derived approach can effectively simultaneously deal with network-induced delay, data packet dropout, and data packet disorder and leads to a novel model for NCSs. This model offers the designer the freedom of designing different controllers with respect to specific network conditions, which is distinct from previous results and ensues better system performance. By applying switched system theory, the stability criterion for the derived model is obtained, which is then used to obtain an linear matrix inequality-based stabilized controller design method for the packet-based control approach. A numerical example is also presented, which illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed packet-based control approach by comparison.
