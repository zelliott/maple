In this work controlled phase shift gates are implemented on a qaudrupolar system, by using non-adiabatic geometric phases. A general procedure is given, for implementing controlled phase shift gates in an 'N' level system. The utility of such controlled phase shift gates, is demonstrated here by implementing 3-qubit Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm on a spin-7/2 quadrupolar nucleus oriented in a liquid crystal matrix.
