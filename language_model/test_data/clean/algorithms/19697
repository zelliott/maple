A new model is developed to recognize eukaryotic promoter sequences from non-promoter sequences based on genetic algorithms and neural network in this paper. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the system to recognize the promoter sequences on the training set and on the test set. The mean recognition rate is as high as 99% on the training set and 97% on the test set, which shows the algorithms has great prospect application in promoter recognition.
