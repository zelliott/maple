The causes of non-haemorrhagic obstetric shock (pulmonary thromboembolism, amniotic fluid embolism, acute uterine inversion and sepsis) are uncommon but responsible for the majority of maternal deaths in the developed world. Clinically suspected pulmonary thromboembolism should be treated initially with heparin and objective testing should be performed. If the diagnosis is confirmed, heparin is usually continued until delivery, following which anticoagulation in the puerperium is achieved with either warfarin or heparin. Amniotic fluid embolism is a rare complication of pregnancy, occurring most commonly during labour. The management of amniotic fluid embolism involves maternal oxygenation, the maintenance of cardiac output and blood pressure, and the management of any associated coagulopathy. Acute uterine inversion arises most commonly following mismanagement of the third stage of labour. The shock in uterine inversion is neurogenic in origin, although there may also be profound haemorrhage. The management of this condition includes maternal resuscitation and replacement of the uterus either manually, surgically or by hydrostatic pressure. Genital tract sepsis remains a significant cause of maternal death, the most common predisposing factor being prolonged rupture of the fetal membranes. The management of septic shock in pregnancy includes resuscitation, identification of the source of infection and alteration of the systemic inflammatory response.
