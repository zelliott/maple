A problem often encountered in multidimensional NMR-spectroscopy is that an existing chemical shift list of a protein has to be used to assign an experimental spectrum but does not fit sufficiently well for a safe assignment. A similar problem occurs when temperature or pressure series of n-dimensional spectra are to be evaluated automatically. We have developed two different algorithms, AUREMOL-SHIFTOPT1 and AUREMOL-SHIFTOPT2 that fulfill this task. In the present contribution their performance is analyzed employing a set of simulated and experimental two-dimensional and three-dimensional spectra obtained from three different proteins. A new z-score based on atom and amino acid specific chemical shift distributions is introduced to weight the chemical shift contributions in different dimensions properly.
