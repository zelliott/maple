Stereocontrolled intramolecular aziridination of the glycal-derived sulfamates offers a highly efficient strategy to divergently prepare aminoglycosides. Rhodium-catalyzed nitrogen-atom transfer to C==C bonds formed semistable aziridines, which were subjected to various nucleophiles (C, O, S, and N) to give cyclic sulfamate-containing aminosugar derivatives selectively. The second nucleophilic displacement of sulfonyloxy moieties of [1,2,3]-oxathiazepane-2,2- dioxides allows straightforward access to aminoglycosides with selective alpha- or beta-linkages. This approach is operationally simple, complements existing methods, and is a versatile protocol for the synthesis of polyfunctionalized amino sugars. In addition, the mechanism of the rhodium-catalyzed intramolecular aziridination of glycals and its ring-opening reaction was extensively studied by using DFT calculations.
