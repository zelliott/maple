The paper proposes the systematization of cardiac arrhythmias in accordance with a generalized scheme of transition from regular conditions to random changes, which makes it possible to conclude that the occurrence of more menacing arrhythmias in patients with implantable pacemakers may suggest that there is a risk for random disorders, as well as to recommend to change pacing parameters and even to replace the pacemaker. At present the authors are conducting computer-aided studies of the proposed approach in the Matlab medium. The algorithm of search for the facts of complication of the dynamic behavior of the system is based on the odd set theory which is presently most promising for designing cardiological monitoring systems. The new approach suggests that there are changes in the dynamics of arrhythmias and hence it will be of practical value in treating all cardiological patients.
