To obtain perfusion as well as diffusion information in normal breast tissues and breast lesions from intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) imaging with biexponential analysis of multiple b-value diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and compare these parameters to apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) obtained with monoexponential analysis in their ability to discriminate benign lesions and malignant tumors.

In this prospective study, informed consent was acquired from all patients. Eighty-four patients with 40 malignant tumors, 41 benign lesions, 30 simple cysts and 39 normal breast tissues were imaged at 1.5 T utilizing contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and DWI using 12 b values (range: 0-1000 s/mm(2)). Tissue diffusivity (D), perfusion fraction (f) and pseudo-diffusion coefficient (D*) were calculated using segmented biexponential analysis. ADC (b = 0 and 1000 s/mm(2)) was calculated with monoexponential fitting of the DWI data. D, f, D* and ADC values were obtained for normal breast tissues, simple cysts, benign lesions and malignant tumors. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed for all DWI parameters.

There was good interobserver agreement on the measurements between the 2 observers. D values were significantly different among malignant tumors, benign lesions, simple cysts and normal breast tissues (P = 0.000) and it was the same result for f, D* and ADC values. Further comparisons of these 4 parameters between every single pair were as the following. D and ADC values of malignant tumors were significantly smaller than those of benign lesions, simple cysts and normal tissues (P = 0.000, respectively). The f value of malignant tumors was significantly higher than that of benign lesions, simple cysts and normal breast tissues (P = 0.001, P = 0.000, and P = 0.000). D and ADC values demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity in differentiating benign lesions and malignant tumors, with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.952 and 0.945, respectively, while f and D* with the lower AUC of 0.723 and 0.630, respectively. Combining f and D values had a sensitivity up to 98.75%.

DWI response curves in malignant tumors, benign lesions and normal fibroglandular tissues are found to be biexponential fit in comparison with the monoexponential fit for simple cysts. IVIM provides separate quantitative measurement of D for cellularity and f and D* for vascularity and is helpful for differentiation between benign and malignant breast lesions.
