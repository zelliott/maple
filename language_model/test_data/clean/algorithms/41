Rotating orthogonal polarization imaging is a new technique that provides quantitative measurements of the polarization properties of scattering media, such as tissue, which are free from surface reflections. The technique is investigated using both experiments and Monte Carlo simulations of a polarizing target embedded within a scattering medium. The technique is sensitive to the polarization properties of the target up to a depth of 17 mean free paths. Preliminary images of bovine tendon, lamb tendon, chicken breast, and human skin are also demonstrated.
