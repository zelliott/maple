Transferring the biological function of one protein to another is a key issue in understanding the structure and function relationship of proteins. We have developed a strategy for grafting protein-protein interaction epitopes. As a first step, residues at the interface of the ligand protein which strongly interact with the receptor protein were identified. Then protein scaffolds were docked onto receptor protein based on geometric complementarity. Only high docking score matches were saved. For each saved match, the scaffold protein was accepted if it had suitable positions for grafting key interaction residues of the ligand protein. These candidate residues were mutated to corresponding residues in the ligand protein at each relevant position and the mutated scaffold protein was co-minimized with receptor protein. Finally, the minimized complexes were evaluated by a scoring function deduced from statistical analysis of rigid binding data sets. As a test case, the binding epitope of barstar, the inhibitor of barnase, was grafted onto smaller proteins. Pheromone Er-1 (PDB entry 1erc) has been found to be a good scaffold. The calculated binding free energy for mutated Pheromone Er-1 is equivalent to that of barstar.
