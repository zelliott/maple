An apparatus based on a high sensitive sensor which detects cardiovascular functions is introduced in this paper. Some intelligent detecting technologies, such as syntactic pattern recognition and a medical expert system are used in this detector. Its embedded single-chip microcomputer processes and analyzes pulse signals for gaining automatically the parameters about heart, blood vessel and blood etc., so as to get the health evaluation, correct medical diagnosis and prediction of cardiovascular diseases.
