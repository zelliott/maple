To determine clinical, echocardiographic features, management and outcomes of patients presenting peri aortic abscess complicating infective endocarditis (IE) and demonstrate the impact of periaortic abscess on morbidity and mortality of these patients.

We have analyzed clinical, microbiological, echocardiographic aspects, therapies and outcomes of patients with aortic abscess occurring during IE, and we compared these data with those of patients presenting IE without peri aortic abscess in the same period in the cardiology department of the University Hospital of Marrakech from January 2006 to January 2010.

Above 56 cases of infective endocarditis, 16 patients had an aortic abscess. Mean age was 33 Â± 11 years with a clear male predominance in the group IE with abscess versus IE without abscess. Heart failure was noted in all patients in periaortic abscess group, and was more severe in this group compared to control. Streptococcus and staphylococcus predominated with no significant difference between the two groups. Transthoracic echocardiography coupled with transesophageal echocardiography made the diagnosis of aortic abscess witch was isolated in 11 cases and associated with other complications in five cases. In terms of complications, splenic infarction was more frequent in the group with abscess (25 versus 2.5%, P<0.05). There was not a significant difference between the two groups for the others complications. Surgery associated with a double antibiotic therapy was the standard treatment with a variable delay for surgery of four days to four weeks. Hospital mortality in the acute phase was higher in periaortic abscess group (37% versus 10%, P<0.05). The evolution of survivors at six months was favorable.

Periaortic abscess complicating IE is associated with a high morbidity and mortality in spite of modern approach as well as on medical or surgical treatment. It requires therefore a strict monitoring of patients with infective endocarditis.
