Based on simultaneous power spectral analysis of systemic arterial pressure (SAP) and central venous pressure (CVP) signals in rats anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium, we assessed the hypotheses that subtle changes in the SAP spectrum exist during hemorrhagic shock, and that the CVP spectrum is a feasible index for central blood volume during acute graded blood loss. During Stage I hemorrhagic shock seen after reduction in 10% of total blood volume (TBV), there was a significant increase in the power of both the very low frequency (VLF, 0-.25 Hz) and low frequency (LF, .25-.8 Hz) components, along with a moderate decrease in the very high frequency (VHF, 5-9 Hz) component, of SAP signals. Substantial reduction in VLF, LF, and VHF components in the SAP spectrum occurred after a blood loss of 25% of TBV (Stage II), which persisted during Stage III hemorrhagic shock when the withdrawn blood reached 50% of TBV and the mean SAP maintained at 40 mm Hg. The depressed SAP-VLF and SAP-LF components sustained the period of spontaneous recovery and subsequent retransfusion of shed blood, although the power of SAP-VHF component gradually elevated during these two periods. The power of the high-frequency (HF, .8-2.4 Hz) component of SAP signals increased discernibly only during Stage III, became significant on spontaneous recovery, and declined during retransfusion. Although CVP and CVP-VHF component progressively declined, the power of the CVP-HF component manifested a gradual increase that was significantly and reversely correlated with the reduction in TBV. We conclude that differential changes in individual components of the SAP spectrum occur during hemorrhagic shock, and that the CVP-HF component may be a reliable indicator for central blood volume during acute graded blood loss.
