A family of numerical methods is developed and analyzed for the numerical solution of the parabolic partial differential equation together with the associated initial and boundary conditions, which arise in a mathematical model of the transient stage of percutaneous drug absorption. Two global extrapolation procedures are described, the first in time only, the second in both space and time, for improving the accuracy of the computed concentration profiles. The behaviours of two members of the family of methods, before and after extrapolation, are examined by repeating a number of experiments reported in the literature. Modifications to the algorithms, which are necessary in computing concentration profiles after the ointment is removed at the steady state, are outlined.
