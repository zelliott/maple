Several hundred programs using different algorithms have been designed to predict individual coding features within any genomic sequence, but none of these tools covers all aspects of a gene or is 100% accurate in its prediction. Automated simultaneous processing of the results from a number of these programs minimizes the chance of a false positive prediction and quickly generates integrated data. We report here on the analysis of two known genes in 5 and 25 kb segments of genomic sequence using four genome annotation packages, NIX, RUMMAGE, Genotator and EMBOSS. Gene predictions were confirmed using cDNA sequences and a comparison was made between the packages. This study showed a similarity in the ability of NIX, RUMMAGE and Genotator to predict well-characterised genes and basic structures, but poor exon prediction for a small, 3 exon gene. However, the BLAST subprograms of all three packages correctly identified the 3 exons. In addition, EST BLAST subprograms identified a previously undescribed, possible 5' untranslated exon for the smaller gene and a number of putative alternatively spliced exons in the larger gene. Overall, NIX was found to be the most user-friendly package, in terms of easy access to databases and the interactive graphical display of results.
