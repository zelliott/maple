The single-pass modulation transfer function (MTF(sgl)) is an important numerical parameter that can help elucidate the performance and some processes of the human visual system. In previous studies, the MTF(sgl) was calculated from double-pass point spread function (PSF) measurements. These measurements include a depolarized reflection component from the retina that introduces a measurement artifact, and they require long acquisition times to allow averaging to reduce speckle. To solve these problems, we developed a new ocular PSF analysis system (PSFAS) that uses polarization optics to eliminate the depolarized retinal reflection component, and a rotating prism to increase measurement speed. Validation experiments on one patient showed that the MTF(sgl) measured by PSFAS agrees closely with the MTF calculated from contrast sensitivity measurements. A simulated retinal image was calculated by convolution of Landolt rings with the calculated single-pass PSF provided by the PSFAS. The contrast characteristic then was calculated from the simulated retinal images. These results indicate that the MTF(sgl) obtained using the PSFAS may be a reliable measure of visual performance of the optics of the eye, including the optical effects of the retina. The simulated retinal images and contrast characteristics are useful for evaluating visual performance.
