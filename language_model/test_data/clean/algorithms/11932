The interaction of bisindolylmaleimide (BIM), widely used as a specific protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, with rat brain Kv1.5 (rKv1.5) channels stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells was investigated using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. BIM (I) and its inactive analog, BIM (V), inhibited rKv1.5 currents at +50 mV in a reversible concentration-dependent manner with an apparent K(d) value of 0.38 and 1.70 microM, respectively. BIM (I) accelerated the decay rate of inactivation of rKv1.5 currents but did not significantly modify the kinetics of current activation. Other specific PKC inhibitors, chelerythrine and PKC 19-36, had no effect on rKv1.5 and did not prevent the inhibitory effect of BIM (I). The inhibition of rKv1.5 by BIM (I) and BIM (V) was highly voltage-dependent between -30 and 0 mV (voltage range of channel opening), suggesting that both drugs interact preferentially with the open state of the channel. The additional inhibition by BIM (I) displayed a voltage dependence (delta = 0.19) in the full activation voltage range positive to 0 mV, but was not shown in BIM (V) (delta = 0). The rate constants of association and dissociation for BIM (I) were 9.63 microM(-1) s(-1) and 5.82 s(-1), respectively. BIM (I) increased the time constant of deactivation of tail currents from 26. 35 to 45.79 ms, resulting in tail crossover phenomenon. BIM (I) had no effect on the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation. BIM (I) produced use-dependent inhibition of rKv1.5, which was consistent with the slow recovery from inactivation in the presence of drug. These results suggest that BIM (I) directly inhibits rKv1.5 channels in a phosphorylation-independent, and state-, voltage-, time-, and use-dependent manner.
