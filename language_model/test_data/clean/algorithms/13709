Estimating the times until incidences of bivariate progressive processes that are categorical is a common problem in ophthalmology, audiology, pulmonary medicine, and other fields of medical research. We consider study designs in which diagnoses of subject's bivariate status are performed repeatedly across time and when diagnosis is subject to error. In such situations, error confounds the interpretation of the time until an event. A composite model is proposed for parameterizing both the incidence and error distributions, which allows for correlation between sites with respect to both incidence and diagnostic error. An EM algorithm is described for this model, which allows categorical covariates for both incidence and error. The methodology is applied to two examples. The first represents a situation in which bivariate incidence and error can reasonably be assumed symmetric: prospective data concerning the development of ocular lens opacities in a large pharmaceutical clinical trial. The second example represents a situation in which bivariate incidence and error may not be symmetric: clinical evaluations of sexual maturation status with respect to two different anatomical indices in the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease. The methodology described in this paper is used, in each case, to estimate incidence, characterize error rates, and assess bivariate correlations.
