In this paper, the problem of generalized outer synchronization between two completely different complex dynamical networks is investigated. With a nonlinear control scheme, a sufficient criterion for this generalized outer synchronization is derived based on Barbalat's lemma. Two corollaries are also obtained, which contains the situations studied in two lately published papers as special cases. Numerical simulations further demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the theoretical results.
