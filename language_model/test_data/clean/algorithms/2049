Hypothermia in the hospitalized adult may be a primary process, as in exposure, or a result of a multitude of disease processes or iatrogenic factors. The condition affects virtually every metabolic process in the body. A thorough understanding of the pathophysiology of hypothermia enables the clinician to differentiate between the hypothermic syndrome and underlying illness and can assist in the detection and management of clinical sequelae. A reliable patient history is the most helpful diagnostic tool, but careful physical examination and laboratory studies are also important for detection of primary or secondary illness.
