A combination of the constant-time spectral-spatial imaging (CTSSI) modality and projection-reconstruction modality was tested to simplify data acquisition for multi-dimensional CW EPR spectral-spatial imaging. In this method, 3D spectral-spatial image data were obtained by simple repetition of conventional 2D CW imaging process, except that the field gradient amplitude was incremented in constant steps in each repetition. The data collection scheme was no different from the conventional CW imaging system for spectral-spatial data acquisition. No special equipment and/or rewriting of existing software were required. The data acquisition process for multi-dimensional spectral-spatial imaging is consequently simplified. There is also no "missing-angle" issue because the CTSSI modality was employed to reconstruct 2D spectral-spatial images. Extra reconstruction processes to obtain higher spatial dimensions were performed using a conventional projection-reconstruction modality. This data acquisition technique can be applied to any conventional CW EPR (spatial) imaging system for multi-dimensional spectral-spatial imaging.
