NMR flow propagators have been obtained for brine flowing through Bentheimer sandstone using the rapid DiffTrain pulse sequence. In this way, 8 flow propagators at different observation times Delta were acquired in 67 mins, compared to 7 h for the same measurements implemented with conventional pulsed field gradient (PFG) sequences. DiffTrain allows this time saving to be achieved through the acquisition of multiple displacement probability distributions over a range of Delta in a single measurement. If only the propagator moments are required, this experiment time can be further reduced to 9 mins through appropriate sparse sampling at low q values. The propagator moments obtained from DiffTrain measurements with dense and sparse q-space sampling are shown to be equivalent to those obtained from conventional PFG measurements.
