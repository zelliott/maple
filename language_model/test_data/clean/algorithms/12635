Rapid advances in understanding the molecular biology of acute myeloid leukemia are transforming the approach to diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment of these cases.

To briefly review the current state of AML classification with a particular emphasis on the role of molecular studies and their impact on the management of acute myeloid leukemia and other malignancies.

Current literature and experience of the authors.

While morphology, immunophenotyping, cytogenetics, and clinical history continue to play an important role, an increasing number of molecular tests are now required to properly classify these cases.
