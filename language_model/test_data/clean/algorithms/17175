The clinical signs and surgical treatment of a 3-year old German wirehair Pointer with chronic intermittent lameness due to a gunshot injury are presented. In addition to routine radiography, ultrasound investigation and positive contrast arthrography of the radiocarpal joint showed that a bullet was located in the lateropalmar part of the radiocarpal joint cavity. Surgical removal of the bullet led to complete clinical recovery. A diagnostic and therapeutic protocol is presented for dogs and cats with gunshot injuries.
