The analytical solutions of the fundamental equation of the multilinear gradient elution are derived in two cases, when the dependence of the logarithm of the solute retention (lnk) upon the volume fraction of organic modifier (φ) is a three-parameter logarithmic expression, and when a simple linear relationship between lnk and lnφ is adopted. The derived theoretical expressions for retention times under multilinear gradient conditions are embodied to simple algorithms for fitting gradient data and especially for resolution optimization. Their performance was examined by using a mixture of 16 model compounds chosen among purines, pyrimidine and nucleosides in eluting systems modified by acetonitrile. It was found that the accuracy of the predicted gradient retention times is very satisfactory even if the simple logarithmic expression for the retention behavior of solutes, i.e. the linear dependence of lnk upon lnφ, is used.
