Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Western societies. Hypertension has been identified as a cardinal risk factor for CHD. Guidelines for hypertension classification and treatment are based on the results of clinical trials that have demonstrated reductions in cardiovascular endpoints in treated hypertensive patient. Controversy persists regarding the level of blood pressure at which treatment should be initiated and the desirable blood pressure goals of treatment. Several algorithms for CHD risk prediction have been developed. This report will review one recently developed approach for predicting CHD risk based upon observational data from the Framingham Heart Study. A rationale is presented for considering absolute level of CHD risk to guide hypertension treatment.
