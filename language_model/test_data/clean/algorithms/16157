Hyponatremia with cerebral symptoms is a medical emergency in which treatment delay may prove fatal. However, controversy prevails over which treatment is the best. This paper presents a practical and unified approach based on a literature study of the physiology of plasma [Na(+) ], the brain's response and clinical and experimental studies. Experimental and clinical studies were thoroughly reviewed. The literature was identified through MESH and free text search in the databases PubMed, Embase and Cochrane, and references in the literature. Cerebral water homeostasis is pivotal in hyponatremia. Prompt, repeated boluses of 2 ml/kg 3% saline constitute a rational treatment of symptomatic hyponatremia. After the initial correction, concern is mainly with avoiding overcorrection and osmotic demyelination. Plasma [Na(+)] is determined by the external balances of water and cations. The water balance must therefore be carefully monitored to counter the dramatic increase in plasma [Na(+)] that may result from brisk diuresis. Definitive treatment of hyponatremia should be directed toward its etiology. This can be challenging and the clinical application of traditional classifications based on hydration is difficult. Therefore, a practical approach is proposed based on the mechanisms of impaired urine dilution.

The conflict between previously opposing standpoints is gradually giving way to an emerging consensus: Prompt bolus treatment of symptomatic hyponatremia with hypertonic saline. After the initial treatment, overcorrection must be avoided. Definitive treatment should be directed toward the nature of the underlying disorder. An approach based on the mechanism governing the impaired urine dilution has been proposed.
