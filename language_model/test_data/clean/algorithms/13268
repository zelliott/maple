The in-line holography has obvious advantages especially in wider spatial bandwidth over the off-axis holography. However, a direct current(DC)-noise and an unwanted twin image should be separated or eliminated in the in-line holography for a high quality reconstruction. An approach for suppressing the twin image is proposed by separating the real and twin image regions in the digital holography. Specifically, the initial region of real and twin images is obtained by a blind separation matrix, and the segmentation mask to suppress the twin image is calculated by nonlinear quantization from the segmented image. For the performance evaluation, the proposed method is compared with the existing approaches including the overlapping block variance and manual-based schemes. Experimental results showed that the proposed method has a better performance at the overlapped region of the real and twin images. Additionally, the proposed method causes less loss of real image than the overlapping block variance-based scheme. Therefore, we believe that the proposed scheme can be a useful tool for high quality reconstruction in the in-line holography.
