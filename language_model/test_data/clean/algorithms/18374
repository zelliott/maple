In this paper, the experimental conditions for preparing ampicillin-loaded surfactant vesicles (SVs) are described. Our studies are focused on the potential use of a vesicular polymeric dispersion as ampicillin delivery system for topical application. The main components of the formulation are uncharged and charged SVs loaded with ampicillin and dispersed in a gellan solution. The following issues are addressed: the drug encapsulation efficiency (e.e.), the kinetic of drug release from the delivery systems, the antimicrobial activity of vesicle-entrapped ampicillin. The in vitro permeation experiments through a synthetic lipophilic barrier (Silastic) and through porcine skin are carried out to evaluate the potential use as a dermal formulation. The use of both a synthetic and a biological membrane allows to discriminate between the effects related to variations of thermodynamic parameters and those correlated to biological factors. The release rate of ampicillin is increased by encapsulation in neutral and negatively charged SVs and the permeation rate was slowed by dispersion of drug-loaded SVs in gellan solution. Finally, studies of antimicrobial activity on prepared systems evidenced that ampicillin encapsulated in SVs exhibit a higher activity than the free drug.
