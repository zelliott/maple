Speckle tracking methods overcome the major limitations of current Doppler methods for flow imaging and quantification: angle dependence and aliasing. In this paper, we review the development of speckle tracking, with particular attention to the advantages and limitations of two-dimensional algorithms that use a single transducer aperture. Ensemble tracking, a recent speckle tracking method based upon parallel receive processing, is described. Experimental results with ensemble tracking indicate the ability to measure laminar flow in a phantom at a beam-vessel angle of 60 degrees, which had not been possible with previous 2D speckle tracking methods. Finally, important areas for future research in speckle tracking are briefly summarized.
