This paper outlines the framework of a porous flow mixture theory for the mathematical modelling of in vitro tissue growth, and gives an application of this theory to an aspect of tissue engineering. The problem is formulated as a set of partial differential equations governing the space and time dependence of the amounts of each component of the tissue (phase), together with the physical stresses in each component. The theory requires constitutive relations to specify the material properties of each phase, and also requires relations to specify the stresses developed due to mechanical interactions, both within each phase and between different phases. An application of the theory is given to the study of the mobility and aggregation of a population of cells seeded into an artificial polymeric scaffold. Stability analysis techniques show that the interplay of the forces between the tissue constituents results in two different regimes: either the cells form aggregates or disperse through the scaffold.
