Although the main reason for adding a random element at every step of minimization procedure is to reduce predictability of the upcoming treatment assignments in single-center open-label trials, there is another reason for its use, applicable to double-blind trials. Adding the random element at every allocation step allows one to avoid a fully deterministic sequence of treatment assignments for sequences of covariates for which at every allocation step one of the treatments leads to a better balance in covariates than all other treatments. An example of such a sequence is provided in this communication.
