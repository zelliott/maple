Quality assessment plays a crucial role in data analysis. In this paper, we present a reduced-reference approach to volume data quality assessment. Our algorithm extracts important statistical information from the original data in the wavelet domain. Using the extracted information as feature and predefined distance functions, we are able to identify and quantify the quality loss in the reduced or distorted version of data, eliminating the need to access the original data. Our feature representation is naturally organized in the form of multiple scales, which facilitates quality evaluation of data with different resolutions. The feature can be effectively compressed in size. We have experimented with our algorithm on scientific and medical data sets of various sizes and characteristics. Our results show that the size of the feature does not increase in proportion to the size of original data. This ensures the scalability of our algorithm and makes it very applicable for quality assessment of large-scale data sets. Additionally, the feature could be used to repair the reduced or distorted data for quality improvement. Finally, our approach can be treated as a new way to evaluate the uncertainty introduced by different versions of data.
