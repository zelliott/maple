Urogenital chlamydia infections are the most prevalent of all sexually transmitted diseases although the number of chlamydia-induced reactive arthritis cases are generally below the estimated incidence of the disease. This may be related with the high rate of asymptomatic chlamydial infections and the lack of adequate diagnostic criteria. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a new system for detection of Chlamydia, is one of the most useful techniques for the diagnosis of this disease. Biologic therapy produces theoretical doubts regarding its indication and there is little information related with chlamydia induced reactive arthritis treatment efficacy. Although the usefulness of long antibiotic treatment is not clear, the use of combination antibiotics opens new therapeutic strategies for chlamydia induced reactive arthritis.
