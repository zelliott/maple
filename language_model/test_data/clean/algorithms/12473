In microarray studies it is common that the number of replications (i.e. the sample size) is small and that the distribution of expression values differs from normality. In this situation, permutation and bootstrap tests may be appropriate for the identification of differentially expressed genes. However, unlike bootstrap tests, permutation tests are not suitable for very small sample sizes, such as three per group. A variety of different bootstrap tests exists. For example, it is possible to adjust the data to have a common mean before the bootstrap samples are drawn. For small significance levels, which can occur when a large number of genes is investigated, the original bootstrap test, as well as a bootstrap test suggested for the Behrens-Fisher problem, have no power in cases of very small sample sizes. In contrast, the modified test based on adjusted data is powerful. Using a Monte Carlo simulation study, we demonstrate that the difference in power can be huge. In addition, the different tests are illustrated using microarray data.
