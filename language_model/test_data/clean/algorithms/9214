A survey of the use of graph theoretical techniques in Biology is presented. In particular, recent work on identifying and modelling the structure of bio-molecular networks is discussed, as well as the application of centrality measures to interaction networks and research on the hierarchical structure of such networks and network motifs. Work on the link between structural network properties and dynamics is also described, with emphasis on synchronisation and disease propagation.
