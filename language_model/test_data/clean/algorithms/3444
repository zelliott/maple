Adsorption parameters (enthalpy of adsorption, free energy of adsorption) of several alkanes, cyclic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons and chlorinated compounds on different adsorbents (alumina, zeolites 13X and 5 A, and activated carbon) were determined by inverse gas chromatography. Dispersive surface energy interaction and specific interaction parameters were determined for each solute-adsorbent system. It was found that mesoporous alumina presents lower enthalpy of adsorption than the microporous materials. Furthermore, zeolite 13X, which has wider pores than zeolite 5 A, exhibits a higher adsorption capacity.
