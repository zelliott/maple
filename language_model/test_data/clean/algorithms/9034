Although the scientific literature contains ample descriptions of peculiar patterns of repolarization linked to arrhythmic risk, the objective quantification and classification of these patterns continues to be a challenge that impacts their widespread adoption in clinical practice. To advance the science, computerized algorithms spawned in the academic environment have been essential in order to find, extract and measure these patterns. However, outside the strict control of a core lab, these algorithms are exposed to poor quality signals and need to be effective in the presence of different forms of noise that can either obscure or mimic the T-wave variation (TWV) of interest. To provide a practical solution that can be verified and validated for the market, important tradeoffs need to be made that are based on an intimate understanding of the end-user as well as the key characteristics of either the signal or the noise that can be used by the signal processing engineer to best differentiate them. To illustrate this, two contemporary medical devices used for quantifying T-wave variation are presented, including the modified moving average (MMA) for the detection of T-wave Alternans (TWA) and the quantification of T-wave shape as inputs to the Morphology Combination Score (MCS) for the trending of drug-induced repolarization abnormalities.
