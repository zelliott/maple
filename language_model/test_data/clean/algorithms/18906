Digital holographic microscopy enables a quantitative phase contrast metrology that is suitable for the investigation of reflective surfaces as well as for the marker-free analysis of living cells. The digital holographic feature of (subsequent) numerical focus adjustment makes possible applications for multifocus imaging. An overview of digital holographic microscopy methods is described. Applications of digital holographic microscopy are demonstrated by results obtained from livings cells and engineered surfaces.
