We use transmission and backscattering optical coherence tomography (OCT) to distinguish and quantify dependent and multiple scattering effects in turbid media. With transmission OCT the dependent scattering coefficients for a range of monodisperse silica particle suspensions are determined. An excellent agreement is observed between the measured dependent scattering coefficients and calculations based on Mie calculations, the Percus-Yevick radial distribution function, and coherent light scattering theory. Backscattering OCT measurements are fitted using the extended Huygens-Fresnel (EHF) model with the dependent scattering coefficients obtained from the transmission OCT measurements as input parameters. Good agreement between the EHF model and the backscattering OCT measurements is observed. For large particles, the rms scattering angle θrms obtained from the EHF fit is in fair agreement with θrms calculated from the transmission OCT data.
