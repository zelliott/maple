A sensitivity enhancement method based on selective adiabatic inversion of a satellite transition has been employed in a (pi/2)CT-(pi)ST1-(pi/2)CT spectral editing sequence to both enhance and resolve multisite NMR spectra of quadrupolar nuclei. In addition to a total enhancement of 2.5 times for spin 3/2 nuclei, enhancements up to 2.0 times is reported for the edited sites in a mixture of rubidium salts.
