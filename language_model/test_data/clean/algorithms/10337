We wanted to evaluate the image quality and diagnostic value of 64-slice dual-source computed tomography (DSCT) coronary angiography in patients with atrial fibrillation (Afib).

The coronary arteries of 22 Afib patients seen on DSCT were classified into 15 segments and the imaging quality (excellent, good, moderate and poor) and significant stenoses (≥ 50%) were evaluated by two radiologists who were blinded to the conventional coronary angiography (CAG) results. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for detecting important coronary artery stenosis were calculated. McNemar test was used to determine any significant difference between DSCT and CAG, and Cohen's Kappa statistics were calculated for the intermodality and interobserver agreement.

The mean heart rate was 89 ± 8.3 bpm (range: 80-118 bpm). A range from 250 msec to 300 msec within the RR interval was the optimal reconstruction interval for the patients with Afib. The respective overall sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV values were 74%, 97%, 81% and 96% for reader 1 and 72%, 98%, 85% and 96% for reader 2. No significant difference between DSCT and CAG was found for detecting a significant stenosis (reader 1, p = 1.0; reader 2, p = 0.727). Cohen's Kappa statistics demonstrated good intermodality and interobserver agreement.

64-slice DSCT coronary angiography provides good image quality in patients with atrial fibrillation without the need for controlling the heart rate. DSCT can be used for ruling out significant stenosis in patients with atrial fibrillation with its high NPV for detecting in important stenosis.
