Auditory brainstem responses (ABR) elicited by click and tonal stimuli were recorded from the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii), a marsupial mammal. The morphology, threshold, amplitude, and latency of ABRs recorded in the tammar wallaby are similar to those of other marsupials and mammals used in auditory research, including humans. Thresholds determined by an algorithm employing cross-correlation and by conventional visual detection methods were comparable. The findings from this study indicate that tammar wallaby is a suitable model for auditory research and that algorithms employing cross-correlation are useful for detection of the ABR waveform.
