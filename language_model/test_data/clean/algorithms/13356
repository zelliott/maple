Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) frequently occur together, and their coexistence is associated with a poor prognosis. AF and HF share risk factors, but their relationship involves complex hemodynamic, neurohormonal, inflammatory, ultrastructural, and electrophysiologic processes that extend beyond epidemiological associations. The shared mechanisms underlying AF and HF have important implications for the treatment of AF in patients with HF. This article focuses on reviewing contemporary data as it pertains to AF management in patients with HF and provides insight into investigational therapies currently under development.
