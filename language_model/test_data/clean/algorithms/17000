A retrospective study of 1000 live renal transplants was performed in order to assess the factors associated with hypertension in renal transplant recipients. The prevalence of hypertension prior to transplantation was 48%. The need for antihypertensive drugs decreased in 43%, increased in 31% and remained the same in 26%. The presence of hypertension before transplantation, rejection episodes, transplant renal artery stenosis and native kidney disease were the main factors associated with post-transplant hypertension. An algorithm for the management of post-transplant hypertension is suggested.
