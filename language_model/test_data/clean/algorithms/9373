NetMatch is a Cytoscape plugin which allows searching biological networks for subcomponents matching a given query. Queries may be approximate in the sense that certain parts of the subgraph-query may be left unspecified. To make the query creation process easy, a drawing tool is provided. Cytoscape is a bioinformatics software platform for the visualization and analysis of biological networks.

The full package, a tutorial and associated examples are available at the following web sites: http://alpha.dmi.unict.it/~ctnyu/netmatch.html, http://baderlab.org/Software/NetMatch.
