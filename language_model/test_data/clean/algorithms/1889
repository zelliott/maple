This paper deals with the complex unit roots representation of archea DNA sequences and the analysis of symmetries in the wavelet coefficients of the digitalized sequence. It is shown that even for extremophile archaea, the distribution of nucleotides has to fulfill some (mathematical) constraints in such a way that the wavelet coefficients are symmetrically distributed, with respect to the nucleotides distribution.
