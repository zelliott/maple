The efficacy of conventional secondary bone grafting is limited in instances of a bilateral alveolar cleft with a wide cleft gap and malpositioning of the premaxilla. The purpose of this study is to suggest a systematic algorithm to guide individualised treatment of a bilateral alveolar cleft according to the position of the premaxilla and the width of the alveolar gap.

A total of 51 patients with bilateral alveolar clefts were investigated between January 2000 and February 2008. The average age was 9.2 years, and the mean follow-up period was 47 months. Conventional alveolar bone grafting (ABG) was performed for patients with both a narrow cleft gap and acceptable position of the premaxilla. Patients with both a wide cleft gap and acceptable premaxilla position were initially managed by interdental distraction osteogenesis. Premaxilla repositioning was indicated in patients with both sagittally and/or vertically unfavoured positioning of the premaxilla. The extent of bone resorption following bone grafting was evaluated using the Abyh√∂lm criteria.

Of 102 grafts, 98 grafts (96.1%) showed satisfactory bony take (Grade I-II). Only four grafts (3.9%) exhibited a poor outcome, with more than 50% bony resorption (Grade III-IV). The average hospital stay was 5.7 days and no serious complications were observed. Our approach resulted in satisfactory surgical outcomes. This suggests the feasibility of a standardised approach for the correction of a bilateral alveolar cleft. Our algorithm should be helpful for systematic and coordinated team approaches to rectify bilateral alveolar clefts.
