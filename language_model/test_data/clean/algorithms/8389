The predictability and constancy over time of the electroosmotic flow in microchannels is an important consideration in microfluidic devices. A common cause for alteration of the flow is the adsorption of analytes to channel walls, for example, during capillary electrophoresis of proteins. It is shown that certain experimental data, published by Towns and Regnier (Towns, J. K; Regnier, F. E. Anal. Chem. 1992, 64, 2473-2478.), on the anomalous elution times for proteins in capillary electrophoresis can be explained using a simple model for analyte adsorption that uses a result first reported by Anderson and Idol (Anderson, J. L.; Idol, W. K Chem. Eng. Commun. 1985, 38, 93-106.) on the electroosmotic flux in capillaries with axial variations in zeta-potential. It is suggested that it might be possible to use such a model to dynamically correct for altered elution times in capillary electrophoretic devices.
