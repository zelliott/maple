The dielectric behavior of a suspension of synchronized, spherical cells has been investigated in relation to the electrical parameters of certain cell structures. In the quasistatic approximation, Poisson's equations are solved for the respective diffusive media, and the local charge distributions are derived by taking into account the continuity equations. The results describe both alpha and beta dispersion and reduce, in the corresponding limiting cases, to previous reports. The dependence of suspension permittivity in alpha- and beta-dispersion ranges on the diffusive effects, the conductivity, and the permittivity of cytoplasm, of membrane, and of culture medium as well as on membrane thickness is pointed out. The possibility is pointed out of characterizing cellular behavior by means of the evolution of certain electrical and morphological parameters during cell cycle progression as well the effects of different stimuli on cellular systems derived by fast dielectric spectroscopy.
