This study measures the effect of case management interview (CMI) on 1,000 long-term sick-listed employees' probability of returning to work. In contrast to previous studies, we use instrumental variables to correct for selection effects in CMI. Using a competing hazard rate model, we find that CMI increases the probability of returning to work for the pre-sick leave employer, but has no effect on the probability of resuming work for a new employer. We argue that CMI either motivates the sick-listed employees to resume work or adjusts for asymmetric information between the employee and the pre-sick leave employer.
