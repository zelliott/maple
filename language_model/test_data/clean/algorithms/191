We assessed the performance of genotypic algorithms for predicting the tropism of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 coreceptor usage in 52 patients infected with the CRF02-AG subtype. The combined criteria of the 11/25 and net charge rules accurately detected CXCR4-using CRF02-AG viruses, whereas the Geno2pheno tool lacked sensitivity and the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) tool WebPSSM lacked specificity.
