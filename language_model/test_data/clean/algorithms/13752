The budgetary implications of using 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in the management of patients with chemotherapy-induced emesis is discussed. It was shown that treatment with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in the acute phase of emesis resulted in relatively little additional cost when introduced into a normal management pattern of emesis control, and therefore seems justifiable. However, in delayed emesis there is a much more substantial budgetary impact with no proven clinical benefit, and therefore treatment does not appear to be appropriate in this situation.
