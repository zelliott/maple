An universal targeting device coupled with computerized tomography is a new promise in the complex of diagnostics and therapy. It allows any point inside the human body to be reached from any spot on its surface. The space containing the target is controlled by moving the arms of the device on three mutually perpendicular planes and by turning at two angles around the longitudinal and transversal axes. The targeting is controlled by computer. The patient is immobilized on a vacuum mattress. This device was tested in model conditions and is now ready for clinical application.
