The potential of maintaining multilocus polymorphism by migration-selection balance is studied. A large population of diploid individuals is distributed over finitely many demes connected by migration. Generations are discrete and nonoverlapping, selection may vary across demes, and loci are multiallelic. It is shown that if migration and recombination are strong relative to selection, then with weak or no epistasis and intermediate dominance at every locus and in every deme, arbitrarily many alleles can be maintained at arbitrarily many loci at a stable equilibrium. If migration is weak relative to selection and recombination, then with weak or no epistasis and intermediate dominance at every locus and in every deme, as many alleles as there are demes can be maintained at arbitrarily many loci at equilibrium. In both cases open sets of such parameter combinations are constructed, thus the results are robust with respect to small, but arbitrary, perturbations in the parameters. For weak migration, the number of demes is, in fact, a generic upper bound to the number of alleles that can be maintained at any locus. Thus, several scenarios are identified under which multilocus polymorphism can be maintained by migration-selection balance when this is impossible in a panmictic population.
