Exclusively heteronuclear (13)C-detected NMR spectroscopy of proteins in solution has seen resurgence in the past several years. For disordered or unfolded proteins, which tend to have poor (1)H-amide chemical shift dispersion, these experiments offer enhanced resolution and the possibility of complete heteronuclear resonance assignment at the cost of leaving the (1)H resonances unassigned. Here we report two novel (13)C-detected NMR experiments which incorporate a (1)H chemical shift evolution period followed by (13)C-TOCSY mixing for aliphatic (1)H resonance assignment without reliance on (1)H detection.
