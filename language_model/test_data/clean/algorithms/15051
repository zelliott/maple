Biopanning of phage-displayed random peptide libraries is a powerful technique for identifying peptides that mimic epitopes (mimotopes) for monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). However, peptides derived using polyclonal antisera may represent epitopes for a diverse range of antibodies. Hence following screening of phage libraries with polyclonal antisera, including autoimmune disease sera, a procedure is required to distinguish relevant from irrelevant phagotopes. We therefore applied the multiple sequence alignment algorithm PILEUP together with a matrix for scoring amino acid substitutions based on physicochemical properties to generate guide trees depicting relatedness of selected peptides. A random heptapeptide library was biopanned nine times using no selecting antibodies, immunoglobulin G (IgG) from sera of subjects with autoimmune diseases (primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and type 1 diabetes) and three murine ascites fluids that contained mAbs to overlapping epitope(s) on the Ross River Virus envelope protein 2. Peptides randomly sampled from the library were distributed throughout the guide tree of the total set of peptides whilst many of the peptides derived in the absence of selecting antibody aligned to a single cluster. Moreover peptides selected by different sources of IgG aligned to separate clusters, each with a different amino acid motif. These alignments were validated by testing all of the 53 phagotopes derived using IgG from PBC sera for reactivity by capture ELISA with antibodies affinity purified on the E2 subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC-E2), the major autoantigen in PBC: only those phagotopes that aligned to PBC-associated clusters were reactive. Hence the multiple sequence alignment procedure discriminates relevant from irrelevant phagotopes and thus a major difficulty with biopanning phage-displayed random peptide libraries with polyclonal antibodies is surmounted.
