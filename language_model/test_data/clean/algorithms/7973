Age related macular degeneration (ARMD) in its neovascular form is a serious disease which produces legal blindness in many patients with poor prognosis if left untreated. We intend to establish a clinical guide with the different therapeutic options that exist nowadays, which may help the ophthalmologists in their clinical practice.

A group of medical retina experts selected by SERV have evaluated the results of different published studies with the drugs currently available, obtaining an evidence-based consensus. Some recommendations have been established for diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of patients with neovascular ARMD.

The intravitreal injection of ranibizumab at a dosage of 0.5 mg produces significant improvement of visual acuity in subfoveal lesions, according to data obtained from studies with the highest level of evidence. It should be considered as a first choice drug. The use of bevacizumab, a drug with not approved indication for intraocular use, nor for the treatment of neovascular ARMD can reach a result which is closer to the ones obtained with ranibizumab than to those obtained with photodynamic therapy (PDT) and pegaptanib. The use of intravitreal pegaptanib sodium in intravitreal injection at a dosage of 0.3 mg as a treatment for subfoveal lesions can obtain similar results to the TFD, but with a wider range of injuries.

The results of the evidence-based studies are a good guide for the treatment of this disease.
