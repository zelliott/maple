In this work, an integral equation approach to investigate the atactic polystyrene (aPS) melt based on polymer reference interaction site model (PRISM) theory is proposed. The intramolecular structure factors, required as input to PRISM theory, are obtained from the semiflexible chain model. With a novel coarse-graining procedure and the explicit-atom molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations for aPS, the parameters needed for the coarse-grained model are obtained by using an automatic simplex optimization. These parameters can be used to describe the structure and thermodynamic properties of the complex aPS melt and good agreement is obtained between the theory and MD simulations. The proposed integral equation approach provides a basis for describing the structure and properties of PS nanocomposites where the application of molecular simulation is difficult.
