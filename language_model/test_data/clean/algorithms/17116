We describe two psychophysical experiments testing predictions of the square difference mechanism we have previously proposed for intensity-based stereo. Experiment 1 assesses the relative contributions of disparity and contrast to intensity-based stereo by measuring detection thresholds. The product of disparity and contrast at threshold is shown to be constant. In experiment 2, we measure quantitatively the global depth position perceived in stereograms of curved, smoothly shaded surfaces. The results show that disparity averaging over the surface involves a contrast-dependent weighting function. The results from both experiments are consistent with predictions derived from the square difference mechanism. The relation of this mechanism to feature correspondence stereopsis and shape-from-shading is discussed and a general framework for assessing the modularity of stereopsis is presented.
