Postural stabilization is required following perturbations or after transitioning to standing. The current research evaluated two available algorithms that utilize within-trial data to quantify standing following multi-planar transitions. Forty-five participants began each trial by assuming a static forward kneeling posture that ended with an auditory signal prompting transition to standing. Data from two force plates was collected at 100Hz for 20s starting with the transition. With one algorithm, using windows of various lengths, stabilization time was defined as when mean center of pressure (CoP) velocity of the current window was less than that for the mean of all subsequent windows. This algorithm produced significantly different stabilization times (1.3-6.9s) depending on the window length. In a second algorithm, a negative exponential mathematical model was fit to data within each trial (R(2)=0.93). This approach was easily implemented and produced results (mean=2.1s) with lower variability (SD=0.9s). Though approaches exist that adequately determine stabilization times in well-constrained uni-planar movements, there are limitations to generalizability. The negative exponential mathematical model evaluated in this study provides a promising method for systematically determining stabilization times for multi-planar movements.
