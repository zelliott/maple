Prediction and modeling of RNA structures has become an indispensable tool of biological research disciplines. Currently, reliable predictions require massive input of experimental data. Structure-forming elements are conventional base pairs, as well as a rapidly increasing repertoire of novel structural motifs. New developments extend structural analysis beyond the one-sequence/one-structure paradigm and allow questions that are relevant to molecular evolution to be answered.
