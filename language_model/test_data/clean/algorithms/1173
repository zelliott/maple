During the course of their biological function, proteins undergo different types of structural rearrangements ranging from local to large-scale conformational changes. These changes are usually triggered by their interactions with small-molecular-weight ligands or other macromolecules. Because binding interactions occur at specific sites and involve only a small number of residues, a chain of cooperative interactions is necessary for the propagation of binding signals to distal locations within the protein structure. This process requires an uneven structural distribution of protein stability and cooperativity as revealed by NMR-detected hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments under native conditions. The distribution of stabilizing interactions does not only provide the architectural foundation to the three-dimensional structure of a protein, but it also provides the required framework for functional cooperativity. In this review, the statistical thermodynamic linkage between protein stability, functional cooperativity, and ligand binding is discussed.
