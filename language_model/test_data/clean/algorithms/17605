In this study we describe a highly sensitive and specific method for discriminating between ventricular and supraventricular tachyarrhythmias based on the response to simultaneous atrial and ventricular antitachycardia pacing. This new method, which can terminate supraventricular tachycardias in >50% of patients, can be easily implemented in a new generation of dual-chamber defibrillators.
