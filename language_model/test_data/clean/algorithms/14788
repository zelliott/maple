Wireless Sensor Networks have become an important technology with numerous potential applications for the interaction of computers and the physical environment in civilian and military areas. In the routing protocols that are specifically designed for the applications used by sensor networks, the limited available power of the sensor nodes has been taken into consideration in order to extend the lifetime of the networks. In this paper, two protocols based on LEACH and called R-EERP and S-EERP with base and threshold values are presented. R-EERP and S-EERP are two efficient energy aware routing protocols that can be used for some critical applications such as detecting dangerous gases (methane, ammonium, carbon monoxide, etc.) in an indoor environment. In R-EERP, sensor nodes are deployed randomly in a field similar to LEACH. In S-EERP, nodes are deployed sequentially in the rooms of the flats of a multi-story building. In both protocols, nodes forming clusters do not change during a cluster change time, only the cluster heads change. Furthermore, an XOR operation is performed on the collected data in order to prevent the sending of the same data sensed by the nodes close to each other. Simulation results show that our proposed protocols are more energy-efficient than the conventional LEACH protocol.
