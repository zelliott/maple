The following study attempts to demonstrate that traditional classifications of OECD countries according to the health condition of their citizens, based on classifications of life expectancy and infant mortality, can lead to substantial normative errors if we assume that economic agents are rational. In particular, classifications of life expectancy and infant mortality can cause a great deal of information loss, and do not allow a precise idea of typical inequalities in certain countries. This study begins with Meyer's method of classification--which allows us to organise different distributions on the basis of risk aversion of agents. This means that countries can be classified as offering a distribution superior to others in regards to the life duration they offer their citizens.
