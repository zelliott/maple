Chronic diseases are a significant burden on western healthcare systems and national economies. It has been suggested that automated disease management for chronic disease, like diabetes mellitus (DM), improves the quality of care and reduces inappropriate utilization of diagnostic and therapeutic measures. We have designed a comprehensive DM Disease Management system for the Negev region in southern Israel. This system takes advantage of currently used clinical and administrative information systems. Algorithms for DM disease management have been created based on existing and accepted Israeli guidelines. All data fields and tables in the source information systems have been analyzed, and interfaces for periodic data loads from these systems have been specified. Based on this data, four subsets of decision support algorithms have been developed. The system generates alerts in these domains to multiple end users. We plan to use the products of this information system analysis and disease management specification in the actual development process of such a system shortly.
