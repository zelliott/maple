Total mortality decreased by 2.5 times in the wards for intensive care of the newborns in the Tushino Pediatric Hospital in 1996 and is now 7.6%. Such results are due to a complex of measures, one such measure being the development and introduction of an algorithm for the diagnosis and treatment of newborns hospitalized in intensive care wards. The algorithm facilitates the work of the staff, helps earlier diagnose a disease, and, hence, carry out timely scientifically based therapy.
