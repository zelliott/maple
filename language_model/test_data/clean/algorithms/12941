Impedance matched and low loss transmission lines are essential for optimal energy delivery through an integrated optical or plasmonic nanocircuit. A novel method for the measurement of the attenuation and propagation constants of an antenna-coupled coplanar strip (CPS) transmission line is demonstrated at 28.3 THz using scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy. Reflection of the propagating optical wave upon an open-circuit or short-circuit load at the terminal of the CPS provides a standing voltage wave, which is mapped through the associated surface-normal E(z) electric near-field component at the metal-air interface. By fitting the analytical standing wave expression to the near-field data, the transmission line properties are determined. Full-wave models and measured results are presented and are in excellent agreement.
