Anxiety disorders are common disorders associated with marked impairment and reduced quality of life. In the general practitioner's office as well as in the specialist's consultation, patients with anxiety disorders frequently present primarily somatic complaints. Many patients run through numerous checkups prior to be referred to psychiatric treatment. Some basic aspects can help to earlier identify patients suffering from anxiety disorders and to initiate sufficient therapy. With evidence-based treatment with cognitive-behavioral therapy and adequate psychopharmacotherapy, many patients can achieve complete remission of symptoms. Initial treatment can comprise specific psycho-education as well as first-line psychopharmacological treatment with e.g. SSRI.
