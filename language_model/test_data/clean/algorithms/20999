A sedation strategy aimed at minimizing alteration of consciousness once comfort, analgesia and adaptation to the ventilator have been ensured is feasible in critically-ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation, even if, in patients with severe ARDS or ICH, the high dosages of sedatives and analgesics transiently required to provide perfect adaptation to the ventilator often preclude preservation of consciousness. The main components of a sedation algorithm include a clear objective of sedation-analgesia, regular assessments of patient status using validated clinical tools and a precise yet simple dosage adaptation schedule. Development and implementation of a sedation algorithm requires a multidisciplinary approach and an important input from both physicians and nurses. However, several methodologically-correct interventional studies have shown that using an algorithm to administrate sedatives and analgesics results in a significant reduction of MV duration, reaching 50% in some studies. This might translate into a real benefit for the patient point of view provided that preserving patient's comfort remains a constant concern for the caregivers. There is no reliable evidence to date to use propofol rather than midazolam as a sedative agent. Indeed, the way the sedative drug is used, as part of a sedation algorithm, is very likely more important than the selection of the drug itself. Analgesia-based sedation, promoting the use of morphinics alone before the adjunction of hypnotics, represents a new alternative to the traditional combined administration of hypnotics and morphinics. However data on the impact of analgesia-based sedation on patients' outcomes remain sparse to date.
