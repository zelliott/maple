An intelligent Li Ion battery management (ILBM) system was developed based on a digital signal processor (DSP). Instead of using relatively complicated hardware charging control, a DSP algorithm was used, and favorable characteristics in volume, mass, and temperature increase of the implantable battery were achieved. In vitro tests were performed to evaluate the DSP based algorithm for Li Ion charging control (24 V dc motor input power 16 W, 5 L/min, 100 mmHg afterload). In this article, the first improvement was volume reduction using a Li Ion battery (3.6 V/Cell, 900 mA, seven cells: 25.2 V, 22.7 W). Its volume and mass were decreased by 40% and 50% respectively (40*55*75 mm, 189 g), compared to previously reported results, with total energy capacity increased by 110% (more than 60 min vs 25 min run time in the other battery). The second improvement includes the ILBM, which can control the performance detection for each unit cell and has a low temperature rise. The ILBM's unit cell energy detection was important because the low performance of one cell dropped to 50% of the total performance along with a 20% increase in surface temperature. All electronics for a transcutaneous energy transmission (TET), battery, and telemetry were finalized for hybridization and used for total artificial heat (TAH) implantation.
