Simulated room impulse responses have been proven to be both useful and indispensable for comprehensive testing of acoustic signal processing algorithms while controlling parameters such as the reverberation time, room dimensions, and source-array distance. In this work, a method is proposed for simulating the room impulse responses between a sound source and the microphones positioned on a spherical array. The method takes into account specular reflections of the source by employing the well-known image method, and scattering from the rigid sphere by employing spherical harmonic decomposition. Pseudocode for the proposed method is provided, taking into account various optimizations to reduce the computational complexity. The magnitude and phase errors that result from the finite order spherical harmonic decomposition are analyzed and general guidelines for the order selection are provided. Three examples are presented: an analysis of a diffuse reverberant sound field, a study of binaural cues in the presence of reverberation, and an illustration of the algorithm's use as a mouth simulator.
