Computer vision techniques have been developed for quantitative analysis of size and shape changes in cells frozen on a cryomicroscope. The analysis is based on implementation of standard serial edge detection algorithms in conjunction with a shape transform to isolate individual cells in complex scenes which may include adjacent and overlying ice crystals. In the present study the sensitivity of the automated analysis procedure is evaluated for images obtained by various microscope optical systems for progressive degrees of subject blurring by defocusing. Size measurements in calibration trials for freezing latex spheres with extracellular ice in the field of view were least sensitive for bright field images, although the most consistent data was obtained by differential interference contrast microscopy. In all cases phase contrast images produced the least accurate data. An example analysis is presented for the freezing of pancreas beta-cells.
