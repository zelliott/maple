Feruloylated diacylglycerol (FDAG) was synthesized using a selective lipase-catalyzed the transesterification between ethyl ferulate and triolein. To optimize the reaction conversion and purity of FDAG, dual response surface was applied to determine the effects of five-level-five-factors and their reciprocal interactions on product synthesis. A total of 32 individual experiments were performed to study reaction temperature, reaction time, substrate molar ratio, enzyme loading, and water activity. The highest reaction conversion and selectivity towards FDAG were 73.9% and 92.3%, respectively, at 55 degrees C, reaction time 5.3 day, enzyme loading 30.4 mg/ml, water activity 0.08, and a substrate molar ratio of 3.7. Moreover, predicted values showed good validation with the experimental values when experiments corresponding to selected points on the contour plots were carried out.
