Many women suffer from pelvic pain, and a great many visit their family doctor for diagnosis and treatment. Two common causes are primary dysmenorrhea and endometriosis. Primary dysmenorrhea is best treated by prostaglandin inhibition from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2)-specific inhibitors. Oral contraceptives can be added to improve pain control. Endometriosis can be treated with NSAIDs and COX-2-specific inhibitors as well but can also be treated with hormonal manipulation or surgery. Empiric treatment for endometriosis in selected patients is now accepted, making the disorder easier for family physicians to manage.
