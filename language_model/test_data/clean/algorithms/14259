The pulmonary gangrene is rare and serious disease. Our experience is based on the treatment of the 2 patients with pulmonary gangrene during the last twenty years. The first and lifesaving step in the treatment of sepsis is the early removal of the necrotic tissue. Next surgery succeeds usually after one week after initial treatment. Surgical treatment continues step by step, we do not advise providing of a major anatomical resection in the initial stage of the disease. This policy is effective in the treatment of this serious disease.
