Most of the sequences determined in current genome sequencing projects remain at least partially unannotated. The available software for DNA sequence analysis is usually limited to the prediction of individual elements (level 1 methods), but does not assess the context of different motifs. However, the functionality of biological units like promoters depends on the correct spatial organization of multiple individual elements.

Here, we present a second-level software package called GenomeInspector [[http:@www.gsf.de/biodv/genomeinspector.html ]], for further analysis of results obtained with level 1 methods (e.g. MatInspector [[http:@www.gsf.de/biodv/matinspector.html ]] or ConsInspector [[http:@www.gsf.de/biodv/consinspector.html++ +]]). One of the main features of this modular program is its ability to assess distance correlations between large sets of sequence elements which can be used for the identification and definition of basic patterns of functional units. The program provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface with direct comprehensive display of all results for megabase sequences. Sequence elements showing spatial correlations can be easily extracted and traced back to the nucleotide sequence with the program. GenomeInspector identified promoters of glycolytic enzymes in yeast [[http:@www.mips.biochem.mpg.de/mips/yeast/]] as members of a subgroup with unusual location of an ABF1 site. Solely on the basis of distance correlation analysis, the program correctly selected those transcription factors within these promoters already known to be involved in the regulation of glycolytic enzymes, demonstrating the power of this method.
