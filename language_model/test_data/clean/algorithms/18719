The article is devoted to incident investigation, specifically to one of its aspects: the satisfactory identification of root causes. Management Oversight and Risk Tree (MORT) technique is exploited as a tool that helps to fulfill the task. However, since the application of traditional MORT diagrams was not considered satisfactory, a new software tool MORT WorkSheet was developed to make the MORT analysis easier. The article explains what led to the development of the software tool, how the tool works, and what results it is able to provide. An incident example is used in the article that illustrates how the new tool is applied during the investigation and how the results of its application look. Final comparison shows how different the obtained results may be with support of the MORT WorkSheet from the results of conventional incident investigation.
