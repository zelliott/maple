Heckel plots are a suitable and valuable method for analysis of powder compaction with very small amounts of powder. The determination is based upon a non-linear transformation of compression data and thus the signal errors that might be introduced into the analysis might be enlarged and become critical. The method of determination of true density affects the results dramatically as does the accuracy of the powder height determination. The porosity should be corrected for compression of the solid fraction. The accuracy of the powder height detection is the most demanding parameter. The statements are proven by simulations based on real data and analytic calculation. According to these highly corrected Heckel plots, the shape of the plots during the compression phase gives the information about fragmentation and plasticity and additionally about the time dependency of the compression behaviour within one compression on an eccentric press.
