Changes in the density of NMDA (GluN) receptors in the neuronal membrane are critical for plasticity, whereas malfunction of precisely regulated GluN receptor activity may be involved in neurotoxicity. In cultured rat neocortical interneurons, we have studied the regulation of the surface density of GluN1, GluN2A and GluN2B subunits. Application of 5 μMol NMDA for 24 h followed by a washout period of 24 h decreased the response of GluN receptors for at least 2 days. The reduction was caused by a decrease in the surface density of GluN1/GluN2B subunits, whereas GluN2A subunits remained unaffected. Our data indicate that long but reversible low level activation of GluN receptors can cause long-term changes in their subunit composition in cultured interneurons.
