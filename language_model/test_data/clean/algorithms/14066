The linear free energy of solution (DeltaG) relationship (DeltaG=DeltaGo+zdeltaG) for compounds of different carbon atoms (z) in the same homologous series is expanded and modified to cover compounds with two different hydrocarbon side chains. The expanded equation is successfully used to predict the retention times (tR) of standard esters of long chain alcohols and fatty acids of different chain lengths in both isothermal and temperature-programmed gas chromatography (TPGC). Approximately 90% of the 125 predicted tR values have a difference of less than 1.00% from the actual tR and the highest difference is 1.26%. Two different temperature gradients in TPGC are tested. The expanded equation can be used to forecast the tR of TPGC with good accuracy. The highest difference is +/-1.40% and +/-1.00% for the temperature gradients of 2 degrees C and 4 degrees C/min, respectively. However, the increments in free energy per carbon atom (zdeltaG) of the alcohol and acid are approximately equal but have slightly different temperature sensitivities. Therefore, it is very difficult to separate esters of different acid and alcohol chain length but with the same total carbon numbers. Furthermore, the difference in temperature sensitivities for the acid and alcohol side chains renders them to be inversely eluted at different temperatures.
