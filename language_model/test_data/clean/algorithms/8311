The objectives of this study were to design and prospectively evaluate a strategy to assess geriatric urinary incontinence in primary care settings. A management plan for urinary incontinence was determined for 264 elderly incontinent patients (205 females and 59 males) based on a clinical evaluation, simple tests of lower urinary tract function, and several criteria for referral for further evaluation derived from the literature on incontinence. Of the 264 patients, 168 (64%) also consented to undergo a urologic and formal urodynamic evaluation. Half of these 168 patients met at least one criterion for referral for further evaluation. At least one-quarter of the patients who met one or more of the criteria were found not to require surgical intervention, and probably did not benefit from the urologic and urodynamic evaluation. Among 84 patients who did not meet any of the criteria for referral, the urologic and urodynamic evaluation changed the initial treatment plan in only 10 (12%). The risks associated with the treatment plan based on the clinical assessment in these patients were, however, relatively small. While further refinement and testing in larger numbers of incontinent patients are needed, the data presented document that a substantial proportion of elderly patients with a treatable and often ignored problem can be appropriately managed based on a relatively simple and inexpensive assessment, which can easily be carried out in primary care settings.
