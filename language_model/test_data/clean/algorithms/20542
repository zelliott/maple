The relationships between individual performance and lactate exchange and removal abilities were studies in 12 male rowers all subjected to three measurements on a rowing ergometer. An incremental exercise carried out to determine the maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and the corresponding maximal aerobic power (Pamax), a 2500-m all-out test where the mean work rate (P2500) represented the individual performance, and a 6-min 90% Pamax exercise designed to assess the lactate kinetics during the following 90 min passive recovery were performed. The lactate recovery curves were fitted to the bi-exponential time function: La(t) = La(O) + A1(1-e-gamma 1.t) + A2(1-e-gamma 2.t). The velocity constants gamma 1 and gamma 2 denote the lactate exchange and removal abilities, respectively. The mean value of P2500 sustained by the rowers was 376 +/- 41W (106 +/- 5% of Pamax (P2500%). P2500 was positively correlated with gamma 2 (P < 0.05). gamma 1 and gamma 2 explained 67% of the P2500 variance. P2500% was also correlated with gamma 2 (P < 0.01). These results suggest that a better performance on the rowing ergometer is associated with improved lactate exchange and removal abilities. Furthermore, the ability to row at high relative work rates was correlated with an increased lactate removal ability. Training-induced adaptations could explain the high gamma 1 and gamma 2 displayed by the present rowers.
