Ultrasound can be valuable in the assessment of salivary gland disease. This examination is simple, non-invasive and cost-effective. Few cases require the need for additional imaging modalities. The use of ultrasound can confirm a diagnosis that has been suggested by case history and findings. Evidence of a mass is an indication for fine-needle aspiration. This does not eliminate the need for histological follow-up.
