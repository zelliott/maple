The principles of tissue compensation in radiotherapy and the methods for their implementation on the GE RT/Plan computer are briefly described. The HEK Medizintechnik GmbH Medical Systems Tissue Compensator cutting device is described, along with the testing procedure adopted for its commissioning and quality assurance testing of the total system. The HEK machine hardware proved to be well engineered, but there were many deficiencies in the software supplied to interface it to the planning computer. Most errors were fatal to the program producing a compensator but a number of errors allowed the cutter to manufacture shapes which on close inspection turned out to be incorrect. These faults were traced to incorrect algorithms and/or incorrect software implementation. It is stressed that the software errors were entirely the responsibility of HEK and that the GE equipment and software were not deficient in any way. However, the experiences of the Adelaide group suggest that caution should be exercised when purchasing two pieces of interacting equipment from separate suppliers.
