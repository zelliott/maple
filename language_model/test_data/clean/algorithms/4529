Open reduction of developmental hip dysplasia by the medial approach is one of the effective surgical treatment methods during early childhood. Although surgical approaches, fixation and follow-up methods may vary, successful results can be obtained by the algorithm involving the posteromedial approach and arthrographic evaluation. The aim of open reduction by the medial approach should be to obtain TÃ¶nnis grade I arthrographic reduction of the dysplastic hip and to maintain it. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head is a potential complication of this method. Even though actual evaluation of this problem requires monitoring patients until maturity, it is essential that special attention be given to the most effective factors (minimal invasive surgical technique, correct reduction, and appropriate position for fixation) for preventing this complication.
