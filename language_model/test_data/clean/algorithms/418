Cone Beam Computed Tomography is a relatively new three-dimensional imaging technology, which has been specifically developed for imaging of the teeth and jaws. The aim of this paper is to acquaint the dental team with various forms of this technology and its potential applications. An understanding of the underlying principles will allow the users of this technology to tailor the imaging protocol to the patient's individual needs to achieve appropriate imaging at the lowest radiation dose.
