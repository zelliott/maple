To overcome speed of sound aberrations that negatively impact the acoustic focus in acousto-optic imaging, received photoacoustic signals are used to guide the formation of ultrasound wavefronts to compensate for acoustic inhomogeneities. Photoacoustic point sources composed of gold and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles are used to generate acoustic waves that acoustically probe the medium as they propagate to the detector. By utilizing cross-correlation techniques with the received photoacoustic signal, transmitted ultrasound wavefronts compensate for the aberration, allowing for optimized and configurable ultrasound transmission to targeted locations. It is demonstrated that utilizing a portable commercially available ultrasound system using customized software, photoacoustic guided ultrasound wavefront shaping for targeted acousto-optic imaging is robust in the presence of large, highly attenuating acoustic aberration.
