Experiments have been carried out in a draft tube fluidized bed bioreactor to study biodegradation of synthetic wastewater containing phenol. The microorganism employed in the study Psuedomonas putida has been immobilized on solid support particles. Studies have been carried out at different feed concentrations of phenol, air flow rates and feed flow rates. The mass transfer coefficient for phenol transfer from bulk phase to the surface of the biofilm on the solid particle has been estimated from observed experimental data using the conservation equations. The mass transfer coefficient was found to be in the range of 0.0726 x 10(-5) to 0.2012 x 10(-5) m s(-1). It was found to increase with increase in feed concentration, air flow rate and feed flow rate. A dimensionless correlation has been developed for the mass transfer coefficient in terms of Sherwood, Reynolds and Schmidt numbers, and the same has been compared with correlations available in literature.
