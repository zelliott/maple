In this review, we examine how far the increased understanding that we have of the events in excitation contraction can explain the effects of the oestrous cycle and sex hormones on uterine function. Observational studies of electrical and mechanical activity in the rat myometrium have shown a relative quiescence during pro-oestrous, with little propagation of any electrical events. Thus, uterine activity can be said to approximately inversely reflect plasma 17beta-oestradiol concentrations. We show that Ca(2+) signalling and mechanical activity are greatest in metoestrous and dioestrous compared to pro-oestrous and oestrous. These data are discussed in terms of hormonal effects on Ca(2+) and K(+) channels. Finally, the influence of sex hormones on lipid rafts and caveolae are considered and discussed in relation to recent findings on their role in uterine signalling and contractility, and cholesterol levels and obesity.
