Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at increased risk of mortality compared with the general population. Evidence suggests that this increased mortality can largely be attributed to increased cardiovascular (CV) death. In a prospective study, 34 patients with RA were compared with age- and sex-matched controls.

We found a lower C-HDL, apolipoprotein A1 and B in patients with RA. However, CT/C-HDL and C-LDL/C-HDL were significantly higher than control patients. The intima-media thickness was significantly higher in patients with RA (0.759 mm vs 0.558 mm; P<0.001).

Increased attention to cardiovascular risk in RA will be necessary to reduce the excess CV mortality and morbidity in RA patients. It appears that the excess risk that is observed in the RA population can be explained, in part, by promotion of CV disease through increased systemic inflammation associated with RA.
