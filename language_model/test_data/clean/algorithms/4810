The momentum distribution of protons in the hydration shell of a globular protein has been measured through deep inelastic neutron scattering at 180 and 290 K, below and above the crossover temperature Tc=1.23Tg, where Tg=219 K is the glass transition temperature. It is found that the mean kinetic energy of the water hydrogens shows no temperature dependence, but the measurements are accurate enough to indicate a sensible change of momentum distribution and effective potential felt by protons, compatible with the transition from a single to a double potential well. This could support the presence of tunneling effects even at room temperature, playing an important role in biological function.
