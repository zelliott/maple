Nutrition and metabolic support of acutely and chronically ill patients is an emerging branch of medicine that has direct applicability to wound healing. The occurrence of pressure ulcers is associated with malnutrition, as well as specific micronutrient deficiencies. A comprehensive approach is reviewed that involves nutritional assessment, selection of an appropriate route for nutrition support (enteral versus parenteral), prioritizing nitrogen retention over energy balance in stressed patients, micronutrient management, and incorporation of specialized nutritional pharmacologic interventions.
