Neuraminidase (NA) is a critical enzyme of the influenza virus and many inhibitors targeting to this enzyme are quite efficient and encouraging as anti-influenza agents. In this paper the binding model of five series of inhibitors to NA was examined using molecular simulation method. The resulted conformation and orientation of the compounds were directly put into CoMSIA study. The most significant amino acid residues at binding sites and the requirement for features of substituents were applied to direct design of new inhibitors. The robust QSAR model and its three-dimensional contour map provided guidelines to building novel compounds with new scaffold and for structural optimization of current molecules.
