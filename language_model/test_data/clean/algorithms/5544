In this paper a new chromatographic response function (CRF) is designed and proposed for utilization in the optimization strategies. The function capability to represent the overall quality of a experimentally obtained chromatograms was compared to the other two objective functions and proved to give more accurate and reliable results. The new CRF has improved concept of separation and time term estimation. It reflects all important defects of the chromatogram such as the appearance of asymmetrical or overlapping peaks and prolonged elution time and allows the appropriate weighting of each of them. The LC separation of raloxifene and its four impurities was evaluated through the central composite design experimental plan choosing the new CRF to be the only output of the system. The function demonstrated the ability to judge the impact of the complex interactions of the selected chromatographic parameters (acetonitrile content in the mobile phase, sodium dodecyl sulfate concentration in the water phase, pH of the mobile phase and column temperature) on the mixture behavior and led to the determination of the optimal separation conditions. The newly developed CRF proved to have the advanced performances and it presents the important step forward in the optimization of the chromatographic separation.
