Template directed Layer-by-layer (LbL) technology recently moved into the center of scientific attention, particularly as a versatile tool for bioencapsulation purposes. Its major advantages can be found in the striking simplicity of tuning wall properties and the complete control over layer thickness and permeability. Yet, for the most commonly applied pair of polyelectrolytes, poly(allylamine) hydrochloride (PAH) and poly(styrene sulfonate) sodium salt (PSS), the mandatory control of the successful deposition on plane and colloidal surfaces is currently only attainable by means of sophisticated and expensive equipment. Here we describe an alternative quantification method based on a simple colorimetric assay using the Bradford reagent, a cost-effective commercially available dye, and standard laboratory technical devices. The binding of the dye to PSS causes a distinct shift of the absorption maximum from 465 to 680 nm, providing a method for spectral quantification of submicrogram amounts of dissolved PSS during LbL coating with significant accuracy and excellent reproducibility. The method was successfully employed to quantify accurate polyelectrolyte loadings on several particles that have a general importance as LbL templates. Thus, this method can be recommended as standard laboratory technique for control of LbL encapsulation and will considerably broaden the applicability of this promising technology in biotechnology.
