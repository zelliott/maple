To develop a computerized algorithm to quantify fetal heart rate (FHR) variability and compare it to perinatologists' interpretation of FHR variability.

FHR variability was calculated using data from 30 women who had a fetal scalp electrode placed for a clinical indication, and compared to the assessment of FHR variability from four perinatologists who interpreted paper tracings of the same data. Inter-rater reliability was calculated and receiver-operator curve analysis was done.

Correlation between the computer algorithm's assessment of variability and the perinatologists' assessment (0.27-0.68) was similar to the inter-rater reliability between perinatologists (0.33-0.72).

A computer-based algorithm can assess FHR variability as well as expert clinicians.
