The DOSY Toolbox is a free programme for processing PFG NMR diffusion data (sometimes loosely referred to as DOSY data), distributed under the GNU General Public License. NMR data from three major manufacturers can be imported and all processing is done in a user-friendly graphical user interface. The Toolbox is completely free-standing in the sense that all necessary basic processing of NMR data (e.g., Fourier transformation and phasing) is catered for within the programme, as well as a number of methods specific to DOSY data (e.g., DOSY and SCORE). The programme is written in MATLAB and as such can be run on any platform, but can also run independent of MATLAB in a free-standing compiled version for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
