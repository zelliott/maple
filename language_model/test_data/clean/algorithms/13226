We use optical interferometry to capture coherent surface acoustic waves for elastographic imaging. An inverse method is employed to convert multi-frequency data into an elastic depth profile. Using this method, we image elastic properties over a 55 mm range with <5 mm resolution. For relevance to breast cancer detection, we employ a tissue phantom with a tumor-like inclusion. Holographic elastography is also shown to be well-behaved in ex vivo tissue, revealing the subsurface position of a bone. Because digital holography can assess waves over a wide surface area, this constitutes a flexible new platform for large volume and non-invasive elastography.
