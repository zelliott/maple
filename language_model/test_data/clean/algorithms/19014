Positron emission tomography dynamic studies have been performed to quantify several biomedical functions. In a quantitative analysis of these studies, kinetic parameters were estimated by mathematical methods, such as a nonlinear least-squares algorithm with compartmental model and graphical analysis. In this estimation, the uncertainty in the estimated kinetic parameters depends on the signal-to-noise ratio and quantitative analysis method. This review describes the reliability of parameter estimates for various analysis methods in reversible and irreversible models.
