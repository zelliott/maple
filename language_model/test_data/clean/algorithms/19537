Parameter estimation is a major challenge for mathematical modelling of biological systems. Given the uncertainties associated with model parameters, it is important to understand how sensitive the model output is to variations in parameter values. A local sensitivity analysis determines the model sensitivity to parameter variations over a localised region around the nominal parameter values, whereas a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) investigates the sensitivity over the entire parameter space. Using a T-cell receptor-activated Erk-MAPK signalling pathway model as an example, the authors present a comparative study of a variety of different sensitivity analysis techniques. These techniques include: local sensitivity analysis, existing GSA methods of partial rank correlation coefficient, Sobol's, extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test, as well as a weighted average of local sensitivities and a new GSA method to extract global parameter sensitivities from a parameter identification routine. Results of this study revealed critical reactions in the signalling pathway and their impact on the signalling dynamics and provided insights into embedded regulatory mechanisms such as feedback loops in the pathway. From this study, a recommendation emerges for a general sensitivity analysis strategy to efficiently and reliably infer quantitative, dynamic as well as topological properties from systems biology models.
