The aim of the study was to realize a mathematical model of insulin-glucose relationship in type I diabetes and test its effectiveness for the design of control algorithms in external artificial pancreas. A new mathematical model, divided into glucose and insulin sub-models, was developed from the so-called "minimal model". The key feature is the representation of insulin sensitivity so as to permit the personalisation of the parameters. Real-time applications are based on an insulin standardised model. Clinical data were used to estimate model parameters. Root mean square error between simulated and real blood glucose profiles (G(rms)) was used to evaluate system efficacy. Results from parameter estimation and insulin standardisation showed a good capability of the model to identify individual characteristics. Simulation results with a G(rms) 1.30 mmol/l in the worst case testified the capacity of the model to accurately represent glucose-insulin relationship in type 1 diabetes allowing self tuning in real time.
