We report a case of a 49-year-old woman from the Philippines, who has been living for many years in Switzerland, with chronic unilateral swelling of the cervical lymphnodes. After the serological exclusion of several microorganisms, a fine needle aspiration was performed without conclusive result. However, patient history and a strongly positive PPD skin test were highly suspicious for tuberculous lymphadenitis, which was finally confirmed by lymphnode biopsy on histopathological and cultural workup. Therefore tuberculostatic treatment was initiated for 6 months.
