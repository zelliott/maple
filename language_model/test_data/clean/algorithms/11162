Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is a common condition in urological outpatients, and is often improperly treated for its multifactorial etiology and non-specific clinical phenotype. Doctor Shoskes proposed a clinical phenotype system for CP/CPPS--the UPOINT system, which is a new diagnostic/therapeutic algorithm addressing 6 CP/CPPS phenotypic domains, including the urinary, psychosocial, organ specific, infection, neurological/systemic and muscle tenderness domains. Under the guidance of UPOINT, doctors can give a multimodal therapy for patients with CP/CPPS according to its clinical phenotype, and several clinical studies have demonstrated obvious clinical benefit from the UPOINT-based therapy.
