An alarm algorithm was developed to monitor the ventilator on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration space station. The algorithm automatically identifies and interprets critical events so that an untrained user can manage the mechanical ventilation of a critically injured crew member. The algorithm was tested in two healthy volunteers by simulating 260 critical events in each volunteer while the volunteer breathed via the ventilator. Thirteen critical events were induced eight times in random order, for the five different modes of ventilation. These events included various ventilator tubing disconnects, leaks, and occlusions, as well as power and gas supply failures. The algorithm identified the critical events and generated alarms in response to 99.2% (516 of 520, total) of the events. The alarm textual messages were correct 98% (505 of 516 messages) of the time. The alarm algorithm is an improvement over current alarms found on most ventilators because its alarm messages specifically identify failures in the patient breathing circuit or ventilator. The system may improve patient care by helping critical care personnel respond more rapidly and correctly to critical events.
