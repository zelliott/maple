The hyperbolic cosine function is shown to be an accurate representation of the form of the mandibular anterior teeth from the canine/first premolar contact on one side around the perimeter to the opposite side (r = 0.951). On the basis of this mathematical function, the changes in canine width, anterior segment depth, arch perimeter, and their related incisor angular alterations are forecastable. This knowledge will allow the clinician to predict the effects on various aspects of the anterior segment arch form as one or more of these variables are altered without resorting to trial and error or performing a wax-up. For example, the clinician can predict the change in the anterior segment arch depth and incisor angulation that would occur with alterations in canine width.
