The first problem to face in prolonged fever is its etiologic diagnosis. Its incidence varies between 0,5 to 3% of all paediatric hospital-stay. Precise diagnosis need an extensive questionnary, complete physical examination and an algorithm of complementary exams.

To precise the epidemiologic profile and causes of prolonged fever in a children.

Retrospective review of 67 children between two and 15 years old admitted in the general paediatrics department of the Fattouma Bourguiba university hospital in Monastir (Tunisia), for prolonged fever between 1(st) January 1988 and 31 December 1998.

The incidence of prolonged fever was 1,02%. The mean age was seven years with female predominance. The mean fever duration was 30 days. Fever was isolated in 23,9% of cases. Fever was associated to rheumatic or respiratory signs in respectively 26,9% and 20,9% of cases. Hospital-stay was of 11 days in 50% of cases. Prominent causes were dominated by infectious diseases (56,7%) with predominance of localized infections, followed by inflammatory diseases (20,9%) with predominance of rheumatic fever and neoplasms (3%). Fever remained of unknown origin was seen in 19,4% of cases.

Prolonged fever is still dominated by infectious and inflammatory diseases and depend on local epidemiological particularities. In fact we noted in this study the relative high-frequency of visceral leishmaniasis, complicated pulmonary hydatic cyst and rheumatic fever. The diagnosis approach should be based on complementary exams of first and second stage because of their high number and cost. Prognosis of fever of unknown origin is often favorable.
