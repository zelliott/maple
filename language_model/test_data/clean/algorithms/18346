A new idea of structure analysis in histopathology based upon first-order and third-order structures is presented. Networks formed by single cells and by tubulopapillary formations in adenomatous tissue were analyzed. The algorithm applied is based on the neighborhood conditions defined by O'Callaghan, using graph theory procedures. Twenty cases each of healthy colon mucosa, tubulovillous adenomas and highly to moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas of colon plus ten cases of mesotheliomas and ten cases of adenocarcinomas metastatic to the pleura were analyzed. Statistically significant differences were found in the cyclomatic number of neighboring elements. Classification of specimens of colon mucosa using discriminant analysis yielded correct results in 85% of the 20 cases. All ten cases of metastatic adenocarcinoma and nine of the ten cases of mesothelioma were also correctly classified by the same procedure. A trial of prospective diagnostic assistance in routine histology based upon these cases gave correct classification of three mesotheliomas and of two adenocarcinomas. The procedures are now being used successfully in the routine diagnosis of pleural epithelial/biphasic mesothelioma and of pleuritis carcinomatosa.
