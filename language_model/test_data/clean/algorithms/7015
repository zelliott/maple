The clinical condition was assessed in 44 patients with alveolar echinococcosis, using methods of mathematical analysis of 10 basic routine laboratory parameters reflecting protein-forming liver function and immune disturbances. The data were processed on a "NOVA-2" [correction of "HOBA-2"] computer using Fortran software on taxonomy 7 classes of conditions were determined, which reflect the progressing severity of the pathological process and correspond to three stages of the disease: uncomplicated, complicated and terminal. A high clinical value of the method has been demonstrated for the evaluation of the patient's condition and determination of the treatment tactics as well as its importance for the creation of a clinical data bank in the invasion focus.
