Desmoid fibromatosis (also known as infantile or aggressive fibromatosis) is a rare soft tissue tumour that is occasionally seen in children. Although histologically benign, its growth pattern is highly aggressive often showing invasion of surrounding musculature and bone. Frequently found in cosmetically sensitive areas, complete excision can present a challenging problem. However, incomplete surgical excision is associated with high recurrence rates and although the disease responds to chemo and radiotherapy, both carry significant risks in young children. The management of four paediatric desmoid fibromatoses occurring in the midface is discussed. The recent and pertinent literature is comprehensively reviewed and an algorithm for the management of paediatric desmoid fibromatoses is proposed.
