In this work, a method is presented for the transformation of MEG recordings to a standard sensor position. For the case of an 148 channel magnetometer array, the algorithm was evaluated using simulations as well as phantom head recordings. It turned out that the method is very robust and yields accurate results regardless of the position of the field generator, even with large differences between original and standard (target) sensor positions and high noise. The method can be applied as a prerequisite for comparing or averaging recordings of different subjects or sessions.
