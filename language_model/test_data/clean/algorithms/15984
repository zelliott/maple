Morse code with an easy-to-operate, single switch input system has been shown to be an excellent communication adaptive device. Because maintaining a stable typing rate is not easy for the disabled, the automatic recognition of Morse code is difficult. Therefore, a suitable adaptive automatic recognition method is needed. This paper presents the application of a Least-Mean-Square algorithm to adaptive Morse code recognition for persons with impaired hand coordination and dexterity. Four processes are involved in this adaptive Morse code recognition method: space recognition, tone recognition, adaptive processing, and character recognition. Statistical analyses demonstrated that the proposed method results in a better recognition rate for the participants tested in comparison to other methods from the literature.
