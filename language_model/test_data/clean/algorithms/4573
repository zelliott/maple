The treatment of sternal wound infection still carries a high mortality. Treatment preferences range from more conservative treatments that do not include flaps, to more aggressive reconstructions using different types of flaps, and these could be resolved and standardised using a proper classification with a treatment algorithm. We propose modification of the existing classification, with different proposals for treatment, stressing the importance of the radicality of debridement, and report our results in 31 patients, 24 of whom were well satisfied. Eleven were left with some pain in the chest wall, and eight each with some muscular weakness and less than adequate cosmesis. We would also like to recommend the omental flap as the first choice for selected cases. With our selective approach we have achieved good functional and aesthetic results with satisfied patients.
