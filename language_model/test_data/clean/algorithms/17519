Homonuclear Hartmann-Hahn transfer is one of the most important building blocks in modern high-resolution NMR. It constitutes a very efficient transfer element for the assignment of proteins, nucleic acids, and oligosaccharides. Nevertheless, in macromolecules exceeding approximately 10 kDa TOCSY-experiments can show decreasing sensitivity due to fast transverse relaxation processes that are active during the mixing periods. In this article we propose the MOCCA-XY16 multiple pulse sequence, originally developed for efficient TOCSY transfer through residual dipolar couplings, as a homonuclear Hartmann-Hahn sequence with improved relaxation properties. A theoretical analysis of the coherence transfer via scalar couplings and its relaxation behavior as well as experimental transfer curves for MOCCA-XY16 relative to the well-characterized DIPSI-2 multiple pulse sequence are given.
