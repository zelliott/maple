The purpose of this study is to discover potential biomarkers in serum for the detection of small cell lung cancer (SCLC).

74 serum samples including 30 from SCLC patients and 44 from healthy controls were analyzed using ClinProt system combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight masss spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). ClinProt software and genetic algorithm analysis selected a panel of serum markers that most efficiently predicted which patients had SCLC.

The diagnostic pattern combined with 5 potential biomarkers could differentiate SCLC patients from healthy persons, with a sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 97.73%. Remarkably, 88.89% of stage I/II patients were accurately assigned to SCLC.

Anchorchip-time-of-flight spectrometry technology will provide a highly accurate approach for discovering new biomarkers for the detection of SCLC.
