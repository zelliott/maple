The repair of hair-occluded information is one of the key problems for the precise segmentation and analysis of the skin malignant melanoma image with hairs. Aimed at dermoscopy images of pigmented skin lesions, an unsupervised repair algorithm for the hair-occluded information is proposed in this paper. This algorithm includes three steps: first, the melanoma image with hairs are enhanced by morphologic closing-based top-hat operator and then segmented through statistic threshold; second, the hairs are extracted based on the elongate of connected region; third, the hair-occluded information is repaired by the PDE-based image inpainting. As a matter of fact, with the morphologic closing-based top-hat operator both strong and weak hairs can be enhanced simultaneously, and the elongate state of band-like connected region can be correctly described by the elongate function proposed in this paper so as to measure the hair effectively. Therefore, the unsupervised repair problem of the hair-occluded information can be resolved very well through combining the hair extracting with the image inpainting technology. The experiment results show that the repaired images can satisfy the requirement of medical diagnosis by the proposed algorithm and the segmentation veracity is effectively improved after repairing the hair-occluded information.
