A five-degree visual field with two programs of different testing field size was studied, and the visual fields between them were compared.

Observational study.

Forty-six patients with open-angle glaucoma were tested by Humphrey field analyzer (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc, Dublin, California, USA) programs 30-2 full threshold and 10-2 full threshold. Forty reliable results with both programs were analyzed.

Sensitivity of the same position within a five-degree field was significantly higher with the 10-2 program than with the 30-2 program. Higher sensitivity within a five-degree field with the 10-2 program significantly correlated with that with the 30-2 program.

Visual field determined by automated perimetry was influenced by testing field size.
