Acetone and hexane mixtures covering the whole solubility range were studied by Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflectance spectroscopy. Factor analysis separates the spectra into four principal factor spectra and multiplying factors. Those containing negative factors are abstract, but the spectra are real. A statistical distribution model of the molecules in the solutions rendered the factors real. From these we define the intermediate species that occur in a 1:2 molar ratio of acetone in hexane, present principally in the low acetone concentration regions, and in a 2:1 molar ratio of acetone in hexane, present principally in the higher acetone concentration region. However, except at the concentration range limits where only pure acetone and pure hexane are present, the four species are present over the whole solubility range. The IR spectra of the species indicated very little displacement of the CH stretch bands, HCH deformation bands, and CC stretch bands, although there are some small intensity variations. Most of the modifications are observed on the acetone C=O stretch band. From the gas phase position, a strong bathochromic shift of 19 cm(-1) of the pure liquid is assigned to dipole-dipole interactions. In the 2:1 groupings, the shift that decreases to 15 cm(-1) is due to the diminished dipole-dipole interactions. In the 1:2 groupings, no dipole-dipole interaction can exist, and the bathochromic displacement of 9 cm(-1) is attributed to van der Waals interactions. In the one acetone to two hexanes grouping, no dipole-dipole interaction can exist, and the bathochromic displacement of 9 cm(-1) is attributed to van der Waals interactions. From the statistical distribution of the molecules, we determine that mixtures of hexane and acetone form a random organization with no preferred association or complex.
