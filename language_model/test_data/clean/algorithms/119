Although the utility of two-dimensional (2D) speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) to quantify left ventricular (LV) volume has been demonstrated, this methodology is limited by foreshortened views, geometric modelling, and the assumption that speckles can be tracked from frame to frame, despite their out of plane motion. To circumvent these limitations, a three-dimensional (3D) speckle tracking algorithm was recently developed. Our goal was to evaluate the accuracy of the new 3D-STE side by side with 2D-STE using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) as a reference.

Apical two- and four-chamber views (A2C and A4C) and real-time 3D datasets (Toshiba Artida 4D System) obtained in 43 patients with a wide range of LV size and function were analysed to measure LV end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes (ESV and EDV) using 2D and 3D-STE techniques. Short-axis CMR images (Siemens 1.5T scanner) acquired on the same day were analysed to obtain ESV and EDV reference values using the method of disks approximation. Reproducibility of both STE techniques was assessed using repeated measurements. While 2D-STE correlated well with CMR (r: 0.72-0.88), it underestimated LV volumes with relatively large biases (10-30 mL) and wide limits of agreement (SD: 36-51 mL), with A2C-derived measurements being worse than A4C values. The 3D-STE measurements showed higher correlation with CMR (0.87-0.92), and importantly smaller biases (1-16 mL) and narrower limits of agreement (SD: 28-37 mL). In addition, 3D-STE showed lower inter- and intra-observer variability (11-14% and 12-13%), than 2D-STE (16-17% and 12-16%, respectively).

This is the first study to validate the new 3D-STE technique for LV volume measurements and demonstrate its superior accuracy and reproducibility over previously used 2D-STE technique.
