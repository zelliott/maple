Multislice computed tomography (MSCT) permits reliable imaging of not only the coronary artery lumen but also vessel wall. It is assumed that both lipid-rich plaques and those that display positive remodeling are more prone to rupture and erosion with subsequent coronary events. The purpose of this study was to assess the correlation between the characteristics of coronary arteries by MSCT and several measures of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk.

This study consisted of 424 consecutive participants who received MSCT and coronary angiography (CAG). We assessed coronary artery findings including coronary artery calcification (CAC), degree of remodeling and narrowing of lumen and characteristics including uric acid (UA) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). Statistical analyses were conducted for four subgroups classified by the presence of significant stenosis and positive remodeling.

Hs-CRP was 2.10+/-2.70mg/L in positive remodeling (+) and stenosis (+) group (PS), 1.05+/-0.97mg/L in positive remodeling (-) and stenosis (+) group (nPS), 0.94+/-0.88mg/L in positive remodeling (+) and stenosis (-) group (PnS) and 0.44+/-0.49mg/L in positive remodeling (-) and stenosis (-) group (nPnS). The results of logistic regression analysis showed that hs-CRP was higher in PS compared with the other groups (p<0.001) and higher in nPS and PnS compared with nPnS (p<0.05).

Regardless of significant stenosis, positive remodeling by MSCT correlates to the increase of hs-CRP.
