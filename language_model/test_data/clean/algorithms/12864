Computer models of biological systems grow more complex as computing power increase. Often these models are defined as differential equations and no analytical solutions exist. Numerical integration is used to approximate the solution; this can be computationally intensive, time consuming and be a large proportion of the total computer runtime. The performance of different integration methods depend on the mathematical properties of the differential equations system at hand. In this paper we investigate the possibility of runtime gains by calculating parts of or the whole differential equations system at given time intervals, outside of the differential equations solver. This approach was tested on nine models defined as differential equations with the goal to reduce runtime while maintaining model fit, based on the objective function value. The software used was NONMEM. In four models the computational runtime was successfully reduced (by 59-96%). The differences in parameter estimates, compared to using only the differential equations solver were less than 12% for all fixed effects parameters. For the variance parameters, estimates were within 10% for the majority of the parameters. Population and individual predictions were similar and the differences in OFV were between 1 and -14 units. When computational runtime seriously affects the usefulness of a model we suggest evaluating this approach for repetitive elements of model building and evaluation such as covariate inclusions or bootstraps.
