Sleep medicine is gaining more and more interest and importance both within medical research and clinical routine. The investigation of sleep and associated disorders requires the overnight acquisition of a huge amount of biosignal data derived from various sensors (polysomnographic recording) as well as consecutive time-consuming manual analysis (polysomnographic analysis). Therefore, the development of automatic analysis systems has become a major focus in sleep research in the recent years, resulting in the development of algorithms for the analysis of different biosignals (EEG, ECG, EMG, breathing signals). In this study, an open source algorithm published by Hamilton et al. was used for ECG analysis, whereas the analysis of breathing signals was done using an algorithm published by Clark et al. using also variations of the intra-thoracic pressure for the detection of breathing disorders. The electromyogram (EMG) analysis was done with a self-made algorithm, whereas EEG analyses are currently under development, using both frequency analysis modules and pattern recognition procedures. Although all these algorithms have proved to be quite useful, their validity and reliability still needs to be verified in future studies. Taking into account that during a standard polysomnographic recording data from approximately 8 hours of sleep are collected, it is imaginable that processing this amount of data by the described algorithms very often exceeds the calculating capacity of current standard computers. Using Grid technology, this limitation can be transcended by splitting biosignal data and distributing it to several analysis computers. Therefore, Grid based automatic analysis systems may improve the effectiveness of polysomnographic investigations and thereby diminish the costs for health care providers.
