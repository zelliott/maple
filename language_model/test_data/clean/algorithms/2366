The acoustic quantification technique for on-line detection of endocardial boundaries currently provides continuous left ventricular area or volume signals and beat-to-beat ejection fraction. However, the distortion of individual waveforms by noise results in a wide beat-to-beat variability in these parameters. We developed an automated algorithm for the evaluation of left ventricular function by averaging acoustic quantification signals. End-diastolic and end-systolic area, stroke area, and fractional area change are measured directly from the average waveform. Peak ejection and peak filling rates and time to peak filling rate are obtained from its time derivative. Area signals obtained from eight normal subjects were used to evaluate the performance of this algorithm. Parameters of left ventricular function obtained with the automated algorithm were highly consistent and in excellent agreement with those obtained by repeated manual operator-dependent selections. This algorithm provides a fast and easy method for noise reduction in acoustic quantification signals, which significantly improves the noninvasive assessment of left ventricular function.
