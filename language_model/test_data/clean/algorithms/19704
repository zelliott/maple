In this paper, the basic principal or rational of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which develops rapidly in the field of functional magnetic resonance imaging study, is introduced. And how to reconstruct the imaging of neuronal fiber tracts in white matter with the data of DTI is described. The technique of tractography, its advantages and disadvantages are analyzed. Finally, the limitations and further applications of neuronal fiber tracts visualization are discussed.
