A common cause for damage to the neonatal brain is a shortage in the oxygen supply to the brain or asphyxia. Neonatal seizures are the most frequent manifestation of neonatal neurologic disorders. Multichannel EEG recordings allow topographic localization of seizure foci.

We want to objectively determine the spatial distribution of the seizure on the scalp, the location in time and order the dominant sources in the brain based on their strength.

In this paper we combine a method based on higher order CP-decomposition with subsequent singular value decomposition (SVD).

We illustrate the abilities of the method on simulated as well as on real neonatal seizure EEG.

The proposed method provides reliable time and spatial information about the seizure, gives a clear overview of what is going on in the EEG and allows easy interpretation.
