Contemporary template-based modeling techniques allow applications of modeling methods to vast biological problems. However, they tend to fail to provide accurate structures for less-conserved local regions in sequence even when the overall structure can be modeled reliably. We call these regions unreliable local regions (ULRs). Accurate modeling of ULRs is of enormous value because they are frequently involved in functional specificity. In this article, we introduce a new method for modeling ULRs in template-based models by employing a sophisticated loop modeling technique. Combined with our previous study on protein termini, the method is applicable to refinement of both loop and terminus ULRs. A large-scale test carried out in a blind fashion in CASP9 (the 9th Critical Assessment of techniques for protein structure prediction) shows that ULR structures are improved over initial template-based models by refinement in more than 70% of the successfully detected ULRs. It is also notable that successful modeling of several long ULRs over 12 residues is achieved. Overall, the current results show that a careful application of loop and terminus modeling can be a promising tool for model refinement in template-based modeling.
