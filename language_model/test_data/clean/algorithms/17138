DNA synthesis with various deoxyribo homo- and heterooligoprimers in the presence of complementary templates was investigated. The lengthening of d(pN)n, primers (n = 1-10) by a unit resulted in an increase of the primer affinity and a maximal rate of polymerization. The coefficient of the affinity enhancement of primers due to formation of one hydrogen bond between primer and template was found to be 1.35. The dependence of the primer affinity and polymerization rate on template-primer structure in solution was analyzed and the objective laws of the changes of the KM and Vmax values were revealed.
