Under specific quasi-static pressure conditions during the Valsalva manoeuvre, high-speed digital video pictures of eardrum displacements were recorded using an endoscope and a Kodak Image Ektapro 1000 Motion Analyzer. A new type of data interface enabled the complete videoclip to be saved and processed digitally, and, with special mathematical algorithms, it is possible to generate three-dimensional computer animations of eardrum movements under quasi-static pressure. The present study describes patterns of eardrum movements under static pressure changes (Valsalva manoeuvre). These patterns were consistent with the results of finite-element simulations of highly similar eardrum displacements reported by other workers.
