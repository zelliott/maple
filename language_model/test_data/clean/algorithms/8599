The software tools required for postprocessing of magnetic resonance (MR) angiograms include the following functions: data handling, image visualization, and vascular analysis. A custom postprocessing software called Magnetic Resonance Angiography Computer Assisted Analysis (MARACAS) has been developed. This software combines the most commonly used three-dimensional visualization techniques with image processing methods for analysis of vascular morphology on MR angiograms. The main contributions of MARACAS are (a) implementation of a fast method for stenosis quantification on three-dimensional MR angiograms, which is clinically applicable in a personal computer-based system; and (b) portability to the most widespread platforms. The quantification is performed in three steps: extraction of the vessel centerline, detection of vessel boundaries in planes locally orthogonal to the centerline, and calculation of stenosis parameters on the basis of the resulting contours. Qualitative results from application of the method to data from patients showed that the vessel centerline correctly tracked the vessel path and that contours were correctly estimated. Quantitative results obtained from images of phantoms showed that the computation of stenosis severity was accurate.
