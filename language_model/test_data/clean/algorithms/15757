Derangements in the tumor suppressor gene PTEN and the mismatch-repair genes, hMLH1, hMSH2, and hMSH6, have an important role in endometrial carcinogenesis. The purpose of this study was to assess immunohistochemically the pattern of protein expression for these genes in 68 patients with endometrial hyperplasia and to determine the relation of protein expression to cancer development or coexistence of cancers. Loss of expression of these genes also was evaluated as potential tumor markers for clinical use. PTEN and hMLH1 both showed loss of expression in 55% of specimens from 18 patients with subsequent or coexisting carcinoma. D&C specimens from 50 patients who did not develop cancer (10 patients underwent hysterectomy within 2 years; 40 had no hysterectomy; follow-up of 10-20 years), expressed protein at a much higher frequency (92% for PTEN and 98% for hMLH1). The parameter with the strongest independent relation to subsequent or coexisting carcinoma in a stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis was hMLH1. Evaluation of the investigated factors as prognostic markers for tumor development showed high specificity (92% for PTEN, 98% for MLH1) at the expense of sensitivity (56% for PTEN, 56% for MLH1). The results were compared with the results of the computerized image analysis algorithm, the D-score.
