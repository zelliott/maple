To describe the data-based development of a short dietary assessment instrument, a 16-item screener; and to evaluate the performance of the screener, comparing its performance with a complete 120-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) in assessing percentage energy from fat intake.

A subsample (n=404) of participants in the National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study, who had completed an FFQ and two 24-hour dietary recalls, also completed the fat screener. Percentage energy from fat from the screener and from the FFQ were compared with estimated true usual intake using a measurement error model.

For men, the mean percentage energy from fat estimates for the different methods were: recalls, 30.1%, screener, 29.9%; FFQ, 30.4%. For women, the results were: recalls, 31.3%, screener, 28.4%, FFQ, 30.0%. Estimated correlations between true intake and screener were 0.64 and 0.58 for men and women, respectively, and between true intake and FFQ were 0.67 for men and 0.72 for women. Estimated attenuation coefficients for the screener were 1.29 (men) and 0.98 (women) and for the FFQ were 0.56 (men) and 0.57 (women).

The percentage energy from fat screener, when used in conjunction with external reference data, may be useful to compare mean intakes of fat for different population subgroups, and to examine relationships between fat intake and other factors.
