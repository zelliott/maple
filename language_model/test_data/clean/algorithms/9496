A new method to determine the surface permeability of nanoporous particles is proposed. It is based on the comparison of experimental data on tracer exchange and intracrystalline molecular mean square displacements as obtained by the PFG NMR tracer desorption technique with the corresponding solutions of the diffusion equation via dynamical Monte Carlo simulations. The method is found to be particularly sensitive in the "intermediate" regime, when the influence of intracrystalline diffusion and surface resistances of the nanoporous crystal on molecular transport are comparable and the conventional method fails. As an example, the surface permeabilities of two samples of zeolite NaCaA with different crystal sizes are determined with methane, as a probe molecule, at room temperature.
