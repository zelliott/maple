A review is presented on the CE analysis of colloidal/nano particles. Topics discussed include the CE separation of polymeric, inorganic, microbial (i.e. viruses, bacteria, fungi, and whole cells), and sub-cellular particles (i.e. mitochondria and nuclei). Several of the encountered difficulties in analysis are presented as well as the methods employed to overcome them.
