Decision for stump improvement, shortening or reconstruction after finger mutilation is based on multiple factors. Some of them belong to the patient, age, psychological background, job and leisure activities and cosmetic expectation. Others belong to the injury, its mechanism and the anatomical lesions. Abstention, prostheses and rehabilitation are among the options. Conventional techniques are not to be forgotten as age remains an ultimate frontier in microsurgical reconstruction to obtain a good sensory result. Function and appearance are closely linked for a useful and a used hand.
