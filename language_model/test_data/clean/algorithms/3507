We briefly describe the ordered weighted average (OWA) operator. We discuss its role in decision making under uncertainty. We provide an extension of the OWA operator to the case in which our argument is a continuous valued interval rather than a finite set of values. We look at some examples of this type of aggregation. We show how it can be used in some tasks that arise in decision making. We consider the extension of the continuous interval argument OWA operator to the more general case in which the argument values have importance weights. We use this to introduce the idea of an attitudinal-based expected value associated with a continuous random variable.
