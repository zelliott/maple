Comparative biology includes the comparison of transcriptome and quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) data sets in a range of species to detect evolutionarily conserved and divergent processes. Transcript abundance analysis of target genes by qRT-PCR requires a highly accurate and robust workflow. This includes reference genes with high expression stability (i.e., low intersample transcript abundance variation) for correct target gene normalization. Cross-species qRT-PCR for proper comparative transcript quantification requires reference genes suitable for different species. We addressed this issue using tissue-specific transcriptome data sets of germinating Lepidium sativum seeds to identify new candidate reference genes. We investigated their expression stability in germinating seeds of L. sativum and Arabidopsis thaliana by qRT-PCR, combined with in silico analysis of Arabidopsis and Brassica napus microarray data sets. This revealed that reference gene expression stability is higher for a given developmental process between distinct species than for distinct developmental processes within a given single species. The identified superior cross-species reference genes may be used for family-wide comparative qRT-PCR analysis of Brassicaceae seed germination. Furthermore, using germinating seeds, we exemplify optimization of the qRT-PCR workflow for challenging tissues regarding RNA quality, transcript stability, and tissue abundance. Our work therefore can serve as a guideline for moving beyond Arabidopsis by establishing high-quality cross-species qRT-PCR.
