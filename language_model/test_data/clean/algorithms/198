Iliac artery aneurysms are a frequent finding in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms. The decision of whether to perform a tubular or bifurcated repair rests on a balance between the natural history of the iliac arteries during the lifetime of the patient versus the risk of symptomatic pelvic ischemia and the increased complexity of a bifurcated repair. The relatively recent increase in the use of cross-sectional imaging, especially in the setting of long-term endograft surveillance, has provided useful data on which to base these clinical decisions. A tube graft repair appears to be safe and durable in patients undergoing open aneurysm repair, when suitable distal aortic anatomy and normal iliac arteries are present. A bifurcated graft should be considered in younger patients with moderate sized iliac aneurysms (<30 mm in diameter), as well as in almost all patients with larger iliac aneurysms.
