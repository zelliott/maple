This paper presents the results of HPLC enantioseparation of derivatives of aryloxyaminopropanols obtained using six chiral stationary phases [macrocyclic antibiotic (vancomycin, teicoplanin, teicoplanin aglycone, and methylated teicoplanin aglycone) and cyclodextrin (beta and gamma)] and a mixture of methanol/acetonitrile/acetic acid/triethylamine (45/55/0.3/0.2) as the mobile phase. No significant difference was observed in the separation of the enantiomers on the vancomycin and teicoplanin chiral stationary phases. Comparing the separation of enantiomers on teicoplanin-based columns the retention factors were increased in the order: native teicoplanin < teicoplanin aglycone < methylated teicoplanin aglycone. The highest values of resolution were obtained on the column containing carbohydrate moieties. The presence of saccharide moieties in the chiral stationary phase plays an important role, together with charge interactions and steric interactions, in the separation of enantiomers of derivatives of aryloxyaminopropanol.
