Advances in the knowledge of the genetics of phaeochromocytoma have broadened our understanding about the mechanisms of tumorigenesis. Formerly it was believed that 10% of phaeochromocytomas were associated with familial cancer syndromes, but it is now recognised that up to 30% of these tumours may be familial. In particular, attention has been focused on those patients with apparently sporadic presentations where 12-24% of patients have been shown to carry germline mutations indicating hereditary disease. Consideration of genetic testing is now recommended for all apparently sporadic cases and, following the identification of a mutation-positive carrier, the offering of genetic testing to first degree relatives. There is a need for lifelong follow up of affected individuals and asymptomatic mutation-positive carriers, but validation of screening protocols has yet to be determined.
