Percutaneous coronary intervention for the treatment of bifurcation lesions is associated with a lower success rate and increased risk of subacute stent thrombosis and restenosis. The goal of this manuscript is to review the current classification of coronary bifurcation lesions and techniques. An algorithmic approach for the treatment of bifurcation lesions based on the recently published simplified and comprehensive classification is proposed in this manuscript.
