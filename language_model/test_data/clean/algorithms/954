The success of medically assisted procreation techniques depends on the influence of numerous parameters and, especially the quality of ovarian hyperstimulation. The need of a homogeneous treatment within the medical team has led us to elaborate a system of assistance in decision making in terms of stimulation of ovulation. A first system was developed for a classical stimulation protocol, type clomiphene-gonadotropin. The limited number of decision making parameters (six) as well as the limited number of therapeutic decisions (six) has enabled us to developed a particularly performing algorithm system.
