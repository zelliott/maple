A measure for registration of medical images that currently draws much attention is mutual information. The measure originates from information theory, but has been shown to be successful for image registration as well. Information theory, however, offers many more measures that may be suitable for image registration. These all measure the divergence of the joint distribution of the images' grey values from the joint distribution that would have been found had the images been completely independent. This paper compares the performance of mutual information as a registration measure with that of other F-information measures. The measures are applied to rigid registration of positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance (MR) and MR/computed tomography (CT) images, for 35 and 41 image pairs, respectively. An accurate gold standard transformation is available for the images, based on implanted markers. The registration performance, robustness and accuracy of the measures are studied. Some of the measures are shown to perform poorly on all aspects. The majority of measures produces results similar to those of mutual information. An important finding, however, is that several measures, although slightly more difficult to optimize, can potentially yield significantly more accurate results than mutual information.
