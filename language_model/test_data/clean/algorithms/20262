Sixty-three patients with polysomatic complaints attributed to sensitivity to environmental chemicals had detailed clinical assessments and diagnostic psychologic evaluations. Objective medical parameters failed to substantiate their beliefs that multiple chemicals were the cause of their problems. A group of 64 patients with chronic medical conditions and defined psychologic disorders not attributed to chemical exposure served as controls. Approximately half the patients in each group underwent long-term psychotherapy, and in these patients, the prevalence of physical and sexual childhood abuse was significantly higher (P < .05) among the cohort of women who attributed their symptoms to environmental or chemically related illness. These data suggest that somatization may reflect sequelae of childhood abuse and may play an important role in the illness experienced by women who believe they are sensitive to environmental chemicals.
