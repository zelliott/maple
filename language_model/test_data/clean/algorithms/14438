Cube mapping is widely used in many graphics applications due to the availability of hardware support. However, it does not sample the spherical surface evenly. Recently, a uniform spherical mapping, isocube mapping, was proposed. It exploits the six-face structure used in cube mapping and samples the spherical surface evenly. Unfortunately, some texels in isocube mapping are not rectilinear. This nonrectilinear property may degrade the filtering quality. This paper proposes a novel spherical mapping, namely unicube mapping. It has the advantages of cube mapping (exploitation of hardware and rectilinear structure) and isocube mapping (evenly sampling pattern). In the implementation, unicube mapping uses a simple function to modify the lookup vector before the conventional cube map lookup process. Hence, unicube mapping fully exploits the cube map hardware for real-time filtering and lookup. More importantly, its rectilinear partition structure allows a direct and real-time acquisition of the texture environment. This property facilitates dynamic environment mapping in a real time manner.
