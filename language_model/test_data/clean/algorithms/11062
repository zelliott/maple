Interventional devices with ferromagnetic components can be manipulated remotely using forces induced by the MRI gradients. To deflect the tip of an endovascular catheter, large ferromagnetic spheres of 2 mm diameter are required to exert sufficiently high magnetic forces; however, tracking of these devices is difficult due to the large image artifacts. In this study, a new dual-echo technique is proposed to improve the stability of localizing and tracking medical devices with ferromagnetic components. MR tracking methods with selective off-resonant excitation and phase compensation with a rephasing gradient can detect ferromagnetic spheres up to a diameter of 1 mm only. In this work, a dual-echo technique is used with two rephasing gradients to stabilize the off-set localization. With rephasing being applied in orthogonal directions, an SNR of 5 was achieved in the signal projections. Compared to a single-echo acquisition the dual-echo method reduces the position error in a phantom from 8 mm to 1.6 mm. In an in vivo study a tracking precision of 4 mm was measured without steering gradients at an image update rate of 2 images per second. Steering experiments were successfully performed with a prototype catheter with ferromagnetic sphere in an aorta phantom and in the vena cava of a pig.
