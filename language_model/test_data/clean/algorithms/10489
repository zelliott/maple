The electrohysterogram (EHG) is often corrupted by electronic and electromagnetic noise as well as movement artifacts, skeletal electromyogram, and ECGs from both mother and fetus. The interfering signals are sporadic and/or have spectra overlapping the spectra of the signals of interest rendering classical filtering ineffective. In the absence of efficient methods for denoising the monopolar EHG signal, bipolar methods are usually used. In this paper, we propose a novel combination of blind source separation using canonical correlation analysis (BSS_CCA) and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) methods to denoise monopolar EHG. We first extract the uterine bursts by using BSS_CCA then the biggest part of any residual noise is removed from the bursts by EMD. Our algorithm, called CCA_EMD, was compared with wavelet filtering and independent component analysis. We also compared CCA_EMD with the corresponding bipolar signals to demonstrate that the new method gives signals that have not been degraded by the new method. The proposed method successfully removed artifacts from the signal without altering the underlying uterine activity as observed by bipolar methods. The CCA_EMD algorithm performed considerably better than the comparison methods.
