In high-energy photon external radiotherapy treatment planning systems (TPSs) are used to calculate the dose to the target volume and the dose distribution around it. Commonly used TPSs include algorithms based on measurements in water and often fail in the estimate of dose in the presence of heterogeneities. In this study TL detectors were used to study the reliability of the Cadplan (Varian) TPS in the presence of low-density heterogeneities such as the lung for 6 and 18 MV photon beams at different field sizes. TL measurements were compared with TPS calculations and Monte Carlo simulations performed with the PENELOPE MC code. In a phantom with lung heterogeneity, TL measurements and MC simulations agreed, with an average deviation inside the lung of 2%. In contrast, TPS results overestimated the dose inside the lung, with a maximum deviation of 39% for the 18 MV photon beam and a field size of 2 x 2 cm(2).
