Human activity patterns display a bursty dynamics with interevent times following a heavy tailed distribution. This behavior has been recently shown to be rooted in the fact that humans assign their active tasks different priorities, a process that can be modeled as a priority queueing system [A.-L. Barabási, Nature (London) 435, 207 (2005)]. In this Letter we obtain exact results for the Barabási model with two tasks, calculating the priority and waiting time distribution of active tasks. We demonstrate that the model has a singular behavior in the extremal dynamics limit, when the highest priority task is selected first. We find that independently of the selection protocol, the average waiting time is smaller or equal to the number of active tasks, and discuss the asymptotic behavior of the waiting time distribution. These results have important implications for understanding complex systems with extremal dynamics.
