Transcatheter aortic valve implantation workup includes assessment of the aorta and the iliofemoral arteries by computed tomographic angiography. An important group of transcatheter aortic valve implantation candidates have severe renal failure. We tested a novel computed tomographic angiography protocol (128-detector-row dual-source scanner, high-pitch helical mode) with ultralow contrast volume (20 mL) in 8 patients, compared with 8 controls. Contrast-to-noise ratio and subjective image quality, albeit lower than in the controls, were suitable for interpretation in the ultralow contrast volume group throughout all measured locations.
