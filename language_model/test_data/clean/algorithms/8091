To determine the efficacy of thoracoscopy in the management of children with complicated parapneumonic pleural effusion at the fibrinopurulent stage.

Retrospective study of 99 children submitted to thoracoscopy for the treatment of complicated parapneumonic pleural effusion at the fibrinopurulent stage between November of 1995 and July of 2005. The mean age was 2.6 years (range, 0.4-12 years), and 60% were males. Thoracoscopy was performed at three different hospitals following the same treatment algorithm.

Thoracoscopy was effective for 87 children (88%). In 12 (12%), a second surgical procedure was required: another thoracoscopy (n = 6) or thoracotomy/thoracostomy (n = 6). Mean duration of chest tube drainage following successful thoracoscopy was 3 days vs. 10 days in patients submitted to a second procedure (p < 0.001). In all of the children, the pleural infection resolved after treatment. Thoracoscopy-related complications included air leak (30%), chest tube bleeding (12%), subcutaneous emphysema associated with trocar insertion (2%) and surgical wound infection (2%). None of the children required additional surgical procedures due to the complications.

The effectiveness of thoracoscopy in children with parapneumonic pleural effusion at the fibrinopurulent stage was 88%. The procedure was safe, with a low rate of severe complications. Thoracoscopy should be the first-choice treatment for children with parapneumonic pleural effusion at the fibrinopurulent stage.
