The electrocardiogram (ECG) provides useful global temporal assessment of the cardiac activity, but has limited spatial capabilities. The Laplacian electrocardiogram (LECG), an improvement over the ECG, provides high spatiotemporal distributed information about cardiac electrical activation. We designed and developed LECG tripolar concentric ring electrode active sensors based on the finite element algorithm 'nine-point method' (NPM). The active sensors were used in an array of 6 by 12 (72) locations to record bipolar and tripolar LECG from the body surface over the anterolateral chest. Compared to bipolar LECG, tripolar LECG showed significantly higher spatial selectivity which may be helpful in inferring information about cardiac activations detected on the body surface. In this study the moment of activation (MOA), an indicator of a depolarization wave passing below the active sensors, was used to surmise possible timing information of the cardiac electrical activation below the active sensors' recording sites. The MOA on the body surface was used to generate isochronal maps that may some day be used by clinicians in diagnosing arrhythmias and assessing the efficacy of therapies.
