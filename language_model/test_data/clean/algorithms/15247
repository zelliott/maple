To reveal predictors of demand formation in phthisiosurgical care during standard treatment of infiltrative pulmonary tuberculosis. Clinical, radiological, laboratory and psychological examination of 103 patients with new-onset infiltrative pulmonary tuberculosis in exsolved phase (ICD-10 A15. and A16.) before standard therapy were done. All patients were divided into two groups (with indications to phthisiosurgical treatment and without indications to transthoracic operation) based on prospective 12-months follow-up results. Predictors of demand formation in phthisiosurgical care were revealed based on results of intergroup comparison and stepwise logistic regression. It was established that demand formation in phthisiosurgical care during conservative treatment of infiltrative pulmonary tuberculosis linked with M. tuberculosis presence in sputum and relative increasing sizes of tuberculous infiltrates, content of erythrocytes in blood, thymol test, atherogenic index and circulating ceruleoplasmin concentration at a time when depressive soreness and asthenia relatively decreased. Integrate algorithm of demand in phthisiosurgical care prognosis was formed by dint of stepwise logistic regression. This algorithm is based on consideration of integrated index of clinical symptoms severity, hidrosis, number of destruction in tuberculous infiltrate and its sizes, HDL concentration, total protein and serum beta-globuline percentage. Algorithm formed with logistic regression offers the possibility to make a prognosis of demand in phthisiosurgical care with 72,7% responsiveness and 80% specificity.
