To measure aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) using flow-sensitive four-dimensional (4D) MRI and to evaluate test-retest reliability, inter- and intra-observer variability in volunteers and correlation with characteristics in patients with aortic atherosclerosis.

Flow-sensitive 4D MRI was performed in 12 volunteers (24 ± 3 years) and 86 acute stroke patients (68 ± 9 years) with aortic atherosclerosis. Retrospectively positioned 28 ± 4 analysis planes along the entire aorta (inter-slice-distance = 10 mm) and frame wise lumen segmentation yielded flow-time-curves for each plane. Global aortic PWV was calculated from time-shifts and distances between the upslope portions of all available flow-time curves.

Inter- and intra-observer variability of PWV measurements in volunteers (7% and 8%) was low while test-retest reliability (22%) was moderate. PWV in patients was significantly higher compared with volunteers (5.8 ± 2.9 versus 3.8 ± 0.8 m/s; P = 0.02). Among 17 patient characteristics considered, statistical analysis revealed significant (P < 0.05) but low correlation of PWV with age (r = 0.25), aortic valve insufficiency (r = 0.29), and pulse pressure (r = 0.28). Multivariate modeling indicated that aortic valve insufficiency and elevated pulse pressure were significantly associated with higher PWV (adjusted R(2) = 0.13).

Flow-sensitive 4D MRI allows for estimating aortic PWV with low observer dependence and moderate test-retest reliability. PWV in patients correlated with age, aortic valve insufficiency, and pulse pressure.
