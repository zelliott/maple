Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry was utilized to investigate noncovalent complexes between beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) and five novel polyamide acids containing N-methylpyrrole and N-methylimidazole. The 1:1 binding mode was specified by examining the binding stoichiometry from ESI mass spectra. It found that polyamide acids with beta-CD have binding affinities in the order: ImImImbetaCOOH > ImPyImbetaCOOH > ImPyPybetaCOOH > PyPyPybetaCOOH > NO(2)PyPyPybetaCOOH. The method gives, simultaneously, the binding constants between beta-CD and polyamide acids based on a novel linear equation.
