Mechanical loading-induced signals are hypothesized to be transmitted and integrated by connected bone cells before reaching the bone surfaces where adaptation occurs. A computational connected cellular network (CCCN) model is developed to explore how bone cells perceive and transmit the signals through intercellular communication. This is part two of a two-part study in which a CCCN is developed to study the intercellular communication within a grid of bone cells. The excitation signal was computed as the loading-induced bone fluid shear stress in part one. Experimentally determined bone adaptation responses (Gross et al. in J Bone Miner Res 12:982-988, 1997 and Judex et al. in J Bone Miner Res 12:1737-1745, 1997) are correlated with the fluid shear stress by the CCCN, which adjusts cell sensitivities (loading and signal thresholds) and connection weights. Intercellular communication patterns extracted by the CCCN indicate the cell population responsible for perceiving the loading-induced signal, and loading threshold is shown to play an important role in regulating the bone response.
