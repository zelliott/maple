The response of enzyme electrode glucose sensors implanted in tissues to physiologic blood glucose oscillations is simulated. Models describe both oxygen-based and peroxide-based glucose sensors in spatially homogeneous medium simulating some mass transfer properties of tissue. Pass-through ratios and delays are reported as a function of frequency for the oxygen-based sensor, and the effects on continuous blood glucose monitoring are illustrated using data from the literature. Certain peroxide-based sensor designs may produce common signals for different glucose concentrations, a characteristic not found in oxygen-based sensors. The dynamic response depends on the frequency of glucose oscillation and is sensitive to sensor type, enzyme activity, and diffusional resistance.
