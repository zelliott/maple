This paper presents a novel technique to create a computerized fluoroscopy with zero-dose image updates for computer-assisted fluoroscopy-based close reduction and osteosynthesis of diaphyseal fracture of femurs. With the novel technique, repositioning of bone fragments during close fracture reduction will lead to image updates in each acquired imaging plane, which is equivalent to using several fluoroscopes simultaneously from different directions but without any X-ray radiation. Its application facilitates the whole fracture reduction and osteosynthesis procedure when combining with the existing leg length and antetorsion restoration methods and may result in great reduction of the X-ray radiation to the patient and to the surgical team. In this paper, we present the approach for achieving such a technique and the experimental results with plastic bones.
