Isokinetic devices are highly rated in strength-related performance diagnosis. A few years ago, the broad variety of existing products was extended by the IsoMed 2000-dynamometer. In order for an isokinetic device to be clinically useful, the reliability of specific applications must be established. Although there have already been single studies on this topic for the IsoMed 2000 concerning maximum strength measurements, there has been no study regarding the assessment of strength-endurance so far. The aim of the present study was to establish the reliability for various methods of quantification of strength-endurance using the IsoMed 2000.

A sample of 33 healthy young subjects (age: 23.8 ± 2.6 years) participated in one familiarisation and two testing sessions, 3-4 days apart. Testing consisted of a series 30 full effort concentric extension-flexion cycles of the right knee muscles at an angular velocity of 180 °/s. Based on the parameters Peak, Torque and Work for each repetition, indices of absolute (KADabs) and relative (KADrel) strength-endurance were derived. KADabs was calculated as the mean value of all testing repetitions, KADrel was determined in two ways: on the one hand, as the percentage decrease between the first and the last 5 repetitions (KADrelA) and on the other, as the negative slope derived from the linear regression equitation of all repetitions (KADrelB). Detection of systematic errors was performed using paired sample t-tests, relative and absolute reliability were examined using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 2.1) and standard error of measurement (SEM%), respectively.

In general, for extension measurements concerning KADabs and - in an weakened form - KADrel high ICC -values of 0.76-0.89 combined with clinically acceptable values of SEM% of 1.2-5.9 % could be found. For flexion measurements this only applies to KADabs, whereas results for KADrel turned out to be clearly weaker with ICC- and SEM% values of 0.42-0.62 and 9.6-17.7 % and leave considerable doubts on the clinical usefulness. However, if there should be after all a need to measure KADrel for flexion, it is - in view of the stronger reliability results - recommended (i) to concentrate on the calculation of KADrelB, (ii) to use the parameter Work and - in view of considerable familiariszation and learning effects of ≈10 % - (iii) to include a familiarisation period that extends exceeds the familiarisation session conducted in the present study.
