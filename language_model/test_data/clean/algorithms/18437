The object of this study was to work at accurate axis registration and interpolation methods for multi-dimension reconstruction of rotary scanning ultrasonic medical images. At first, time-field curves of the images' axes were analyzed according to their characteristic points and the axial direction registration was realized. Similar matrix was used to find registration pixels line near the axes of two images. Auto-correlation function and Fourier spectrum were used to evaluate the effects of axes registration. Second, an interpolation method was studied for the special space distribution of rotary scanning images. Results of experiments indicate that the axes registration and interpolation methods were suitable to rotary scanning medical images. The quality of reconstruction can be greatly improved by registration-based interpolation methods.
