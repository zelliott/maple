Inter-subject alignment of functional MRI (fMRI) data is necessary for group analyses. The standard approach to this problem matches anatomical features of the brain, such as major anatomical landmarks or cortical curvature. Precise alignment of functional cortical topographies, however, cannot be derived using only anatomical features. We propose a new inter-subject registration algorithm that aligns intra-subject patterns of functional connectivity across subjects. We derive functional connectivity patterns by correlating fMRI BOLD time-series, measured during movie viewing, between spatially remote cortical regions. We validate our technique extensively on real fMRI experimental data and compare our method to two state-of-the-art inter-subject registration algorithms. By cross-validating our method on independent datasets, we show that the derived alignment generalizes well to other experimental paradigms.
