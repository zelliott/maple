This paper investigates dynamic source imaging of the spinal cord electrophysiological activity from its evoked magnetic field by applying the spatial filter version of standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA). Our computer simulation shows that the sLORETA-based spatial filter can reconstruct the four current sources typically associated with the elicitation of the spinal cord evoked magnetic field (SCEF). The results from animal experiments show that significant changes in the latency and intensity of the reconstructed volume current arise near the location of the artificial incomplete conduction block. The results from the human SCEF show that the SCEF source imaging can visualize the dynamics of the volume currents and other nerve electrical activity propagating along the human spinal cord. These experimental results demonstrate the potential of SCEF source imaging as a future clinical tool for diagnosing cervical spinal cord disorders.
