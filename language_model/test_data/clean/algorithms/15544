Traditionally, lower lid blepharoplasty has been confined to a choice of skin or skin-muscle flap transcutaneous blepharoplasty. In the past decade, in particular, various new techniques and technologies have emerged, altering our ability to treat the lower eyelids. These techniques include transconjunctival blepharoplasty, a variety of canthopexy procedures, fat-conserving or fat-replacing methods, wedge excision, and laser resurfacing techniques, and they allow a more individualized approach based on variations in anatomical features and patient goals. A retrospective review of data for 100 consecutive patients (ranging in age from 30 to 80 years) who underwent lower eyelid procedures during a 12-month period is presented. Procedures were categorized as follows: lower lid blepharoplasty, 35 cases; lower lid transconjunctival blepharoplasty, 27 cases; lower lid transconjunctival blepharoplasty with laser resurfacing, 17 cases; lower lid laser resurfacing, 16 cases; tarsorrhaphy with lower lid operation, three cases; tarsorrhaphy with laser resurfacing, two cases. Two complications of retained fat pads (one medial and one lateral) were encountered and were addressed with a secondary operation using a transconjunctival blepharoplasty approach. The results indicate that laser treatment has become the predominant form of lower eyelid resurfacing and that transconjunctival blepharoplasty is now the most common surgical procedure for the lower eyelid. All of our tarsorrhaphy procedures were performed for patients who had previously undergone surgical treatment of the lower eyelids. An algorithm based on physical findings and these techniques has been developed, for appropriate tailoring of the procedure to each patient's specific concerns. With the availability of a variety of techniques, an individualized approach based on variations in anatomical features is feasible.
