Hydroquinone (HQ) produces nephrotoxicity and renal tubular adenomas in male F344 rats following 2 years of oral dosing. Female F344 and SD rats are comparatively resistant to these effects. Nephrotoxicity and tumorigenicity have been associated with a minor glutathione conjugation pathway following the oxidation of HQ to benzoquinone (BQ). The majority of administered doses (90-99%) consists of glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of HQ. An initial physiologically based pharmacokinetic model was developed to characterize the role of kinetics in the strain differences observed in HQ-induced renal toxicity and tumorigenicity. Partition coefficients, protein-binding, and metabolic rate constants were determined directly or estimated from a series of in vivo and in vitro studies. Metabolism was confined to the liver and GI tract. The total flux through the glutathione pathway represented the "internal dose" of HQ for nephrotoxicity. Simulations were compared to a variety of data from male and female F344 rats, male SD rats, and a single male human volunteer. Simulations of intraperitoneal administration resulted in higher amounts of glutathione conjugates than comparable oral doses. This was consistent with protein-binding and toxicity studies and emphasized the importance of first-pass GI tract metabolism. In addition, male F344 rats were predicted to form more total glutathione conjugates than SD rats at equivalent dose levels, which was also consistent with the observed strain differences in renal toxicity. This model represents the first stage in the development of a biologically based dose-response model for improving the scientific basis for human health risk assessments of HQ.
