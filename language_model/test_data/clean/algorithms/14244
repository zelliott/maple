Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive technique used to image the electrical conductivity and permittivity within a body from measurements taken on the body's surface. High-quality static images are required for many medical imaging applications. Forming such images usually requires an accurate way to calculate the expected voltages on the surface resulting from the application of known currents to that surface. This is described as the forward problem. This paper introduces a new method to improve static images by using an improved forward solution which estimates a different conductivity value for each applied current pattern. This method, creating an automatically adjusting forward solution, can improve the sensitivity of static images under many EIT imaging applications. It does so by reducing the boundary effects caused by electrodes and any layered structures near them such as skin. The drawback of this method is that circularly symmetric structures of interest may be suppressed or eliminated from the images. The performance of this method is illustrated in a 2D circular phantom with simulation data from both a FEM model and experimental data.
