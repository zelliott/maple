We study critical properties of the continuous Abelian sandpile model with anisotropies in toppling rules that produce ordered patterns on it. Also, we consider the continuous directed sandpile model perturbed by a weak quenched randomness, study critical behavior of the model using perturbative conformal field theory, and show that the model has a random fixed point.
