Epilepsy, a common neurological condition most often diagnosed in childhood, has physical, psychologic, and psychosocial effects on individuals. Of people diagnosed with complex partial seizures, about 10%-20% will not be able to achieve control of their seizures with medical management. The impact of continued seizures can be devastating on developing children and their families. Surgery for removal of the epileptic focus can offer the hope of an ordinary life; over 70% of patients achieve either complete seizure control or are greatly improved (Ventureyra & Higgins, 1993). Surgery requires a careful evaluation, services of a multidisciplinary team, and education and support for children and families. Pediatric nurses can identify potential candidates, act as advocates to encourage families to seek this option, and work collaboratively with their colleagues in specialty centers to facilitate referrals.
