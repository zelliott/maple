Moso-bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens) is well known as an edible shoot in Asia, and the stems of moso-bamboo are used as tableware due to its characteristic odour. Despite the pleasant odour of bamboo stems, no detailed analysis of the volatile compounds has been reported.

To clarify the potent odourants contributing to the characteristic aroma of the bamboo, the aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA) method was performed through gas chromatography olfactometry (GC-O) analysis. In addition, relative flavour activity (RFA) was calculated, in which both the flavor dilution (FD) factor and weight percentage of each compound are involved.

Eighty-nine compound in bamboo stems oil were identified by GC and GC-MS. The main components of the oil were palmitic acid (16.5%), (E)-nerolidol (10.2%) and indole (8.1%). In sensory analysis, 18 aroma-active compounds were detected by aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA). The most intense aroma-active compounds were eugenol (sweet, clove-like, green) and (E)-2-nonenal (green).

The results of the sniffing test, RFA and FD factor indicated that (E)-2-nonenal and eugenol were estimated to have a bamboo-like aroma, and aldehyde compounds, such as a phenylacetaldehyde (floral) and C9-C10 unsaturated aldehydes, make the aroma of bamboo.
