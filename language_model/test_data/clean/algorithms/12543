The aim of this study is to evaluate performance of Matching Pursuit (MP) algorithm against visual analysis for automatic sleep spindle (SS) detection in a sample of sleep stages 2-4 and REM pertaining to nine healthy young subjects. MP-SS voltage, frequency and duration characteristics were investigated for the amplitude threshold (AT) that maximized yield between test sensitivity and specificity. Parameter distribution curves were also built for correctly detected (true positive) and false-positive events. For sleep stage 2, MP reached 80.6% sensitivity and specificity for an AT value of 58.8. For all stages together, 81.2% sensitivity and specificity were reached for an AT value of 46.6. Specificity curves were adequate for all stages; sensitivity was lower for S3+4. Sigma frequency range activity with atypical characteristics was detected within REM sleep. Prevalence indexes obtained with MP were much higher than visual prevalence indexes for all stages; similar voltage, frequency and duration distribution curves were obtained for true positive and false positive events. For this sample of young male healthy subjects, the free-ware MP algorithm showed satisfactory performance for SS detection in sleep stage 2 as reported earlier, acceptable performance in sleep stages 3+4, although with lowered sensitivity, and sigma frequency range activity within REM sleep that needs better understanding. Within NREM sleep, correspondence between the MP automatic and the visual method was supported.
