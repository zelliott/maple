Obstructive sleep apnea and upper airway obstruction (even without complete apnea) from adenotonsillar hypertrophy is either occurring more frequently or is becoming better recognized. Tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy is indicated for these children. Most patients who would benefit from surgery can be identified by a thorough history and physical examination. Occasionally, additional methods of evaluation, such as lateral neck radiographs or polysomnograms, are helpful. The indications for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy are varied. No review can cogently encompass all clinical scenarios. Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy remain valuable procedures for carefully selected patients.
