Fluctuations of the surface membrane potential due to adsorbtion and desorbtion of ions when environmental fluctuations generate a fluctuation in the number of adsorbtion sites were investigated. The correlation functions of surface charge density, surface potential and the spectral density of surface potential fluctuations were calculated. The characteristic features of these fluctuations were determined.
