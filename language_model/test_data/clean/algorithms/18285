The solubility of paracetamol in water-ethanol-propylene glycol binary and ternary mixtures at 25 and 30 degrees C was determined using flask shake method. The generated data extended the solubility database for further computational investigations and also was used to assess the prediction capability of the Jouyban-Acree model. A new version of the model was proposed for modeling the solubility data in water-cosolvent mixtures with the cosolvent concentration of <50% which is required in pharmaceutical formulations. The accuracy of the predicted solubilities was evaluated by the mean percentage deviation (MPD) between the predicted and experimental solubilities. The overall MPD of the Jouyban-Acree model and the log-linear model of Yalkowsky for the entire composition range of the cosolvents were 11.0+/-8.7 and 55.4+/-17.8%, respectively; the corresponding values for the predicted solubilities in mixtures having a cosolvent concentration of <50% were 12.0+/-9.1 and 22.0+/-11.0%.
