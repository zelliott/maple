With increasing research interest in displaying and analyzing biomedical images, a practical personal computer based off-line image processing software would be useful. This paper describes the implementation of an image processing work station on a Macintosh II which features a novel edge detection capability useful for biomedical measurement. The boundary finding algorithm is coded in Turbo Pascal, and operates at a speed comfortable for interactive operation. Depending on the complexity of the problem, it usually takes less than a minute for the measurement of an image. The edge detection algorithm has an built-in edge detector with decision-making capability, and can be efficiently controlled by a mouse. In this way, the local accuracy of an automatic edge detection operator, and the global accuracy of the human eye (through manual control of a mouse) are combined.
