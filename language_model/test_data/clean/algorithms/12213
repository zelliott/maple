This article aims at the gas flow into the dustbin of conventional cyclones, the prolonged cyclone (attaching a vertical tube at the bottom of the dust outlet) is proposed by some researchers, which can make flow with dust enter into the tube and separate further. The Reynolds stress transport model (RSTM) has been employed to predict the gas flow fields of the conventional and prolonged cyclones. The tangential velocity, axial velocity profiles and turbulent kinetic energy profiles are presented, and the downward flow rates into the dustbin of the three cyclones are compared. The separation performances of these three cyclones are tested. The result indicates that the tangential velocity, axial velocity and turbulent kinetic energy in the dustbin reduce greatly when the prolonged vertical tube attaching into the dust outlet, which can avoid the re-entrainment of already separated dust effectively. Furthermore, the prolonged vertical tube increases the separation space of dusts. The downward flow rate into the dustbin of the prolonged cyclone decreases compared with the conventional cyclone. The experimental results show that the prolonged vertical tube can improve the separation efficiency by a slightly increased pressure drop. However, for an even longer tube, the separation efficiency is slightly reduced. Thus, there is an optimal tube length for a given cyclone.
