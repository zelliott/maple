We study phase ordering dynamics of spatially periodic striped patterns on the small-world network that is derived from a two-dimensional regular lattice with distance-dependent random connections. It is demonstrated numerically that addition of spatial disorder in the form of shortcuts makes the growth of domains much slower or even frozen at late times.
