The benefits of hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women, especially in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, are well known. It is still not clear whether oestrogen replacement therapy can be given safely to women with breast cancer. The incidence and survival of breast cancer is rising in the UK and increasing numbers of young women with breast cancer treated systemically experience an early menopause and are at prolonged risk of osteoporosis. This review discusses the risk/benefit analysis of oestrogen replacement therapy for breast cancer patients, and alternative therapies: SERMs, phyto-oestrogens and bisphosphonates. A schedule for monitoring osteoporosis for breast cancer patients with a therapeutic early menopause is suggested.
