The flat panel-based volume computed tomography (fpVCT) is a new CT device applicable for experimental, three-dimensional evaluation of teeth at a resolution of about 150 microm in the high contrast region. The aim of this study was to investigate whether fpVCT was suitable for quantification of the volumes of dental hard tissues and the root canal system to establish a new method for morphological studies. Fifty-two extracted third molars (maxillary: 31, mandibular: 21) were examined with a prototype of an fpVCT using a volumetry algorithm at different levels according to the radiographic density of enamel and dentine. Volumetry of the root canal system was performed after "region growing segmentation": starting from a voxel in the centre of the root canal, this algorithm searches voxels of same density in the surrounding. The volumetry of the root canal system was stopped by the investigator at the apical constriction. Results showed that dentine, enamel and root canal system could be well distinguished in three-dimensional images. Volumetry yielded the following data (cm(3), mean+/-SD): dentine 0.438+/-0.111, enamel 0.227+/-0.051, root canal system 0.052+/-0.017 and total volume 0.753+/-0.159. In conclusion, the fpVCT is appropriate for non-destructive volumetry of large numbers of teeth in experimental laboratory studies.
