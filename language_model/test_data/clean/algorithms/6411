NMR spectroscopy has become a vital tool for studies of protein conformational changes and dynamics. Oxidized Fe(III)cytochromes c are a particularly attractive target for NMR analysis because their paramagnetism (S = (1)/(2)) leads to high (1)H chemical shift dispersion, even for unfolded or otherwise disordered states. In addition, analysis of shifts induced by the hyperfine interaction reveals details of the structure of the heme and its ligands for native and nonnative protein conformational states. The use of NMR spectroscopy to investigate the folding and dynamics of paramagnetic cytochromes c is reviewed here. Studies of nonnative conformations formed by denaturation and by anomalous in vivo maturation (heme attachment) are facilitated by the paramagnetic, low-spin nature of native and nonnative forms of cytochromes c. Investigation of the dynamics of folded cytochromes c also are aided by their paramagnetism. As an example of this analysis, the expression in Escherichia coli of cytochrome c(552) from Nitrosomonas europaea is reported here, along with analysis of its unusual heme hyperfine shifts. The results are suggestive of heme axial methionine fluxion in N. europaea ferricytochrome c(552). The application of NMR spectroscopy to investigate paramagnetic cytochrome c folding and dynamics has advanced our understanding of the structure and dynamics of both native and nonnative states of heme proteins.
