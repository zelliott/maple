The differences between reagents of prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen and fibrin and fibrinogen degradation products(FDP) were examined in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and without DIC. The sensitivity of the PT ratio for DIC is lowered by the PT reagent with a high international sensitivity index, and the difference between PT reagents was marked. The sensitivity of PT-international normalized ratio (INR) for DIC was higher than that of the PT ratio and the difference between reagents in PT-INR was low. Though the difference between reagents for fibrinogen is slight, the usefulness in diagnosing DIC is also slight. Though the sensitivity of FDP for DIC was good, the difference between FDP reagents was marked. Therefore, standardization of PT and FDP seems to be necessary. Concordance of overt-DIC diagnostic criteria by the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) and DIC diagnostic criteria of Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare (JMHW) was about 70%, and overt-DIC diagnostic criteria of ISTH seemed to diagnose the typical type of DIC diagnosed by JMHW criteria. Finally, the diagnostic criteria of non-overt DIC are expected to become increasingly important.
