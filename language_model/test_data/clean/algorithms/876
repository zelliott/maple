In the current study, the effects of reconstruction algorithms on quantitative measures derived from computed tomographic (CT) lung images were assessed in patients with emphysema. CT image data sets were reconstructed with a standard algorithm and alternative algorithm(s) for 42 subjects. Algorithms were grouped as overenhancing, sharp, standard, or smooth. Density mask and volume measurements from the alternative algorithm data sets were compared with standard algorithm data sets. The overenhancing category yielded an average shift of 9.4% (ie, a shift in average score from 35.5% to 44.9%); the sharp category, a shift of 2.4%; and the smooth category, a shift of -1.0%. Differences in total lung volume measurements were less than 1%. In conclusion, the CT reconstruction algorithm may strongly affect density mask results, especially for certain reconstruction algorithms.
