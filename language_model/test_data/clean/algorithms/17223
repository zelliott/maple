This paper demonstrates preliminary image processing with the aim of obtaining invariant signs for identification by colour. For this purpose we have used microscopic images of cell structures in coloured peripheral blood smears. The main parameter for the identification is the colouring of the respective cell structures on the basis of which we have created histograms by hue for the available cell types.
