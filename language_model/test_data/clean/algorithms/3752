A simple time-domain optical method for estimating the depth and concentration of fluorescent inclusions in turbid media is described. We demonstrate direct depth estimation of a localized fluorescent object from the temporal position of the temporal point-spread function maximum. The depth estimation permits recovery of the fluorophore concentration, both of which are essential quantities for optical molecular imaging studies. Since the maximum is independent of the fluorophore concentration, excitation laser power, detector gain, and other system-dependent factors, this method ensures a robust and efficient approach.
