In a previous paper the preparation has been described, by three different techniques, of microparticles made of Eudragit RS 100 and RL 100 containing a NSAI agent, Tolmetin. Freely flowing microparticles failed to affect significantly the in vitro drug release, which displayed a similar dissolution profile after micro-encapsulation to the free drug powder. Microparticles were then converted into tablets and the effect of compression on drug delivery, as well as that of the presence of co-additives, was studied in the present work. Furthermore, microparticles were also prepared by adding MgO to the polymer matrix, to reduce the sensitivity of the drug to pH changes during its dissolution. Similarly, magnesium stearate was also used for microparticle formation as a droplet stabilizer, in order to reduce particle size and hinder rapid drug release. A mathematical evaluation, by using two semi-empirical equations, was applied to evaluate the influence of dissolution and diffusion phenomena upon drug release from microparticle tablets.
