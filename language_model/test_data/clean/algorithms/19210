A PRESS (Point RESolved Spectroscopy) sequence for the improved detection of the C2 protons of Glx (glutamate and glutamine) at approximately 3.75ppm is presented in this work. It is shown that for spins like the C2 protons of Glx which are involved solely in weak coupling interactions, the chemical shift displacement effect can be turned to advantage by exploiting PRESS refocusing pulses with bandwidths less than the chemical shift difference between the target spins and the spins to which they are weakly coupled. The narrow-bandwidth PRESS sequence allows refocusing of the J-coupling evolution of the target protons in the voxel of interest independently of echo time yielding signal equivalent to that which can be obtained with a one-pulse acquire sequence (assuming ideal pulses and ignoring T2 relaxation). The total echo time of PRESS was set long enough for the decay of macromolecule signal and the two echo times were empirically optimized so that the Glx signal at 3.75ppm suffered minimal contamination from myo-inositol. The efficacy of the method was verified on phantom solutions of Glx and on brain in vivo.
