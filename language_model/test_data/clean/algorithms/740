With separability assumed, we decompose a three-dimensional point spread function (3D PSF) into two-dimensional (2D) PSFs and further into one-dimensional (ID) PSFs. Based on the observation of the location invariance of a step edge under convolution, we propose a rectification procedure to automatically establish the step-edge function from a blurred edge profile. The ID PSF is modelled as a single-parameter Gaussian function, which is determined by iteratively blurring a step-edge function into a spread edge profile. A plastic solid ball (diameter approximately 6 mm) is used to provide double-edged rectangular functions along scanlines passing through the ball centre, and correspondingly, the reconstructed digital volume provides the blurred rectangular profiles. Experimenting with a cone-beam computed tomography system, we demonstrate the iterative edge-blurring algorithm for PSF measurement. By repositioning the ball phantom in the object support space, we measure the system's spatial variance in terms of full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of the local PSFs. Specifically, we obtained the FWHMs for three specific locations at (0, 0, -40 mm), (0, 0, 0) and (0, 0, 40 mm), which are given by 0.92 +/- 0.10 mm, 0.65 +/- 0.08 mm and 0.93 +/- 0.10 mm, respectively.
