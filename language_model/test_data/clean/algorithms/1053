Heart failure is not a simple defect in the pumping function of cardiac muscle, but rather a complex systemic inflammatory disease affecting many organ systems. Recognition of this fact has led to new therapeutic interventions such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers, which have a significant impact on the quality of life and survival of patients with heart failure. During the course of heart failure, the steps involved in the activation of inflammation are now better understood. As a result, new therapies will develop that block, modify, or prevent these inflammatory changes, and supplement our armamentarium for providing better and longer lives for patients.
