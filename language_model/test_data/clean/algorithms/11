The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the advantages of designing computer-based motor controllers together with innovative motors, such that maximum controller/motor system benefits are obtained. Specifically, this paper describes how a computer-based controller/drive system for powered wheelchairs has been designed and is being built and tested. This type of integral controller/drive system has been possible to build into a wheelchair only with the advent of the microprocessor-based feedback motor controller. The type of motor chosen for this project was a linear synchronous motor (LSM), which is highly efficient (90%+) and could easily be made an integral part of a wheelchair wheel, providing a "no-moving-parts" drive system. However, an LSM cannot be variable-speed-controlled without knowledge of, and controlled adjustment to, the absolute rotor versus stator position at each point in time. Microprocessor-based feedback motor controllers make precise, efficient control of LSMs possible at a reasonable cost. In addition, this combination of controller and motor provides a very flexible wheelchair control/drive system that may be easily programmed to suit the needs and necessities of the wide variety of over 200,000 persons now using powered wheelchairs.
