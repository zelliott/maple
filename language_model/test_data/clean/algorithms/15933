Computer modeling and simulation of human movement plays an increasingly important role in sport and rehabilitation, with applications ranging from sport equipment design to understanding pathologic gait. The complex dynamic interactions within the musculoskeletal and neuromuscular systems make analyzing human movement with existing experimental techniques difficult but computer modeling and simulation allows for the identification of these complex interactions and causal relationships between input and output variables. This article provides an overview of computer modeling and simulation and presents an example application in the field of rehabilitation.
