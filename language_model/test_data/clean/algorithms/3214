We derive the new oriented-couple partial differential equation (PDE) models based on the variational methods for filtering in electronic speckle pattern interferometry phase fringe patterns. In the filtering methods based on the oriented PDE models, filtering along fringe orientation for the entire image is simply realized through solving the PDEs numerically, without having to laboriously establish the small filtering window along the fringe orientation and move this filtering window over each pixel in an image. We test the proposed models on two computer-simulated speckle phase fringe patterns and an experimentally obtained phase fringe pattern, respectively, in which the fringe density is variable, and compare our models with related PDE models. Further, we quantitatively evaluate the performance of these PDE models with a comparative parameter, named the image fidelity. We also compare the computational time of our method with that of a traditional filtering method along the fringe orientation. The experimental results demonstrate the performance of our new oriented PDE models.
