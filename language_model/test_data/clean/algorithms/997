Computed Tomography(CT) is one of the successful methods, in which mathematical theories are combined with engineering technology. Volume CT will replace the cross-sectional CT that has been widely used. In this paper two new cone vertex orbits, which are circle-and-arc and regular triangular pyramid lines, have been proposed and their complete conditions for exact reconstruction have been obtained. After having studied circle-and-n-line cone vertex orbit which is one of the important orbits in volume CT, we have given a better proof about the complete condition in circle-and-line and circle-and-2-line cone vertex orbit and have obtained some proper conclusions. Finally, we extend the above results to circle-and-n-line vertex orbit. These results will be useful for the design of direct volume imaging.
