Integrating multiple analytical processes into microfluidic devices is an important research area required for a variety of microchip-based analyses. A microfluidic system is described that achieves preparative separations by intelligent fraction collection of attomole quantities of sample. The device consists of a main microfluidic channel used to perform electrophoresis, which is interconnected at 90 degrees to two vertically displaced channels via a nanocapillary array membrane. The membrane interconnect contains nanometer-diameter pores that provide fluidic communication between the channels. Sample injection and analyte collection are controlled by application of an electrical bias between the microfluidic channels across the nanocapillary array. After the separation, the automated transfer of the FITC-labeled Arg, Gln, and Gly bands occurs; a fluorescence detector located at the separation/collection channel interconnect is used to generate a triggering signal that initiates suitable voltages to allow near-quantitative transfer of analyte from the separation channel to the second fluidic layer. The ability to achieve such sample manipulations from mass-limited samples enables a variety of postseparation processing events.
