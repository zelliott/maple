The present study has for the first time demonstrated the isolation of peptides from human plasma by electromembrane extraction (EME). Angiotensin 1, angiotensin 2, and angiotensin 3 migrated from 500 microL of diluted plasma, through a thin layer of 1-octanol and 8% di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate immobilized as a supported liquid membrane (SLM) in the pores of a porous hollow fiber, and into a 25 microL aqueous acceptor solution present inside the lumen of the fiber. The driving force for the extraction was a 15 V potential difference applied across the SLM. After only 10 min of EME, the peptides were isolated from diluted plasma (pH 3) with extraction recoveries between 25 and 43%. After optimization, the extraction system was evaluated using spiked plasma samples of angiotensin 2. The evaluation was performed by liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry, showing linearity of angiotensin 2 in the range 2.5-125.0 ng/mL (r(2)=0.989), and repeatability (RSD) between 5.6 and 11.6% (n=6). The results demonstrate the possibility of isolating angiotensin peptides from plasma in only 10 min, using electromembrane extraction. The experimental findings are therefore promising with regard to future peptide extractions.
