In this study, a reconstruction algorithm for a 16-electrode interleaved-drive electrical impedance tomography (EIT) system is developed, based on inversion of an analytically calculated sensitivity matrix. The sensitivity matrix is calculated using Geselowitz's lead-sensitivity theorem. Eight interleaved electrodes out of 16 (equally spaced) electrodes are designated as current injection electrodes and the remaining eight electrodes are designated as measurement electrodes. The sensitivity matrix is singular, therefore singular value decomposition (SVD) of the sensitivity matrix, followed by pseudoinversion-with and without truncation-is used to reconstruct images. The algorithm is a single-pass algorithm. Data from a saline filled tank and in vivo data during respiration and the cardiac cycle, acquired by using a Sheffield multifrequency system, are used to reconstruct images. The effect of different truncation levels on the reconstructed images is investigated.
