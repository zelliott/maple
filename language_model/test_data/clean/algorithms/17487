For flexible control of behaviour, it is important to associate preceding behavioural response with its outcome. Since the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) plays a major role in such control, it is likely that this area has a neuronal mechanism of coding response-outcome, such as reward/non-reward, based on the nature of the behavioural response made immediately before. To test this hypothesis, we examined neuronal activity in the dlPFC while monkeys performed a variant of the oculomotor delayed-response (ODR) task that had two reward conditions. In this task, the correct response was rewarded in half of the trials only and the subject could not expect the outcome (reward/non-reward). The response was followed by a fixation of 2 s (F2-period). We also employed a fixation (FIX) task that required monkeys to fixate on the peripheral target only, with two reward conditions that were similar to those in the ODR task. Post-response activity of a subset of dlPFC neurons was modulated by both the direction of the preceding response and its outcome. None of these neurons showed directional F2-period activity in the FIX task. These results suggest that a subset of dlPFC neurons represent response-outcome (i.e. reward/non-reward associated with directional saccade made immediately before).
