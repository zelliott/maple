The performance of a nuclear resonance detection system can be quantified using binary detection theory. Within this framework, signal averaging increases the probability of a correct detection and decreases the probability of a false alarm by reducing the variance of the noise in the average signal. In conjunction with signal averaging, we propose another method based on feedback control concepts that further improves detection performance. By maximizing the nuclear resonance signal amplitude, feedback raises the probability of correct detection. Furthermore, information generated by the feedback algorithm can be used to reduce the probability of false alarm. We discuss the advantages afforded by feedback that cannot be obtained using signal averaging. As an example, we show how this method is applicable to the detection of explosives using nuclear quadrupole resonance.
