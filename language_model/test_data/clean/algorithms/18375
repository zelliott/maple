As a matter of fact, in vitro dissolution is well known to be the method of choice for the pharmaceutical industry to develop effective medicines. However, many experiments must be performed all along a new product life and they represent an overcharge of work for researchers. The purpose of this paper was to assess the relevance of new parameters obtained during preformulation stage by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) experiments to better understand drug release mechanism. This study was carried out with three cellulose derivatives currently used as carrier matrices (Microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), Hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) and Ethyl cellulose (EC)). Granules and tablets were produced with these three excipients (60% w/w) and theophylline as drug model (40%). On the one hand, in vitro dissolution studies were performed with the rotating paddle method displaying the different release behaviour of these three matrices (immediate release for MCC, steady release for HPMC and sustained release for EC). On the other hand, the evolution of the T2m spin-spin relaxation time in NMR experiments during granules hydration was recorded. NMR findings shore up dissolution data, both depending on interactions between the matrix and water. NMR spectroscopy appears to be a valuable tool for obtaining, at an earlier stage of drug development, more information about drug release mechanism.
