By exploiting the error functions of explicit symplectic integrators for solving separable Hamiltonians, I show that it is possible to develop explicit time-reversible symplectic integrators for solving nonseparable Hamiltonians of the product form. The algorithms are unusual in that they are of fractional orders.
