This article presents a method for QTL interval mapping in autotetraploid species for a full-sib family derived by crossing two parents. For each offspring, the marker information on each chromosome is used to identify possible configurations of chromosomes inherited from the two parents and the locations of crossovers on these chromosomes. A branch and bound algorithm is used to identify configurations with the minimum number of crossovers. From these configurations, the conditional probability of each possible QTL genotype for a series of positions along the chromosome can be estimated. An iterative weighted regression is then used to relate the trait values to the QTL genotype probabilities. A simulation study is performed to assess this approach and to investigate the effects of the proportion of codominant to dominant markers, the heritability, and the population size. We conclude that the method successfully locates QTL and estimates their parameters accurately, and we discuss different modes of action of the QTL that may be modeled.
