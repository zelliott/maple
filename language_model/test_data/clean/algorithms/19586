The purpose of the study was to establish an algorithm for the reconstruction of soft tissue defects of the distal lower leg, ankle and heel.

81 patients presenting with soft tissue defects in these regions underwent flap coverage. The average age was 44.1 years. Small defects (up to 4 x 4 cm) were covered by local flaps. The neurovascular sural flap was the predominant flap procedure for medium size defects (up to 10 x 15 cm). Free flaps were used for larger defects or in cases of stenosis or occlusion of the peroneal artery. Femoro-crural bypasses were performed in three cases to improve peripheral arterial perfusion.

The reconstructive goals were achieved in 95% of the cases by performing reconstruction according to the established algorithm. Minor complications occurred in 29.6% of the cases.

The results appear to be very good considering a patient population with complex and predominantly contaminated wounds. A preoperative angiography represents an important part of the algorithm for flap reconstruction to detect abnormal arterial vascular conditions and thus to plan vascular reconstruction prior to or simultaneously with free flap coverage. Additionally, a non-patency of the peroneal artery represents a contraindication for sural flaps.
