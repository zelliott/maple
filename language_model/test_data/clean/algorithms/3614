For patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction who undergo revascularization, it is important to estimate the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) improvement after revascularization, as this is a strong indicator of the long-term outcome. Identification of viable segments from echocardiography has been considered a predictive sign of LVEF improvement. However, a quantitative relation between segmental function recovery and global ejection fraction improvement has not been established. There is a clinical need to determine parameters that are predictive to LVEF improvement. A cylindrical left ventricular model is proposed to establish the relation between segmental myocardial function and LVEF based on a 12-segment echocardiograph model. Model results show that LVEF improvement is directly related to the contraction ratio in normal segments and a weighted sum of the number of viable segments that recover to normal or hypokinetic, which is equal to a weighted sum of the change in wall motion scores. This new combined parameter is a better predictor of the amount of LVEF improvement than the total number of viable segments or preoperative ejection fraction. The predictive value of the model was illustrated in a group of four patients with coronary artery disease who underwent revascularization.
