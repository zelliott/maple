The surgical management of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) parathyroid disease and involvement of the endocrine pancreas remains controversial. Hyperparathyroidism, usually the first clinical manifestation of the syndrome, requires surgical treatment in nearly all patients. We favour a subtotal parathyroidectomy and cervical thymectomy rather than a total parathyroidectomy and autotransplant because of good long-term results and the absence of permanent hypoparathyroidism. The results of treating 34 MEN1 patients during a 20-year period are reported. The most common functional pancreatic or duodenal tumours in MEN1 patients are gastrinomas and insulinomas. In addition to the management of functional syndromes, another major concern is the malignant potential of the neuroendocrine tumours that frequently develop. Our surgical management of gastrinomas and the ZES has evolved over a period of 15 years. We have found that distal pancreatectomy, enucleation of any neoplasms in the head, and duodenotomy and excision of any neuroendocrine tumours (gastrinomas) combined with a regional node dissection are effective in the majority of patients. The results of treating 21 MEN1 patients with ZES are reported.
