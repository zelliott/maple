To describe our experience with a cuffed oesophageal prosthesis in the management of malignant oesophagoairway fistulas.

Retrospective study.

Teaching hospital, Denmark.

Nine patients treated with a balloon cuffed oesophageal prosthesis during the period 1987-93.

Endoscopic assessment of the fistula compared with the results and complications of treatment.

The prosthesis were inserted without complications. Eight patients had total relief of aspiration and were able to eat a semisolid diet. Three patients needed reintervention. Patients with little or no stenosis of the tumour seemed to be at considerable risk of dislodgement of the tube and those with large fistulas developed protrusion of the balloon into the tracheal lumen.

Intubation with the cuffed oesophageal prosthesis is safe and relatively inexpensive. Other treatments should be considered in patients with minor stenosis of the tumour or a large fistula.
