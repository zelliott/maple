This paper deals with contact currents that may occur when the human body is in contact with two electrodes at different electrical potentials, e.g., an electrical/electronic device and the floor. Actually, any device must comply not only with electromagnetic compatibility and safety requirements, but also with specific electromagnetic field exposure recommendations in order to prevent health hazards for the occupational and general public population. Since the contact currents depend on the applied voltage and on the human body impedance, this last parameter has been measured for several configurations in a broadband frequency range, from 40 Hz to 110 MHz. From the measurement results, a new equivalent circuit of the human body impedance is derived by using a vector-fitting procedure. This equivalent circuit is very easy and can be adopted for compliance tests against contact currents.
