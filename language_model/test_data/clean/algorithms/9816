DNA molecules under good solvent conditions condense when subjected to strong AC electrical fields. It is shown that AC electrical fields couple charge fluctuations to molecular shape fluctuations, which produces a non-equilibrium noise source that can dominate over equilibrium thermal noise in the long-wavelength limit. The field-induced excess charge fluctuations amplify the Asakura-Oosawa fluctuation attraction force between neighboring chains, providing a mechanism for field-induced DNA condensation.
