We present results for the comparison of six deconvolution techniques. The methods we consider are based on Fourier transforms, system identification, constrained optimization, the use of cubic spline basis functions, maximum entropy, and a genetic algorithm. We compare the performance of these techniques by applying them to simulated noisy data, in order to extract an input function when the unit impulse response is known. The simulated data are generated by convolving the known impulse response with each of five different input functions, and then adding noise of constant coefficient of variation. Each algorithm was tested on 500 data sets, and we define error measures in order to compare the performance of the different methods.
