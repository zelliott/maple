Vascular segmentation has recently been given much attention. This review paper has two parts. Part I focuses on the physics of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) generation and prefiltering techniques applied to MRA data sets. Part II of the review focuses on the vessel segmentation algorithms. The first section of this paper introduces the five different sets of receive coils used with the MRI system for magnetic resonance angiography data acquisition. This section then presents the five different types of the most popular data acquisition techniques: time-of-flight (TOF), phase-contrast, contrast-enhanced, black-blood, T2-weighted, and T2*-weighted, along with their pros and cons. Section II of this paper focuses on prefiltering algorithms for MRA data sets. This is necessary for removing the background nonvascular structures in the MRA data sets. Finally, the paper concludes with a clinical discussion on the challenges and the future of the data acquisition and the automated filtering algorithms.
