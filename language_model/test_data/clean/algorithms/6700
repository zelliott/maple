We present a new numerical model of cascaded Raman fiber lasers that takes into account the chromatic dispersion of the fiber and includes the full spectrum of the intracavity field. This model explains and describes remarkably well a new operating regime found experimentally and reveals that chromatic dispersion is truly a new degree of freedom in the design of cascaded Raman lasers.
