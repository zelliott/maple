To evaluate the impact of conservative oncoplastic techniques in a surgery program for women with breast cancer.

The study group was composed of women who underwent a conservative oncoplastic technique and the control group consisted of women who underwent conservative (tumorectomy/quadrantectomy) and radical (mastectomy) techniques. Women with tumors smaller than 3 cm, axillary clinical stages N0-N1a-b and multifocal processes (infiltrating and/or in situ) were eligible for inclusion. Women with T3-4 tumors and reduced breast volume, and those in whom postoperative radiotherapy and disease-free margins during intraoperative study were not feasible were excluded.

One hundred sixty women underwent surgery during the study period. Fifty oncoplastic techniques (29 to avoid mastectomy and 21 to improve the result of a conservative technique), 57 conservative techniques and 53 mastectomies were performed. The techniques used for breast reconstruction were superior mammoplasty with transversal scar (23 patients), mammoplasty with superior pedicle (10 patients), mammoplasty with inferior pedicle (10 patients), J-shapped mammoplasty (four patients) and oblique mammoplasty (three patients). The mean operating time in the group undergoing oncoplastic techniques (131 minutes) was higher than that in the group undergoing conservative (56 minutes) and radical (93 minutes) techniques. The incidence of postoperative complications was higher with radical techniques (35%), mainly due to axillary seromas after lymphadenectomy, than with conservative (25%) and oncoplastic (24%) techniques.

Oncoplastic techniques are an effective and efficient alternative to conventional surgical techniques in women with breast cancer.
