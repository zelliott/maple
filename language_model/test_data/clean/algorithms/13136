To demonstrate the feasibility and technical features of the WaveLight FS200 femtosecond laser (WaveLight GmbH) in refractive and corneal laser surgery.

The reproducibility of femtosecond laser-created flap dimensions and channels used for corneal ring segment implantation were measured by means of an optical coherence tomography system in porcine corneas. The increase in the intraocular pressure (IOP) during applanation with the corneal interface was measured by means of an IOP sensor. The possibility of creating a channel for gas diffusion within the stroma was investigated to minimize opaque bubble layer formation.

The technical features, such as optical design, pulse energy, and scanning algorithms at a high repetition rate, allow reproducibility for tissue cutting with a standard deviation of <10 Î¼m in depth and 0.1 mm laterally. Intraocular pressure increases up to 150 mmHg during applanation. The use of a gas channel minimizes the creation of an opaque bubble layer during the femtosecond laser procedure.

The WaveLight FS200 femtosecond laser provides a high reproducibility for cutting three-dimensional tissue structures. The IOP increase is comparable to other microkeratomes and femtosecond lasers. The minimized opaque bubble layers allow the surgeon to perform an excimer laser treatment immediately after FS200 flap creation.
