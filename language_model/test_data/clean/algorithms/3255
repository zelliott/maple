Bone is able to adapt itself to the mechanical and biological environment by changing its porosity and/or orientation of its internal microstructure in a process known as bone remodelling. As a consequence, a change of bone mechanical properties is produced leading to an optimum structure, able to bear the external loads with the minimum weight. This adaptation is carried out by a temporal association of cells known as BMUs (basic multicellular units) that resorb old bone and sometimes produce new organic extracellular matrix (osteoid) that is later mineralized. This involves changes in porosity, damage level (density of microcracks accumulated by cyclic loads) and mineral content. All of these features were taken into account in a previous model, but the whole process and therefore the resulting bone constitutive behaviour was considered isotropic. The model proposed herein, recognizing that bone is actually anisotropic, tries to explain how BMUs modify the anisotropy by changing their progressing direction. We check the potential of the model to predict the alignment of the bone microstructure with the external loads in different situations. Then, the model is also applied to obtain the anisotropy and mechanical properties of the human proximal femur under physiological loads with initial conditions corresponding to a heterogeneous, but otherwise isotropic bone.
