The authors describe a pressure ulcer prevention program implemented across a large healthcare system in Minnesota. An interprofessional team of representatives from 10 hospitals developed a bundle of interventions directed at measurement standardization, provider education, patient/family education and point-of-care resources for providers, timely nutritional assessment, and a novel Skin Day event intended to increase awareness. The number of pressure ulcers reported to the State of Minnesota decreased 33% after implementation of the program with a potential cost savings of up to $430,000.
