Patients with underlying liver disease often present for non-liver-related surgery and are at risk for postoperative decompensation. Several predictive models exist to determine the risk of morbidity and mortality after surgery in such patients, but the risk depends on the severity of liver disease and also the type and urgency of the surgery. Clinicians should be cognizant of the various risk assessment tools and incorporate them into their practice when encountering patients with liver disease undergoing surgery.
