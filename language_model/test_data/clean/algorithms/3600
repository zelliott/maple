In the literature, conventional 3D inverse dynamic models are limited in three aspects related to inverse dynamic notation, body segment parameters and kinematic formalism. First, conventional notation yields separate computations of the forces and moments with successive coordinate system transformations. Secondly, the way conventional body segment parameters are defined is based on the assumption that the inertia tensor is principal and the centre of mass is located between the proximal and distal ends. Thirdly, the conventional kinematic formalism uses Euler or Cardanic angles that are sequence-dependent and suffer from singularities. In order to overcome these limitations, this paper presents a new generic method for inverse dynamics. This generic method is based on wrench notation for inverse dynamics, a general definition of body segment parameters and quaternion algebra for the kinematic formalism.
