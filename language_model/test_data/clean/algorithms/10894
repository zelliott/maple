Physiological, laboratory and instrumental parameters were evaluated at the day of antibiotic therapy cancel, on discharge from hospital, on the 5-th and 15-th day of MR. The peroxidation activity, intensity of unspecific resistance mechanisms and obstructive impairment of bronchial passages remained during CAP late phases.
