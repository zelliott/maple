A dipole equivalent generator of heart is considered, which represents a circuit containing an active, capacitive and inductive resistance. The model makes it possible to solve a direct diagnostic task for the electric systole. A differential equation for the integral electrical vector of the heart in the dipole approximation was solved. A model vector electrocardiogram and a linear electrocardiogram for the electrical heart parameters are presented.
