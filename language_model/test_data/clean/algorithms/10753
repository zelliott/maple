In this paper, a new, fully-automatic method for the quantification of brain atrophy based on CT volume data is put forward by taking advantage of the characteristics of cerebral CT images in combination with the prior medical knowledge. This algorithm has been verified through the calculation of 2388 cases of normal and brain atrophy subjects.
