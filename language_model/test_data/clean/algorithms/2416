Achievement of mineral targets in patients receiving dialysis remains challenging. This study sought to evaluate outcomes for phosphorus, calcium, and parathyroid hormone when a dialysis population was switched from a predominantly active vitamin D analogue treatment regimen to a computerized algorithm incorporating both cinacalcet and active vitamin D as potential first-line therapies.

This longitudinal prospective trial enrolled 92 patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. Baseline measures (the average of the 3 months before computerized algorithm implementation) were compared with the proportion of patients achieving the prespecified targets at 6 and 12 months.

After 6 months there was a statistically significant improvement in the percentage of patients achieving the primary and secondary phosphorus targets (primary: phosphorus â‰¤ 5.5 mg/dl, increase from 41% to 75%, P<0.001; secondary: phosphorus 3.0-4.6 mg/dl, increase from 16% to 38%; P=0.005). These improvements were sustained at 12 months. There was a statistically significant improvement in the percentage of patients achieving all three prespecified secondary endpoints (an increase from 12.8% to 25.6% at 12 months; P=0.04); however, this was mainly driven by improved phosphorus control. The proportion of patients achieving the primary or secondary parathyroid hormone targets did not improve.

A greater proportion of dialysis patients achieved improved phosphorus but not parathyroid hormone control by switching from a predominantly active vitamin D analogue-based treatment regimen for mineral and bone disorder to a computer-driven algorithm that incorporated cinacalcet and low-dose active vitamin D analogues as first-line therapy.
