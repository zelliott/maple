Primary care physicians and specialists often refer patients to the emergency department with a specific diagnosis and request for admission. Such an external diagnosis frequently influences the initial evaluation in the emergency department. The present study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of such external diagnoses and to assess the consequences of incorrect diagnoses on length of stay and number of specialty consultations in the emergency department.

This was a prospective observational study over the course of 3 months in the emergency department of a tertiary care center. External admission diagnoses made by primary care physicians and specialists were categorized as "accurate", "partially accurate" and "inaccurate". A special analysis of the external admission diagnosed was performed for patients admitted directly to an intermediary care unit and intensive care unit or patients who were transferred directly from the emergency department to the operating room.

Data for 784 patients were analyzed. Patients were on average 63.1 ± 19.5 years old (minimum-maximum 18-97 years, median 68 years) and 54 % were male. After emergency department evaluation and treatment 57.8 % of external diagnoses were categorized as accurate, 23.6 % as partially accurate and 18.6 % as inaccurate. Patients with partially accurate and inaccurate diagnoses had a 3 and 6.5 times higher rate of specialty consultations in the emergency department, respectively, when compared with patients with an accurate diagnosis (number of specialty consultations n = 0: 77.3 % vs. 54.1 % vs. 92.9 %, p < 0.05; n = 1: 20.0 % vs. 40.4 % vs. 6.2 %, p < 0.05; n = 2: 2.7 % vs. 5.5 % vs. 0.9 %, p < 0.05, respectively. Patients with an accurate diagnosis had a shorter total length of stay than patients with a partially accurate or inaccurate diagnosis [mean ± SD (min-max; median): 192 ± 108 min (10-707 min; 181 min) vs. 246 ± 126 min (27-1,026 min; 214 min) vs. 258 ± 138 min (22-700 min; 232 min), p < 0.001], respectively. Out of 85 patients admitted directly to an intermediary care unit, intensive care unit and patients who were transferred directly from the emergency department to the operating room the diagnosis was accurate, partially accurate and inaccurate in 56.5 %, 24.7 % and 18.8 %, respectively.

Admission diagnoses made by primary care physicians and specialists who subsequently refer patients to the emergency department are subject to certain inaccuracies. Inaccurate admission diagnoses are associated with an increased length of stay and a considerably higher rate of specialty consultation in the emergency department. Standardized operating procedures, treatment algorithms and triage systems are important to identify such incorrect diagnoses so that these patients can undergo appropriate diagnostic investigation and treatment.
