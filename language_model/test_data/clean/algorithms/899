A strategy is described for the rapid alignment of many long nucleic acid or protein sequences on a microcomputer. The program described can handle up to 100 sequences of 1200 residues each. The approach is based on progressively aligning sequences according to the branching order in an initial phylogenetic tree. The results obtained using the package appear to be as sensitive as those from any other available method.
