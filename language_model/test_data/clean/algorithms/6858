Permanent childhood hearing impairment is a serious public health problem. Identification by screening in the first few months of life has the potential to improve affected children development. Neonatal hearing screening programs endorse the WHO requirement for a cost efficient screening. This paper shows the implementation of a medium-size hospital-based universal newborn hearing screening program using transient evoked otoacoustic emissions. Operational procedures and requirements are discussed. Quality control and results are showed.
