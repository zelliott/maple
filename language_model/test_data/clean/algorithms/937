The overall cure rate for gastric cancer has changed relatively little in the United States over the past 30 years, largely because patients continue to present for treatment in advanced stages. The paucity of symptoms in early gastric cancer, the low incidence in the general United States population, and the lack of cost-effective screening methods suggest that improvements in early detection are unlikely. Hope for improved survival in late stage cases lies mostly in a better understanding of the pathophysiology and patterns of spread, in evolving techniques for more accurate perioperative staging, and in the gradually improving results of multimodality therapy for local-regional and systemic disease. A proposal is made for a new staging system integrating newer approaches to staging and for controlled trials of multimodality therapy in patients unlikely to be cured by surgery alone.
