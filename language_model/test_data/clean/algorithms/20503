A classification for periprosthetic tibial fractures is presented. It is based on the anatomic location of the fracture in reference to the tibial component; whether the fracture occurred during surgery or in the postoperative period; and whether the prosthesis is radiographically well-fixed or loose. A treatment algorithm is proposed for each fracture type.
