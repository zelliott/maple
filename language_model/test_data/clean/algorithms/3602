Micro-finite element (FE) analysis is a well established technique for the evaluation of the elastic properties of trabecular bone, but is limited in its application due to the large number of elements that it requires to represent the complex internal structure of the bone. In this paper, we present an alternative FE approach that makes use of a recently developed 3D-Line Skeleton Graph Analysis (LSGA) technique to represent the complex internal structure of trabecular bone as a network of simple straight beam elements in which the beams are assigned geometrical properties of the trabeculae that they represent. Since an enormous reduction of cputime can be obtained with this beam modeling approach, ranging from approximately 1,200 to 3,600 for the problems investigated here, we think that the FE modeling technique that we introduced could potentially constitute an interesting alternative for the evaluation of the elastic mechanical properties of trabecular bone.
