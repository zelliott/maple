The assessment of competency is a legal and judicial one, often resting heavily on a medical evaluation. According to one set of criteria, the primary elements of mental competency are based on an individual's awareness of the nature of the present situation, factual understanding of the issues at hand and ability to manipulate information rationally to reach a decision. Family physicians can play pivotal roles in the process of competency determination.
