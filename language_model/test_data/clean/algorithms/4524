An analysis system was developed to evaluate the sliding behavior of a liquid droplet on a hydrophobic surface. This system enables continuous and simultaneous measurement of both the sliding acceleration and shape deformation during the sliding of a liquid droplet. Moreover, the velocity vector of the internal fluidity of a sliding droplet was obtained by employing particle image velocimetry in the analysis system. This evaluation method pioneers the measurement of the dynamic wettability of a hydrophobic solid surface.
