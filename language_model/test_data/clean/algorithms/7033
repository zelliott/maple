Pocket computers provide the physician's (expert's) advice at home and by that may increase the number of self-adapting diabetics and alleviate documentation and evaluation of therapy data. By a more complex quantitative approach metabolic control may be improved beyond the range which is attained by optimal intensified education, as clinical trials showed. By their reproducible measures a learning process seems to be induced in the patients. Risks like hyperinsulinisation may be overcome by watch dog functions and suitable algorithms. In addition to these patient-oriented functions the automatic data acquisition may be used for secondary PC-assisted data interpretation and more complex advice at the physicians office. For compliance reasons the system concept has to be user-friendly considering size, easy handling and compensating for the loss of a written log book by adequate display.
