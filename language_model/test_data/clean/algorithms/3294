We show that in nonlinear systems dynamical order can be reached through the flows of matter, energy, and information, which can be non uniformly spread over the organism due to self-trapping induced by the correlated coherence domains of interfacial water. Endogenous electromagnetic field is self trapped in these domains and forms the dynamical pathways as wave-guides, along which these flows can occur via soliton mechanisms. Solitons in the pathways can be stimulated either by intrinsic dynamics or by external stimuli and can be visualized in the infrared range as bright or dark solitons. The formation of such pathways is the consequence of coherence-non coherence transitions occurring in the biological cycle of the organism. A rational therapy appears then to be the induction of conditions for soliton existence necessary for maintaining the coherence of the system.
