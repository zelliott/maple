Correct arterial input function (AIF) measurements in dynamic susceptibility contrast-MRI are crucial for quantification of the hemodynamic parameters. Often a single global AIF is selected near a large brain-feeding artery. Alternatively, local AIF measurements aim for voxel-specific AIFs from smaller arteries. Because local AIFs are measured higher in the arterial-tree, it is assumed that these will reflect the true input of the microvasculature much better. However, do the measured local AIFs reflect the true concentration-time curves of small arteries? To answer this question, in vivo data were used to evaluate local AIF candidates selected based on two different types of angiograms. For interpretation purposes, a 3D numerical model that simulated partial-volume effects in local AIF measurements was created and the simulated local AIFs were compared to the ground truth. The findings are 2-fold. First, the in vivo data showed that the shape-characteristics of local AIFs are similar to the shape-characteristics of gray matter concentration-time curves. Second, these findings are supported by the simulations showing broadening of the measured local AIFs compared to the ground truth. These findings are suggesting that local AIF measurements do not necessarily reflect the true concentration-time curve in small arteries.
