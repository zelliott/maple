Noise abounds in different signal transduction pathways. Even though the noise effects are extensively studied, the indirect influence of noise on other transduction section is seldom reported. In this work, the calcium signal induced and optimized by agonist release noise is reported. Simulation results prove that the signal is more sensitive to the "frequency noise" than to the often discussed "amplitude noise". This is an important finding for signal transduction in complex pathways, which suggests that frequency fluctuations in the signaling cascade may have greater influence than the amplitude ones.
