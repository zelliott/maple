Constipation is a frequent clinical disorder in pediatric age and it is often difficult to resolve without a suitable diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Parents and pediatrician often underestimate this pathology, reaching the specialist only when it has already shown its complications. In the Department of Pediatric Surgery of Siena, in the last 10 years, we have activated a study centre on constipation in the pediatric age and we have developed a diagnostic and therapeutic protocol to give indications on the type of constipation and the consequent therapy. The Authors report their experience on 174 children with chronic constipation. The patients underwent a scintigraphic colonic transit time evaluation by radionuclides, an enema and an anorectal manometry. Such examinations were able to divide patients into two groups: with colonic and rectal constipation. The management consisted in common dietetic, behavioural and pharmacological treatment at first and then of specific treatment (biofeedback, prokinetic, emicolectomy), according to the type. The follow up showed recovery or improvement in 83.53% cases, unchanged clinical condition in 8.57%, aggravation in 1.9%. The Authors conclude emphasising the importance of diagnostic techniques that allow to frame correctly the pediatric patient affected by constipation. Particularly the anorectal manometry can be considered a first level examination, able to identify rectal constipation; together with scintigraphic colonic transit time that individualizes colonic constipation. The right diagnosis will be able to give a suitable therapeutic treatment.
