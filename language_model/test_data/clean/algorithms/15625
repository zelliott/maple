The dynamics of migration of electronic excitations and the efficiency of their trapping in two-dimensional ensembles of molecules were analyzed. Molecules were characterized using the following parameters: the width of long-wavelength bands, the values of extinction and rate constant of deactivation of electronic excitations, critical distances of migration close to those of dye molecules, in particular, bacteriochlorophyll a and purple bacteria. A comparative analysis of two-dimensional models of energy migration made it possible to chose a model with an optimum light-harvesting on traps from the largest numbers of light-absorbing molecules. It was shown that in ensembles of molecules having different spectral characteristics (spectral shifts between the short- and long-wavelength fractions of the molecules are hear 800 cm-1) the efficiency of excitation trapping is approximately 90 and 80% for the number of light-harvesting molecules per one trap 210 and 580, respectively.
