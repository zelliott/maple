The efficacy of the two-compound formulation (TCF) product containing calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate applied once daily in psoriasis has been demonstrated in phase III trials but no randomised clinical trial comparing all commonly used topical treatments exists. The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of once-daily use of the TCF product relative to other commonly used topical agents in plaque psoriasis.

Data on change in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score from baseline and PASI 75 (percentage of patients achieving a 75% reduction in PASI score), after 4 weeks of treatment were obtained by means of a systematic literature review of randomised controlled trials and synthesised with a Bayesian mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis.

Relative to all active interventions, except for the unlicensed twice-daily application of the TCF product, the TCF once daily showed a greater efficacy based on PASI 75 response (relative risk ranging from 1.22 to 3.18) and improvement in PASI score from baseline (difference in % CFB PASI between TCF once daily and other active interventions ranged from 4.01 to 49.68).

Among topical therapies evaluated, TCF once daily can be considered the most efficacious treatment for plaque psoriasis.
