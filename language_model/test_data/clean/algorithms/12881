We theoretically investigate coupled Fano structures which combine the characteristics of both directly coupled Fabry-Perot cavities (DCFPC) and a side-coupled integrated spaced sequence of resonators (SCISSOR). Asymmetric and symmetric Fano resonances in a single and doubly-coupled Fano unit are analytically derived based on Fabry-Perot approach. It is found that doubly-coupled Fano units show a special asymmetric EIT-like lineshape. This structure shows an index changing sensitivity of 10(-6), about two orders higher than that of the single Fano resonator, which is promising for index sensor application. A unique frequency detuning method of EIT like lineshape is also found in the doubly-coupled Fano units. The multiple coupled Fano unit structure demonstrates potentials for applications of tunable optical filter and slow light, whereas for the latter it shows much higher group delay than that of SCISSORS and DCFPC with the same parameters.
