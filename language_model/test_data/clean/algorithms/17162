Previously we reported the results of a series of experimental tests using PC-12 cells to examine the biological effect of prescribed combinations of both nerve growth factor and magnetic fields. Because our assay of the PC-12 cells is based on binary classification of the cells following treatment, our data might be expected to have a binomial distribution. However, our data consistently show a smaller variability than that predicted by the binomial distribution model. In this paper, we examine some possible reasons for this reduction in variability in our results.
