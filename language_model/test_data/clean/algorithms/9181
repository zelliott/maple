Chronic venous insufficiency continues to be a major source of disability and cost, with accompanying socio-economic burdens. Incompetent perforator veins play a significant role in chronic venous insufficiency. This article describes the technique of radiofrequency ablation of incompetent perforating veins for patients with chronic venous insufficiency. Patient evaluation, the evolution of the treatment technique, and details of current treatment are provided. Radiofrequency ablation of incompetent perforating veins is feasible, has promising early results, and extends the armamentarium of minimally invasive venous treatments.
