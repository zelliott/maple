We investigate the effects of additive noise on coupled excitable chemical oscillators, particularly focusing on how oscillatory coupled modes can be induced by noise. We find that phase locking in the weak coupling regime occurs through coherence resonance, although the resulting phase locking modes are apparently similar to those in coupled deterministic oscillators. Experimental observations are approximately reproduced in a numerical simulation with a forced Oregonator reaction-diffusion model.
