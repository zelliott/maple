Sinus disease and its surgical treatment carry the risk of orbital complications, including the possibility of blindness. These complications apply to traditional sinus procedures and the more recent endoscopic approach. Two recent endoscopic cases resulted in eye complications, and the lessons learned in their management are herein shared. One case was complicated in the immediate postoperative period with an orbital haematoma that required urgent decompression through lateral canthotomy/cantholysis. The second case involved a patient who complained of visual changes starting 5 days after an uncomplicated procedure. Ophthalmologic consultation diagnosed amblyopia, which he had preoperatively. A preoperative visual assessment is highly recommended to avoid possible medicolegal misadventures.
