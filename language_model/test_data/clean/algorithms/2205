After a long gestation, the elucidation of the crystal structures of proteins at atomic resolution is now maturing. The use of such data for both refinement and structure solution is advancing space. The necessary technology is generally available, in terms of data collection, computing hardware and software. The structures appearing in the literature mainly relate to demonstration projects on native proteins. The importance of these alone is already obvious. Biologically significant results, in terms of ligand complexes and prosthetic groups, are just starting to emerge.
