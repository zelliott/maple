This paper proposes a high precision Gaussian Mixture Model-based novel Boundary Detection 3D (BD3D) scheme with reasonable implementation cost for 3D cases by selecting a minimum number of Boundary sensor Nodes (BNs) in continuous moving objects. It shows apparent advantages in that two classes of boundary and non-boundary sensor nodes can be efficiently classified using the model selection techniques for finite mixture models; furthermore, the set of sensor readings within each sensor node's spatial neighbors is formulated using a Gaussian Mixture Model; different from DECOMO [1] and COBOM [2], we also formatted a BN Array with an additional own sensor reading to benefit selecting Event BNs (EBNs) and non-EBNs from the observations of BNs. In particular, we propose a Thick Section Model (TSM) to solve the problem of transition between 2D and 3D. It is verified by simulations that the BD3D 2D model outperforms DECOMO and COBOM in terms of average residual energy and the number of BNs selected, while the BD3D 3D model demonstrates sound performance even for sensor networks with low densities especially when the value of the sensor transmission range (r) is larger than the value of Section Thickness (d) in TSM. We have also rigorously proved its correctness for continuous geometric domains and full robustness for sensor networks over 3D terrains.
