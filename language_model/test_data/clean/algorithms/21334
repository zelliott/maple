An approach is presented to display and analyze epidemiologic data using population density equalized maps (cartograms). The algorithm for generating these maps is discussed. A specific method for statistically analyzing plotted data is given, followed by an application of maps and analysis to 73 sets of age-, race-, sex-, and site-specific cancer incidence data. The data were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results project for San Francisco City/County (1978-1981) and combined with 1980 U.S. Census data.
