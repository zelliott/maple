Direct Haptic rendering of voxels from an anatomical dataset provides patient specific haptic feedback vital for diagnosis and surgical planning. Our algorithm uses zero sets of scalar trivariate function for polynomial interpolation with sixty-four neighborhood points to generate isosurfaces on the fly for haptic rendering. This approach gives continuity in surfaces as well as better capture of isosurface features of the medical dataset. The detailed algorithm is presented along with the description of results from haptically rendering medical datasets.
