An ultrasensitive solid-phase fluorescence resonance energy quenching (FREQ) method for determination of 1,4-dihydroxybenzene (DHB) using mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA)-capped CdTe quantum dots (QDs) immobilized on silica nanoparticles (NPs) as donors was developed. In the method, silica NPs were first modified with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTS). Then, MSA-capped CdTe QDs were immobilized on the surface of the APTS-modified silica NPs. Finally, DHB in the solution was attached to the empty sites on the surface of silica NPs with QDs through electrostatic interaction. The fluorescence emission of the QDs was quenched by the proximal DHB molecules on the silica NPs. The quenching efficiency of the solid-phase FREQ method was 200-times higher than that of the solution-phase FREQ method. Using the ultrasensitive solid-phase FREQ method, DHB as low as 2.4Ã—10(-12) mol/L could be detected. The method was applied to quantify trace DHB in water samples.
