Algorithms of secondary structure prediction have undergone the developments of nearly 30 years. However, the problem of how to appropriately evaluate and compare algorithms has not yet completely solved. A graphic method to evaluate algorithms of secondary structure prediction has been proposed here. Traditionally, the performance of an algorithm is evaluated by a number, i.e., accuracy of various definitions. Instead of a number, we use a graph to completely evaluate an algorithm, in which the mapping points are distributed in a three-dimensional space. Each point represents the predictive result of the secondary structure of a protein. Because the distribution of mapping points in the 3D space generally contains more information than a number or a set of numbers, it is expected that algorithms may be evaluated and compared by the proposed graphic method more objectively. Based on the point distribution, six evaluation parameters are proposed, which describe the overall performance of the algorithm evaluated. Furthermore, the graphic method is simple and intuitive. As an example of application, two advanced algorithms, i.e., the PHD and NNpredict methods, are evaluated and compared. It is shown that there is still much room for further improvement for both algorithms. It is pointed out that the accuracy for predicting either the alpha-helix or beta-strand in proteins with higher alpha-helix or beta-strand content, respectively, should be greatly improved for both algorithms.
