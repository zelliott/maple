In this work, we present the development of a method for the determination of doxorubicin in plasma samples in the presence of an unexpected component (riboflavin) by using total synchronous fluorescence spectroscopic data matrices. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the second-order advantage is obtained with this kind of data. Two strategies including unfolding the data and: (a) processing with multivariate curve resolution coupled to alternating least-squares as first-order data or (b) processing with unfolded partial least-squares and exploiting the second-order advantage by the residual bilinearization procedure were considered. The calibration set was built with human plasma samples spiked with doxorubicin, while the validation set was prepared with human plasma samples spiked with both doxorubicin and riboflavin, a drug whose spectrum highly overlaps with the one corresponding to doxorubicin. Both methodologies reached good indicators of accuracy: recoveries of ca. 100 Â± 8% and REP of ca. 5%; and precision: coefficient of variations between 7 and 9%.
