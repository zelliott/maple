Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory and possibly destructive form of arthritis. As in rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, the use of biological therapy in psoriatic arthritis is a therapeutic revolution: both articular and cutaneous efficacy have been shown, and some improvement is visible on radiography. The benefit-risk ratio will improve when we learn to identify more accurately the patients likely to benefit from these treatments.
