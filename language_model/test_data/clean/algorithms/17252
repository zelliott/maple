Papanicolaou (Pap) tests reported as CIN I (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, grade 1) may be subject to laboratory misclassification because of screening and interpretative errors. A peer-groupC consensus review was conducted to measure the misclassification rate of Pap tests reported as CIN I and to analyze the undercalled and overcalled tests for due cause. Four hundred and forty-nine Pap tests originally reported as CIN I were independently reviewed twice by a panel of four pathologists, and disagreements were resolved by consensus review. Results were based on the original screening for the first review and, following the removal of those markings, were based on a second, independent rescreening for the second review. A review result of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) favoring LSIL was equated with the original CIN I result. Final classification was based on the second consensus review. Misclassified tests were categorized as screening or interpretative errors, based on a comparison of the review classifications. LSIL and ASCUS favoring LSIL were reported in 85.1% and 73.9% of the first and second reviews, respectively. In the final classification there were 362 (80.6%) LSIL and ASCUS-LSIL and 87 (19.4%) misclassifications: 31 (6.9%) undercalls and 56 (12.5%) overcalls. Screening error accounted for 35.5% of undercalled tests, and the remainder were interpretative errors, as were all those overcalled. In this study, Pap tests reported as CIN I were subject to misclassification because of a laboratory error in 19.4% of tests. Reductions in screening and interpretative errors were identified as mechanisms for improving accuracy. Diagn. Cytopathol. 1999;21:129-136.
