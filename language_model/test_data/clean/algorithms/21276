Forty-three patients with fetal cardiac dysrhythmia were referred to a tertiary ultrasound department for further evaluation. The patients were subdivided according to the type of dysrhythmia diagnosed. All patients with irregular fetal heart rate had a good perinatal outcome. Of the six patients with fetal tachycardia, two required in utero therapy with maternal digoxin, and one of these fetuses had a cardiac tumor. The eleven patients with fetal bradycardia had the worst perinatal outcome, with four deaths occurring. The results suggest that all patients with fetal tachycardia or bradycardia should have a complete fetal cardiac assessment in a center experienced with the management of such cases.
