Status epilepticus (SE) is an emergency situation for the neurologist as for the critical care physician, because it is caused by a focal or by a generalized severe brain suffering. Therefore, SE must be treated as soon as possible. The management, beyond a rapid and accurate diagnosis, must include the identification of the cause of SE, whereas seizures must be rapidly stopped.
