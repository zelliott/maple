Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of organothiol molecules prepared on noble metal substrates are known to exert considerable influence over biomineral nucleation and growth and, as such, offer model templates for investigation of the processes of directed biomineralization. Identifying the structural evolution of SAM/crystal systems is essential for a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms by which organic monolayers mediate mineral growth. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) provides the attractive ability to study SAM structure at critical stages throughout the processes of crystallization in SAM/mineral systems. Here, we discuss important theoretical and experimental considerations for designing and implementing XAS studies of SAM/mineral systems.
