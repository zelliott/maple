We present two efficient iterative Monte Carlo algorithms in the grand canonical ensemble with which the chemical potentials corresponding to prescribed (targeted) partial densities can be determined. The first algorithm works by always using the targeted densities in the kT log(rho(i)) (ideal gas) terms and updating the excess chemical potentials from the previous iteration. The second algorithm extrapolates the chemical potentials in the next iteration from the results of the previous iteration using a first order series expansion of the densities. The coefficients of the series, the derivatives of the densities with respect to the chemical potentials, are obtained from the simulations by fluctuation formulas. The convergence of this procedure is shown for the examples of a homogeneous Lennard-Jones mixture and a NaCl-CaCl(2) electrolyte mixture in the primitive model. The methods are quite robust under the conditions investigated. The first algorithm is less sensitive to initial conditions.
