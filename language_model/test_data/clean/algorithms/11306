In this paper, we evaluate the discrimination power of structural superindices. Superindices for graphs represent measures composed of other structural indices. In particular, we compare the discrimination power of the superindices with those of individual graph descriptors. In addition, we perform a statistical analysis to generalize our findings to large graphs.
