Several pharmacokinetic processes are affected by enantioselectivity (ES). At the level of distribution, protein binding (PB) is one of the most important. The enantioselective binding of fluoxetine (FLX) to HSA has been evaluated in this work by ultrafiltration of FLXâ€“HSA mixtures and chiral analysis of unbound fractions by EKC-CD. PB, affinity constants (K) and ES were obtained for both enantiomers of FLX. In order to improve the consistency of the estimations, the evaluation of affinity constants of each enantiomer was performed using two designs, one keeping constant the total concentration of protein and varying the total concentration of the enantiomers, and the other in the opposite way, in both cases via an unusual short-concentration interval strategy to assure model validity. Different mathematical approaches were compared and characterised and some of them, judged as the most consistent under the experimental conditions used, were selected to provide final estimates. Quality considerations include criteria for three critical aspects: (i) detecting/eliminating outliers, (ii) checking the number of binding sites in the protein and (iii) evaluating the robustness of each approach. The differences on estimates from the selected approaches were used as an uncertainty source to delimit the reported values. The ES of HSA for FLX enantiomers was approximate. Estimates include the assumptions of independent and competitive models. In the last case, a SIMPLEX function was designed capable of simultaneously optimizing the non-linear binding models for both enantiomers, thus improving the consistence of results.
