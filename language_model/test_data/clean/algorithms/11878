A pharmacy database for tracking drug costs and physician prescribing trends is described. Accuracy problems plagued data systems used to make drug-use-policy decisions at a tertiary care teaching hospital because of structural deficiencies within the systems and their nonclinical orientation. To resolve these problems, a programmer analyst, a clinical supervisor, and a clinical pharmacist developed a hierarchical database of drug costs. The database was designed to be valid for tracking drug costs according to patterns of clinical use. Internal controls were created that could identify and correct cost-tabulation errors arising within the ordering, order-entry, and billing processes. The database was able to tabulate drug costs according to the clinical service on which the patient was being treated at the time so that reports could compare aggregate prescribing trends from one time period to another for the same service. Similarly, the database could track and report drug use by disease or financial classification. Flagging elements were introduced to the database for cancer chemotherapy and antimicrobial drug products to enable reporting by these categories and by therapeutic subcategories within the antimicrobial category. Routine monthly reports were distributed to end users. Development of a database for tracking drug costs and utilization allowed a teaching hospital to derive the cost of medications from billing-charge information and to report data to health care professionals on the basis of important factors like clinical services.
