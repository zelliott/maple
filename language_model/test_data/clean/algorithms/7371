Gene duplication is considered to be a major driving force in evolution that enables the genome of a species to acquire new functions. A reconciliation--a mapping of gene tree vertices to the edges or vertices of a species tree--explains where gene duplications have occurred on the species tree. In this study, we sample reconciliations from a posterior over reconciliations, gene trees, edge lengths and other parameters, given a species tree and gene sequences. We employ a Bayesian analysis tool, based on the probabilistic model DLRS that integrates gene duplication, gene loss and sequence evolution under a relaxed molecular clock for substitution rates, to obtain this posterior.
