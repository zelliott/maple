Prostate cancer is currently one of the main causes of urological practice workload. Patients with negative prostate biopsies may pose serious problems to the urologist in the decision making process for follow-up due to the lack of definitive data in the follow-up algorithm. MRI spectroscopy seems to open a diagnostic window evaluating prostatic metabolic changes. The performance of perineal prostatic biopsy with stabilizer and template enables selective biopsy of the suspect voxels following the spectroscopic study, simulating the Rubick's cube.
