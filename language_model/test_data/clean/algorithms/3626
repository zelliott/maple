The identification of nonsense syllables in quiet and in three types of background (babble, cafeteria and single female speaker) was measured using four hearing aid compression algorithms differing in attack and release time constants, and using linear amplification. The speech level was always 65 dB SPL. The compression algorithms, which were implemented in a Phonak Claro ITE hearing aid, were: (1) 'very fast'--the attack time was 8 ms and the release time was 32 ms, for all 20 channels; (2) 'slow-fast'--the attack and release times decreased from 500 ms for low frequencies to about lOOms for high frequencies; (3) 'fast-slow'-the attack and release times increased from about 50ms for low frequencies to 500 ms for high frequencies; and (4) 'slow + fast'-a very slow-acting gain control signal was combined with a fast-acting gain control signal, for each channel in a 10-channel system. Acoustical stimuli were presented monaurally via a circumaural headphone mounted over the hearing aid. The linear condition did not use the Claro aid; instead, the signal was digitally filtered to implement the Cambridge formula prior to delivery via the earphone. Five subjects with moderate sensorineural hearing loss were tested in a counter-balanced order across conditions. In quiet, performance was best for linear amplification and worst for the slow + fast algorithm. In the presence of background sounds, the highest scores were obtained with the linear-gain Cambridge formula implemented via headphones; a supplementary experiment suggested that this was due to the greater high-frequency gain resulting from the use of this formula. No significant differences were found between scores for the different compression algorithms. We conclude that the intelligibility of speech at a fixed level, presented in background sounds, is not markedly affected by rather substantial variations of the time constants in a multichannel compression system.
