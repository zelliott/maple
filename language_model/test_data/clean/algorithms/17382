The purpose of this study was to evaluate the subjective quality of Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) compressed images of intraoral radiographs with file sizes of 30 kilobytes or less, which can be transmitted quickly on the World Wide Web.

Conventional intraoral radiographs were digitized at sampling rates of 100, 200, 300, 400, and 600 dots per inch through use of a flatbed scanner and saved in JPEG format in 11 compression degrees. Fifty-five combinations of sampling rate and compression degree were evaluated by means of a visual analog scale. Sampling rate and compression degree combinations whose quality was inferior to that of an average image were excluded. The quality of the remaining combinations was subsequently evaluated through assessment of 8 anatomical features in each image.

Forty of the 55 combinations provided a file size less than 30 kilobytes. Thirty combinations obtained VAS scores of 0 or higher on the standardized VAS. As a result, 16 combinations of sampling and compression conditions were selected for the second part of the study. Only one combination of sampling rate and compression degree was found to provide sufficient image quality for all 8 anatomical features.

Under the file size limit of the study design, the full-sized compressed image of an intraoral radiograph did not always provide sufficient quality. This problem will be reduced by improvements in telecommunications infrastructure, which will permit faster transfer of files of larger size.
