It was found that the resonance frequency of NMR protons of the fluid inside erythrocytes differs from that of plasma protons. This leads to a broadening of the NMR signal from blood, which depends on the extent of oxygenation and the shape of erythrocytes. The coefficient of diffusion of water through the erythrocyte membrane was estimated to be D approximately equal to 10(-14) m2/s.
