Herein, we report on the binding of optically pure ruthenium complexes Delta- or Lambda-[Ru(bpy)(2)(L-L)][PF(6)](2) [L-L = Hcmbpy = 4-carboxy-4'-methyl-2,2'-bipyridine (1), L-L = H(2)dcbpy = 4,4'-dicarboxy-2,2'-bipyridine (2)] to DNA. The binding constants of the two enantiomeric Delta-1 and Lambda-1 complexes to DNA were estimated from titration monitored by (1)H NMR spectroscopy. 2D transferred NOESY (TRNOESY) experiments support the conclusion that Delta-1 and Lambda-1 bind to DNA and that an intermediate-to-fast exchange occurs between bound and free Ru(II) complex. Further, evidence for enantioselective DNA cleavage by Delta-2 is provided by means of gel electrophoresis performed in the presence and in the absence of light; in contrast, the Lambda-2 enantiomer does not. The IR spectrum of enantiomer Delta-2 (or Lambda-2) compared to that of the racemate (rac-2) gives evidence that, in the latter form, the enantiomers are strongly associated. Moreover the X-ray structure of rac-2 was also determined and exhibits as an outstanding feature the formation of a one-dimensional supramolecular species in which the cohesion of the system is maintained by strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid groups of enantiomers Delta-2 and Lambda-2 (cationic parts) with d(O...O) = 2.6 A in agreement with the infrared results. The conclusion that can be drawn from IR and X-ray spectroscopies together is that the self-association in rac-2 is strong.
