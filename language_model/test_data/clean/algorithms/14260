Many future investigations into FGIDs are needed. These should focus on refining and validating the Rome diagnostic criteria, investigating possible biologic markers of these disorders, elucidating the role of the visceral afferent dysfunction or reflex motor responses that lead to symptoms, searching for new pathogenic factors (eg, corticotrophin-releasing factor), and evaluating therapies in prospective controlled trials. To tackle this challenging group of disorders successfully, there must be a broad collaboration among basic scientists, clinical investigators, physicians, psychologists, and practitioners of alternative and complementary medicine to develop and evaluate improved therapies. In the meantime, it is our duty as practitioners to keep updated and receptive to the needs of patients and families to reduce patient suffering, improve functioning, and control the costs to society.
