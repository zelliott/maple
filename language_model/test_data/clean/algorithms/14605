With an increase in the understanding of the formation and treatment of cerebral aneurysms and an improvement in imaging technology, actual standardized measurement values for the cerebral arteries are necessary. Therefore, the aim of this study was to provide a detailed assessment of the three-dimension (3D) morphology (vessel's curvature and trajectory) and 3D-morphometry of the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery using computer tomography angiography (CTA) images. The DICOM files from CTA of 40 male and 75 female individuals with a mean age of 50.1 years were analyzed using an interactive postprocessing 3D volume-rendering algorithm. Specifically, the M1 segment was evaluated. Calculations included the length, internal diameter, volume, deviation (DI) and tortuosity indices (TI). The M1 segment had a mean internal diameter of 2.23 mm and was greater in men. M1 asymmetry was identified in 23.4% of the individuals and was more common in women. The mean length was 15.62 mm and the left M1 segments were a little longer. The mean volume of the M1 segments was 63.92 mm(3) , and this was typically greater in men and on the left sides. The mean TI and DI for the M1 segment were 0.91 and 2.17 mm, respectively. Therefore, the M1 segments are only slightly curved or straight in their course. In addition, the longest vascular M1 segments are more deviated (curved) and more tortuous. Such standardized data as presented herein may be useful in the preprocedural evaluation of patients with intracranial vascular pathology of the M1 segment.
