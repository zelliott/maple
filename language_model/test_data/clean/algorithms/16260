Diabetes mellitus contributes to the increase of cardiovascular deaths worldwide. Despite continuous treatment evolution, patients with diabetes suffering from an acute coronary syndrome still have a high morbidity and mortality. We aimed to analyze the impact of diabetes on one-year outcome in an unselected patient population with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (non-STEMI).

Retrospective analysis of 847 unselected patients with non-STEMI. We compared the baseline characteristics, treatment and outcome of patients versus those without diabetes.

A total of 138 patients had diabetes (16%) and 709 (84%) had no diabetes. Patients with diabetes were older, often had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, previous myocardial infarction and Killip class â‰¥2 on admission. Approximately 80% of both patients, with and without diabetes, underwent diagnostic coronary angiography. Multivessel disease was more present among patients with diabetes, but patients with diabetes were treated more often conservatively. At one-year follow up rates of death and major adverse cardiac events were significantly higher in patients with diabetes compared to those without diabetes (8% vs. 3%; P=0.001 and 23% vs. 14%; P=0.008, respectively). Even after adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics, diabetes remained an independent predictor of mortality (OR: 2.25; CI95%: 1.05-3.91).

In an unselected patient population with non-STEMI, patients with diabetes have higher risk factors on admission, less often undergo coronary revascularisation and have worse outcome at one-year follow-up. Diabetes is an independent predictor of one-year mortality in patients with non-STEMI.
