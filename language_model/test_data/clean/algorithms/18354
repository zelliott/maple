DDDR pacemakers with QT driven sensor algorithms may be susceptible to inappropriate pacemaker tachycardia when implanted into patients who have a relatively extended cardiac repolarization. The inability to detect and measure the QT interval at near maximum sensor rate, results in an inappropriate adjustment of the automatic QT slope. Triggering pacemaker induced tachycardia.
