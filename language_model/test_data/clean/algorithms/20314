This study has investigated the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400 on the intranasal absorption and ensuing pharmacokinetics of the calcium entry blockers nicardipine and verapamil in a rat model. To solutions of nicardipine in acetate buffer pH 5.0 and of verapamil in distilled water, PEG 400 was added in concentrations of 0-5%. The nasal bioavailability of nicardipine from plain buffered solution was 44%, and increased steadily to 56-79% in direct proportion to the amount of PEG 400 added. Verapamil, on the other hand, exhibited an intranasal bioavailability of 52% in the absence of PEG 400, and between 61-68% in the presence of increasing concentrations of PEG 400. None of the formulations tested was found to cause adverse effects on the morphology and integrity of the nasal mucosa.
