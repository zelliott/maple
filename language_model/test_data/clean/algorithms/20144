To characterize pulmonary nodules in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) using computed tomography.

We retrospectively reviewed chest computed tomographic images of 73 patients with TSC (22 males and 51 females; mean ± SD age, 31.5 ± 13.2 years; range, 13.8-63.5 years).

Multiple pulmonary nodules were identified in 42 (58%) of 73 patients (mean ± SD size, 6.6 ± 3.0 mm; range, 2-14 mm). Solid nodules were present in 11 (26%) of 42 patients, ground-glass nodules were present in 3 (7%) of 42 patients, and both solid and ground-glass nodules were present in 28 (67%) of 42 patients. The presence of multiple nodules was independent of sex and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Follow-up images were available for 22 patients with multiple nodules (mean ± SD follow-up, 2.0 ± 1.1 years; range, 0.9-4.9 years), none of whom had change in nodule size or number.

Most men and women with TSC have multiple pulmonary nodules, which likely represent multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia in the absence of known predisposing factors.
