A novel synthetic process leading to the framework of benzo[c]cinnoline has been discovered and investigated. The process is composed of two separate reactions, the first of which is a partial reduction of the nitro groups of the 2,2'-dinitrobiphenyl, a process that we believe proceeds via a SET mechanism to yield the hydroxyamino and nitroso groups. In the following step the cyclization takes place under formation of the -N=N- bond. We believe that this process take place via a radical mechanism through the nitroso radical anion. The novel process affords either benzo[c]cinnoline or benzo[c]cinnoline N-oxide, both in high yields, 93% and 91%, respectively. To obtain benzo[c]cinnoline, the reaction is conducted with an alcohol as solvent and an alkoxide as the base, while for benzo[c]cinnoline N-oxide, water is used as solvent with sodium hydroxide as the base. To establish the latter procedure, statistical experimental design and multivariate modeling were utilized to reveal the response surface for the reaction and to determine the optimal conditions for the reaction. A proposal for the complex reaction mechanism is given. During the corroboration of the mechanism, a new deoxygenation reaction for converting benzo[c]cinnoline N-oxide into benzo[c]cinnoline was discovered. The reaction is conducted by treating the N-oxide with sodium ethoxide at elevated temperature to achieve near-quantitative conversion into benzo[c]cinnoline in a yield of 96%.
