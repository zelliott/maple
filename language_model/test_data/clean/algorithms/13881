To assess the usefulness of directional coronary atherectomy (DCA) in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 139 consecutive patients with anterior wall AMI undergoing successful catheter intervention were studied. The reocclusion rate was significantly lower in the last 70 patients who underwent DCA as aggressively as possible compared with the first 69 patients treated with coronary balloon angioplasty (12.1% vs 3.0%, p <0.05).
