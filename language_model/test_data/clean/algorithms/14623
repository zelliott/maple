Utilizing gastro-retentive drug delivery systems (GRDDS) to increase absorption of weakly basic drugs by extending their transit time is a promising approach. Swellable systems were evaluated for this purpose. Such systems demonstrate dual mechanism of release-diffusion and erosion. GRDDS requires maintaining its dimensions, which demands diffusion as a predominant mechanism of release (Fickian). In this work, dypyridamole, a weakly basic drug, together with various grades of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and different excipients were evaluated for release and swelling properties. Dissolution data were analyzed by curve fitting to various models to estimate predominant release mechanism. It was found that matrices containing a swellable diluent like microcrystalline cellulose demonstrated predominantly Fickian mechanism of release, whereas soluble diluents (lactose and mannitol) contributed to a mixed mechanism of release. Addition of copovidone increased the swelling and survivability, whereas sodium chloride altered the erosion behavior. A correlation between matrix weight loss and drug release was obtained, which further consolidated the analysis. Correlation for the soluble excipients was linear, whereas that for the swellable excipient was nonlinear, implying predominance of Fickian release mechanism for the latter. Hence, the selection of excipients can influence matrix survivability and release kinetics, which can be used for developing GRDDS.
