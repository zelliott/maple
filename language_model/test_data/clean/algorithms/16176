Pre-scrotal orchiopexy is emerging as an alternative approach for cryptorchid testes that can be preoperatively mobilized into the scrotum. We present our 3-year pre-scrotal orchiopexy series for all palpable cryptorchid testes regardless of their mobility into the scrotum preoperatively.

We retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent pre-scrotal orchiopexy during a 3-year period. Data collected included preoperative and postoperative testicular position, mobility of the testis into the scrotum preoperatively or with the patient under general anesthesia, patency of processus vaginalis, operative times and complications.

A total of 88 cryptorchid testes were treated using single pre-scrotal incision orchiopexy. Mean patient age was 4.9 years. Of the testes 74 (84.1%) could be milked down to the scrotum preoperatively and 14 (15.9%) could not. Of the 14 immobile testes 8 were intracanalicular and 6 were in the superficial inguinal pouch. Pre-scrotal orchiopexy was successful in all 74 testes that were mobilized into the scrotum preoperatively. However, 6 of 14 testes (43%) that could not be moved to the scrotum were effectively managed by a single pre-scrotal incision, while 8 (57%) required an additional groin incision for successful orchiopexy. No complications were observed during a mean followup of 7.1 months.

Orchiopexy using a pre-scrotal approach is a viable alternative for palpable cryptorchid testes that can be preoperatively mobilized into the scrotum. Cryptorchid testes that are palpable but cannot be moved to the scrotum can be managed by the pre-scrotal approach alone in 40% of cases or with an additional groin incision in 60%.
