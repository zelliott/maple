As part of ongoing efforts to develop computerized planning tools for cryosurgery, the current study provides a comparison between two recently developed methods for planning, known as bubble packing and force-field analogy.

For the purpose of comparison, four 3D prostate models were reconstructed from ultrasound imaging. The quality of planning for each method was evaluated based on bioheat transfer simulations.

Both methods are shown to be robust planning tools in 3D. Typical results show at least 75% of the target region volume having temperatures below a target temperature isotherm for planning. While the force-field analogy method yields superior planning results, it comes at the expense of an order of magnitude longer run time, with only moderate improvement.

Due to time constraints in a clinical setup, bubble packing alone may be considered adequate for computerized planning. Furthermore, only bubble packing is demonstrated to be adequate for intra-operative planning.
