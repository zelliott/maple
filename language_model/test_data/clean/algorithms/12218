LOTUSES is a novel computer code, which has been developed for the prediction of various thermodynamic properties such as heat of formation, heat of explosion, volume of explosion gaseous products and other related performance parameters. In this paper, we report LOTUSES (Version 1.4) code which has been utilized for the optimization of various high explosives in different combinations to obtain maximum possible velocity of detonation. LOTUSES (Version 1.4) code will vary the composition of mixed explosives automatically in the range of 1-100% and computes the oxygen balance as well as the velocity of detonation for various compositions in preset steps. Further, the code suggests the compositions for which least oxygen balance and the higher velocity of detonation could be achieved. Presently, the code can be applied for two component explosive compositions. The code has been validated with well-known explosives like, TNT, HNS, HNF, TATB, RDX, HMX, AN, DNA, CL-20 and TNAZ in different combinations. The new algorithm incorporated in LOTUSES (Version 1.4) enhances the efficiency and makes it a more powerful tool for the scientists/researches working in the field of high energy materials/hazardous materials.
