In biomedical signal processing, Gibbs oscillation and severe frequency aliasing may occur when using the traditional discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Herein, a new denoising algorithm based on the dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) is presented. Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and heart sound signals are denoised based on the DTCWT. The results prove that the DTCWT is efficient. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the mean square error (MSE) are used to compare the denoising effect. Results of the paired samples t-test show that the new method can remove noise more thoroughly and better retain the boundary and texture of the signal.
