Coronary flow velocity reserve is obtained by manual tracings of transthoracic coronary Doppler flow velocity profiles as the ratio of stress versus baseline diastolic peak velocities. This approach introduces subjectivity in the measurements and limits the information which could be exploited from the Doppler velocity profile. Accordingly, our goals were to develop a technique for nearly automated detection of Doppler coronary flow velocity profile, and automatically compute both conventional and additional amplitude, derivative and temporal parameters, and validate it with manual tracings. A total of 100 patients (17 normals, 15 patients with severe coronary stenosis, 41 with connective tissue disease and 27 with diabetes mellitus) were studied. Linear correlation and Bland-Altman analyses showed that the proposed method was highly accurate and repeatable compared to the manual measurements. Comparison between groups evidenced significant differences in some of the automated parameters, thus representing potentially additional indices useful for the noninvasive diagnosis of microcirculatory or coronary artery disease.
