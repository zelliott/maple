The purpose of this paper was to compare manual and automated analysis for the quantification of carotid wall obtained with sonography by using the computed tomography as validation technique.

21 consecutive patients underwent MDCTA and ultrasound analysis of carotid arteries (mean age 68 years; age range 59-81 years). The intima-media-thickness (IMT) of the 42 carotids was measured with novel and dedicated automated software analysis (called AtheroEdge™, Biomedical Technologies, Denver, CO, USA) and by four observers that manually calculated the IMT. The carotid artery wall thickness (CAWT) was also quantified in the CT datasets. Bland-Altman statistics was employed to measure the agreement between methods. A Student's t-test was used to test the differences between the IMT values of AtheroEdge™. The study obtained the IRB approval.

The correlation between automated AtheroEdge™ measurements and those of the human experts were equal to 95.5%, 73.5%, 88.9%, and 81.7%. The IMT coefficient of variation of the human experts was equal to 11.9%. By using a Student's t-test, the differences between the IMT values of AtheroEdge™ and those of the human experts were not found statistically significant (p value=0.02). On comparing AtheroEdge™ (using Ultrasound) with CAWT (using CT), the results suggested a very good concordance of 84.96%.

Data of this preliminary study indicate that automated software AtheroEdge™ can analyze with precision the IMT of carotid arteries and that the concordance with CT is optimal.
