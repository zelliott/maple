Measurement of glycine in human frontal brain by an optimized point-resolved spectroscopy sequence at 7 T is reported. Echo time dependencies of the overlapping coupled resonances of myo-inositol, free choline, and threonine were investigated with density matrix simulations, incorporating the slice-selective radiofrequency and gradient pulses. The numerical simulations indicated that the selectivity of the 3.55-ppm glycine singlet is maximized at (TE(1), TE(2)) = (101, 51) ms. Phantom experiments indicated that the myo-inositol peak amplitude between 3.5 and 3.6 ppm is reduced by a factor of 30 following the optimized point-resolved spectroscopy, as predicted by the simulation. From LCModel analyses, the glycine concentration in the medial prefrontal cortex in healthy adults was estimated, with a mean Cram√©r-Rao lower bound of 7 +/- 1% (mean +/- standard deviation; n = 7), to be 0.8 +/- 0.1 mM, with reference to total creatine at 8 mM.
