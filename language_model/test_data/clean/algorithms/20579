The conversion from polar to Cartesian coordinates can be carried out with two-pass algorithms. The paper describes two different methods based on concentric square frames and octagonal frames and their results, obtained with accurate interpolations based on the "moving window Shannon reconstruction' (MWSR). The embedding of these algorithms in direct Fourier methods (DFMs) of tomographic reconstruction is discussed. With respect to one-pass methods and to the use of octagonal frames, the square frame method makes it possible to carry out the first pass, a radial resampling, in the direct space, before computing 1D Fourier transforms (FTs) of projections. Reconstructions of clinical images from the raw data of a third-generation x-ray tomograph are presented and compared with those obtained with one-pass DFMs and with the convolution back-projection method (CBPM) performed by the instrument. The simple algorithm using square frames yields results in complete agreement with other DFM protocols and the CBPM. On a general-purpose computer, the execution of DFM protocols based on one-pass and two-pass coordinate transformations is 35 to 55 times faster than the CBPM and make the algorithms attractive for modern instrumentation.
