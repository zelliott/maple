HLA polymorphism is a major barrier for hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplantation. To estimate the allogeneic potential between HLA-mismatched stem cell donor/recipient pairs, we recently proposed a matching score (dissimilarity index) that is based on the structural data of HLA class I molecules, and on the functional similarity of amino acids (AA). This first approach revealed new features about presumptive subtype allogenicities within the HLA-A*23 and A*24 groups. We have now developed an internet-based software tool ("HistoCheck") that is capable to assess the allogenicity (matching score) between any pair of clinically relevant HLA class I, and also class II, alleles. Newly described HLA sequences will be regularly integrated into the database according to the nomenclature for factors of the HLA system updates. The software is intended to be a first step for estimating the allogenicity of HLA mismatches in peculiar clinical settings, as long as there are no reliable in vitro or clinical studies available. The algorithm can later be modified according to functional data, for example, peptide-binding specificities. With the extension of the sequence similarity concept to all clinically relevant HLA class I and II loci, HistoCheck may contribute to prevent HLA mismatching being a matter of chance.
