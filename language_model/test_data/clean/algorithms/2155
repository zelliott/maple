To evaluate the interobserver and intraobserver agreement for both treatment plan and fracture classification of tibial plateau fractures using plain films alone and with computed tomography (CT) scans.

Prospective study to assess the impact of an advanced radiologic study on the agreement of treatment plan and fracture classification of tibial plateau fractures.

Two orthopaedic traumatologists, two orthopaedic residents, and two skeletal radiologists were presented with twenty-one cases of tibial plateau fractures imaged with plain films and with CT scans.

Agreement was measured using kappa coefficients.

Using plain films alone, the mean interobserver kappa coefficient for classification was 0.62, which decreased to 0.61 after addition of CT scans. Using plain films alone for formulating a treatment plan, the mean interobserver kappa coefficient was 0.58, which increased to 0.71 after addition of CT scans. The mean intraobserver kappa coefficient for fracture classification using plain films was 0.70, which increased to 0.80 with addition of CT scans. The mean intraobserver kappa coefficient for treatment plan based on plain films alone was 0.62, which increased to 0.82 after addition of CT scans. Class was changed in an average of 12 percent of cases after addition of CT scans. Treatment plan was changed an average of 26 percent of the time after addition of CT scans.

Addition of CT scans to plain roentgenograms increases the interobserver and intraobserver agreement on treatment plan.
