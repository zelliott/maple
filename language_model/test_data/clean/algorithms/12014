The expected role of computerized mate selection programs with regard to inbreeding and lifetime profitability of Holstein and Jersey cattle was examined using data from 25 large registered herds of each breed. Sire selection and mate allocation were carried out using linear programming with the following objectives: 1) minimum inbreeding, 2) maximum net merit subject to a fixed inbreeding threshold, and 3) maximum expected lifetime profit after adjustment for inbreeding depression. Inbreeding of actual matings was similar to inbreeding from random matings, indicating that current inbreeding avoidance programs in these herds are ineffective. Inbreeding was reduced by 1.6 and 1.9% in Holsteins and Jerseys, respectively, when a mate allocation program was applied with service sires and usage levels fixed at the actual values. Benefits of mate selection programs increased when both sire selection and mate pair allocation were considered. Maximization of mean net merit with inbreeding restricted to a fixed level (5% in Holsteins and 8% in Jerseys) led to decreases in inbreeding of 0.9 and 1.4% and increases in lifetime profit of $16.66 and $26.86 in Holsteins and Jerseys, respectively, relative to programs that ignored inbreeding. Maximization of mean expected lifetime profit after adjustment for inbreeding depression decreased inbreeding by 1.8 and 2.8% and increased lifetime profit by $37.37 and $59.77 in Holsteins and Jerseys, respectively. Inbreeding coefficients estimated with pedigree traced to 1985 were inadequate predictors of inbreeding coefficients estimated with pedigrees traced to 1960. Mate selection programs cannot function optimally unless extensive historical pedigree data are available, particularly for service sires. Computerized mate selection programs can reduce inbreeding in the next generation, which will lead to an increase in farm profitability. However, if genetic diversity is to be maintained in the long term, procedures for selecting parents of AI sires must also be considered.
