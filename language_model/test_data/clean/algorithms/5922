Among many factors, the effectiveness of the cryoprocedure is determined by the quality of the cryoprobes layout. A computerized planning tool for optimizing this layout has the potential of improving the outcome of cryosurgery, reducing post-operative complications, and reducing the cost of the clinical operation. As part of an ongoing effort to develop planning tools for cryosurgery, the current study takes a novel approach, based on bubble-packing method. This study shows that the application of bubble-packing shortens runtime by an order of magnitude. In this study, the bubble-packing method is integrated with bioheat transfer simulations to demonstrate the quality of planning.
