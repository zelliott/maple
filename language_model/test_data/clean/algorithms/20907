Reaction of 6a-f individually with 2-methylsulfonyl-4,6-dimethoxypyrimidine yielded 7a-f in excellent yield. The newly synthesized heterocycles were characterized by IR, (1)H NMR, and mass spectral data. Compounds 7a-f was screened for their anti-inflammatory activity and were compared with standard drugs. Of the compounds studied, the compound 7e showed more potent activity than the standard drugs at all doses tested.
