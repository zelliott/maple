Embolization is increasingly used to treat systemic arteriovenous (AV) shunts although its success, as judged by either angiographic or clinical means, is difficult to quantify. The aim of the study was to quantify blood flow through AV shunts with 133Xe, which, because of its relatively long transit time through peripheral tissues, behaves like microspheres. Following arterial injection, 133Xe entering an AV shunt rapidly arrives in the lung and can be quantified with a scintillation probe. In 17 patients with systemic AV shunts, the reduction in shunt flow following therapeutic embolization was quantified in the angiography theatre by comparing the initial count rates in the lung, recorded by probe, following injection of identical quantities of 133Xe into a supplying artery before and after embolization. By comparing the lung counts with those given by an intravenous injection of 133Xe, the fraction of flow at the catheter tip entering the shunt was also quantified. Tissue perfusion in the vascular territory distal to the shunt was measured at the same time by recording the clearance of non-shunted 133Xe with a second probe over the extremity. Control injections of 133Xe were given in the contralateral limb in order to assess 133Xe transit in the absence of shunting and to compare tissue perfusion between the two sides. Shunt flow ranged from 40% to 100% (of that at the tip of the catheter) (n = 14), while the reduction in shunt flow following embolization ranged from 15% to 96% (n = 19). Tissue perfusion distal to the shunt and in the contralateral limb was about 5 ml 100 ml-1 min-1. Contrast medium had no consistent effect on tissue perfusion in either limb, or on shunt flow. There was no difference in peripheral perfusion between the abnormal and control sides, nor any significant difference in perfusion in the distal tissue on the abnormal side before and after embolization. There was, however, a consistent increase in the fraction of the injected 133Xe delivered to the distal tissue after embolization (median increase 93%, p < 0.001). The technique is relatively simple and merits further development as a means of continuous quantification of systemic AV shunt flow in the angiography theatre at the time of embolization.
