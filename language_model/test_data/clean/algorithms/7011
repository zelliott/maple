We consider the problem of tracking rapid changes in the viscous and elastic properties of the respiratory system by using mouth flow and transpulmonary pressure data measured during mechanical ventilation. A recursive least-squares algorithm with adjustable compensator is used for online estimation of an R-C model of the breathing mechanics. Specific simulation experiments are presented to provide guidelines to select suitable values for the key variable, which controls the compromise between tracking ability and noise sensitivity. The results obtained confirm the critical role of the optimum tuning in relation to the noise level. Experimental results obtained from data measured on mechanically-ventilated dogs, in which respiratory distress syndrome was intravenously induced by oleic acid, demonstrate that the tuned algorithm is able to track appropriately both the viscous and elastic properties of lung mechanics. Parameter estimates are consistent with those obtained by standard and robust offline algorithms and their time course is in qualitative agreement with known physiopathological behaviour.
