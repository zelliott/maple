This study evaluated whether improved insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in recovery from acute exercise coincides with reduced malonyl-CoA (MCoA) content in human muscle. Furthermore, we investigated whether a high-fat diet [65 energy-% (Fat)] would alter the content of MCoA and insulin action compared with a high-carbohydrate diet [65 energy-% (CHO)]. After 4 days of isocaloric diet on two occasions (Fat/CHO), 12 male subjects performed 1 h of one-legged knee extensor exercise (approximately 80% peak workload). Four hours after exercise, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was determined in both legs during a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. Muscle biopsies were obtained in both legs before and after the clamp. Four hours after exercise, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was improved (approximately 70%, P<0.001) independent of diet composition and despite normal insulin-stimulated regulation of insulin receptor substrate-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Akt, GSK-3, and glycogen synthase. Interestingly, exercise resulted in a sustained reduction (approximately 20%, P<0.05) in MCoA content 4 h after exercise that correlated (r=0.65, P<0.001) with improved insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Four days of Fat diet resulted in an increased content of intramyocellular triacylglycerol (P<0.01) but did not influence muscle MCoA content or whole body insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. However, at the muscular level proximal insulin signaling and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake appeared to be compromised, although to a minor extent, by the Fat diet. Collectively, this study indicates that reduced muscle MCoA content in recovery from exercise may be part of the adaptive response leading to improved insulin action on glucose uptake after exercise in human muscle.
