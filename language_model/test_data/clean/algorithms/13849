Genetic disorders manifested in chromosome aberrations can be evaluated by analysis of the banding pattern of human metaphase chromosomes. We describe the resolution of chromosomal bands depending on the degree of chromosomal condensation and introduce a pattern enhancement technique using local statistics to improve band pattern features of a past condensation stage. The algorithm was first tested on synthesized profiles to determine its characteristics as the parameters of the algorithm are varied. It is shown that the method is capable of enhancing subtle staining patterns hidden in artificial profiles as well as in measured profiles. The example of a human chromosome No. 11 demonstrates the importance of the described technique for chromosome classification in ambiguous cases.
