With the advent of multidetector CT, pulmonary CT angiography (MD-CTPA) has substantially gained in spatial resolution and is the accepted method of choice to diagnose and rule out acute pulmonary embolism down to the subsegmental level. This article reviews means to optimize scanning technique and contrast injection protocols dependent on the scanner type used. It summarizes recent publications on the performance of MD-CTPA with special emphasis on the diagnostic accuracy, interpretation and clinical role of (isolated) peripheral emboli. Diagnostic algorithms are outlined that describe the role of CT in context with the pretest probability, the D-Dimer, lower limb sonography and scintigraphy.
