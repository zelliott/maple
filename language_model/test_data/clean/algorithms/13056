A method for determination of the endpoint of the procedure for radix rehmanniae steamed was proposed based on UV spectrophotometry combination with continuous wavelet transform and kernel independent component analysis (UV-CWT-KICA). In the proposed method, the raw UV spectra of the rehmanniae samples during steamed procedure were measured. The raw UV spectral data were firstly pretreated by CWT for elimination of the noise signal and enrichment of the spectral resolution, then the independent components (ICs) were estimated from the mixed CWT coefficient matrix. The results show that the ICs are chemical significance with their relative concentrations gradually decreasing or increasing during the first steamed period, and the endpoint of the steamed procedure can be determined by inspection of the relative concentration profiles, at which the ICs should be approached maximum or minimum. Furthermore, the estimated ICs of rehmanniae samples from different areas or with different grades are similar, and the relative concentration of the similar ICs in different groups are increasing or decreasing before the first 14 h, and nearly steady or some decreasing after 16 h. Based on the variations of the relative concentration profiles of the ICs, the endpoint of the steamed procedure can be determined as 15 h, while that determined by sensory analysis is 14-20 h. The proposed UV-CWT-KICA method can avoid the higher deviations of the endpoints that were determined by sensory analysis. It provides an alternative approach for determination of the endpoint of the procedure for processing traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).
