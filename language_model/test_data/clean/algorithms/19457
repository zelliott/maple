The Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) define the daily requirement for energy as the Estimated Energy Requirement (EER). The EER is based on calculations that account for an individual's energy intake, energy expenditure, age, sex, weight, height, and physical activity level. Including physical activity level in the calculations makes determining energy expenditure possible and achieving energy balance a more realistic goal. However, physical activity level is often difficult to measure and accurate assessment of energy expenditure not always possible. We provide an easy way to calculate daily EERs for adults based on physical activity level. We use the EER equations of the DRI Committee and provide a spreadsheet template for the calculation of physical activity level. This technique accounts for all factors and measurements to determine physical activity level and energy expended from daily physical activity. It should prove a useful approach in research, clinical, and public health settings.
