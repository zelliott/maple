Because newborn hearing screening (NHS) programs are currently implemented in an increasing number of countries, physiological NHS technologies have to be continuously optimized. This study validates a new TEOAE-AABR screening device.

TEOAE and AABR screenings were performed in 299 ears with both the new NHS device and a well-established and validated one. Furthermore, 49 ears, suspected of having a hearing loss, underwent the screenings and an additional diagnostic ABR.

One hundred and fifty newborns and infants were included in the study (median age 1.0 months, range 0-54 months; among them 39 babies from neonatal intensive care units).

Screening with both devices resulted in a concordance of Îº =.98 for TEAOE measurements and .96 for AABR measurements. The mean measurement durations were significantly shorter for the new device than for the established one for both TEOAE (15.4 vs. 17.2 s) and AABR (26.6 vs. 32.7 s).

The algorithm of the new screening device is as valid as that for the established one. The shorter test durations with the new device facilitate hearing screenings and allow for a higher number of valid measurements in restless children than with former comparable procedures.
