A coherent confocal microscope is proposed as a means to fully characterize the elastic scattering properties of a nanoparticle as a function of wavelength. Using a high numerical aperture lens, two-dimensional scanning, and a simple vector-beam shaper, the rank-2 polarizability tensor is estimated from a single confocal image. A method for computationally efficient data processing is described, and numerical simulations show that this algorithm is robust to noise and uncertainty in the focal plane position. The proposed method is a generalization of techniques that provide an estimate of a limited set of scattering parameters, such as a single orientation angle for rodlike particles. The measurement of the polarizability obviates the need for a priori assumptions about the nanoparticle.
