The structure and work principle of an ultraviolet photon counting imaging detector based on wedge and strip anode with induction readout mode are introduced. Two methods of estimating the charge footprint size are presented. One way is theoretical calculation and simulation. The physical course of electrons is simulated from the microchannel plate output side to the readout anode. The calculated results show that the final charge footprint size is sensitive to the thickness of ceramic and not sensitive to the charge footprint size on the Ge layer. The other way is experimental image estimation. The final charge footprint size can be estimated according to the position where the light line of resolution board image begins to bend. Both methods show that the charge footprint size is sensitive to the ceramic substrate. The two methods are simple and effective for estimation of charge footprint size of photon counting imaging detector with induction readout.
