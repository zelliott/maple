In this work, we investigated the effect of storage in solid-phase extender on buck semen conserved at 5 degrees C. Furthermore, we studied the effect of addition of cysteine to the extender and the washing of seminal plasma on sperm survival. In Experiment 1, milk-based extender (M) was used as a control to study the effect of solid media storage (G) and cysteine supplementation (C), and the combination of both (GC), on in vitro sperm survival of washed and non-washed semen, conserved up to 72 h at 5 degrees C. Motility, acrosome integrity (NAR) and hypo-osmotic swelling tests (HOST) were evaluated to assess in vitro sperm survival. In Experiment 2, an artificial insemination (AI) field trial was performed to compare G versus M. Solid media (G) maintained motility of spermatozoa during storage higher than any other extender (67% G versus 62% GC; 61% M and 59% C; P<0.05), but there was no difference in NAR or HOST between extenders (P>0.05). No improvement in sperm viability was obtained by addition of cysteine to the media. Washing of semen improved motility (65% versus 60%; P<0.05), NAR (70% versus 64%; P<0.05) and HOST (37% versus 28%; P<0.05). No significant differences in fertility were obtained between G and M extenders (47% versus 41%; P>0.05). In conclusion, washing of semen and dilution in gelatin-supplemented milk extender (solid storage) appears to be a successful method for goat semen storage at 5 degrees C.
