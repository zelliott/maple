Wound debridement refers to the removal of necrotic, devitalized, or contaminated tissue and/or foreign material to promote wound healing. Surgical debridement uses sharp instruments to cut dead tissue from a wound and it is the quickest and most efficient method of debridement. A wound debridement simulator can ensure that a medical trainee is competent prior to performing a procedure on a genuine patient. Irrigation is performed at different stages of debridement in order to remove debris and reduce the bacteria count through rinsing the wound. This paper presents a novel approach for realistic irrigation visualization based on texture representations of debris. This approach applies image processing techniques to a series of images, which model the cleanliness of the wound. The active texture is generated and updated dynamically based on the irrigation state, location, and range. Presented results demonstrate that texture mapping and image processing techniques can provide effective and efficient solutions for irrigation visualization in the wound debridement simulator.
