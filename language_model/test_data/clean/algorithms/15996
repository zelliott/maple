The authors measured the noise and impedance from face-to-face Ag-AgCl electrode pairs, as well as the noise from Ag-AgCl electrodes placed on the human body surface, in the frequency band from 0.5 Hz to 500 Hz, which corresponds to high-resolution ECG measurements. Electrode noise and electrode impedance were measured simultaneously to compare electrode noise with the thermal noise from the real part of electrode impedance. The results show that electrode noise depends on electrode area, electrolytic gel, the patient, and the placement site. In the frequency band from 0.5 Hz to 500 Hz, root-mean-square electrode noise is typically less than 1 microV for electrodes placed face-to-face and ranges from 1 microV to 15 microV for electrodes on the body surface. The noise spectral density increases at low frequencies as 1/fa and it is always higher than the thermal noise from the real part of the electrode impedance. There is a high correlation between electrode dc offset voltage and electrode noise. Thus, offset voltage measurements allow identification of noise from low-noise electrodes.
