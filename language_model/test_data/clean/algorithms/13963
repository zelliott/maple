The diagnosis of erectile dysfunction (ED) needs an appropriate evaluation of global function and specific component of the erection. We have used a quantified methodology to grade each of the specific factors: arterial, venous, neurologic, endocrine, psychological and anxiety, in four groups of increasing severity. With this information each patient is them classified organic, psychological or mixed. The prevalence of "mixed" aetiology appears in the statistical objective offered by two different retrospective studies with a 76% rate of psychological prevalence and a 85% of organic prevalence. In two out of three of the patients both factors are present.
