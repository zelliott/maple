Motivated by mechanical analysis of bones and bone-implant systems, a 3D constitutive law describing the macroscopic mechanical behaviour of both cortical and trabecular bone in cyclic (not fatigue) overloads is developed. The proposed model which mathematical formulation is established within the framework of generalized standard materials accounts for three distinct material evolution modes where elastic, plastic and damage aspects are closely related. The anisotropic elasticity of bone is described by a morphology-based model and distinct damage behaviour in tension and compression by a halfspacewise generalized Hill criterion. The plastic criterion is based on the intact elastic compliance tensor. The algorithm applies three distinct projections based on the relationship between the internal variables and criteria. Their respective consistent tangent operators are presented. Numerical resolutions of several boundary value problems and a biomechanical application are presented to illustrate the potential of the constitutive model and demonstrate the expected quadratic convergence of the algorithm.
