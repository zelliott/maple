The mass balance equation of a chromatographic system using a compressible moving phase has been compiled for mass flow of the mobile phase instead of traditional volumetric flow allowing solution of the equation in an analytical form. The relation obtained correlates retention volume measured under ambient conditions with the partition coefficient of the solute. Compared to the relation in the ideal chromatographic system the equation derived contains an additional correction term accounting for the compressibility of the moving phase. When the retention volume is measured under the mean column pressure and column temperature the correction term is reduced to unit and the relation is simplified to those known for the ideal system. This volume according to International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is called the corrected retention volume.
