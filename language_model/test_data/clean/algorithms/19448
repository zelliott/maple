In this paper, a fuzzy waste index for evaluating the hazard posed by composite wastes generated from industrial processes is proposed. Within this methodology, a fuzzy index as a measure of hazardousness of a given composite waste is derived from the crisp inputs of its component's flammability, corrosivity, toxicity and reactivity attributes based on the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) hazard rankings. The novelty of this work lies in establishing an integrated fuzzy hazardous waste index (FHWI) which provides a single-value representing the hazard ranking of a composite waste. This is contrary to current techniques which do not provide a final aggregated hazard index. The efficacy of the new proposed approach is illustrated through several worked examples. The results demonstrate that the fuzzy algorithm can be useful in aiding policy and decision-makers in conducting comprehensive initial evaluation of the status of waste hazardous status without the need for costly laboratory experiments. As such, the approach offers a robust and transparent decision-making methodology.
