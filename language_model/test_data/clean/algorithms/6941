DNA methylation occurring within the context of CpG site in the promoter element generally correlates with transcriptional silencing, delayed replication, condensed chromatin and mammalian genome imprinting (Nature Genet 24:101-2, 2000). We have been focusing attention on Restriction Landmark Genomic Scanning (RLGS) method as the powerful experimental procedure which can used to determine DNA methylation status change occurring on a genome simultaneously. To support systematic analysis with RLGS method, we have developed the automated processing algorithms for two-dimensional electrophoretograms of genomic DNA based on RLGS method (RLGS profile). Our powerful processing algorithms realize the automated spot recognition from RLGS profiles and the automated comparison of a huge number of such profiles. To make systematic RLGS analysis more easy and objective, we equipped our automated RLGS image processing algorithms with a WWW interface and relational database which stores the RLGS profile images together with their accompanying information, such as DNA sample specification, two-dimensional electrophoresis conditions and so forth. The web based RLGS image processing system "DNAinsight" can be accessed via URL http://www.methylome.jp/DNAinsight/.
