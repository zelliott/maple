A comparison of two wavelet approaches, Daubechies and reverse Biorthogonal, is described for the quantitative resolution of a binary mixture of diminazene aceturate (DIMA) and phenazone (PHE) in veterinary granules for injection without any chemical separation. These two approaches were specified as db4 (a = 180) and rbior3.7 (a = 125) respectively, after testing the signal analysis parameters for the overlapping absorption spectra and ratio spectra. In the first step db4 (a = 180) was applied to the original absorbance data vector of DIMA and PHE. In the second step rbio3.7 (a = 125) was applied to the ratio spectra data vectors of DIMA using the divisor PHE. The same approach was also subjected to the ratio spectra of PHE using the divisor DIMA. The db4 (a = 180) and rbior3.7 (a = 125) calibration graphs were constructed using the transformation values obtained in the wavelet domain. In the method validation, the wavelet calibration functions were tested using synthetic mixtures and the standard addition technique. The simultaneous quantitative analysis of DIMA and PHE in the commercial veterinary preparation was achieved by the elaborated methods. The assay results were compared with each other and good agreement was observed.
