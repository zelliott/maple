Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments are widely applied in structural biology. The SAXS experiments yield one-dimensional profile that needs further analysis to reveal structural information. The pair distance distribution function (PDDF), P(r), can provide molecular structures more intuitively, and it can be used to guide ab initio model reconstructions, making it a critical step to derive P(r) from experimental SAXS profiles. To calculate the P(r) curves, a new method based on a specially designed parametric functional form is developed, and implemented in pregxs. This method is tested against both synthetic and experimental data, the estimated P(r) functions are in good agreement with correct or known P(r). The method can also predict the molecular size. In summary, the pregxs method is robust and accurate in P(r) determination from SAXS profiles. The pregxs source code and an online server are available at http://www.sastbx.als.lbl.gov.
