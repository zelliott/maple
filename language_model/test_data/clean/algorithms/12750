The paper investigates the impact of the integration of the visual error augmentation training method with the assist-as-needed training method in robot-assisted rehabilitation training of the upper extremity. A robot-assisted rehabilitation system is developed that integrates an assistive controller, which can provide robotic assistance to the participant as and when needed, with a visual error augmentation mechanism, which amplifies the tracking error to heighten the participant's motivation to improve tracking accuracy. A crossover study is designed to evaluate the impact of the integration of the visual error augmentation method with the assist-as-needed training method. Experimental results on unimpaired participants demonstrate improved performance has been achieved in the integrated training session.
