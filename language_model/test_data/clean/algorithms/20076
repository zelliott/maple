After surgery for Hirschsprungs disease, most children thrive, have few if any episodes of abdominal distention and enterocolitis, and are fecally continent. However, there exists a small group of patients who do not do well. Either they suffer from persistent distension and enterocolitis or they experience soiling after their pull-through procedure. These patients can be systematically evaluated and successfully treated with a combination of bowel management, dietary changes, and laxatives, and, in certain circumstances, a reoperation.
