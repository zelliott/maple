While sonification has enjoyed much attention in VR simulation studies, music has generally been incorporated as ambiance. This is partially due to difficulties with manipulating it interactively in real-time while maintaining a sensible musicality. This paper discusses how algorithmically generated music is used to provide ambiance, characterize the visual representation of molecular particle flow, provide orientation cues to the user, and enhance recognition of chemical gradient balances in a reified model of the kidney nephron. The technical obstacles related to the use of music in this context are also addressed.
