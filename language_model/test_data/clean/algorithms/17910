There has been tremendous growth in the number of patients seeking body contouring procedures after massive weight loss. Most patients desire improvement of the abdominotorso region first. After massive weight loss, there is enormous variability of body proportions, and therefore there have been many surgical options proposed based on the quality of the skin, subcutaneous fat component, and location of the lax tissue. Each area needs to be assessed to see whether there is a significant lower abdominal component, an upper midline abdominal component, or contributions from the buttocks and flanks. An algorithm for treatment is presented to simplify the decision-making process. Patient examples are also shown to demonstrate the usefulness of the algorithm.
