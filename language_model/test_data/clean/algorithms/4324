We report the design of an integrated platform for on-chip electrical transduction of the surface plasmon resonance supported by a nanostructured metal grating. The latter is fabricated on the active area of a GaAs/AlGaAs photo-HEMT and simultaneously works as the electronic gate of the device. The gold plasmonic crystal has a V-groove profile and has been designed by numerical optical simulations. By showing that the numerical models accurately reproduce the phototransistors experimental response, we demonstrate that the proposed architecture is suitable for the development of a new class of compact and scalable SPR sensors.
