An intelligent multichannel stimulator (IMS) has been designed and built for use in a cardiac research environment. The device is capable of measuring and responding to cardiac electrophysiological phenomena in real time with carefully timed and placed electrical stimuli. The system consists of 16 channels of sense/stimulation electronics controlled by a digital signal processor (DSP) data acquisition card and a host computer and can be expanded to include more channels. The DSP allows for powerful and flexible algorithms to be implemented for real-time interaction with the cardiac tissue. Although a number of possible uses can be conceived for such a device, the initial motivation was to improve upon attempts to terminate fibrillation by pacing. The IMS was tested in an open-chest animal model, both in sinus rhythm and during fibrillation. It was shown to be an effective research tool by demonstrating the ability to measure and respond to cardiac activations in real time using complex numerical algorithms and appropriately timed stimuli.
