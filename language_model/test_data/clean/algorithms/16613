To integrate data from two-dimensional echocardiography (2D ECHO), three-dimensional echocardiography (3D ECHO), and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) for prediction of left ventricular (LV) reverse remodeling (LVRR) after cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). It was also compared the evaluation of cardiac dyssynchrony by TDI and 3D ECHO.

Twenty-four consecutive patients with heart failure, sinus rhythm, QRS ≥ 120 msec, functional class III or IV and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 0.35 underwent CRT. 2D ECHO, 3D ECHO with systolic dyssynchrony index (SDI) analysis, and TDI were performed before, 3 and 6 months after CRT. Cardiac dyssynchrony analyses by TDI and SDI were compared with the Pearson's correlation test. Before CRT, a univariate analysis of baseline characteristics was performed for the construction of a logistic regression model to identify the best predictors of LVRR.

After 3 months of CRT, there was a moderate correlation between TDI and SDI (r = 0.52). At other time points, there was no strong correlation. Nine of twenty-four (38%) patients presented with LVRR 6 months after CRT. After logistic regression analysis, SDI (SDI > 11%) was the only independent factor in the prediction of LVRR 6 months of CRT (sensitivity = 0.89 and specificity = 0.73). After construction of receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves, an equation was established to predict LVRR: LVRR =-0.4LVDD (mm) + 0.5LVEF (%) + 1.1SDI (%), with responders presenting values >0 (sensitivity = 0.67 and specificity = 0.87).

In this study, there was no strong correlation between TDI and SDI. An equation is proposed for the prediction of LVRR after CRT. Although larger trials are needed to validate these findings, this equation may be useful to candidates for CRT.
