DNA chips have proven to be effective tools in detecting gene expression levels. Compared with DNA chips using complementary DNA as probes, oligonucleotide microarrays using oligonucleotides as probes have attracted great attention because of their well known advantages. The design of gene-specific probes for each target is essential to the development of oligonucleotide microarrays. We have previously reported the development of a probe design software termed Mprobe 1.0. Here, we present a new version of this software, termed Mprobe 2.0. Several new features are included in Mprobe 2.0. Firstly, a paradox-based sequence database management system has been developed and integrated into the software, which consequently allows interoperability with sequences in GenBank, EMBL, and FASTA formats. Secondly, in contrast to setting a fixed threshold for the secondary structure of probes in Mprobe 1.0 and other related software, Mprobe 2.0 employs a different method. After parameters such as GC type, probe melting temperature and GC contents have been evaluated, candidate probes are sorted by the free energy from high to low value, followed by specificity analysis. Thirdly, Mprobe 2.0 provides users with substantial parameter options in the visual mode. Mprobe 2.0 possesses an easier interface for users to manage sequences annotated in different formats and design the optimal probes for oligonucleotide microarrays and other applications.
