Recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis in dermatologic surgery have been established, but there is variability in perioperative antibiotic use of dermatologists. Authoritative guidelines have shifted away from routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis because there is no conclusive evidence that antibiotic use reduces risk of infective endocarditis or prosthetic joint infection.

To determine current practices of perioperative antibiotic use of Mohs-trained surgeons and to compare patterns of use with updated administration guidelines.

A survey was sent to American College of Mohs Surgery members in 2012. The main outcome measures were survey responses relating to demographic characteristics, experience with postoperative infection, familiarity with antibiotic guidelines, perioperative antibiotic practices, attitudes regarding antibiotic use, and antibiotic selection.

Most survey respondents are familiar with the Antibiotic Prophylaxis in Dermatologic Surgery Advisory Statement 2008, but respondents give antibiotics for more indications than are recommended. Although not recommended, a high percentage reported giving antibiotics to patients at high risk of infective endocarditis or joint infection even when surgery does not breach oral mucosa or involve infected skin.

Dermatologic surgeons overuse perioperative antibiotics for prevention of surgical site infection, infective endocarditis, and prosthetic joint infection based on current recommendations.
