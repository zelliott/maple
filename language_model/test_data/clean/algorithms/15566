The mean inner potential of GaAs(14.18V), InAs(14.50V), GaP(14.35V) and InP(14.50V) has been measured by transmission electron holography using the phase shift of the (000)-beam of the first hologram sideband. To provide a defined specimen geometry we used 90 degrees wedges obtained by the cleavage technique. The exact excitation condition as well as the acceleration voltage of the electrons were determined from convergent beam electron diffraction images. The magnification is extracted from two-beam lattice fringe images and dynamical effects are taken into account by Bloch-wave calculations.
