We propose and validate the hypothesis that we can use differential shape properties of the myocardial surfaces to recover dense field motion from standard three-dimensional (3-D) image sequences (MRI and CT). Quantitative measures of left ventricular regional function can be further inferred from the point correspondence maps. The noninvasive, algorithm-derived results are validated on two levels. First, the motion trajectories are compared to those of implanted imaging-opaque markers of a canine model in two imaging modalities, where subpixel accuracy is achieved. Second, the validity of using motion parameters (path length and thickness changes) for detecting myocardial injury area is tested by comparing algorithms derived results to postmortem analysis TTC staining of myocardial tissue, where the achieved Pearson product-moment correlation value is 0.968.
