We present an algorithm to realign images distorted by motion and vibrations captured in cameras that use a scanning vector sensor with an interlaced scheme. In particular, the method is developed for images captured by a staggered time delay and integration camera distorted by motion. The algorithm improves the motion-distorted image by adjusting its fields irrespective of the type of motion that occurs during the exposure. The algorithm performs two tasks: estimation of the field relative motion during the exposure by a normal least-squares estimation technique and improvement of the degraded image from such motion distortion. The algorithm uses matrix computations; therefore it has a computation advantage over algorithms based on the technique of searching for a match. The algorithm is successfully demonstrated on both simulated and real images.
