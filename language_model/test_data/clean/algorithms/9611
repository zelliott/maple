This paper presents an algorithm for fast image synthesis inside deformed volumes. Given the node displacements of a mesh and a reference 3-D image dataset of a predeformed volume, the method first maps the image pixels that need to be synthesized from the deformed configuration to the nominal predeformed configuration, where the pixel intensities are obtained easily through interpolation in the regular-grid structure of the reference voxel volume. This mapping requires the identification of the mesh element enclosing each pixel for every image frame. To accelerate this point location operation, a fast method of projecting the deformed mesh on image pixels is introduced in this paper. The method presented was implemented for ultrasound B-mode image simulation of a synthetic tissue phantom. The phantom deformation as a result of ultrasound probe motion was modeled using the finite element method. Experimental images of the phantom under deformation were then compared with the corresponding synthesized images using sum of squared differences and mutual information metrics. Both this quantitative comparison and a qualitative assessment show that realistic images can be synthesized using the proposed technique. An ultrasound examination system was also implemented to demonstrate that real-time image synthesis with the proposed technique can be successfully integrated into a haptic simulation.
