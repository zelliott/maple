About 7-day (circaseptan) components, found at different levels of organization, notably in relation to growth, regeneration, repair and development, are often viewed as reflecting no more than the 7-day societal schedule, ample evidence for a built-in feature notwithstanding. Herein, we resolve circaseptans in geomagnetic pulsations recorded by a stand-alone magnetometer residing in Antarctica, far away from societal influences. Human physiological data, collected in the neonatal intensive care unit, show by intra-class correlation analysis that the nonlinearly assessed circaseptan period of heart rate, diastolic blood pressure and body weight is more similar between same-gender twins than among twin pairs, lending additional support for the endogenicity of circaseptans. Like circadians, about-weekly features in environmental variables such as geomagnetic pulsations were genetically acquired in the course of evolution.
