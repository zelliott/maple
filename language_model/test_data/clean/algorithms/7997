Ischemic postconditioning, a simple mechanical maneuver at the onset of reperfusion, reduces infarct size after ischemia/reperfusion. After its first description in 2003 by Zhao et al. numerous experimental studies have investigated this protective phenomenon. Whereas the underlying mechanisms and signal transduction are not yet understood in detail, infarct size reduction by ischemic postconditioning was confirmed in all species tested so far, including man. We have now reviewed the literature with focus on experimental models and protocols to better understand the determinants of protection by ischemic postconditioning or lack of it. Only studies with infarct size as unequivocal endpoint were considered. In all species and models, the duration of index ischemia and the protective protocol algorithm impact on the outcome of ischemic postconditioning, and gender, age, and myocardial temperature contribute.
