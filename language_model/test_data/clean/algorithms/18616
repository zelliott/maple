The purposes of this study were (1) to measure the nonlinear force-deflection behavior of selected orthodontic wires using a conventional tensile test, (2) to extend a mathematical model for simulating the force system produced by orthodontic wires based on the small-deflection linear theory to the large-deflection nonlinear theory, and (3) to examine the effects of the cross-section and mechanical properties of orthodontic wires on nonlinear characteristics. A method for extending a mathematical model for simulating the force system produced by orthodontic wires based on the small-deflection linear theory to the large-deflection nonlinear theory was established, and this can provide a clear view of the true nature of orthodontic wires. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that the nonlinear properties of orthodontic wires were affected more by the cross-sectional shape than by mechanical properties.
