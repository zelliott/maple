This article is a scientific review on the effects of senescence of the respiratory chain and it aims to provide an overview of what role exercise has on the way the aging of the respiratory chain occurs. There are several reasons that explain the lack of exercise in senescent, less need, less interest, different goals, and also deficiencies that make these decisions strongest, as mild equilibrium, coordination, strength, or vision abnormalities. The use of the whole respiratory chain from the mithocondria to the the lungs, its solicitation through exercise and a proper nutrition are basic to limit the senescence of the system. The capacity for renewal and adaptation to processes of time, environment exposition and use, will define a faster, difficult and hopeless or slower and comfortable aging. The absence of movement, the lack of function of any organ or system leads to the inefficiency, atrophy and death.
