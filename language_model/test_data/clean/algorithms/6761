Coeliac disease is a permanent intolerance to gluten which requests a quick diagnosis as soon as possible to prevent neoplastic and non-neoplastic complications of the disease, since frequently coeliac disease shows pauci- or asymptomatic forms. We describe herein the most common non invasive diagnostic methods used in clinical practice to diagnose coeliac disease, as well as we describe non invasive methods poorly used or which will play a key role in the non invasive diagnosis of coeliac disease in the future.
