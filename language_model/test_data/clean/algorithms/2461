In cultured rat neocortical interneurons, we have studied the effect of long-term application of NMDA or AMPA on the surface density of the NMDA (GluN) receptor subunits GluN1 and GluN2B. Stimulation of Ca(2+) -permeable AMPA (GluA) receptors located on the interneurons decreased the response of GluN receptors. The reduction was caused by a decrease in the surface density of GluN1/GluN2B subunits. In contrast, stimulation of GluN receptors located on the interneurons enhanced the surface density of GluN1/GluN2B subunits. Both effects could be induced by network activation.
