Since its introduction into the operating room, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has proven to be an invaluable diagnostic tool for perioperative patient management. TEE allows direct visualization of structural and functional cardiac abnormalities. Therefore, it has become the most important imaging technique to evaluate valular function. Pressure gradients across a stenotic valve can be calculated by measuring the blood flow velocity within the valve. Additionally, the area of the valve can be estimated by using the continuity equation. The severity of regurgitant blood flow across an incompetent valve can be assessed using color flow, continuous or pulsed-wave Doppler. Surgical patients experience significant changes in blood pressure, intrathoracic pressures and volume status in the perioperative period. Therefore, the interaction between these parameters and valvular function is the focus of recent clinical studies and might in future contribute to the perioperative as well as anesthesiological management of patients with valvular dysfunction.
