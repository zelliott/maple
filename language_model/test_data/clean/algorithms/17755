A new hybrid event based control architecture for tele-robotic systems controlled through the Internet is proposed in this paper. Different from the traditional event based control method, the new framework does not require every part of the system to be strictly event synchronized. Instead, it allows time referenced control components to be integrated into this framework, which makes it more convenient to develop Internet based control systems. Since there are two reference variables, time and event, in this architecture, how to coordinate these components with different references to keep the stability of the whole system is discussed in detail in this paper. To verify this new idea, an experiment was conducted to control the end effector of a PUMA robot tracking a continuous state trajectory given on-line by the remote operator. Experimental results confirmed the stability of such systems being controlled through the Internet in real-time.
