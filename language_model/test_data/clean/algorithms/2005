Autism is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder with high heritability and an unclear etiology. The identification of key genes related to autism may elucidate its etiology. The current study provides an approach to predicting autism susceptibility genes. Genes are first extracted from the biomedical literature, and some autism susceptibility genes are then recognized as seeds by the prior knowledge. As candidates, the remaining genes are predicted by creating association rules between the seeds and candidates. In an evaluated data set, 27 autism susceptibility genes (type "Y") are extracted and 43 possible autism susceptibility genes (type "P") are predicted. The sum of "Y" and "P" genes accounts for 93.3% of the data set that are not contained in the typical database of autism susceptibility genes. Our approach can effectively extract and predict autism susceptibility genes from the biomedical literature. These predicted results complement the typical database of autism susceptibility genes. The web portal for the predicted results, which is freely available at http://biolab.hyit.edu.cn/ar, can be a valuable resource in studies of diseases related to genes.
