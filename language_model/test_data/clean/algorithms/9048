To test a magnetic resonance image (MRI) technique that uses an additional pulse in multi-echo T2* sequence that works to suppress the fat signal, in subjects with liver iron overload and concomitant presence of fat in the liver, which have been revealed as a major drawback that compromises the correct iron quantification by MRI.

Fifty magnetic resonance images of the liver (1.5T scanner) of individuals with blood ferritin increases were retrospectively reviewed for the presence of steatosis, using the sequence in and out of phase, and iron overloading, using two sequences T2 * multi-echo: one standard and other with additional fat suppression pulse. T2 * values and their standard deviations were analyzed statistically.

Our results showed that a significantly lower standard deviation of T2* values is obtained when the fat saturation pulse is applied in patients with steatosis. We found that modulation of fat signal on liver iron overload resulted in a different categorization of some patients. In one case, the patient was re-classified within normal levels of liver iron.

Our findings may contribute to a better measure of liver iron overload with relevant implications for patient treatment and care.
