New graphical algorithm is proposed to find vertex functions which are the coefficients of expansion of the Landau free energy of polydisperse multigraft copolymers whose macromolecules comprise an arbitrary number of types of side chains. This algorithm imposes no restriction on length distributions of side chains in copolymer macromolecules as well as on distribution of distances between two successive grafting points along the backbone. By way of example, with this algorithm the expressions for the second, third, and fourth order contributions into the free energy have been derived. The obtained results can be used for construction of the phase diagrams of polydisperse multigraft copolymers.
