The concept of multiobjective optimization (MOO) has been integrated with variable length chromosomes for the development of a nonparametric genetic classifier which can overcome the problems, like overfitting/overlearning and ignoring smaller classes, as faced by single objective classifiers. The classifier can efficiently approximate any kind of linear and/or nonlinear class boundaries of a data set using an appropriate number of hyperplanes. While designing the classifier the aim is to simultaneously minimize the number of misclassified training points and the number of hyperplanes, and to maximize the product of class wise recognition scores. The concepts of validation set (in addition to training and test sets) and validation functional are introduced in the multiobjective classifier for selecting a solution from a set of nondominated solutions provided by the MOO algorithm. This genetic classifier incorporates elitism and some domain specific constraints in the search process, and is called the CEMOGA-Classifier (constrained elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm based classifier). Two new quantitative indices, namely, the purity and minimal spacing, are developed for evaluating the performance of different MOO techniques. These are used, along with classification accuracy, required number of hyperplanes and the computation time, to compare the CEMOGA-Classifier with other related ones.
