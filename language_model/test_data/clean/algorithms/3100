Snoring is not necessarily a benign condition; it can be linked to the serious condition obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). In some cases mandibular repositioning devices can be an effective treatment for simple snoring and mild to moderate sleep apnoea, and these devices can be provided by dentists (with appropriate training and in line with Dental Protection Ltd guidelines). Until now, the dental profession has not been given any guidance on how to differentiate between patients who may be treated without further reference to medical colleagues (ie simple snorers), and those who should be referred for specialist assessment. The aim of this paper is to facilitate safe treatment of snoring and OSA and to protect dentists by explaining an accepted method for screening patients for obstructive sleep apnoea.
