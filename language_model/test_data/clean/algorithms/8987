Searching metabolic pathways that relate two compounds is a common task in bioinformatics. This is of particular interest when trying, for example, to discover metabolic relations among compounds clustered with a data mining technique. Search strategies find sequences to relate two or more states (compounds) using an appropriate set of transitions (reactions). Evolutionary algorithms carry out the search guided by a fitness function and explore multiple candidate solutions using stochastic operators. In this work we propose an evolutionary algorithm for searching metabolic pathways between two compounds. The operators and fitness function employed are described and the effect of mutation rate is studied. Performance of this algorithm is compared with two classical search strategies.
