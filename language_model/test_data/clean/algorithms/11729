Vascular segmentation has recently been given much attention. This review paper has two parts. Part I of this review focused on the physics of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and prefiltering techniques applied to MRA. Part II of this review presents the state-of-the-art overview, status, and new achievements in vessel segmentation algorithms from MRA. The first part of this review paper is focused on the nonskeleton or direct-based techniques. Here, we present eight different techniques along with their mathematical foundations, algorithms and their pros and cons. We will also focus on the skeleton or indirect-based techniques. We will discuss three different techniques along with their mathematical foundations, algorithms and their pros and cons. This paper also includes a clinical discussion on skeleton versus nonskeleton-based segmentation techniques. Finally, we shall conclude this paper with the possible challenges, the future, and a brief summary on vascular segmentation techniques.
