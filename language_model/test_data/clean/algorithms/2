In this article we present a statistical model that, when applied in conjunction with existing image analysis technology, allows for a precise quantification of two-component visual fields. Application of this methodology to the problem of quantification of hair density in patients with hair loss disorders yields excellent results. Under photographically controlled conditions this method should yield completely consistent and valid results. The complete absence of subjective bias in the application of this method makes it an extremely attractive alternative to existing procedures. Limitations to the use of this methodology are detailed, and an alternative approach is suggested.
