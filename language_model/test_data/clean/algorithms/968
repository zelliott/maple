A similarity index based on the hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties of molecules is presented. Such an index is defined based on the fractional partition of the free energy of solvation developed within the framework of the self-consistent reaction field MST model, which divides the free energy of solvation or the free energy of transfer into contributions assigned to the surface elements defining the solute/solvent interface. These surface contributions can be integrated to derive atomic or group contributions. The suitability of the index to compute the molecular similarity based on hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties is examined by considering their application in a variety of test systems, including structure-activity relationships, absorption properties, and molecular recognition. The similarity index is expected to be a very powerful tool in molecular similarity studies for compounds of chemical, biochemical, and pharmaceutical interest.
