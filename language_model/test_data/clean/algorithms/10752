An ultrasound technique for imaging objects significantly smaller than the source wavelength is investigated. Signals from a focused beam are recorded over an image plane in the acoustic farfield and backprojected in the wave-vector domain to the focal plane. A superresolution image recovery method is then used to analyze the Fourier spatial frequency spectrum of the signal in an attempt to deduce the location and size of objects in this plane. The physical foundation for the method is rooted in the fact that high spatial frequencies introduced by the object in fact affect the lower (nonevanescent) spatial frequencies of the overall signal. The technique achieves this by using a priori measurements of the ultrasound focus in water, which gives full spectral information about the image source. A guess is then made regarding the size and location of the object that distorted the field, and this is convolved with the a priori measurement, thus creating a candidate image. A large number of candidates are generated and the one whose spectrum best matches the uncorrected image is accepted. The method is demonstrated using 0.34- and 0.60-mm wires with a focused 1.05-MHz ultrasound signal and then a human hair (approximately 0.03 mm) with a 4.7-MHz signal.
