Brain death is a condition widely recognized by philosophers, theologians, the public, and the law. Criteria for the determination of brain death have been progressively refined for almost 30 years. They involve clinical evidence of the loss of brain function and various periods of observation, which can often be shortened by confirmatory tests, particularly cerebral blood flow studies or electroencephalography. Prompt declaration of brain death is therefore possible. In addition, it is important for physicians to offer the possibility of organ donation to the patient's family both because organs are desperately needed and because many families desire this. A model algorithm for the determination of brain death, explanatory text, and appropriate references are presented to aid the development of protocols for individual and hospital use.
