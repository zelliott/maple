Obstructive sleep-disordered breathing is associated with upper airway obstruction during sleep, which negatively affects sleep quality, ventilation, and/or oxygenation. The condition affects 2-11% of children. In this paper we discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of obstructive sleep-disordered breathing in children and provide a brief overview of the Arkansas Children's Hospital Sleep Disorder Center.
