An interdisciplinary process for the reduction of medication errors was implemented at East Jefferson General Hospital in Metairie, Louisiana, a suburb of New Orleans. The Medication Administration Review and Safety Committee expanded the error reporting system with a comprehensive concurrent chart review process. Safe administration of medications through a systems approach has led to a reduction of documentation deficiencies, a new follow-up process, and an increase in reported errors.
