The paper is concerned with the problem of stereological volumenometry applied to the problems of ultrasound topometry of the thyroid. The organ surfaces are tightened on the basis of information obtained from echotomographic films using a method of cubic spline-interpolation, parametric function setting and methods of computer graphics. Images of sections can be obtained with an arbitrary step and an angle of inclination to the organ longitudinal axis. The main sources of errors of the method were estimated, and their numeric values were given.
