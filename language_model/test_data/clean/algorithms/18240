Phalen's test, with more than 100 degrees of elbow flexion, is not always comfortable for patients with elbow pathology. Therefore, we suggest a modification of the test with the patient having both arms resting on a pillow or arm-holders in a relaxed position, the hands floating at the end, and the examiner passively flexing (or reversed: extending) the hands up to 90 degrees.
