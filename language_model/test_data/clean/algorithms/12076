A view order that matches k-space sampling to cardiac motion within the acquisition window was developed for breath-hold three-dimensional contrast material-enhanced coronary magnetic resonance angiography. In vivo experiments in seven volunteers demonstrated that blurring was substantially reduced with this motion-matched view order as compared with the standard centric view order. Coronary arteries were well delineated.
