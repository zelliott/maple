Isolates of Discula destructiva Redlin and an undescribed species of Discula, the filamentous fungi that cause anthracnose of flowering (Cornus florida L.) and Pacific (Cornus nuttalli Aud.) dogwoods, were analyzed for genetic variation by nucleic acid scanning with arbitrary mini-hairpin oligonucleotide primers. While the fungal population was highly homogeneous throughout the disease range in eastern and western North America, the generation of arbitrary signatures from amplification profiles (ASAP) distinguished isolates from the northeast, middle and southern Appalachian mountain range, and western United States and Canada. ASAP involves a dual-step arbitrary primer-based amplification procedure that generates a large number of informative allelic characters by amplification of monomorphic DNA fingerprints. ASAP analyses showed a fine fungal population structure consistent with the recent and separate introduction of the pathogen on the west and east coasts of North America.
