computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen is an established, albeit expensive and perhaps overused, diagnostic modality for the evaluation of the injured patient. We developed a practice management guideline for blunt abdominal trauma intended to reduce the percentage of negative CT scans, yet minimize delayed recognition of injury and non-therapeutic laparotomy.

between April 1996 and March 1997, 1147 adult patients at risk for blunt abdominal injury were admitted to our Level I trauma centre and underwent abdominal evaluation according to the practice management guideline.

abdominal CT was performed in 522 patients (45%), and 441 scans were negative (85%). Delayed recognition of injury and non-therapeutic laparotomy rates were low, 4% and 1.6%, respectively.

abdominal CT scanning in trauma patients can achieve low non-therapeutic laparotomy and delayed recognition of injury rates but at the expense of high negative CT scan rates. Greater reliance on the physical examination and perhaps abdominal ultrasound may reduce negative CT scan rates and yet preserve low non-therapeutic laparotomy and delayed recognition of injury rates.
