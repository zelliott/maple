Stratum corneum (SC) desorption experiments have yielded higher calculated steady-state fluxes than those obtained by epidermal penetration studies. A possible explanation of this result is a variable diffusion or partition coefficient across the SC. We therefore developed the diffusion model for percutaneous penetration and desorption to study the effects of either a variable diffusion coefficient or variable partition coefficient in the SC over the diffusion path length. Steady-state flux, lag time, and mean desorption time were obtained from Laplace domain solutions. Numerical inversion of the Laplace domain solutions was used for simulations of solute concentration-distance and amount penetrated (desorbed)-time profiles. Diffusion and partition coefficients heterogeneity were examined using six different models. The effect of heterogeneity on predicted flux from desorption studies was compared with that obtained in permeation studies. Partition coefficient heterogeneity had a more profound effect on predicted fluxes than diffusion coefficient heterogeneity. Concentration-distance profiles show even larger dependence on heterogeneity, which is consistent with experimental tape-stripping data reported for clobetasol propionate and other solutes. The clobetasol propionate tape-stripping data were most consistent with the partition coefficient decreasing exponentially for half the SC and then becoming a constant for the remaining SC.
