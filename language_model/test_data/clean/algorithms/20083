A new algorithmic approach is proposed for correspondence analysis of different types of data in zoological systematics. The algorithm is tested on actual data. A high degree of correspondence is shown for morphometric and genetic distances in the tested set of species. Two directions of variation in both character spaces have clearly appeared. The first direction discriminates families; the second discriminates orders. The characters responsible for these differences have been revealed. After uniting both distance matrixes, the morphological one and the molecular genetic one, into a single matrix, and displaying the summarized distances between species on a plane, the configuration of species remained principally unchanged. The principal directions of variations were preserved and marked the differences between orders, families, and genera.
