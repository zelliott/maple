In this study, quantitative structure-activity/property models are developed for modeling and predicting both MEK inhibitory activity and oral bioavailability of novel isothiazole-4-carboxamidines. The models developed are thoroughly discussed to identify the key components that influence the inhibitory activity and oral bioavailability of the selected compounds. These selected descriptors serve as a first guideline for the design of novel and potent MEK inhibitors with desired ADME properties.
