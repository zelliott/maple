Speciation affects trace metal bioavailability. One model used to describe the importance of speciation is the biotic ligand model (BLM), wherein the competition of inorganic and organic ligands with a biotic ligand for free-ion trace metal determines the ultimate metal availability to biota. This and similar models require natural ligand concentrations and conditional stability constants as input parameters. In concept, the BLM is itself an analogue of some analytical approaches to the determination of trace metal speciation. A notable example is competitive ligand equilibration/cathodic stripping voltammetry, which employs an artificial ligand for comparative assessment of natural ligand concentrations and discrete conditional stability constants (i.e., BLM parameters) in a natural sample. Here, we report a new numerical approach to voltammetric speciation and parameter estimation that employs multiple analytical windows and a two-step optimization process, simultaneously generating both parameters and a complete suite of corresponding species concentrations. This approach is more powerful, systematic, and flexible than those previously reported.
