Assessment of different diagnostic sequences, in patients VIH(+) with a suspected pulmonary infection.

A cross-sectional descriptive study of 76 HIV(+) patients with suspected respiratory infection. It has been determined the validity and the pretest and post-test probability of the radiology (Rx) of thorax, 67Ga pulmonary scintigraphy and seric LDH levels, in order to design four different diagnostic algorithms.

The diagnostic sequence Rx-LDH-scintigraphy with normal results involved an infection probability of 58.0%. Pathological Rx with successively normal LDH and scintigraphy, implied a likelihood of 97.0%. The LDH elevation in sequence with scintigraphy and Rx rose to 96.1% if both were abnormal and diminished to 8.3% if normal.

The LDH elevation associated with the sequence of normal Rx and scintigraphy suggests a low infection likelihood. On the contrary, associated with pathological Rx and scintigraphy in sequence, practically assures the pulmonary infection.
