Studies examining dual adaptation to opposing novel environments have yielded contradictory results, with previous evidence supporting both successful dual adaptation and interference leading to poorer adaptive performance. Whether or not interference is observed during dual adaptation appears to be dependent on the method used to allow the performer of the task to distinguish between two novel environments. This experiment tested if colour cues, a separation in workspace, and presentation schedule, could be used to distinguish between two opposing visuomotor rotations and enable dual adaptation. Through the use of a purpose designed manipulandum, each visuomotor rotation was either presented in the same region of workspace and associated with colour cues (Group 1), different regions of workspace in addition to colour cues (Groups 2 and 3) or different regions of workspace only (Groups 4 and 5). We also assessed the effectiveness of the workspace separation with both randomised and alternating presentation schedules (Groups 4 and 5). The results indicated that colour cues were not effective at enabling dual adaptation when each of the visuomotor rotations was associated with the same region of workspace. When associated with different regions of workspace, however, dual adaptation to the opposing rotations was successful regardless of whether colour cues were present or the type of presentation schedule.
