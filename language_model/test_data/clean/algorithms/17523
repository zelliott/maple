In this paper, we propose a novel approach for electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) mixture spectra analysis based on blind source separation (BSS) technique. EPR spectrum of a free radical is often superimposed by overlapping spectra of other species. It is important and challenging to accurately identify and quantify the 'pure' spectra from such mixtures. In this study, an automated BSS method implementing independent component analysis is used to extract the components from mixed EPR spectra that contain overlapping components of different paramagnetic centers. To apply this method, there is no requirement to know the component spectra or the number of components in advance. The method is applied to analyze free radical EPR spectra which are collected from standard chemical system, cultured cell suspense, and ex vivo rat kidneys by spin trapping EPR technique. Results show that the BSS method proposed here is capable of identifying the component EPR spectra from mixtures with unknown compositions. The BSS technique can offer powerful aids in resolving spectral overlapping problems in general EPR spectroscopy analysis.
