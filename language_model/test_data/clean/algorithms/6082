The neural substrate for song behavior in songbirds, the song control system (SCS), is thus far the best-documented brain circuit in which to study neuroplasticity and adult neurogenesis. Not only does the volume of the key song control nuclei change in size, but also the density of the connections between them changes as a function of seasonal and hormonal influences. This study explores the potentials of in vivo Diffusion-Tensor MRI (DT-MRI or DTI) to visualize the distinct, concentrated connections of the SCS in the brain of the starling (Sturnus vulgaris). In vivo DTI on starling was performed on a 7T MR system using sagittal and coronal slices. DTI was accomplished with diffusion gradients applied in seven non-collinear directions. Fractional Anisotropy (FA)-maps allowed us to distinguish most of the grey matter and white matter-tracts, including the laminae subdividing the avian telencephalon and the tracts connecting the major song control nuclei (e.g., HVC with RA and X). The FA-maps also allowed us to discern a number of song control, auditory and visual nuclei. Fiber tracking was implemented to illustrate the discrimination of all tracts running from and to RA. Because of the remarkable plasticity inherent to the songbird brain, the successful implementation of DTI in this model could represent a useful tool for the in vivo exploration of fiber degeneration and regeneration and the biological mechanisms involved in brain plasticity.
