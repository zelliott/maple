Congenital lobar emphysema (CLE) is characterized by overinflation of a pulmonary lobe and may present as a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. The authors have reviewed their experience to clarify the controversies about the diagnosis and management of CLE in children.

Children who had CLE and were treated at our department between 1991 and 1998, inclusive, were reviewed.

Fourteen children consisting of 8 boys and 6 girls (age range, 25 days to 2.5 years) had CLE. Eight children (57%) were symptomatic at birth. Major presenting symptoms were dyspnea (n = 8, 57%), cyanosis (n = 6, 43%) and recurrent respiratory tract infection (n = 4, 28.5%). Chest x-rays and computerized tomography scans showed hyperaeration of the affected lobes in 14 and 12 patients, respectively. Pulmonary perfusion scan was performed in 8 patients and showed loss of perfusion in the affected lobe in 7 cases. The affected sites were left upper lobe (n = 8, 57%), right middle lobe (n = 4, 28.5%) and right upper lobe (n = 2, 14.5%). Congenital cardiac anomalies were encountered in 2 patients (14.5%). Ten children underwent lobectomy, and postoperative course was uneventful. Nonoperative management was performed in 4 cases (28.5%) presenting at older age with milder symptoms. In the latter, although symptoms subsided, radiological abnormalities persisted during the follow-up period of 3 months to 4 years. No mortality was encountered in the series.

The diagnosis of CLE is established by combined radiological and scintigraphic imaging methods. Surgical excision of the affected lobe is the appropriate treatment in all infants under 2 months of age and in infants older than 2 months presenting with severe respiratory symptoms. Infants older than 2 months presenting with mild to moderate respiratory symptoms associated with normal bronchoscopic findings can be treated conservatively. In conservative management, the children should be under close follow-up, and the family should be alarmed about the disease. Further studies are required to determine the long-term outcome of conservative management.
