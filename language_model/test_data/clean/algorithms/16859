The role of cytology has so far been underrecognized in the diagnostic process of hematopathological questions. This article presents an algorithm which allows a stepwise work-up of cytology specimens obtained by minimally invasive ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration in patients with unexplained lymph node swelling. Moreover, it is shown how the selective separation of cytology specimens allows the application of immunophenotypic analysis including flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry as well as molecular analyses, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) strategies. With the integrative procedure presented, cytology offers an excellent cost-effective tool for the diagnostic approach of patients with suspected hematopathological malignancies allowing a high diagnostic accuracy, ideal for initial diagnosis or follow-up.
