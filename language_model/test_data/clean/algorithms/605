Simple reaction time, a simple model of sensory-to-motor behavior, has been extensively investigated and its role in inferring elementary mental organization has been postulated. However, little is known about the neuronal mechanisms underlying it. To elucidate the neuronal substrates, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals were collected during a simple reaction task paradigm using simple cues consisting of different modalities and simple triggered movements executed by different effectors. We hypothesized that a specific neural network that characterizes simple reaction time would be activated irrespective of the input modalities and output effectors. Such a neural network was found in the right posterior superior temporal cortex, right premotor cortex, left ventral premotor cortex, cerebellar vermis, and medial frontal gyrus. The right posterior superior temporal cortex and right premotor cortex were also activated by different modality sensory cues in the absence of movements. The shared neural network may play a role in sensory triggered movements.
