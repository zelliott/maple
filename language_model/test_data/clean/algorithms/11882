The purpose of this work is to calculate end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes of Halobatrachus didactylus ventricles, from two-dimensional (2D) echocardiographic images, comparing four different linear methods, and to derive systolic indices of ventricular function-fractional shortening, ejection fraction, stroke volume, and cardiac output independent of the Fick principle. Echocardiography provided high resolution images of cardiac structures and allowed accurate linear measurements. The Simpson algorithm proved to be the best method of calculating ventricle volumes. As a corollary, ventricular mass can be derived from echocardiographic volume data. This noninvasive method promises wide utilization in experimental comparative cardiovascular biology.
