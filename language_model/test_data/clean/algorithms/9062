This paper presents simulation of speckle activity through controlling a moving plate. We present two procedures to extract the initial movement frequency and amplitude, either through correlation calculus or through processing the temporal history of the speckle pattern. We compare and discuss these two methods in terms of efficiency and the ability to retrieve motion parameters. The correlation technique seems to be more suitable for monitoring biospeckle activity as it provides more reliable parameter estimation than the temporal history of the speckle pattern. The evolution of temporal history of the speckle pattern parameters and their response sensibility with amplitude and frequency variations have been studied and quantified. Briers contrast appears to depend only on movement amplitude, whereas inertia moment varies with amplitude and frequency.
