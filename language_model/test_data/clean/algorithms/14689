BSP is a well established discipline and constitutes the corner stone for the training of Biomedical Engineers both at undergraduate and at graduate levels. No basic curriculum on Biomedical Engineering could even exist without one or more BSP courses. All the advanced methods of signal processing (from traditional linear digital filtering up to non linear higher-order approaches) have been applied to BSP. The EEG signal, which is basically pseudo-stochastic, is a good example: the information contained in the original tracings, which are generally used for physiological or clinical interpretation, is hardly directly interpretable unless a more or less complicate pre-processing is done. This reasoning is obviously applicable, in different contexts, to other biomedical signals.
