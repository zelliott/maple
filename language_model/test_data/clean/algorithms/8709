The expected cell count for a 2 x 2 contingency table, governed by the noncentral (extended) hypergeometric distribution, is expressed as a terminating continued fraction. The coefficients in the continued fraction are better behaved than the multinomial coefficients required for the usual moment calculation. The expected cell count must be calculated repeatedly in a conditional maximum likelihood analysis of K2 x 2 contingency tables. Since the continued fraction can be easily evaluated, a rapid and numerically stable computational algorithm results. Once this first moment is known, higher moments can be obtained as shown by Harkness (1965, Annals of Mathematical Statistics 36, 938-945). A BASIC program to implement the continued fraction algorithm is given in an appendix.
