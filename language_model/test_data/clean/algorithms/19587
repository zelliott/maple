Clinical practice guidelines are statements developed from best evidence about clinically relevant appropriate care. A simulated patient case is presented to demonstrate how to use a CPG in decision-making in determining a clinical decision. Conceptualized knowledge management software templates are provided to explain a process by which best evidence is retrieved from a primary, centralized network database. Templates describe the process of converting a clinical question into a research question, retrieving best evidence, and performing data analysis for the outcome of individualizing and optimizing a clinical decision. Templates also describe the reciprocation of information to update CPGs by translational researchers who manage and build the primary, centralized network database.
