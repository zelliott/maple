In this study, we investigate the problem of detecting time epochs when zero-velocity updates can be applied in a foot-mounted inertial navigation (motion tracking) system. We examine three commonly used detectors: the acceleration moving variance detector, the acceleration magnitude detector, and the angular rate energy detector. We demonstrate that all detectors can be derived within the same general likelihood ratio test framework given the different prior knowledge about the sensor signals. Further, by combining all prior knowledge, we derive a new likelihood ratio test detector. Subsequently, we develop a methodology to evaluate the performance of the detectors. Employing the developed methodology, we evaluate the performance of the detectors using leveled ground, slow (approx. 3 km/h) and normal (approx. 5 km/h) gait data. The test results are presented in terms of detection versus false-alarm probability. Our preliminary results shows that the new detector performs marginally better than the angular rate energy detector that outperforms both the acceleration moving variance detector and the acceleration magnitude detector.
