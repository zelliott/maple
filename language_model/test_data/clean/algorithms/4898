This paper provides a general simulation study on tremor based on a modular neuromusculoskeletal model. It focuses on the peripheral mechanism. It is known that the reflex loops in the peripheral nervous system have influences on the tremor. A neuromusculoskeletal model with several reflex loops is developed to explore the dynamics of tremor. The muscle model is derived from a Hill-type muscle model. The reflex loops include the spindle organ, Golgi tendon organ, and Renshaw cell. Their effects are investigated quantitatively in detail. A two-muscle (agonist/antagonist) system with interaction is further studied. Moreover, a model in combination with the central oscillation and peripheral system is developed. Some results are in accordance with the previous research, whereas some new findings are proposed according to the simulation study.
