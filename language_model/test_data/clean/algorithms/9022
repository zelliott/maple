The accumulation of sub-rupture tendon fatigue damage in the extracellular matrix, particularly of type I collagen fibrils, is thought to contribute to the development of tendinopathy, a chronic and degenerative pathology of tendons. Quantitative assessment of collagen fibril alignment is paramount to understanding the importance of matrix injury to cellular function and remodeling capabilities. This study presents a novel application of edge detection analysis to calculate local collagen fibril orientation in tendon. This technique incorporates damage segmentation and stratification by severity which will allow future analysis of the direct effect of matrix damage severity on the cellular and molecular response.
