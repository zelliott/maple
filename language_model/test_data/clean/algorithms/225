The ocular fundus is the only area of human body where vascular system is visible using relatively simple instrumentation. Furthermore, there is medical suggestive evidence of a direct relationship between certain measures of vascular characteristics in the ocular fundus (arteriolar and venular calibers and focal arteriolar narrowing) and cardiovascular diseases. In order to establish such relationship on sound statistical basis a method must be provided to measure the needed values in an easy, yet precise and repeatable way. This paper presents a system to assist physicians in signaling and storing the data associated to signs of vascular deterioration and vascular calibers in non-mydriatic ocular fundus images. The system is built around a graphical user interface that, even not fully automatic, guides the practitioner to mark certain anatomic visible features in an easy and precise way. The data are exported in common database formats for further processing and a statistical summary is also presented.
