While the recent developments in the velocity-sensitive MR imaging offer great potential for non-invasive assessment of blood flow in major blood vessels, the clinical applications of this technique have been hampered by tedious, human-assisted data processing techniques. In this paper, we describe a robust system for automated extraction of quantitative as well as qualitative flow information from velocity-sensitive, phase contrast MR images. The algorithm accomplishes reliable segmentation of blood vessels using multiresolution analysis based on wavelet transform, and employs a multivariate scoring criterion to minimize the impact of imaging artifacts such as partial volume averaging and flow turbulence, which normally cause incomplete or inaccurate detection of vascular boundaries.
