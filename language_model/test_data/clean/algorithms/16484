In recent years the number of interdisciplinary emergency departments (ED) at hospitals in Germany has increased. The model of decentralized first contact units for each medical discipline has been abandoned, last but not least due to economic considerations. While decentralized units could be staffed with personnel from each discipline there is much controversy surrounding the question of which kind of doctor is best suited for a centralized ED. The development of programs providing the necessary qualification for German ED physicians in the future by working groups of several specialties is still nascent and has not yet produced concrete results. However, even without these special training programs, the management of critically ill or severely injured patients in the ED is paramount. The smooth operation of centralized EDs is therefore important. Therefore, taking into account economical aspects, qualification and number of available personnel, this article introduces a staffing concept as a rational basis for an optimized patient management in centralized EDs in Germany. Taking the patient characteristics, the specific treatment modalities and the number of admissions to the ED into account, this paper will determine treatment time per patient and the necessary number of physicians, as well as an optimized staffing model for EDs.
