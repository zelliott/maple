In this paper, we present experimental and numerical analysis on Extraordinary Optical Transmission (EOT) or optical resonance transmission through various nano-hole arrays constructed from an optically thick metal film within the visible and near infra-red spectrum. Nano-hole arrays with different geometrical parameters (hole size, hole shape, and hole periodicity) having their EOT properties in the visible and near-infrared regime were simulated based on Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD). Large nano-hole arrays with geometric properties similar to the simulated arrays were fabricated using Electron Beam Lithography (EBL). The optical resonance transmission properties (resonance position, transmission efficiency, and spectral bandwidth of resonance peak) of the fabricated nano-hole arrays were characterized. Finally, the experimental and numerical results were analyzed to determine the dependencies and discrepancies between optical resonance transmission properties for various nano-hole arrays.
