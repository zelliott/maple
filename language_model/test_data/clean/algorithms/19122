We report about a 36-year-old patient, who developped 4 days after a pharyngitis a sepsis with high temperature und recurrent vomiting. The chest radiograph showed multiple pulmonary abcesses and in the computed tomography additionally a thrombosis was detected in a communicans vein between the right jugularis anterior and the jugularis interna. This disease is commonly known as Lemierre Syndrom. The most common pathogen is the Fusobacterium necrophorum, but other bacteria of the normal oropharyngeal flora can also be the causative organisms. Given an adequate antibiotic therapy and supportive care, the prognosis is favourable.
