In this study, a computer-assisted entropy-based feature extraction and decision tree induction protocol for breast cancer diagnosis using thermograph images was proposed. First, Beier-Neely field morphing and linear affine transformation were applied in geometric standardization for whole body and partial region respectively. Gray levels of pixel population at the same anatomical position were statistically analyzed for abnormal region classification. Morphological closing and opening operations were used to identify unified abnormal regions. Three types of 25 feature parameters (i.e. 10 geometric, 7 topological and 8 thermal) were extracted for parametric factor analysis. Positive and negative abnormal regions were further reclassified by decision trees to induce the case-based diagnostic rules. Finally, anatomical organ matching was utilized to identify the corresponding organ with the positive abnormal regions. To verify the validity of the proposed case-based diagnostic protocol, 71 and 131 female patients with and without breast cancer were analyzed. Experimental results indicated that 1750 abnormal regions (703 positive and 1047 negative) were detected and 822 branches were broken down into the decision space. Fourteen branches were found to have more than 4 positive abnormal regions. These critical diagnostic paths with less than 10% of positive abnormal regions (61/703=8.6%) can effectively classify more than half of the cancer patients (42/71=59.2%) in the abovementioned 14 branches.
