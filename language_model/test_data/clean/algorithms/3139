A RP-HPLC method for the simultaneous analysis of tocotrienol isoforms (TRF) and simvastatin (SIM) in SIM-TRF nanoparticles (NPs) was developed. Analytes were monitored by UV detection at 238 and 295 nm for SIM and TRF, respectively, using a gradient methanol/water elution. Calibration curves for TRF and SIM were linear over concentration range of 20-80 microg/mL and 1-10 microg/mL with correlation coefficients 0.9990 and 0.9991, respectively. The recovery of TRF and SIM from the NPs was in the range from 97.35 to 102.19% and from 92.71 to 104.35%, respectively. This developed method was successfully employed in quantifying both drugs in NPs for future use in cancer therapy.
