This article describes applications of scalar expectancy theory (SET), learning-to-time theory (LeT), and Packet theory to data from a peak procedure. Twelve rats were trained in a multiple cued-interval procedure with two fixed intervals (60 and 120 s) signaled by houselight and white noise. Twenty-five percent of the cycles were nonfood cycles, which were 360 s long and had no reinforcement. Mean and individual response rates on nonfood cycles were fitted with explicit solutions of SET, LeT and Packet theory. Applications of the three timing theories were compared in terms of goodness of fit and complexity.
