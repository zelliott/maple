A kinetic method is described for the estimation of neuroreceptor density as well as the rate constants for association and dissociation of rapidly equilibrating radioligands. The method is exemplified by positron emission tomographic measurements of the human brain using 11C-raclopride, a D 2 dopamine receptor antagonist, and 11C-Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. Using a linear non iterative algorithm, regional binding characteristics were calculated and displayed pixel by pixel in brain maps. Data from repeated experiments on the same subject with different amounts of the unlabeled ligand were utilized. The binding characteristics were determined according to a two step procedure in which the time course of the free radioligand concentration was estimated from a reference region considered to be free of specific receptor binding sites. Alternative methods to determine the concentration of free radioligand are discussed.
