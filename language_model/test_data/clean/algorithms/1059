In addition to clinical and laboratory findings, ultrasound is a very useful imaging procedure for the diagnosis of all rheumatic diseases. This method is able to monitor their development and dynamics. All joints that can be reached by the ultrasound beam are examined (from large ones such as the shoulder and knee to small ones such as fingers and toes) with various techniques and different frequencies.
