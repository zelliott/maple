Radiofrequency ablation is increasingly used in the treatment of hepatic tumors. Planning the percutaneous intervention is essential and particularly difficult. In this paper, we focus on an automated computation of optimal needle insertion in computer-assisted surgery with 3D visualization. First, we review our method which delineates on the skin of a virtual patient the candidate zones for needle insertion, i.e., those which allow safe access to the tumor. In each case, we look for the trajectory that minimizes the volume of burnt tissue. Secondly, we introduce a quasi-exhaustive method that allies sampling and certified minimization to form a strong argument for the accuracy of our results. We also compare results of applying both methods on 7 representative reconstructed patient cases.
