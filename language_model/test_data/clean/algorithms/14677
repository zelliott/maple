Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) may not be adequately managed with available therapeutic options. This phase III, randomized-withdrawal, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of tapentadol extended release (ER) for relieving painful DPN.

Patients (n = 588) with at least a 3-month history of opioid and/or non-opioid analgesic use for DPN, dissatisfaction with current treatment, and an average pain intensity score of at least 5 on an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS; 0 = 'no pain,' 10 = 'pain as bad as you can imagine') were titrated to an optimal dose of tapentadol ER (100-250 mg bid) during a 3-week open-label phase. Subsequently, patients (n = 395) with at least a 1-point reduction in pain intensity were randomized 1:1 to receive placebo or the optimal fixed dose of tapentadol ER determined during the open-label phase for a 12-week double-blind phase.

NCT00455520.

The primary efficacy outcome was the change in average pain intensity from randomization, determined by twice-daily NRS measurements. Safety was assessed throughout the study.

The least-squares mean difference between groups in the change in average pain intensity from the start of double-blind treatment to week 12 was -1.3 (95% confidence interval, -1.70 to -0.92; p < 0.001, tapentadol ER vs. placebo). A total of 60.5% (356/588) of patients reported at least a 30% improvement in pain intensity from the start to the end of the open-label titration phase; of the patients who were randomized to tapentadol ER, 53.6% (105/196) reported at least a 30% improvement from pre-titration to week 12 of the double-blind phase. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred during double-blind treatment with tapentadol ER included nausea, anxiety, diarrhea, and dizziness. Potential limitations of this study are related to the enriched enrollment randomized-withdrawal trial design, which may result in a more homogeneous patient population during double-blind treatment and may present a risk of unblinding because of changes in side effects from the open-label to the double-blind phase.

Compared with placebo, tapentadol ER 100-250 mg bid provided a statistically significant difference in the maintenance of a clinically important improvement in pain 1 , 2 and was well-tolerated by patients with painful DPN.
