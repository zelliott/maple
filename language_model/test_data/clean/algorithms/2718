There are no objective selection criteria described in the literature for the laparoscopic posterior retroperitoneal (PR) versus lateral transabdominal (LT) approach in a given patient. The aim of this study is to quantify the algorithm we have been using in our practice.

Within 11 years, 219 patients underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy at one institution. The laparoscopic LT technique was used in patients with unilateral tumors >6 cm. In those patients with unilateral tumors <6 cm, anthropometric parameters were used to select between laparoscopic PR and LT approaches. These parameters were quantified for 82 patients from computed tomography scans and their effects on operative time were calculated. Statistical analyses were performed by use of the t test and logistic regression analysis.

Fifty-two patients underwent laparoscopic LT and 30 patients underwent PR adrenalectomy. Patients were selected for the PR approach if the distance from Gerota's fascia to the skin was less than 5Â cm and the 12th rib was at or rostral to the level of renal hilum. On multivariate analysis, total operative time correlated with body mass index in the LT approach and thickness of the perinephric fat and the distance between the adrenal tumor and the upper pole of kidney in the PR approach.

In this study, we have described an objective algorithm that can be used to select patients with unilateral adrenal tumors <6 cm for a laparoscopic PR or LT approach with favorable perioperative outcomes.
