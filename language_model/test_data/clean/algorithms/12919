On the basis of a formal analogy with the irradiance moments, analytical definitions are proposed for the width of both the transverse and the longitudinal component of rotationally-symmetric radially-polarized fields at the focal plane of a high-focusing optical system. The beam width of the whole field is also introduced. The transverse beam size is thus associated with the overall spatial structure of the field. The beam-width definitions are applied to an illustrative example, which enables us to show that, at the focal plane, the power contained within a circle whose radius is given by the proposed beam widths represents the main part of the total power.
