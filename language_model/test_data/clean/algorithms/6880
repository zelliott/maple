The ability of iron oxide-coated sand (IOCS) to adsorb strontium from synthetic wastes simulating the tank wastes at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation was examined in this study. These wastes have high pH and high ionic strength, containing up to 5.5 M Na+, 3.7 M NO3-, and 1.2 M OH-. The use of IOCS in such applications may be advantageous because it is inexpensive, is nontoxic, and can be prepared from readily available materials. IOCS can selectively remove strontium from solutions, even when they contain overwhelmingly higher concentrations of potentially competing cations such as Ca2+, Al3+, and Cr3+. Sr-EDTA chelates do not adsorb to IOCS. However, the interference caused by EDTA can be substantially overcome by the addition of excess Ca to the solution since Ca displaces Sr from EDTA. The adsorbed Sr can be released, and the IOCS can be regenerated by exposure to dilute acid (pH approximately 3) for short periods. The physical and adsorptive properties of the IOCS remain essentially unaltered over at least several dozens of regeneration cycles, corresponding to treatment of at least 20000 bed volumes of influent. The only byproduct of the regeneration process is a small volume of residual waste containing essentially only strontium and dilute acid.
