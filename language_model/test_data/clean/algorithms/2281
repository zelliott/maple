Wavelets analysis methods have been widely used in the signal processing of biomedical signals. These methods represent the temporal characteristics of a signal by its spectral components in the frequency domain. In this way, important features of the signal can be extracted in order to understand or model the physiological system. This paper reviews the widely used orthogonal wavelet transform method in the biomedical applications.
