Patients with stage II non-small cell lung cancer who are not suitable for or refuse surgery are treated with radiotherapy, but the results reported so far are not satisfactory. To improve the prognosis of such patients, we have used hyperfractionated radiotherapy. In this paper, we retrospectively analyzed results of the treatment.

Between 1988 and 1993, 67 patients were treated with hyperfractionated radiotherapy with 1.2 Gy twice daily to a total dose of 69.6 Gy. All patients were technically operable, but 43 had medical problems and 24 refused surgery. The median age and Karnofsky performance status score was 60 and 90 years, respectively. No patient received chemotherapy or immunotherapy. The median follow-up period was 61 months.

The median survival time and the 5-year survival rate were 27 months and 25% (standard error, SE, 6%), respectively. The 5-year local control rate was 44% (SE,7%). Univariate analysis of prognostic factors revealed that a higher Karnofsky performance status score, weight loss of < or =5% before treatment, and T1 stage were associated with better prognosis, and peripheral location was of borderline significance (P = 0.053). There were two bronchopulmonary and two esophageal acute grade 3 toxicities, and one bronchopulmonary and two esophageal late grade 3 toxicities. No grade 4 or 5 toxicity was observed.

These results are encouraging and further studies on the use of hyperfractionation seem to be warranted for stage II non-small cell lung cancer.
