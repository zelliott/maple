Genome-wide transcriptome analyses have identified hundreds of genes encoding transcription factors that are induced or repressed by a range of environmental stresses. Their complex expression patterns suggest that stress tolerance and resistance are controlled at the transcriptional level by a complicated gene regulatory network. The next steps towards understanding stress biology at the systems level are reconstructing the network and then verifying the roles these transcription factors play in the network.
