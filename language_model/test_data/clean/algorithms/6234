Simulating and controlling physiological phenomena are notoriously complex tasks to tackle and require accurate models of the phenomena of interest. Currently, most physiological processes are described by a set of partial models capturing specific aspects of the phenomena, and usually their composition does not produce effective comprehensive models. A current open issue is thus the development of techniques able to effectively describe a phenomenon starting from partial models. This is particularly relevant for heart rate regulation modeling where a large number of heterogeneous partial models exists. In this paper we make the original proposal of adopting a multiagent paradigm, called anthropic agency, to provide a powerful and flexible tool for combining partial models of heart rate regulation for adaptive cardiac pacing applications. The partial models are embedded in autonomous computational entities, called agents, that cooperatively negotiate in order to smooth their conflicts on the values of the variables forming the global model the multiagent system provides. We experimentally evaluate our approach and we analyze its properties.
