Multiscale modeling and integration of physiological models carry challenges due to the complex nature of physiological processes. High coupling within and among scales present a significant challenge in constructing and integrating multiscale physiological models. In order to deal with such challenges in a systematic way, there is a significant need for an information technology framework together with related analytical and computational tools that will facilitate integration of models and simulations of complex biological systems. Physiological Model Simulation, Integration and Modeling Framework (Phy-SIM) is an information technology framework providing the tools to facilitate development, integration and simulation of integrated models of human physiology. Phy-SIM brings software level solutions to the challenges raised by the complex nature of physiological systems. The aim of Phy-SIM, and this paper is to lay some foundation with the new approaches such as information flow and modular representation of the physiological models. The ultimate goal is to enhance the development of both the models and the integration approaches of multiscale physiological processes and thus this paper focuses on the design approaches that would achieve such a goal.
