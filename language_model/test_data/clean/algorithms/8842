Oro-tracheal intubation and selected surgical conditions are facilitated by a deep neuromuscular block (NMB), but patient's security can be jeopardized by its residual effects at the time of tracheal extubation. Although neostigmine remains the reference reversal agent in many situations, the limitations of its efficacy must be well understood (ceiling effect, delay of action, side effects). It is best administered after re-emergence of the 3rd or 4th train-of-four (TOF) response. Sugammadex causes more predictable and more rapid recoveries from much deeper rocuronium-induced NMB. Therefore, maintaining deep NMB during surgery is no longer incompatible with rapid recovery and safe extubation. In Belgium, the use of sugammadex and its reimbursement depend on specific conditions. The excellent clinical tolerance of sugammadex benefits to patients at risk of developing complications related to residual NMB or to the undesirable effects of neostigmine. In all cases, neuromuscular transmission monitoring is the key to adequate NMB management.
