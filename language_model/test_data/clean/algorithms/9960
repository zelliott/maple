We propose a multi-viewer tracking integral imaging system for viewing angle and viewing zone improvement. In the tracking integral imaging system, the pickup angles in each elemental lens in the lens array are decided by the positions of viewers, which means the elemental image can be made for each viewer to provide wider viewing angle and larger viewing zone. Our tracking integral imaging system is implemented with an infrared camera and infrared light emitting diodes which can track the viewers' exact positions robustly. For multiple viewers to watch integrated three-dimensional images in the tracking integral imaging system, it is needed to formulate the relationship between the multiple viewers' positions and the elemental images. We analyzed the relationship and the conditions for the multiple viewers, and verified them by the implementation of two-viewer tracking integral imaging system.
