The use of echocardiography in intensive care units in shock patients allows us to measure various hemodynamic variables in an accurate and a non-invasive manner. By using echocardiography not only as a diagnostic technique but also as a tool for continuous hemodynamic monitorization, the intensivist can evaluate various aspects of shock states, such as cardiac output and fluid responsiveness, myocardial contractility, intracavitary pressures, heart-lung interaction and biventricular interdependence. However, to date there has been little guidance orienting echocardiographic hemodynamic parameters in the intensive care unit, and intensivists are usually not familiar with this tool. In this review, we describe some of the most important hemodynamic parameters that can be obtained at the patient bedside with transthoracic echocardiography in critically ill patients.
