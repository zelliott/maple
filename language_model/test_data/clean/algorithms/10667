Visual comparison of a reference image with a verification image is commonly used for setup verification in external beam radiation therapy. However, it sometimes lacks reproducibility and provides insufficient quantitative evidence. The present study was performed to develop computerized methods for determining landmarks to verify a portal image with digital reconstruction radiograph (DRR), and to investigate the clinical effectiveness of our method. Our computer algorithm consisted of three main procedures--preprocessing, determination of landmarks, and verification--none of which required manual operation. Finally, our system indicated the distance for setup correction. We evaluated the accuracy of our system using pelvic phantom images, and the maximum magnitude of error was shown to be 1.12 (n=9). The results indicated that the error range of our system was sufficiently small to examine patient positioning error, which should be less than 5 mm, as described in AAPM report TG40. Our system will aid operators in positioning patients accurately for external radiation therapy.
