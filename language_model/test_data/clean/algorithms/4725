The aim of this study was to test a previously described training tool for ultrasound for use as a first-line imaging modality. Navigated sonography was performed in 10 patients with midfacial fractures diagnosed using computed tomography (CT). One examiner ranked his sonographic findings regarding the presence of a fracture on six predefined anatomic landmarks on a scale from 1 to 5. These results were correlated with CT findings by displaying fused images. In all but three patients fractures were correctly identified using sonography. In the remaining three patients the examiner was unable to determine whether a fracture was present or not. Normally, these patients would have been subjected to conventional radiographs. Ultrasound proved to be a reliable first-line imaging modality for the investigation of suspected midfacial fractures in daily clinical practice, resulting in decreased radiation exposure since conventional radiographs are omitted. According to this algorithm, patients with sonographically confirmed midfacial fractures are examined for surgical planning using cone-beam CT.
