To evaluate acute change of right and left ventricle after percutaneous closure of isolated atrial septal defect (ASD) 21 adult patients (13 F; 8 M) aged 28 ± 9.5 range 18-49 years have been examined by echocardiography before and 24 hours after percutaneous closure of ASD. Twenty-one normal adult subjects, as control group were included. A MyLab25 echo machine equipped with a multifrequency 2.5-3.5 MHz transducer was used. Offline computer-based analysis for strain and SR were performed using XStrain software based on a feature tracking algorithm. All patients had ASD OS2 with right ventricular dilatation and diastolic areas were larger than in controls: P = 0.0158. Global right ventricular longitudinal strain was higher P = 0.0438. Twenty-four hours after ASD closure, right ventricular diastolic and systolic areas were significantly reduced. Right ventricular global longitudinal systolic strain decreased: P = 0.00016, as well as global right ventricular longitudinal SR -1.56/sec ± 0.57 vs. -1.28/sec ± 0.31, P = 0.02646. At the mean time left ventricular end diastolic volume and left ventricular cardiac output measured by two-dimensional echocardiography both increased significantly P = 0.002145 and 0.013409. Global circumferential strain at mitral level augmented significantly -20.3%± 4.64 vs. -25.39%± 5.22, P = 0.00003. Longitudinal strain of the right ventricle works as indicator of right ventricular function dependent on loading conditions while SR seems to be less dependent on it. Circumferential strain could be used as an indicator of left ventricular response to normalized loading conditions.
