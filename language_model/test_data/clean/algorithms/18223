Accurate diffusion measurements with pulsed gradient NMR are hampered by cross-terms of the diffusion-weighting and background gradients. For experiments based on a stimulated echo pulse sequence, that is preferred for samples with a T2 short compared to the diffusion time, a diffusion-weighting scheme has been presented that avoids these cross-terms in each of the en- and decoding periods separately. However, this approach suffers from a reduced diffusion-weighting efficiency because the two gradients applied in each of the periods have effectively opposite polarities leading to a partial cancellation. An extension of this scheme is presented that involves an additional gradient pulse in each period and delivers an improved diffusion-weighting efficiency without sacrificing the cross-term compensation. Analytical expressions for the gradient pulse lengths and amplitudes are given for arbitrary timing parameters. MR measurements with artificial (switched) background gradients were performed to test the cross-term compensation capability of the proposed extension. The results show that considerably higher q and b values can be achieved with the extension without changing the timing parameters. The MR measurements yielded identical diffusion coefficients without, with the same, and with different background gradients in the en- and decoding periods demonstrating the cross-term compensation of the presented approach.
