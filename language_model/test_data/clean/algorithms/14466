PhospoPep version 2.0 is a project to support systems biology signaling research by providing interactive interrogation of MS-derived phosphorylation data from four different organisms. Currently the database hosts phosphorylation data from the fly (Drosophila melanogaster), human (Homo sapiens), worm (Caenorhabditis elegans), and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The following will give an overview of the content and usage of the PhosphoPep database.
