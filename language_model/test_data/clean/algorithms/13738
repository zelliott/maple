A presentation is made of abdominal vasculitis in the course of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). The disease is not yet completely known and therefore it is often incorrectly diagnosed as acute abdomen requiring surgery. An accurate diagnosis of this disease is essential for the choice of the correct therapeutic attitude. Some theoretical aspects of the disease are discussed and the personal experience of the authors resulting from the study of some cases hospitalized in the Institute of Internal Medicine, are discussed.
