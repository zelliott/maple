Quantification of cerebral arterial blood volume (CBVa) is important for understanding vascular regulation. To enable measurement of CBVa with diffusion-weighted (DW) arterial spin labeling (ASL), a theoretical framework was developed using the effects of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM). The pseudo-diffusion coefficient (D*) in the IVIM model was evaluated at 9.4 T in DW-ASL of rat brain under isoflurane anesthesia by variations of both post-labeling delay (w) and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR). D* and its volume fraction decreased at values of w>or=0.3 s, and the normalized apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) increased with MTR, suggesting that D* is closely correlated with CBVa. Thus, the difference between ASL measurements with and without DW gradients is related to CBVa. The CBVa values measured by this approach were compared with values obtained using the modulation of tissue and vessel (MOTIVE) technique with ASL, which varies MT levels without changing spin labeling efficiency. CBVa values from both methods were highly correlated. The measured CBVa values were linearly correlated with cerebral blood flow (CBF) for a PaCO2 range of 25-50 mmHg; DeltaCBVa (ml/100 g)=0.007 (min-1)xDeltaCBF (ml/100 g/min). The DW-ASL approach is simple and easy to implement for human and animal CBVa studies.
