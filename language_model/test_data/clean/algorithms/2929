Aggressive screening for blunt cerebrovascular injuries in patients with trauma has led to the identification and successful treatment of these injuries. We report the case of an 8-year-old boy who sustained a vertebral artery injury after a motor vehicle collision. Computed tomography angiogram showed an 8-mm thrombosed segment of the vertebral artery. The patient was initially anticoagulated with a heparin drip and transitioned over to treatment with enoxaparin sodium (Lovenox). With few reports in the literature of blunt cerebrovascular injuries in the pediatric population, a review of the appropriate screening parameters, treatment plans, and follow-up is helpful for the practicing physician.
