The aim of this work was to show current opinions on performing acute laparoscopic exploration in penetrating injuries of the abdomen and to assess the authors' own experience in performing the above operation in conditions of the regional hospital.

The authors present 17 patients treated between the years 1997-2002 for penetrating injuries of the abdomen or suspected for a penetrating injury. Acute laparotomy was performed in 11 cases, acute laparoscopy in 6 patients. The authors specify certain indications which lead to the acute laparoscopy, the method performed and its diagnostic value.

In the group observed, an intraabdominal injury was diagnosed in 41% of the patients, in 59% of cases findings were negative. When the intraabdominal injuries were assessed, the group of the acute laparotomies had 54% of negative findings, the group of the acute laparoscopies had 66.6% of negative findings. Laparoscopy decreased the total number of all negative laparotomies from 59% down to 35%. Diagnostic laparotomy fits to complement a spectrum of examination methods. Especially in equivocal cases, when a penetrating injury is suspected, it decreases the number of so called "necessary" non-therapeutic laparotomies to a minimum. It is most efficient, compared to other diagnostic methods, in verifying injuries of the peritoneum and diaphragm. However, acute laparoscopy should be always performed by an experienced surgeon. A therapeutic potential of the acute laparoscopy depend on proficiency of the operating surgeon and on the technical potential of each hospital. However, they, mostly, still remain restricted to caring for minor, isolated intraabdominal injuries.
