Lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) are known reproductive toxicants, which accumulate in granulosa cells of the ovary. Female Charles foster rats were treated with sodium acetate (control), lead acetate and cadmium acetate either alone or in combination at a dose 0.05 mg/kg body weight intra-peritoneally for 15 days daily. Animals were killed at proestrous stage and granulosa cells were isolated from the ovaries. Binding of (125)I-luteinizing hormone ((125)I-LH), (125)I-follicle stimulating hormone ((125)I-FSH) and 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity were measured. As these receptors are localized on the surface of the cell membrane, we also estimated the membrane parameters of these cells. Our results demonstrated that both lead and cadmium caused a significant reduction in gonadotropin binding, which altered steroidogenic enzyme activity of granulosa cells. These changes exhibited a positive correlation with membrane changes of the granulosa cells.
