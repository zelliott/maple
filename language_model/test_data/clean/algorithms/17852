A new relativistic four-component density functional approach for calculations of NMR shielding tensors has been developed and implemented. It is founded on the matrix formulation of the Dirac-Kohn-Sham (DKS) method. Initially, unperturbed equations are solved with the use of a restricted kinetically balanced basis set for the small component. The second-order coupled perturbed DKS method is then based on the use of restricted magnetically balanced basis sets for the small component. Benchmark relativistic calculations have been carried out for the (1)H and heavy-atom nuclear shielding tensors of the HX series (X=F,Cl,Br,I), where spin-orbit effects are known to be very pronounced. The restricted magnetically balanced basis set allows us to avoid additional approximations and/or strong basis set dependence which arises in some related approaches. The method provides an attractive alternative to existing approximate two-component methods with transformed Hamiltonians for relativistic calculations of chemical shifts and spin-spin coupling constants of heavy-atom systems. In particular, no picture-change effects arise in property calculations.
