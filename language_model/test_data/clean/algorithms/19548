Sibships are commonly used in genetic dissection of complex diseases, particularly for late-onset diseases. Haplotype-based association studies have been advocated as powerful tools for fine mapping and positional cloning of complex disease genes. Existing methods for haplotype inference using data from relatives were originally developed for pedigree data. In this study, we proposed a new statistical method for haplotype inference for multiple tightly linked single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which is tailored for extensively accumulated sibship data. This new method was implemented via an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm without the usual assumption of linkage equilibrium among markers. Our EM algorithm does not incur extra computational burden for haplotype inference using sibship data when compared with using unrelated parental data. Furthermore, its computational efficiency is not affected by increasing sibship size. We examined the robustness and statistical performance of our new method in simulated data created from an empirical haplotype data set of human growth hormone gene 1. The utility of our method was illustrated with an application to the analyses of haplotypes of three candidate genes for osteoporosis.
