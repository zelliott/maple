The interaction of a series of 1,2,5-thiadiazolidin-3-one 1,1 dioxide-based sulfonamides with neutrophil-derived serine proteases was investigated. The nature of the amino acid component, believed to be oriented toward the S' subsites, had a profound effect on enzyme selectivity. This series of compounds were found to be potent, time-dependent inhibitors of human neutrophil elastase (HNE) and were devoid of any inhibitory activity toward neutrophil proteinase 3 (PR 3) and cathepsin G (Cat G). The results of these studies demonstrate that exploitation of differences in the S' subsites of HNE and PR 3 can lead to highly selective inhibitors of HNE.
