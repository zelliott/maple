Hypertensive emergencies must be distinguished from severe blood pressure elevations without acute target organ damage. Clinical examination (chest pain, dyspnoea, neurological disorders, ECG, retinal examination) and laboratory tests (blood and urine tests, cerebral imaging in case of neurological disorders) have to be immediately performed. Immediate referral to an intensive care unit is indicated, and an intravenous antihypertensive therapy has to be implemented. Blood pressure objectives depend on the associated acute pathology (myocardial infarction, pulmonary oedema, aortic dissection, severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia of pregnancy, hypertensive encephalopathy, retinopathy, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke treated or not with thrombolysis).
