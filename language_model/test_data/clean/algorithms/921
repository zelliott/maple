Twenty-eight cases of diaphragmatic rupture due to blunt trauma are reviewed. The need for accurate and rapid diagnosis and results of treatment are discussed. Chest roentgenogram was found to be the best diagnostic aid. Surgical repair through an abdominal approach is advised in all acute cases. The high mortality rate in this series (28.6%) is related to the multiple injuries rather than to the diaphragmatic lesion itself.
