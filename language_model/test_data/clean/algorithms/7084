Ten patients aged 16-63 years (mean 36.3) had the Siemens P56T "Tachylog II" pacemaker implanted for treatment of drug refractory supraventricular tachycardia. The pacemaker incorporates a noninvasive electrophysiological study (EPS) facility and a sophisticated Holter function combined with a unique "learning" self-search antitachycardia algorithm. The Holter reveals that new tachycardias arise that are not previously detected at conventional EPS. The number of stimuli in the initiation sequences during noninvasive EPS proved highly variable, however, termination sequences remained constant in the long term. There was variability of timing of stimuli in the long term that was significantly greater for "new" tachycardias than for "original" arrhythmias. Long-term follow-up (at 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year) have shown that 90% of patients have good tachycardia control without the need for drugs. All patients confirm the acceptability of this pacemaker for control of their arrhythmias in the long term.
