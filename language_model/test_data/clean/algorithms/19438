An electromagnetic (EM) heating system is developed to achieve the rapid and uniform warming of cryopreserved biomaterials. Using the heating system, a rectangular resonant cavity is excited in TE101 mode at frequencies near 434 MHz. In experiments, a spherical phantom of biomaterial with a diameter of 36 mm is placed at the center of the cavity. The phantom is first cooled down to about -80 degrees C within the cavity and then thawed by EM absorption. Results show that EM warming can produce much higher warming rate than conventional water-bath warming method. The spatial temperature distribution in the phantom during EM warming is also more uniform than that during the water-bath warming.
