Our goal is to assess the potential of computational methods as an alternative to analytical models to predict the two longitudinal wave modes observed in cancellous bone and predicted by the Biot theory. A three-dimensional (3D) finite-difference time-domain method is coupled with 34 human femoral trabecular microstructures measured using microcomputed tomography. The main trabecular alignment (MTA) and the degree of anisotropy (DA) were assessed for all samples. DA values were comprised between 1.02 and 1.9. The influence of bone volume fraction (BV/TV) between 5% and 25% on the properties of the fast and slow waves was studied using a dedicated image processing algorithm to modify the initial 3D microstructures. A heuristic method was devised to determine when both wave modes are time separated. The simulations (performed in three perpendicular directions) predicted that both waves generally overlap in time for a direction of propagation perpendicular to the MTA. When these directions are parallel, both waves are separated in time for samples with high DA and BV/TV values. A relationship was found between the least bone volume fraction required for the observation of nonoverlapping waves and the degree of anisotropy: The higher the DA, the lower the least BV/TV.
