An analytical formula is suggested to predict the accurate Q-branch spectral lines of rovibrational transitions for diatomic systems by taking multiple spectral differences, and is applied to study the high-lying Q-branch emission spectra of the (0, 0) band of the ⁴Γ₅/₂-⁴Φ₃/₂ and ⁴Γ₇/₂ -⁴Φ₅/₂ systems of TiF molecule using fifteen known accurate experimental transition data. The results show that not only the known experimental transition lines are accurately reproduced, but also the correct values of the unknown spectral lines are predicted.
