In this chapter we illustrate the methodology for high-throughput metabolic flux analysis. Central to this is developing an end to end data pipeline, crucial for integrating the wet lab experiments and analytics, combining hardware and software automation, and standardizing data representation providing importers and exporters to support third party tools. The use of existing software at the start, data extraction from the chromatogram, and the end, MFA analysis, allows for the most flexibility in this workflow. Developing iMS2Flux provided a standard, extensible, platform independent tool to act as the "glue" between these end points. Most importantly this tool can be easily adapted to support different data formats, data verification and data correction steps allowing it to be central to managing the data necessary for high-throughput MFA. An additional tool was needed to automate the MFA software and in particular to take advantage of the course grained parallel nature of high-throughput analysis and available high performance computing facilities.In combination these methods show the development of high-throughput pipelines that allow metabolic flux analysis to join as a full member of the omics family.
