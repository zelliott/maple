The purpose of preoperative assessment is to evaluate the patient's health status, to address known or unidentified co-morbidities and to perform adequate complementary exams if necessary. On the other hand, it allows to prepare and protect the patient in order to reduce perioperative risk. The assessment consists of patient's history and physical examination, both focusing on cardiovascular and respiratory assessment. Complementary exams have to be chosen selectively depending on the patient's risk factors and the type of surgery. They are indicated if their result leads to a potential patient's benefit only, either by a modification in anesthetic and/or surgical management or by introduction of a pharmacological strategy, adequate and maximal if necessary, especially for cardioprotection.
