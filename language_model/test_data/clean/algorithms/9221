The expressions that describe the sound field focused by an acoustic lens with different sound speed distribution (SSD) in lens are given. Numerical calculation results are presented, in which the axial and lateral sound pressure distributions and the -3 dB sound beam profile along the focused field are given out for three types of the acoustic focused lens with revolving-arc curved outer surface and four types' axisymmetric SSD. It is shown that, when sound beam is focused by a lens with SSD, the best focal point moves away from the lens and achieves a large focal region compared with the no-SSD case. The maximum axial focused intensity at the best focal point is smaller than that of the no-SSD case, but the focused beam width at the best focal point is larger than that of the no-SSD case. The larger the coefficient of the SSD, the larger the focused beam width and the larger focal region, but the divergent angle is almost the same.
