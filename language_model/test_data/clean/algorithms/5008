The study goals were development of reference intervals and an interpretive algorithm for pancreatic cyst fluid tumor markers.

442 pancreatic cyst fluids were tested for CEA, CA19-9, and amylase.

CEA>30 ng/mL discriminates mucinous from non-mucinous cysts. After CEA analysis, amylase and CA19-9 segregate non-mucinous and mucinous subtypes, respectively.

Pancreatic cyst fluid tumor markers supplement other diagnostic measures. This study provides estimated reference intervals and an algorithm for interpretation.
