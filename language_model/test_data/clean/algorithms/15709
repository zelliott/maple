A new, fast screening algorithm based on auditory brainstem response (ABR) recorded at a high click repetition rate is proposed. Response detection is carried out in the frequency domain by a statistical test procedure which includes the fundamental frequency and the harmonics below 800 Hz. First, the method was tested in 25 young adults. ABRs were recorded in the repetition rate range 20/s to 400/s. With a mean response detection time of 31 s, a click repetition rate of 140/s was found to be the optimum rate among the adult group. The method was then tested using a group of 114 neonates in whom the repetition rate range 60/s to 200/s was examined. At the repetition rate 90/s, which was found to be the optimum rate in neonates, the mean detection time was 24.6 s. In addition to the fast ABR detection, the proposed screening algorithm also allows simultaneous hearing screening of both ears using a one-channel data recording.
