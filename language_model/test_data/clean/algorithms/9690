A decrease of elasticity of walls of aorta and large arteries in the process of human natural aging leads to a significant increment of pulse arterial pressure (AP) due to a reflected wave and accordingly to a rise of the load on myocardium and arterial walls. Therefore, an enhancement of the arterial wall stiffness is considered as a possible mechanism and at the same time as a prognostic factor of risk of development of diseases of the cardiovascular system (CVS). For detection and quantitative estimation of this factor, we applied method of arterial piesopulsometry, which allowed revealing characteristic age peculiarities of dynamic structure of AP pulse waves that were used at development of the way and algorithm of express-diagnostics of functional state of the human CVS. The perspective use of this method for detection of signs of the age-related CVS readjustment as a factor of the organism aging is discussed.
