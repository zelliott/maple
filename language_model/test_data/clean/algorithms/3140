A rapid selective and accurate quantitative (1)H NMR method was developed for the simultaneous analysis of obidoxime chloride and atropine sulfate, the active components in parenteral injection devices (PID) used for the emergency treatment of poisoning by toxic organophosphates. The spectra were acquired in 90% H(2)O-10% D(2)O using sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)-1-propane sulfonate hydrate as the internal standard. Both synthetic mixtures and dosage forms were assayed. The results were compared with those obtained from a reported HPLC method.
