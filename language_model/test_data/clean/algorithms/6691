The metabolic pathway shift between only ethanol consumption to both sugar/ethanol consumption was measured by on-line analysis of respiratory quotient of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The experiments were carried out in a fed-batch culture under aerobic conditions. During the transition phase, respiratory quotient (RQ) profile shows that sugar can be metabolized through the fermentative pathway even to values of RQ lower than 1.
