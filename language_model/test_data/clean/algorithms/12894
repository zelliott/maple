A design for a single-plane multiple speckle pattern phase retrieval technique using a deformable mirror (DM) is analyzed within the formalism of complex ABCD-matrices, facilitating its use in conjunction with dynamic wavefronts. The variable focal length DM positioned at a Fourier plane of a lens comprises the adaptive optical (AO) system that replaces the time-consuming axial displacements in the conventional free-space multiple plane setup. Compared with a spatial light modulator, a DM has a smooth continuous surface which avoids pixelation, pixel cross-talk and non-planarity issues. The calculated distances for the proposed AO-system are evaluated experimentally using the conventional free-space phase retrieval setup. Two distance ranges are investigated depending on whether the measurement planes satisfy the Nyquist detector sampling condition or not. It is shown numerically and experimentally that speckle patterns measured at the non-Nyquist range still yield good reconstructions. A DM with a surface height of 25 microns and an aperture diameter of 5.2 mm may be used to reconstruct spherical phase patterns with 50-micron fringe spacing.
