Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides anatomical information about the brain in healthy as well as in diseased conditions. On the other hand, functional MRI (fMRI) provides information on the brain activity during performance of a specific task. Analysis of fMRI data requires the registration of the data to a reference brain template in order to identify the activated brain regions. Brain templates also find application in other neuroimaging modalities, such as diffusion tensor imaging and multi-voxel spectroscopy. Further, there are certain differences (e.g., brain shape and size) in the brains of populations of different origin and during diseased conditions like in Alzheimer's disease (AD), population and disease-specific brain templates may be considered crucial for accurate registration and subsequent analysis of fMRI as well as other neuroimaging data. This manuscript provides a comprehensive review of the history, construction and application of brain atlases. A chronological outline of the development of brain template design, starting from the Talairach and Tournoux atlas to the Chinese brain template (to date), along with their respective detailed construction protocols provides the backdrop to this manuscript. The manuscript also provides the automated workflow-based protocol for designing a population-specific brain atlas from structural MRI data using LONI Pipeline graphical workflow environment. We conclude by discussing the scope of brain templates as a research tool and their application in various neuroimaging modalities.
