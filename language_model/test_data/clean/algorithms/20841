Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) is now widely performed. One of the most common complications of this procedure is seroma. Most seromas usually form anterior to the mesh and resolve with conservative management. In rare cases, some patients develop a pseudoneoperitoneum deep to the mesh which actively secretes fluid, forming a collection. We present a group of seven patients with persistent seroma posterior to the mesh and a possible treatment algorithm.
