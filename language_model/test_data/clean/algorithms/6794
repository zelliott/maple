The suitability of polyethylene sheets as passive samplers of lipophilic contaminants in water bodies was tested. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) sheets were contaminated with PAH. Uncontaminated and pre-contaminated sheets were deployed simultaneously and collected at intervals over 32 days. The exposed sheets and water samples were analyzed for PAH. The initial PAH concentrations in the contaminated and uncontaminated sheets differed by two to three orders of magnitude, but approached a common equilibrium concentration during exposure. The two- to four-ring PAH achieved quasi-equilibrium within the 32-day exposure period, whereas the five- and six-ring PAH did not. The estimated PE/water partition coefficients were approximately three times higher for HDPE than for LDPE, and they were similar in magnitude to the K(ow) values (the partition coefficients between n-octanol and water). The uptake rate constants were approximately four times higher for HDPE than LDPE, which was attributed to the four times higher specific surface area. The uptake and elimination in HDPE followed linear first-order kinetics, whereas for LDPE very slow elimination rates were observed that could not be explained. The results show that PE is a simple, effective, and inexpensive material for sampling trace organic contaminants in water.
