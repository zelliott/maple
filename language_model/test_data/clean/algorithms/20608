The analysis and visualization of large data sets collected by use of laser Doppler velocimetry has presented a challenge to researchers using this technique to investigate complex flow fields. This paper describes an automated procedure for analysis and animation of two- and three-dimensional laser Doppler velocimetry data. The procedure consists of a suite of FORTRAN programs for calculating phase window averages of velocity and the Reynolds stress tensor, calculating the principal normal stresses, maximum shear stresses, and preparation of data files for input into Plot-3D compatible data visualization software. An example application of these techniques to data collected from an in vitro investigation of the retrograde flow field associated with a bileaflet mechanical heart valve is also presented.
