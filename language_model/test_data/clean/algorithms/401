Measurements of Rayleigh light scattering and Cotton-Mouton (CM) effect are carried out at room temperature for 100 mM NaCl solutions of apoferritin/ferritin loaded with 0, 90, 100, 500, 700, and 1500 Fe atoms/molecule. Because of the spherical shape, ferritin macromolecule should not manifest magnetic anisotropy; however, in solution it shows the induced magnetic birefringence (CM effect) and changes in intensity of the scattered light components. The newly obtained data support the previously reported conclusions indicating that the deformation of linear optical polarizability induced in the ferritin by a magnetic field and the orientation of the induced magnetic dipole moment by this field are the main sources of the magneto-optical phenomena observed. Nevertheless, it is also found that the orientation of the permanent magnetic dipole moment contributes to both effects. The magnetic field induced changes in the light scattering and the CM effect theoretically depend on the linear magneto-optical polarizability, chi, on the nonlinear magneto-optical polarizability, eta, and square of the permanent magnetic dipole moment value of the macromolecule, mu(2). On the basis of the theory describing both effects as well as the experimental data, the values of the anisotropy of linear magneto-optical polarizabilities components, the values of the linear optical polarizability and its anisotropy, nonlinear magneto-optical polarizability and its anisotropy, are estimated. Also the magnetic dipole moment of the ferritin macromolecule is found. Interestingly, not all iron atoms in the ferritin are indicated to be in the superparamagnetic state, some of them occur in the diamagnetic form.
