A substantial component of nursing is concerned with solving problems, or helping patients and clients to solve problems for themselves. This article considers problem solving in a range of nursing practice settings and outlines how psychology can help to explain and inform this process. The diverse nature of problems which nurses might encounter in their work are discussed and recommendations for the application of problem-solving strategies are offered. No single approach to problem solving is sufficiently flexible to address the complex challenges met in nursing practice, and hence an eclectic approach to problem solving is proposed.
