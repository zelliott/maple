The problem of discriminating between a number of similar, nonspecific odors is discussed with special reference to the phenomenon of kin and nestmate discrimination in social insects. Guided by the basic physiological and anatomical features of the olfactory sensory receptors and neural pathways in insects, a model is presented for the process of odor discrimination. The model hypothesizes neural processing capabilities that include the logarithmic transformations of electrical potentials to generate a scalar quantity representing the "similarity" of two multivalued signals. The model thereby quantifies the notion of phenotype matching that appears in the kin recognition literature, and makes the concept of a recognition template more precise. The hypotheses underlying the model suggest a number of neurophysiological studies that should be undertaken, while the model itself provides a basis for integrating several areas of research pertaining to kin recognition in particular species of animals.
