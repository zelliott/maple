When fuzzy production rules are used to approximate reasoning, interaction exists among rules that have the same consequent. Due to this interaction, the weighted average model frequently used in approximate reasoning does not work well in many real-world problems. In order to model and handle this interaction, this paper proposes to use a nonadditive nonnegative set function to replace the weights assigned to rules having the same consequent, and to draw the reasoning conclusion based on an integral with respect to the nonadditive nonnegative set function, rather than on the weighted average model. Handling interaction in fuzzy production rule reasoning in this way can lead to a good understanding of the rules base and an improvement of reasoning accuracy. This paper also investigates how to determine from data the nonadditive set function that cannot be specified by a domain expert.
