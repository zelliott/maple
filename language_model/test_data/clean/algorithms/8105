A balanced probe circuit is used to generate high B(1) magnetic field for sensitivity enhancement of multiple-quantum magic-angle spinning (MQMAS) experiment applied to low-gamma quadrupolar nuclei. Electrical balancing of the sample coil can cut the peak voltage by a half, therefore improving the power handling when generating a two-fold higher B(1) field. Experimental results, illustrated here with (25)Mg data for two layered double hydroxides, show that the MQMAS efficiency increases more than linearly with the B(1) field strength. The multiplicative enhancements from high B(0) and B(1) fields and an optimized MQMAS pulse sequence provide the critically needed sensitivity for acquiring MQMAS spectra of low-gamma quadrupolar nuclei such as (25)Mg at natural abundance.
