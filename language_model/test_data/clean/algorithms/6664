A semianalytical theory of the stability of odd-harmonic square oscillation modes of a nonlinear delayed-feedback system operating in the period-2 regime is proposed. Stability is found to be ruled by how the system approaches or leaves plateaus. An organization of the stability domains in interrupted bands of values of the delay is revealed.
