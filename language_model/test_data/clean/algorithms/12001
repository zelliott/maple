A new model for pulse jet fabric filtration is proposed. In contrast to the earlier model of Ravin and Humphries, which was formulated on the steady state assumption, the present study is aimed at developing a predictive capability for both transient and steady state operations, taking into account the compression effect of filter cakes. The model's relative simplicity allows frequent updating of the model parameter values, thus improving the accuracy of predictions. As a result, the model is particularly useful in developing control algorithms and designing controllers of pulse jet fabric filtration systems.
