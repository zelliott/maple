Undesired fragmentation of electrospray generated ions in an rf multipole traps can be problematic in many applications. Of special interest here is ion dissociation in a 2-D quadrupole ion trap external to a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FTICR MS) used in proteomic studies. In this work, we identified the experimental parameters that determine the efficiency of ion fragmentation. We have found that under the pressure conditions used in this study there is a specific combination of the radial and axial potential well depths that determines the fragmentation threshold. This combination of rf and dc fields appears to be universal for ions of different mass-to-charge ratios, molecular weights, and charge states. Such universality allows the fragmentation efficiency of the trapped ions in the course of capillary liquid chromatography (LC) separation studied to be controlled and can increase the useful duty cycle and dynamic range of a FTICR mass spectrometer equipped with an external rf only 2-D quadrupole ion trap.
