A model has been developed based on random walk theory that allows the diffusion of light along a principal axis to differ from that in orthogonal directions. We present expressions that describe the time-resolved intensity measured across a slab and on the surface of a semi-infinite medium for a principal axis oriented parallel or perpendicular to the surface. The model of time-resolved transmittance is compared with experimental data acquired by use of a phantom consisting of wax fibers arranged within a solid cube of resin. It is shown that a single set of optical parameters is sufficient to model the experimental measurements acquired across all three orientations of the cube.
