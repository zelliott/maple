The aim of this work was to analyze genetic variability in 18 populations of Maytenus ilicifolia, and representatives of Maytenus aquifolia and Maytenus evonymoidis, collected in the states of Mato Grosso do Sul, Paran√°, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, using RAPD molecular markers. Considering total samples of the three species, 263 amplified fragments were identified, of which 72.2% showed to be polymorphous. The index of similarity (Jaccard coefficient) was on average 0.64 between M. ilicifolia and M. aquifolia; 0.47 between M. ilicifolia and M. evonymoidis; and 0.44 between M. aquifolia and M. evonymoidis. The analysis of groupings by the UPGMA algorithm allowed to clearly separate the three analyzed species. In determining the variability in M. ilicifolia, 222 bands were identified, on average 11.1 bands per primer, being 43.2% polymorphous. The index of similarity (Jaccard coefficient) in the bulks of each population in M. ilicifolia was, on average, 0.92 and the index of similarities among the populations was 0.83. The analysis of groupings with the UPGMA algorithm and the analysis of the main coordination (PCO), allowed the separation of the analyzed populations into three groups, the populations from the south of Rio Grande do Sul and the population from Mato Grosso do Sul standing out. A relation between the groupings found and the edaphoclimatic conditions of the collecting places was observed.
