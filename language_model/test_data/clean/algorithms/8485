For the compression of medical signals such as electrocardiogram (ECG), excellent reconstruction quality of a highly compressed signal can be obtained by using a wavelet-based approach. The most widely used objective quality criterion for the compressed ECG is called the percent of root-mean-square difference (PRD). In this paper, given a user-specified PRD, an algorithm is proposed to meet the PRD demand by searching for an appropriate bit rate in an automatic, smooth, and fast manner for the wavelet-based compression. The bit rate searching is modeled as a root-finding problem for a one-dimensional function, where an unknown rate-distortion curve represents the function and the desired rate is the root to be sought. A solution derived from root-finding methods in numerical analysis is proposed. The proposed solution is incorporated in a well-known wavelet-based coding strategy called set partitioning in hierarchical trees. ECG signals taken from the MIT/BIH database are tested, and excellent results in terms of convergence speed, quality variation, and coding performance are obtained.
