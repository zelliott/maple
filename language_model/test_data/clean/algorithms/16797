Parkinson disease (PD) is an age-related deterioration of certain nerve systems, which affects movement, balance, and muscle control of clients. PD is one of the common diseases which affect 1% of people older than 60Â years. A new classification scheme based on support vector machine (SVM) selected features to train rotation forest (RF) ensemble classifiers is presented for improving diagnosis of PD. The dataset contains records of voice measurements from 31 people, 23 with PD and each record in the dataset is defined with 22 features. The diagnosis model first makes use of a linear SVM to select ten most relevant features from 22. As a second step of the classification model, six different classifiers are trained with the subset of features. Subsequently, at the third step, the accuracies of classifiers are improved by the utilization of RF ensemble classification strategy. The results of the experiments are evaluated using three metrics; classification accuracy (ACC), Kappa Error (KE) and Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC). Performance measures of two base classifiers, i.e. KStar and IBk, demonstrated an apparent increase in PD diagnosis accuracy compared to similar studies in literature. After all, application of RF ensemble classification scheme improved PD diagnosis in 5 of 6 classifiers significantly. We, numerically, obtained about 97% accuracy in RF ensemble of IBk (a K-Nearest Neighbor variant) algorithm, which is a quite high performance for Parkinson disease diagnosis.
