The simulation of response of a new passive area dosemeter for measuring ambient dose equivalent H*(10) for photons has been performed using the Monte Carlo code MCNP and experimentally determined responses of LiF:Mg,Ti and LiF:Mg,Cu,P thermoluminescent (TL) detectors for hard-filtered X-ray spectra from 20 to 300 keV and for 137Cs and 60Co gamma radiation. Relative TL efficiency for both types of detectors, determined in experiments with bare detectors and similar Monte Carlo simulations, compared favourably with prediction of microdosimetric models for proposed microdosimetric target sizes in the range of 20-40 nm. The concluding verification experiment showed small deviations between measured and simulated dosemeter energy response values in the range of a few percent.
