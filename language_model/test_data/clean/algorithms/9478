MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in human health and disease as endogenous suppressors of the translation of coding genes. At this early point of time in miRNA biology, it is important to identify specific cognate mRNA targets for miRNA. Investigation of the significance of miRNAs in disease processes relies on algorithms that hypothetically link specific miRNAs to their putative target genes. The development of such algorithms represents a hot area of research in biomedical informatics. Lack of biological data linking specific miRNAs to their respective mRNA targets represents the most serious limitation at this time. This article presents a concise review addressing the most popular concepts underlying state-of-the-art algorithms and principles aimed at target mapping for specific miRNAs. Strategies for improvement of the current bioinformatics tools and effective approaches for biological validation are discussed.
