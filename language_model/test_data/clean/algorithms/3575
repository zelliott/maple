While mammography is a highly sensitive method for detecting breast tumours, its ability to differentiate between malignant and benign lesions is low, which may result in as many as 70% of unnecessary biopsies. The purpose of this study was to develop a highly specific computer-aided diagnosis algorithm to improve classification of mammographic masses. A classifier based on the likelihood ratio was developed to accommodate cases with missing data. Data for development included 671 biopsy cases (245 malignant), with biopsy-proved outcome. Sixteen features based on the BI-RADS lexicon and patient history had been recorded for the cases, with 1.3 +/- 1.1 missing feature values per case. Classifier evaluation methods included receiver operating characteristic and leave-one-out bootstrap sampling. The classifier achieved 32% specificity at 100% sensitivity on the 671 cases with 16 features that had missing values. Utilizing just the seven features present for all cases resulted in decreased performance at 100% sensitivity with average 19% specificity. No cases and no feature data were omitted during classifier development, showing that it is more beneficial to utilize cases with missing values than to discard incomplete cases that cannot be handled by many algorithms. Classification of mammographic masses was commendable at high sensitivity levels, indicating that benign cases could be potentially spared from biopsy.
