In this paper an attempt is made to review the types of processes developed by the author, and others, to classify and segment textures and to compare, where possible, such algorithms with what has been proposed to occur in human vision. In particular, this paper is concerned with evaluating the proposed constituent processes from a 'cognitive engineering' perspective where, in order to have an adequate model for either human or machine texture processing, complete segmentation or classification or both must be attained.
