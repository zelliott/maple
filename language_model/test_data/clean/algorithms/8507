A theoretical model for predicting intrinsic and induced DNA superstructures as well as their thermodynamic properties is presented. Intrinsic sequence-dependent superstructures are evaluated by integrating local deviations from the canonical B-DNA of the different dinucleotide steps. Induced superstructures are obtained by adopting the principle of minimum deformation free energy, evaluated in the Fourier space, in the framework of first-order elasticity. Finally dinucleotide stacking energies and melting temperatures are considered to account for local flexibility. In fact the two scales are strongly correlated. The model works very satisfactorily in predicting the sequence-dependent effects on the DNA experimental behavior, such as the gel electrophoresis retardation, the writhe transitions in topologically constrained domains, the thermodynamic constants of circularization reactions as well as the nucleosome thermodynamic stability constants.
