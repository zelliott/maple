Homeostasis, the creation of a stabilized internal milieu, is ubiquitous in biological evolution, despite the entropic cost of excluding noise information from a region. The advantages of stability seem self evident, but the alternatives are not so clear. This issue was studied by means of numerical experiments on a simple evolution model: a population of Boolean network "organisms" selected for performance of a curve-fitting task while subjected to noise. During evolution, noise sensitivity increased with fitness. Noise exclusion evolved spontaneously, but only if the noise was sufficiently unpredictable. Noise that was limited to one or a few stereotyped patterns caused symmetry breaking that prevented noise exclusion. Instead, the organisms incorporated the noise into their function at little cost in ultimate fitness and became totally noise dependent. This "noise imprinting" suggests caution when interpreting apparent adaptations seen in nature. If the noise was totally random from generation to generation, noise exclusion evolved reliably and irreversibly, but if the noise was correlated over several generations, maladaptive selection of noise-dependent traits could reverse noise exclusion, with catastrophic effect on population fitness. Noise entering the selection process rather than the organism had a different effect: adaptive evolution was totally abolished above a critical noise amplitude, in a manner resembling a thermodynamic phase transition. Evolutionary adaptation to noise involves the creation of a subsystem screened from noise information but increasingly vulnerable to its effects. Similar considerations may apply to information channeling in human cultural evolution.
