To assess the readiness of mental health facilities in Oregon to implement medication algorithms using the Medication Management Approaches in Psychiatry toolkit (MedMAP) developed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), researchers conducted interviews with 68 clinical and administrative employees of four inpatient and four outpatient mental health facilities in Oregon. Respondents had generally positive opinions about the algorithms, but they also expressed many concerns about logistics and implementation, chiefly related to medication selection and expected restrictions on choices for prescribing providers and patients. In implementing medication algorithms, it may be beneficial to assess staff perspectives as well as the capabilities of the program's infrastructure. The extent to which staff concerns, values, and needs are anticipated and promptly and responsively addressed is likely have a major influence on successful implementation.
