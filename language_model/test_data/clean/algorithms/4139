The Assessment for Living with Aphasia (ALA) is a pictographic, self-report measure of aphasia-related quality-of-life. Research was undertaken to assess test-re-test reliability, construct validity, and the ability to discriminate aphasia severity. The ALA was administered to 101 participants with aphasia on two occasions. Test-re-test reliability was evaluated using intra-class correlations and internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha. Three reference measures were administered to assess construct validity. A focus group reported on ease of administration and face validity. Analysis identified 15 out of 52 rated items for elimination. For the remaining items, test-re-test reliability was excellent for the total score (ICC = .86) and moderate-to-strong for a priori domains adapted from the WHO ICF (.68-.83). Internal consistency was acceptable-to-high. Significant correlations were observed between the ALA and reference tests (SAQOL-39, .72; p < .001; VASES, .62, p = .03; BOSS CAPD, -.69; p = .008). The language impairment domain discriminated between all aphasia severity groups, while mild aphasia was different from moderate and severe aphasia in participation and total scores. The ALA was reportedly easy to administer and captured key aspects of the experience of living with aphasia. Results suggest acceptable test-re-test reliability, internal consistency and construct validity of the ALA.
