A main objective of analyzing peptide array-based binding experiments is to uncover the relationship between a peptide sequence and the binding outcome. Limited by the peptide array technologies available for applications, few attempts have been made to construct qualitative or quantitative models that depict the peptide sequence:binding strength relationships in peptide microarray-based binding studies. There has been a long history of similar modeling efforts based on low-throughput binding data in the areas of T-cell epitope screening and kinase substrate mapping, however. The keen needs in peptide array applications and the success of the modeling efforts in related fields have prompted us to develop SVM-PEPARRAY, a Web-based program capable of constructing qualitative and quantitative models based on peptide microarray binding datasets using support vector machine (SVM) modeling methods. We expect that such modeling analysis will allow researchers to quickly extract sequence-based biological information from improved peptide array binding results and provide more precise and accurate information about the biological systems investigated.
