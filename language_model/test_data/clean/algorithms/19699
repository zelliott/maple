This article provides demonstrations and calculations, using rough-set theory and method, of the math-morphological features (MMFs), such as form parameter, lobation and sphericity, etc. drawn from 28 species of insects of the Hemiptera, Lepidoptera and Coleoptera based on their images. The results are compared with statistical analysis made by Zhao Hanqing, and also with the traditional classifications through the pattern recognition of neural network on the basis of the rough-set disposal. The result of the experiments showed that when used in categorical taxonomy, the importance of MMF was ranked from high to low: (roundness-likelihood. eccentricity) > (hot-hole number, sphericity, circularity) > (lobation, form parameter). The results of pattern recognition by neural network were completely identical with those of traditional classifications. Accordingly, the conclusion was that this theory applied in insect taxonomy was more idealistic compared with statistical analysis method, and it had great significance when used with rough-set neural network.
