Anatomic variations in the contours of the palmar and dorsal horns of 100 dry lunates were classified by symmetry, curvature, and angularity. Frequencies of the major forms were determined. An algorithm was constructed for the identification of the dorsal and palmar horns of the lunate on a frontal radiograph. By this algorithm, it is possible to diagnose intercalated segment instabilities without the use of a lateral radiograph.
