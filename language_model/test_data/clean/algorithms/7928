Computation lithography is enabled by a combination of physical understanding, mathematical abstraction, and implementation simplification. An application in the virtual world of computation lithography can be a virtual reality or a virtual virtuality depending on its engineering sensibleness and technical feasibility. Examples under consideration include design-for-manufacturability and inverse lithography.
