Dipolar waves are distinct hallmarks of both the secondary and tertiary structures of alpha-helical proteins that are immobilized in membrane bilayers or embedded in anisotropic media. We present a simple, semi-empirical approach that exploits the modulation of the amplitude and average of dipolar waves to determine the topology of alpha-helical proteins. Moreover, we describe the application of this method for the structural determination of a detergent solubilized membrane protein, phospholamban (PLB) that is involved in calcium regulation of cardiac muscle. When combined with high-resolution solid-state NMR data, this method can serve as a fast route for determining the topology of helical membrane proteins solubilized in detergent micelles.
