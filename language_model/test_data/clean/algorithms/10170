A prospective evaluation of fifty patients with faecal soiling but normal sphincter function treated by a conservative treatment algorithm.

Between January 2010 and January 2011, 50 consecutive patients of two different clinical centres, with faecal soiling and normal anorectal function as assessed by endoanal ultrasound, MRI and anal manometry, were eligible for the purpose of this study. All patients started the therapy by psyllium (PS) and a fibre-rich diet daily after 2 months followed by rectal irrigation (RI) in case of incomplete response and after 4 months by 4 g colestyramine (CO), respectively. The patients completed the Vaizey incontinence score and a 2-week diary card. All tests were performed repeated after 2, 4 and 8 months, respectively.

The study group consisted of 41 men and 9 women and a mean age of 38 years (21-70). The soiling complaints resolved completely in 37 (79%) patients. After treatment with PS, RI and CO, 12 (24%) patients, 24 (73%) patients and 1 (79%) patient, respectively, resolved completely of faecal soiling. Average weekly soiling frequency, the amount of patients wearing pads daily and the Vaizey incontinence score diminished significantly after treatment with psyllium and after treatment with rectal irrigation (P < 0.001).

Conservative treatment focussed on complete evacuation or clearing the anorectal canal is effective in the treatment of patients with faecal soiling.
