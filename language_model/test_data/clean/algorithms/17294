Slipping during various kinds of movement often leads to potentially dangerous incidents of falling. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there was evidence to support the theory that movement strategies could be used by individuals to regain stability during an episode of slipping and whether forced sliding from a moving platform accurately simulated the effect of slipping on stability and balance. A single-link-plus-foot biomechanical model was used to mathematically simulate base of support (BOS) translation and body segment rotation during movement termination in sagittal plane. An optimization routine was used to determine region of stability [defined at given COM locations as the feasible range of horizontal velocities of the center of mass (COM) of human subject that can be reduced to zero with respect to the BOS while still allowing the COM to traverse within the BOS limits]. We found some 30% overlap in the region of stability for slipping and non-slipping conditions. This finding supports the theory that movement strategies can be sought for restoring stability and balance even if slipping unexpectedly occurs. We also found that forced sliding produces effects on stability that are similar to those of slipping, indicated by over 50% overlap in the regions of stability for the two conditions. In addition, forced sliding has distinctive effects on stability, including a "shift" of the region of stability extended beyond the BOS in the direction of sliding. These findings may provide quantifiable guidance for balance training aimed at reducing fall incidents under uncertain floor surface conditions.
