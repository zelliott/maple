Experiments have shown that the lateral profile of a point target measured with a clinical ultrasound scanner is wider when the target is embedded in a urethane phantom than when it is in a traditional gel phantom. The behavior has been attributed to the low speed of sound in the urethane material, with the possibility that some of the broadening is caused by increased attenuation in this material. In this paper we apply a computer simulation model to study this behavior. Lateral beam profiles modeled for targets within a medium having a speed of sound and an attenuation matching that of urethane are compared with profiles for targets in a water-based gel. Simulations yield results that agree qualitatively with published experimental results. The lateral profile broadening in urethane is caused by the 6 % mismatch between speed of sound in this material and the speed of sound assumed in the receive focusing and beam forming. Attenuation plays a lesser role than the mismatch of the speed of sound.
