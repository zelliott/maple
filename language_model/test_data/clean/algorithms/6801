The relative energy response of NE2561 and NE261 IA ionization chambers to megavoltage photon beams from the ARPANSA linac indicates significant differences between these two types of chamber. In 16 MV beams of TPR20(10) 0.779, differences of about 2% are observed. The results are expressed as ratios KQ of the beam quality correction factors kQ, where the kQ factor for each type of chamber is the ratio of the absorbed dose to water calibration factor ND, at the x-ray quality Q to that at 60Co. These results have implications for the use of generic kQ factors in dosimetry protocols and suggest that NE2561 and NE2611A ionization chambers cannot be assumed to be identical.
