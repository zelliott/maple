In the context of the increasing worldwide occurrence of imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strains, we investigated a possible porin-mediated mechanism relating to the carbapenem resistance-associated outer membrane protein, CarO. The aim of this study was to determine whether this porin may be a diffusion pathway for carbapenems in A. baumannii.

By analysing and comparing the sequences of CarO with protein databanks, we identified two major groups of sequences that we named CarOa and CarOb. We overproduced in Escherichia coli, extracted, purified by affinity chromatography and refolded in Triton X-100 rCarO from both groups. Their functional properties were investigated and compared by reconstitution in planar lipid bilayers.

This functional study showed that rCarOa and rCarOb exhibit identical single-channel conductances (i.e. 20 pS in 1 M KCl) and similar poor cationic selectivity. Both channels were not specific towards meropenem and glutamic acid and poorly specific towards arginine, but they presented a marked specificity towards imipenem. From the calculated binding constants, we highlight that the CarOb channel was twice as specific as the CarOa channel for this antibiotic. Moreover, the CarOa channel could facilitate ornithine diffusion when the CarOb channel would not.

We provide here the first evidence that CarO channels possess an imipenem (but not meropenem) binding site, and that their specificities depend on their primary structure. Any decrease in CarO expression would thus reduce the susceptibility of A. baumannii to this antibiotic.
