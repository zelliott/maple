The modeling of signal transduction pathways is a task of systems biology. However, such a task is very difficult because of the structure complexity, the strong nonlinearity of signaling pathways and the noised and incomplete measurements. The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LM algorithm) is applied to estimate the unknown parameters of the signaling pathways. With this method, the identifiability of unknown parameters is appraised, and the sensitivity equations of original model are evaluated. Then we append the sensitivity equations to the original model in order to form the augmented model, and we apply the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to the augmented model in order to estimate parameters. TNFalpha mediated NF-kappaB signaling pathway is taken as an example to illustrate the effectiveness of this method, and the simulation results are given.
