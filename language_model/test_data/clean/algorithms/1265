In patients with right ventricular volume or pressure overload, the biplane Simpson's rule underestimates left ventricular volume more than the modified Simpson's rule. We suggest that the modified Simpson's rule should be used for estimation of left ventricular volumes rather than the biplane Simpson's rule in determining therapy for infants or children with complicated congenital heart disease.
