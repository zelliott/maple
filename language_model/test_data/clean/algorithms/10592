HIV-1 drug resistance methodologies are being increasingly utilized to guide treatment decisions; however, information comparing the various assays is limited. Duplicate plasma samples from 70 ART-experienced subjects were analyzed by both the Antivirogram and PhenoSense phenotypic assays and the results compared. HIV genotypes were also obtained and analyzed using seven different resistance algorithms. These results were also compared with the phenotypic assay results. Concordances between the phenotypic tests and between each algorithm, and between the two phenotypic assays were calculated and kappa coefficients (KC) determined. Overall agreement between the two phenotypic assays was good (86.9% concordance; KC 0.621). The highest concordance by drug class was seen for protease inhibitors (93.4%; KC 0.679) and the lowest (79.8%; KC 0.549) for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Concordance between the two phenotypic assays, when evaluating individual drugs, was good for all drugs tested except for abacavir, zalcitabine, and indinavir. Agreement between the seven algorithms and each phenotypic assay was variable, though most had good or excellent agreement. The highest overall level of agreement for an individual drug was observed when comparing lamivudine susceptibility to either assay. Concordance for abacavir, didanosine, zalcitabine, and saquinavir was generally problematic when comparing one or more phenotypic assays to the drug resistance predictive algorithms. In conclusion, results comparing these two phenotypic tests were mostly similar, but comparisons of the predictive resistance algorithms for specific drugs, as well as to specific phenotypic assays, were more inconsistent.
