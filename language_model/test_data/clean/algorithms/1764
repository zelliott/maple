In this paper, we investigate the fouling mechanisms responsible for MF and UF membrane flux decline in Anaerobic Membrane Bioreactors (AnMBR). We have used the fouling mechanism models proposed by Hermia (1982), namely pore constriction, cake formation, complete blocking and intermediate blocking. Based on an optimization approach and using experimental data extracted from the literature, we propose a systematic procedure for identifying the most likely fouling mechanism in play. Short-term as well as long-term experiments are considered and discussed. It was found that short-term experiments are usually characterized by two fouling phases during which the same fouling mechanism or two different mechanisms affect the process. In contrast, in long-term experiments involving cleaning cycles, membrane fouling appears to be better ascribed to one phase only. The impact of abiotic parameters on membrane fouling mechanisms is reviewed and discussed in the light of these results. Finally, it is shown that the mechanism most responsible for membrane fouling in an AnMBR is cake formation. This main result will be useful for the future development of simple integrated models for optimization and control.
