Ellipsometry gives access to the phenomenological parameters of a grating coupled slab waveguide structure and permits its functional modeling without a priori knowledge of the geometry of the structure. The evidence is shown by comparing with the exact electromagnetic modeling of a sliced cross-section of a singlemode grating waveguide biosensor chip cut by FIB and analyzed by SEM.
