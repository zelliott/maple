To investigate the role of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases V (GnT-V) in the development of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) both in vitro and in vivo, the GnT-V stably suppressed cell line CNE-2 GnT-V/2224 was constructed from CNE-2. The studies indicated that down-regulation of GnT-V inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of the NPC cell line CNE-2. The radio sensitivity of CNE-2 was enhanced after down-regulation of GnT-V, which may be associated with the decreased expression of bcl-2.
