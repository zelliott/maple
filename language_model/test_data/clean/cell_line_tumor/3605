CXCR4-stromal cell-derived factor-1 (CXCR4-SDF-1alpha) system has been proved to be involved in targeting metastasis of breast cancer. Some antagonists of CXCR4 have inhibitory effects on metastasis of breast cancer. This study was to investigate effect of viral macrophage inflammatory protein-II (vMIP-II), an antagonist of CXCR4, on metastasis of breast cancer cell line MCF-7.

Proliferation of MCF-7 cells stimulated by vMIP-II of different concentrations (10, 50, 100, 500, and 1 000 ng /ml) was detected by MTT assay, clone formation rate was assessed by agar clone assay. Adhesion and chemotaxis assays were also used to evaluate the effect of vMIP-II on MCF-7 cells in different steps of metastasis.

MCF-7 cells treated with vMIP-II of a series of concentrations for 72 h showed no proliferation change (P >0.05). vMIP-II (50-1 000 ng /ml) suppressed colony formation of MCF-7 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. After MCF-7 cells treated with 300 ng/ml of vMIP-II for different time (0, 0.5, 2, and 6 h), inhibition peak of cell adherence to fibronectin (FN) and Matrigel was observed. The number of migration was low in MCF-7 cells in the presence of vMIP-II of 500 ng/ml (24+/-10) was lower than that of control MCF-7 cells (60+/-9) (P< 0.05).

The clone formation rate of MCF-7 cells may negatively correlates with the concentration of vMIP-II. vMIP-II may inhibit MCF-7 cells adhesion to FN and Matrigel, and suppress chemotactic activity of MCF-7 cells toward extracts of human lung protein.
