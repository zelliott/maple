The growth and circulation of B lymphocytes is largely under the control of bone marrow stromal cells, cytokines and chemokines. The gene responsible for the pivotal B cell growth factor, stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1), has recently been shown to contain a single nucleotide polymorphism G > A at position 801 which leads to higher SDF-1 secretion. This polymorphism is common in the normal population and has been shown to play a potential role in the development of both HIV and non-HIV related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We therefore undertook a large single-centre study to ascertain its role in the pathogenesis of two other common B-cell malignancies, notably chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL- 197 patients) and multiple myeloma (126 patients). We show that the 801 G > A polymorphism plays no role in the incidence of multiple myeloma or CLL nor the outcome in multiple myeloma. By contrast, it trends towards an inferior cause-specific survival in CLL.
