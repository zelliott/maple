Several novel amine substituted N-(1H-benzimidazol-2ylmethyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-8-quinolinamines were synthesized which had potent activity against HIV-1. The synthetic approaches adopted allowed for variation of the substitution pattern and resulting changes in antiviral activity are highlighted. This led to the identification of compounds with low and sub-nanomolar anti-HIV-1 activity.
