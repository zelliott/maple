Tiny particles were found in the medium in the presence of the human leukemia cell line Kasumi-6. The particles were separated from human cells by filtration and incubated in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 C. The particles increased in number very slowly in the liquid medium but did not reveal any biological activity. Transmission electron microscopy of the particles showed a spheroid or ovoid shape in ultrathin section. No specific polypeptides from the purified particles were detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), except for bovine fetuin that adsorbed to the surface of the particles. X-ray diffractometry as well as Fourier transform infrared spectrometry suggested the particles consisted of hydroxyapatite. The mechanism of self-propagation of the hydroxyapatite particles in liquid medium is currently unknown. This type of particle has been overlooked for a long period because it is noncultivable. It will be necessary to examine its biological effects to the cultured cells.
