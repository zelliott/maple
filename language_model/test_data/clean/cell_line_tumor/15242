To investigate possible differences in the effects of soluble factors from oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells (UT-SCC-87) and normal oral keratinocytes (NOK) on fibroblast expression of genes involved in tumor stroma turnover.

Transwell co-cultures with fibroblasts in collagen gels, and SCC cells or NOK in inserts were carried out. Fibroblast gene expression was measured with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

The expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) was up-regulated in co-cultures with SCC cells but not with NOK. In contrast, both SCC cells and NOK regulated matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1) and -3, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP2) and -3 to a similar extent, while MMP2 and TIMP1 were largely unaffected. Interleukin 1 alpha (IL1Î±) up-regulated both MMP1 and MMP3 and down-regulated PAI-1, TIMP2 and -3.

SCC and NOK regulate fibroblast expression of genes involved in tumor stroma turnover differentially in vitro. These observations may contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms behind extracellular matrix turnover in tumors.
