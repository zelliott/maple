To investigate the effect of several traditional Chinese medicine formula therapies on proliferation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line HNE1.

The inhibition effect of medicine serums of Qi-Boosting Toxin-Resolving granule on proliferation of NPC cell line HNE1 in vitro was observed by MTT assay.

The rates of survival cells in Qi-Boosting Toxin-Resolving decoction group and Toxin-Resolving group were the lowest after 48 hours treatment, while Qi-Boosting group, yin-nourishing group, residual-component group medicine serums had the most obvious effects on the rates of survival cells at 72 hours. The inhibition ratio of 15% Qi-Boosting Toxin-Resolving granule medicine serums was 67.68%.

The result of MTT assay showed that cell proliferation was significantly inhibited by Qi-Boosting Toxin-Resolving granule and its separate composes medicine serums. Qi-Boosting Toxin-Resolving granule had the most significantly specific effects. The effects were correlated with serum concentration and treatment time of Qi-Boosting Toxin-Resolving granule and its separate composes medicine.
