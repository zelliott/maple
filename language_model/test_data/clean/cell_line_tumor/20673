Resveratrol (3,4',5 tri-hydroxystilbene), a natural plant polyphenol, has             gained interest as a non-toxic chemopreventive agent capable of inducing tumor             cell death in a variety of cancer types. Several studies were undertaken to obtain             synthetic analogues of resveratrol with potent anticancer activity. The aim of             the present study was to investigate the effect of HS-1793 as a new resveratrol             analog on apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway in murine breast cancer cells.             A pharmacological dose (1.3-20 µM) of HS-1793 exerted a cytotoxic effect on murine             breast cancer cells resulting in apoptosis. HS-1793-mediated cytotoxicity in FM3A             cells by several apoptotic events including mitochondrial cytochrome c release,             activation of caspase-3 and PARP occurred. In addition, HS-1793 induced collapse             of ∆Ψm and enhanced AIF and Endo G release from mitochondria while undergoing             apoptosis. These results demonstrate that the cytotoxicity by HS-1793 in FM3A             cells can mainly be attributed to apoptosis via a mitochondrial pathway by caspase             activation or contributions of AIF and Endo G.
