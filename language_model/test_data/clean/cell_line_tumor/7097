The action of 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is mediated by inhibition of thymidylate synthase (TS), which is regulated by cell cycle proteins controlled by protein phosphorylation. We studied the effects of staurosporine and its analogue UCN-01, inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC) on 5-FU cytotoxicity in Lovo colon cancer cells. Each drug contributes equally to the cell cycle effects of the 5-FU combinations. In sequential drug administration, the cell cycle distribution was determined by the first drug. Simultaneous 5-FU combinations induced additive effects in induction of apoptosis. When staurosporine was used as the second drug, induction of apoptosis was 2-fold higher than the sum of both drugs alone. Based on induction of apoptosis 5-FU addition prior to the PKC inhibitors seemed preferable.
