The aims of this study were to assess the cytotoxic capability of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells from umbilical cord blood (UCB), to compare them with those of peripheral blood (PB)-derived cells against anaplastic astrocytoma cell line (U87) and medulloblastoma cell line (TE671), and to identify which mechanism and genes were involved in cytotoxicity.

The effector cells were generated by interleukin-2 from UCB and PB. The antitumor property of effector cells against the target cells (U87, TE671) were estimated using a visual survival cell assay. The mixed target and effector (UCB) cells were analyzed for whether DNA fragmentation was present or not. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis was then performed to estimate the statement of the perforin and FasL genes in activated and inactivated cells from UCB.

The higher in vitro antitumor properties of the LAK cells from UCB were observed in comparison to the LAK cells from PB against the U87 and the TE671 (  p<0.05). Apoptosis may be one of the lysis mechanisms of target cells by the LAK cells from UCB. The contributing genes could be FasL and perforin.

This study suggests that UCB may be used as a source of LAK cells in adults and children suffering from anaplastic astrocytoma or medulloblastoma.
