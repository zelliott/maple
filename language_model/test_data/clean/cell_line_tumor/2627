Neoplastic transformation is the abnormal proliferation of cells. These transformations are often related to changes in cell surface glycoconjugates which can be detected by lectins. We evaluated the anti-tumor potential of BlL, a galactoside-binding lectin isolated from Bothrops leucurus venom as well as its cytotoxicity and hemolysis activity. The phosphatidylserine externalization and mitochondrial membrane potential were also determined. BlL exhibited cytotoxic activity against all tumor cell lines tested by induced phosphatidylserine externalization and mitochondrial depolarization, indicating cell death by apoptosis.
