The aim of the present study was to investigate the involvements of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and estrogen receptor α (ERα) in the inhibitory effect of wogonin on the breast adenocarcinoma growth. Moreover, the effect of wogonin on the angiogenesis of chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) was also investigated. MCF-7 cells (human breast adenocarcinoma cell line) were subjected to several drugs, including IGF-1, wogonin and ER inhibitor ICI182780, alone or in combination. MTT assay was used to detect breast cancer proliferation. Western blot was used to analyze ERα and p-Akt expression levels. CAM models prepared from 6-day chicken eggs were employed to evaluate angiogenesis inhibition. The results showed wogonin and ICI182780 both exhibited a potent ability to blunt IGF-1-stimulated MCF-7 cell growth. Either of wogonin and ICI182780 significantly inhibited ERα and p-Akt expressions in IGF-1-treated cells. The inhibitory effect of wogonin showed no difference from that of ICI182780 on IGF-1-stimulated expressions of ERα and p-Akt. Meanwhile, wogonin at different concentrations showed significant inhibitory effect on CAM angiogenesis. These results suggest the inhibitory effect of wogonin on breast adenocarcinoma growth via inhibiting IGF-1-mediated PI3K-Akt pathway and regulating ERα expression. Furthermore, wogonin has a strong anti-angiogenic effect on CAM model.
