DNA replication, repair, transcription and chromatin structure are intricately associated nuclear processes, but the molecular links between these events are often obscure. In this study, we have surveyed the protein complexes that bind at β-globin locus control region, and purified and characterized the function of one such multiprotein complex from human erythroleukemic K562 cells. We further validated the existence of this complex in human CD34+ cell-derived normal erythroid cells. This complex contains ILF2/ILF3 transcription factors, p300 acetyltransferase and proteins associated with DNA replication, transcription and repair. RNAi knockdown of ILF2, a DNA-binding component of this complex, abrogates the recruitment of the complex to its cognate DNA sequence and inhibits transcription, histone acetylation and usage of the origin of DNA replication at the β-globin locus. These results imply a direct link between mammalian DNA replication, transcription and histone acetylation mediated by a single multiprotein complex.
