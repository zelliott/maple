Here, we show that carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) is expressed in umbrella cells of bladder urothelium but is down-regulated in superficial bladder cancer, such as histologic tumor stage a (pTa) and transitional cell carcinoma in situ (pTis). Concurrently, CEACAM1 is up-regulated in the endothelia of adjacent angiogenic blood vessels. Mimicking the CEACAM1 down-regulation in the urothelium, CEACAM1 was silenced in bladder cancer cell lines 486p and RT4 using the small interfering RNA technique. CEACAM1 down-regulation was confirmed at the protein level by Western blot analyses. CEACAM1 silencing leads to a significant up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C and VEGF-D in quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Correspondingly, supernatants from the CEACAM1-overexpressing bladder cancer cell lines reduce, but those from CEACAM1 silencing induce endothelial tube formation and potentiate the morphogenetic effects of VEGF. These data suggest that the epithelial down-regulation of CEACAM1 induces angiogenesis via increased expression of VEGF-C and VEGF-D. Inversely, CEACAM1 is up-regulated in endothelial cells of angiogenic blood vessels. This in turn is involved in the switch from noninvasive and nonvascularized to invasive and vascularized bladder cancer. CEACAM1 appears to be a promising endothelial target for bladder cancer therapy.
