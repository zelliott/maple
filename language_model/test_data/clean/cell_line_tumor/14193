Peroxynitrite is one of the most potent neurotoxic agents with multiple targets in neurons and glial cells. This study addressed a question of whether peroxynitrite-mediated cytotoxicity can be prevented by Escherichia coli lypopolisaccharide (LPS) due to its mitogenic activity towards C6 glioma cells. A number of characteristic morphological changes (processes impairments, nuclei modifications, cytoplasm vacuolization) and apoptotic cells were observed in the cell culture after 24-h treatment with 3-morpholinosyndnonimine (SIN-1), a well-known donor of peroxynitrite. These morphological changes were clearly associated with a SIN-1 dose-dependent increase in the number of pathological mitoses as well as with SIN-1 inhibition of the menadione-induced, lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence of C6 glioma cells, an independent indicator of mitotic activity of these cells. The mitotic index of C6 glioma cells increased in response to LPS and underwent non-uniform changes depending on SIN-1 concentrations. At a mitogenic concentration of 100 ng/ml, LPS reduced significantly the toxicity of SIN-1 determined as the accumulation of pathological mitoses, thus acting as a protective agent. Taken together, our findings indicate that SIN-1 specifically impairs the mitotic process in C6 glioma cells, and provide the first evidence that antimitotic effects of peroxynitrite can be restored by LPS.
