Polar phenanthrene-based tylophorine derivatives (PBTs) were designed, synthesized and evaluated as potential antitumor agents. These compounds contain a core phenanthrene structure and can be synthesized efficiently in excellent yield. The newly synthesized PBTs were evaluated for cytotoxic activity against the A549 human cancer cell line. Among them, N-(2,3-methylenedioxy-6-methoxy-phenanthr-9-ylmethyl)-L-2-piperidinemethanol (34) and N-(2,3-methylenedioxy-6-methoxy-phenanthr-9-ylmethyl)-5-aminopentanol (28) showed the highest potency with IC50 values of 0.16 and 0.27 microM, respectively, which are comparable to those of currently used antitumor drugs. A structure-activity relationship (SAR) study was also explored to facilitate the further development of this new compound class.
