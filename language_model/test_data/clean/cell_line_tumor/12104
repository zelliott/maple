Squamous cell carcinoma antigens SCCA1 and SCCA2 are highly homologous serine proteinase inhibitors which have been widely utilized as serological markers for squamous cell cancers, but it has recently been demonstrated that only SCCA2 is truly specific for certain forms of lung cancer. Using a construct containing the 5'-flanking region of the SCCA2 gene between -460 and +0 bp and the luciferase reporter gene, SCCA2 promoter activity was detected in SCCA2-producing SCC cell lines (LK-2, LC-1), but not in SCCA2-nonproducing lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (A549, ABC-1, and RERF-LC-MS) or normal cells (WI-38, SAEC, and NHEK-Adult). Infection with a recombinant adenovirus vector, Ad-SCCA2-DsRed, resulted in cell-specific expression of the SCCA2 promoter-driven DsRed marker gene only in LK-2 and LC-1 cells. The same strategy was used for SCCA2-driven expression of a proapoptotic gene, (KLAKLAK)2, which can cause mitochondrial disruption by triggering mitochondrial permeabilization and swelling, resulting in the release of cytochrome c and induction of apoptosis. Infection with Ad-SCCA2-KLAKLAK2 specifically reduced the growth of the two human lung SCC cell lines compared to the SCCA2 nonproducing cell lines both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that the SCCA2 promoter had a tumor-specific effect. These results suggest that transduction of SCCA2 promoter-controlled suicide genes by adenoviral vectors can confer transcriptionally targeted cytotoxicity in SCCA2-producing lung SCC cells, and represents a novel strategy for gene transfer specifically targeted to SCC in the lung.
