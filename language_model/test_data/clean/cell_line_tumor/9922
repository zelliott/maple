Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a matrix-bound adhesive glycoprotein, has been shown to modulate tumor progression. We previously demonstrated that TSP-1 up-regulates matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9. Our studies suggested that the balance between MMPs and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) is a key determinant in tumor cell invasion. We now report that TSP-1 up-regulates TIMP-1 expression in both human breast and prostate cancer cell lines. The effect of TSP-1 on TIMP-1 expression was examined in human breast adenocarcinoma cell lines (MDA-MB-231) and human prostate cancer cell lines (PC3-NI and PC3-ML) treated with exogenous TSP-1. TIMP-1 expression was also examined in TSP-1 stably transfected breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-435). Northern and western blot analysis revealed TIMP-1 mRNA and TIMP-1 protein expression increased with increasing concentrations of TSP-1. This effect was inhibited by antibodies against the type I repeat domain of TSP-1 further suggesting that TSP-1 mediates TIMP-1 secretion. Inhibition of TSP-1 induced TIMP-1 levels increased tumor cell invasion. We conclude that TSP-1 is involved in influencing the critical balance between MMPs and their inhibitors, maintaining the controlled degradation of the extracellular matrix needed to support metastasis and our results may provide an explanation for the divergent activities reported for TSP-1 in tumor progression.
