The dose-dependent cardiotoxicities of doxorubicin (DOX) significantly limits its anti-cancer efficacies. One of the ways to augment the efficacies of DOX at a relatively low cumulative dose is to use a chemical sensitizer. Here, we demonstrated that schisandrin B (Sch B) significantly enhanced DOX-induced apoptosis of SMMC7721, a human hepatic carcinoma cell line, and of MCF-7, a human breast cancer cell line. This enhancement was irrelevant to the action of Sch B on P-glycoprotein or other drug-transporters, but associated with the activation of caspase-9 rather than caspase-8. The loss of mitochondria membrane potential was observed when cells were treated with DOX and Sch B combined. On the other hand, at the same experimental conditions, Sch B did not enhance the DOX-induced apoptosis of primary rat cardiomyocytes and primary human fibroblasts. Therefore, it is speculative that Sch B may bring benefit to clinical chemotherapy by reducing significantly the cumulative doses of DOX and its associated cardiotoxicities.
