To investigate the effects of tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) combined with Chinese medicine, Extractum trametes robiniophila murr in human hepatic cancer cells.

HepG2 cell line resistant to adriamycin (HepG2/ADR) was induced step by step. The effects of TRAIL (100 ng/L) combined with Extractum trametes robiniophila murr (1.0 g/L) promoting apoptosis in HepG2 or HepG2/ADM were analyzed. The proliferation was observed by MTT assay and the apoptosis of cells was also observed by flow cytometry.

HepG2/ADM was confirmed resisting to ADM. The treatment of TRAIL (100 ng/L) combined with Extractum trametes robiniophila murr (1.0 g/L) showed significant inhibitory effects on the growth of both HepG2 and HepG2/ADM, and the percentage of apoptosis was increased compared with other groups within 24 to 72 h.

Extractum trametes robiniophila murr dramatically augmented the sensitivity of both HepG2 and HepG2/ADM to TRAIL, but only has slightly killing effects on L02. TRAIL combined with Chinese medicine treatment could be a safe and attractive strategy to drug-resistant/TRAIL-resistant tumor cells.
