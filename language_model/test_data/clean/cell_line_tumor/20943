We investigated the potential role of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in colorectal carcinogenesis by constructing a eukaryotic expression vector of the mitochondrial D-loop gene from colorectal cancer cell SW480 and transfected NIH3T3 cells. The NIH3T3/SW480 cells exhibited a significantly increased growth rate and colony formation rate, and also had a decreased apoptotic rate. Polyploidy and aberrant chromosomes were detected in the NIH3T3/SW480 cells by chromosome karyotype analysis. Our results suggested that mtDNA from colorectal cancer cells promotes the malignant phenotype of NIH3T3 cells. Further study of the biological functions of NIH3T3/SW480 cells might be helpful in understanding the role of mtDNA in colorectal carcinogenesis.
