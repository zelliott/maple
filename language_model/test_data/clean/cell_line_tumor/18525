The design, the synthesis, and the in vitro antitumor activities of trans 2-[2-(heteroaryl)vinyl]-1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodides versus MCF7 (human mammary carcinoma) and LNCap (prostate carcinoma) cell lines are reported. The design indicates trans 2-[2-[5-(2-chlorophenyl)furan-2-yl]vinyl]-1, 3-dimethylimidazolium iodide 5 and trans 2-[2-[5-(4-bromophenyl)furan-2-yl]vinyl]-1, 3-dimethylimidazolium iodide 6 as highly active compounds in the series. The synthesis of the above new derivatives and in vitro antitumor tests, confirm their significant antiproliferative and cytotoxic activities.
