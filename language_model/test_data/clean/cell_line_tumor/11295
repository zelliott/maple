Most chemical transfection reagents are ineffective for the transfection of cells in suspension, such as leukemic cell and stem cell lineages. We developed two different types of viroplexes, cationic Sendai F/HN viroplexes (CSVs) and protamine sulfate-condensed cationic Sendai F/HN viroplexes (PCSVs) for the efficient transfection of T-leukemic cells.

The viroplex systems were prepared by reconstitution of fusogenic Sendai F/HN proteins in DMKE (O,O'-dimyristyl-N-lysyl glutamate) cationic liposomes. The viroplexes were further optimized for plasmid DNA and siRNA delivery to suspension cells. The particle size and surface charge of the viroplexes were analyzed with a Î¶-sizer. Transfection of plasmid DNA (pDNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) by CSVs or PCSV was evaluated by measurement of transgene expression, confocal microscopy, FACS, and RT-PCR.

The optimized CSVs and PCSVs exhibited enhanced gene and siRNA delivery in the tested suspension cell lines (Jurkat cells and CEM cells), compared with conventional cationic liposomes. In the case of pDNA transfection, the CSVs and PCSVs show at least 10-fold and 100-fold higher transgene expression compared with DMKE lipoplexes (or lipofectamine 2000), respectively. The CSVs showed more effective siRNA delivery to the suspension cells than cationic liposomes, as assessed by confocal microscopy, FACS, and RT-PCR. The effective transfection by the CSVs and PCSVs is presumably due to fusogenic activity of F/HN proteins resulting in facilitated internalization of pDNA and siRNA.

This study suggests that Sendai F/HN viroplexes can be widely applicable for the transfection of pDNA and siRNA to suspension cell lines.
