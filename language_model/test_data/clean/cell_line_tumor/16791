Three new norditerpenoids, castanol A-C (1-3), along with eighteen known diterpenoids, were isolated from Salvia castanea Diels f. pubescens. Their structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis. All compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic activities against five human cancer cell lines. The known compounds neo-tanshinlactone (12) and methyltanshinoate (17) exhibited significant cytotoxic activities against some cells.
