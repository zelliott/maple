The inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and interferon gamma (IFNγ) stimulate production of the inflammatory mediators prostaglandin E₂ (PGEγ), prostacyclin (PGIγ), and nitric oxide (NO) in cultured lung epithelial cells. Pretreatment of these cells with the selective MEK1/2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase [ERK] kinase 1/2) inhibitor U0126 blocked ERK1/2 activation and inhibited cytokine-induced production of these inflammatory mediators. Primary bronchiolar epithelial Clara cells treated with TNFα and IFNγ also produced increased PGE₂, PGI₂, and NO, and PG and NO production was decreased by MEK inhibition. U0126 differentially affected cyclooxygenase (COX)-1, COX-2, and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression in cell lines, however, suggesting that MEK1/2 regulates prostanoid and NO production by means other than inducing their biosynthetic enzymes. Functionally, inhibition of MEK1/2 caused G1 cell cycle arrest and decreased cyclin D1 expression, but these effects were not related to decreased prostanoid production. These results indicate separate proinflammatory and proliferative roles for ERK1/2 in lung epithelial cells. During lung tumor formation in vivo, ERK1/2 phosphorylation increased as lung tumors progressed. Since tumor-derived cells were more sensitive than nontumorigenic cells to the antiproliferative effects of U0126, MEK1/2 inhibition may serve as an attractive chemotherapeutic target.
