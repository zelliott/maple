We describe a novel murine gene rudhira that is expressed at high levels in embryonic stem cells and is restricted to blood islands and the erythroid lineage during embryonic development. Rudhira is expressed in angiogenic precursors but is excluded from the differentiated endothelium. Rudhira-expressing cells are seen in close proximity to endothelial cells in angiogenic blood vessels. Rudhira encodes a predicted cytoplasmic WD40 protein that is 98% identical to human BCAS3. The gene encoding BCAS3 maps to a breakpoint of hematological neoplasms on human chromosome 17q23, but its expression and function remain to be determined. We demonstrate that mouse Rudhira is a novel marker for analysis of the erythroid lineage.
