Open-pore titanium scaffolds were fabricated by sintering of compressed mixtures of TiH(1.924) and urea. Spherical and irregular shaped space holders were used to investigate the effect of pore shape on cellular behavior. After removal of the space holder, the shape of the spacers was replicated to the pores. Average diameter of the pores was in the range of 300-600 Î¼m. SEM images showed that titanium hydride resulted in higher surface roughness and larger micro porosities than pure titanium. In vitro evaluations were carried out by using MTT assay, measuring alkaline phosphatase activity and alizarin red staining in flow perfusion bioreactor for cell culture. Observations revealed excellent attachment and proliferation of G-292 cells to the highly porous scaffolds fabricated with titanium hydride and urea of this research.
