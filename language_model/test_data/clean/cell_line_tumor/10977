To evaluate the status of promoter hypermethylation of Ras association domain family protein 1A (RASSF1A), hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC1) and p73 genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to explore the correlation with clinicopathological features.

Forty cases of HCC and their corresponding non-tumor liver tissues, other 2 cases of healthy donor livers were detected using methylation specific polymorphism chain reaction (MSP) method.

The frequency of promoter hypermethylation of RASSF1A showed 90.0% and 72.5% in tumor and corresponding non-tumor tissues respectively, and there was significant difference between them (P < 0.05). The frequency of promoter hypermethylation of HIC1 showed 77.5% and 70.0% in tumor and corresponding non-tumor tissues respectively. The frequency of hypermethylation of HIC1 in non-tumor liver tissues showed significant correlation between younger and older patients. The frequency of promoter hypermethylation of p73 showed 5.0% in tumor tissues. However, none of hypermethylation of the gene was detected in corresponding non-tumor liver tissues. There was none of hypermethylation of the three genes showed in two cases of healthy donor livers.

Promoter hypermethylation of RASSF1A and HIC1 genes are common event in HCC and play an important role in the pathogenesis and may be used to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for HCC in the future.
