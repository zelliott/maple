Four canine melanoma cell lines were established from the subcutaneous, oral gingival and mucosal melanoma tissues at the primary and metastatic sites. These cell lines were designated as CMeC-1, CMeC-2, KMeC and LMeC. The cells were spindles in shape, similar to that of primary tumor cells. The doubling times of these cells ranged from 34.1 +/- 5.61 to 57.9 +/- 3.28 hr and their chromosome number ranged from 46 to 80. When transplanted into nude mice, CMeC-1 and LMeC produced tumors, whereas CMeC-2 and KMeC did not. The morphology of the tissue formed by xenotransplantation of these cells was similar to their primary tumors.
