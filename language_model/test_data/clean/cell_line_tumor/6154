One of the main olive oil phenolic compounds, hydroxytyrosol (3,4-DHPEA), exerts in vitro chemopreventive activities (antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic) on tumor cells through the accumulation of H(2)O(2) in the culture medium. However, the phenol composition of virgin olive oil is complex, and 3,4-DHPEA is present at low concentrations when compared to other secoiridoids. In this study, the in vitro chemopreventive activities of complex virgin olive oil phenolic extracts (VOO-PE, derived from the four Italian cultivars Nocellara del Belice, Coratina, Ogliarola, and Taggiasca) were compared to each other and related to the amount of the single phenolic constituents. A great chemopreventive potential among the different VOO-PE was found following this order: Ogliarola > Coratina > Nocellara > Taggiasca. The antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activities of VOO-PE were positively correlated to the secoiridoid content and negatively correlated to the concentration of both phenyl alcohols and lignans. All extracts induced H(2)O(2) accumulation in the culture medium, but this phenomenon was not responsible for their pro-apoptotic activity. When tested in a complex mixture, the olive oil phenols exerted a more potent chemopreventive effect compared to the isolated compounds, and this effect could be due either to a synergistic action of components or to any other unidentified extract constituent.
