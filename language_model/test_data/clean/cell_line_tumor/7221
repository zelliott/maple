Tumor cell invasion and metastasis are the hallmark of malignant neoplasm. Despite advances in the management of thyroid carcinoma and other solid tumors, metastasis continues to be the most significant cause in cancer mortality. To gain new insights into this complex process in thyroid carcinoma, we established a thyroid carcinoma cell line (ARO-met2) with high metastatic capacity to the lung by sequential passage of a human anaplastic thyroid cancer cell line (ARO) through the lung of a nude mouse. Global patterns of gene expression were analyzed in cells of the parental ARO and the ARO-met2, using Atlas human cancer 1.2 array with 1176 cancer-related genes. In total, 184 genes were differentially expressed more than 1.5 times, and 64 genes were differentially expressed over two times. Among those 64 genes, 43 were overexpressed, and 21 genes were underexpressed. Many genes whose increased expression was thought to be related to tumor progression were identified, such as c-Met, ezrin, integrin, motility-related protein-1, cadherin, and S100A4. The most highly expressed gene is the S100A4 (8-fold higher than control), which is a member of a small calcium binding protein family and is involved in the cell proliferation and cancer progression. The S100A4 overexpression in the ARO-met2 cells was later confirmed by Northern blot and real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR. Analysis of 49 thyroid tumor specimens by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (eight benign goiters, 36 papillary, and five anaplastic carcinomas) revealed that S100A4 overexpression was present in most advanced thyroid carcinomas and lymph node metastases, and was associated with poor prognosis. None of the benign goiters was found to have S100A4 overexpression. These data suggest that S100A4 could be used as a prognostic marker for thyroid carcinoma. Given that S100A4 is involved in tumor progression and metastasis, it may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention.
