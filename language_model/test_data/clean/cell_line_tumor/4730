The platinum mixed-phosphine complexes (SP-4,2)-[PtCl(8-MTT)(PPh3)(PTA)] (2) and cis-[Pt(8-MTT)2(PPh3)(PTA)] (3) (MTTH2 = 8-(methylthio)theophylline, PTA = 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane) have been prepared from the precursor cis-[PtCl2(PPh3)(PTA)] (1), which has been fully characterized by X-ray diffraction determination. Antiproliferative activity tests indicated that the presence of one lipophilic PPh3 and one hydrophilic PTA makes 1-3 more active than the analogues bearing two PPh3 or two PTA. The reactivity of cis-[PtCl2(PPh3)2], cis-[PtCl2(PTA)2], and cis-[PtCl2(PPh3)(PTA)] with the bis(thiopurines) bis(S-8-thiotheophylline)methane (MBTTH2), 1,2-bis(S-8-thiotheophylline)ethane (EBTTH2), and 1,3-bis(S-8-thiotheophylline)propane (PBTTH2) has also been investigated. New binuclear complexes have been prepared and identified by spectroscopic techniques and their antiproliferative activities on T2 and SKOV3 cell lines evaluated.
