To analyse short term and long term X-ray irradiation effects on proliferation, viability, glucose and amino acid uptake of murine melanoma cells in vitro and metastasis in vivo.

B16-F10 melanoma cells were irradiated with different doses of X-ray irradiation (200 kV) in the range from 1-20 Gy. One, two and three days respectively 7, 14 and 21 days after treatment cells were analysed concerning cell growth, viability, proliferation, cell cycle distribution, glucose and amino acid transport. Moreover the capability of the cells for in vivo metastasis was examined.

As short term response on irradiation we detected decreased cell growth, viability and arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Long term response involves re-start of proliferation, increased cell growth and glucose uptake but still decreased viability and amino acid transport. In vivo metastasis is lost immediately after irradiation and regained to a low extent beyond two weeks time for recurrence of cells before injection.

In vitro data suggest that surviving melanoma cells compensate the initial irradiation-dependent damage of proliferation within three weeks possibly by increase in glucose uptake. For metastasis in vivo the role of additional mechanisms is strongly suggested.
