Gold and its complexes have long been known to display unique biological and medicinal properties. Extensive cell-based (in vitro) and animal (in vivo) studies have revealed the potent anti-cancer activities of diverse classes of gold(I) and gold(III) complexes. Most of the reported anti-cancer active gold complexes are highly cytotoxic and unstable under physiological conditions, which hamper their development to be launched clinically. Several clinical reports showed that lipophilic organic cations are promising anti-cancer drug candidates targeting to mitochondria. Through metal-ligand coordination, gold(I) and gold(III) ions can form stable lipophilic cations containing organic ligands having tunable lipophilicity and diverse functionalities. The present highlight summarizes the recent development of lipophilic gold(III) cations and gold(I) complexes with promising anti-cancer activities.
