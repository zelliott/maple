Heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) is up-regulated in multiple malignancies and implicated in cisplatin resistance. It is attempted to know how Hsp27 endues cell with cisplatin resistance by interfering with upstream of both apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated apoptotic signaling and serine/threonine kinase Akt-dependent survival signaling.

The mouse L929 cells stably transfected with human Hsp27 or its dominant-negative mutant and the human cervical cancer HeLa cells transfected with Hsp27 siRNA were used. The cisplatin-induced apoptosis and activation of ASK1, p38, and Akt were compared in control cells, cells overexpressing Hsp27, and cells with their endogenous Hsp27 knocked down.

Hsp27 effectively protected the cells from cisplatin-induced DNA fragmentation. The p38 inhibitors obviously decreased whereas Akt inhibitors markedly increased the apoptotic fraction in cisplatin-treated cells. Overexpression of Hsp27 doubly enhanced the drug-induced Akt activation while substantially depressing the drug-induced activation of ASK1 and p38. Knockdown of the endogenous Hsp27 in HeLa cells resulted in the effects opposite to that observed in the Hsp27-overexpressing cells. Enhancement of Akt activation is associated with complex formation between Akt and Hsp27, whereas depression of ASK1/p38 activation is attributed to a reversion of the drug-induced inhibition of thioredoxin reductase activity and subsequent oxidation of thioredoxin.

Hsp27 endues cells with cisplatin resistance via depression of the drug-induced ASK1/p38 activation and enhancement of the drug-induced Akt activation. This study revealed the intervention of Hsp27 in upstream of both ASK1/p38 apoptotic signaling and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt survival signaling. Therefore, the inhibition of Hsp27 may be a novel strategy of cancer chemotherapy.
