Four cycloartane-type saponins, kahiricosides II-V (1-4), were isolated from the aerial parts of Astragalus kahiricus of Egyptian origin. Their structures were established as 9beta,19-cyclolanost-24E-ene-3beta,6alpha,16beta,27-tetraol-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, 9beta,19-cyclolanost-24E-ene-3beta,6alpha,16beta,27-tetraol-3-O-(2'-O-acetyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside, 9beta,19-cyclolanost-24E-ene-3beta,6alpha,16beta,27-tetraol-3-O-(6'-O-acetyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside, and 9beta,19-cyclolanost-24E-ene-3beta,6alpha,16beta,27-tetraol-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-27-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside based on chemical and spectral evidences. All compounds exhibited very weak cytotoxicity against the A2780 ovarian cancer cell line.
