Drug resistance remains a major clinical obstacle to successful treatment in breast cancer patients, and the evidence of microRNAs involvement in cancer drug resistance has been emerging recently. However, the role of microRNA-200c (miR-200c) in modulating chemoresistance of breast cancer remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the miR-200c expression in tumor specimens obtained from thirty-nine breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvent chemotherapy by quantitative real-time PCR. Down-regulated miR-200c was observed in non-responders as compared to responders. In addition, miR-200c expression was observed to be down-regulated over 800-fold in human breast cancer cells resistant to doxorubicin MCF-7/ADR as compared to the parental MCF-7 cells. Up-regulation of miR-200c with transfection of miR-200c mimics in breast cancer cells could enhance the chemosensitivity to epirubicin and reduce expression of multidrug resistance 1 mRNA and P-glycoprotein. Moreover, our study demonstrated that restoration of miR-200c in MCF-7/ADR cells could increase intracellular doxorubicin accumulation determined by flow cytometry. Taken together, our findings suggest that miR-200c may act as a promising therapeutic target for improvement of responsiveness to chemotherapy in breast cancer.
