Testicular cancer is the most common cancer among young men of reproductive age. Bleomycin is a frequently used drug for the treatment of several malignancies and is part of the chemotherapy protocols used for testicular cancer; however, side-effects are common. Bleomycin causes an increase in oxidative stress which has been shown to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), an active component of the spice turmeric, has been demonstrated to induce apoptosis in a number of malignancies. However, to date no study has been carried out to elucidate its anticancer activity and interaction with bleomycin in testicular cancer cells. In this study, we investigated and compared the effects of curcumin, bleomycin and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on apoptotic signaling pathways. Curcumin (20 µM), bleomycin (400 µg/ml) and H2O2 (400 µM) incubation for 24 h decreased the viability of NTera-2 cells, and increased caspase-3, -8 and -9 activities, Bax and cytoplasmic cytochrome c levels and decreased Bcl-2 levels. The concurrent use of curcumin with bleomycin induced caspase-3, -8 and -9 activities to a greater extent in NTera-2 cells than the use of each drug alone. Our observations suggest that the effects of curcumin and bleomycin on apoptotic signaling pathways are synergistic. Therefore, we propose to use curcumin together with bleomycin to decrease its therapeutic dose and, therefore, its side-effects.
