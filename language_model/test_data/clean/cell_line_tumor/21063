To investigate the effects of Scutellaria barbate extract (ESB) on suppressing proliferation and inducing apoptosis of mouse hepatoma H22 cells.

H22 cells cultured in vitro were divided into 5 groups: blank control group, ESB in high, medium, low dose groups and 5-Fu group. H22 cells were cultured in media with serum containing different concentrations of ESB and blank serum. The proliferation of H22 cells was determined by microculture tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Fluorescence microscopy was utilized to observe the apoptosis of H22 cells by staining with Hoechst 33258. The cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM).

The inhibition of serum containing ESB on the proliferation of H22 cells in vitro was observerd in a dose and time dependent manner. The typical morphological changes of apoptosis were observed after incubation with ESB-containing serum in high dose for 48 hours. Among the various phases of cell cycle, the percentage of cells in S phase decreased significantly, while the percentage of cells in G1 phase increased. Drug-containing serum showed positive effect on cell apoptosis. The apoptosis rate of blank control group, ESB in low, medium, high dose groups and 5-Fu group were 0.51%, 1.07%, 3.15%, 7.83%, 11.26%, respectively.

ESB containing serum can inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of H22 cells in vitro.
