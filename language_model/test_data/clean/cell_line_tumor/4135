Seven new mono- and bis-furanones, pezizolides A-G (1-7), have been isolated from the crude extract of the endolichenic fungus Peziza sp. inhabiting the lichen Xanthoparmelia sp. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated mainly by NMR and MS methods. The absolute configuration of 1-4 was assigned by the application of CD exciton chirality method, and 1 was further supported by electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations, whereas that of 5 was deduced by Snatzke's method following the relative configuration analysis of its acetonide. The cytotoxity and antimicrobial activity of compounds 1-7 were tested.
