We present evidence that pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) inhibits growth of p53-negative pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines via cell cycle arrest in the S-phase, while it has no effect on primary fibroblast proliferation. Growth inhibition of cancer cells is dependent on ROS and ERK1/2 induction as indicated by a significantly reduced PDTC-associated growth inhibition by the free radical scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) or the MEK/ERK1/2 inhibitor (PD98059). Moreover, ERK1/2 induction is dependent on ROS production as demonstrated by a complete removal of PDTC-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation by NAC. p21(WAF1/CIP1) activation has a central role in growth inhibition by PDTC, as revealed by P21(WAF1/CIP1) silencing experiments with antisense oligonucleotide, and occurs via increased mRNA stability largely mediated by ROS/ERK induction. Conversely, PDTC does not affect P21(WAF1/CIP1) gene expression in primary fibroblasts, although it is able to activate p53 and the p53-regulated antioxidant SESN2. These results suggest that the resistance of fibroblasts to the cytotoxic action of PDTC may be related to the up-regulation of p53-dependent antioxidant genes. Finally, in vivo studies on PaCa44 cells subcutaneously xenografted in nude mice show that treatment with 100 or 200 mg/kg PDTC reduces of 30% or 60% the tumour volume, respectively, and does not cause any apparent form of toxicity.
