Local delivery of anti-tumor drugs provides a high local concentration and decreases the incidence of side effects commonly observed with systemic therapy. Hydrogel systems are commonly used as a local drug delivery system. In this study, we prepared a novel thermosensitive conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)-coupled poloxamer hydrogel for local delivery of paclitaxel (PTX) to gain the benefits of the pro-drug activity of the CLA-coupled poloxamer and enhanced PTX solubility due to the micellar property of the CLA-coupled poloxamer. To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of the PTX-incorporated CLA-coupled poloxamer hydrogel in vivo, formulations were injected subcutaneously into tumor-bearing mice. Cell cycle and apoptosis markers were examined to determine the mechanism of the anti-tumor activity of PTX. The PTX-incorporated CLA-coupled poloxamer thermosensitive hydrogel showed excellent anti-tumor activity in vivo inducing stronger cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor tissue than the PTX-incorporated poloxamer hydrogel. These results were attributed to the synergistic effect of the anti-tumor property of PTX with released CLA from the CLA-coupled poloxamer as the pro-drug and the enhanced solubility of PTX resulting from the micellar property of the CLA-coupled poloxamer. The CLA-coupled poloxamer designed in this study has great potential as an effective injectable carrier of PTX.
