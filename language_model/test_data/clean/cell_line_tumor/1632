Aldehyde drugs are gaining increasing research interest, considering that aldehyde dehydrogenases overexpression is characteristic of cancer stem cells. Here, we describe the traceless site-specific coupling of a novel potent drug, containing an aldehyde moiety, to recombinant antibodies, which were engineered to display a cysteine residue at their N-terminus, or a 1,2-aminothiol at their C-terminus. The resulting chemically defined antibody-drug conjugates represent the first example in which a thiazolidine linkage is used for the targeted delivery and release of cytotoxic agents.
