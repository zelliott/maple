P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is an ATP-driven membrane exporter for a broad spectrum of hydrophobic xenobiotics. Pgp-overexpression is a common cause of multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells and could lead to chemotherapeutic failure. Through an extensive herbal drug screening program we previously showed that (+/-)-praeruptorin A (PA), a naturally existing pyranocumarin isolated from the dried root of Peucedanum praeruptorum Dunn., re-sensitizes Pgp-mediated MDR (Pgp-MDR) cancer cells to cancer drugs. A number of PA derivatives were synthesized and one of these, (+/-)-3'-O, 4'-O-dicynnamoyl-cis-khellactone (DCK), was more potent than PA or verapamil in the reversal of Pgp-MDR. In Pgp-MDR cells DCK increased cellular accumulation of doxorubicin without affecting the expression level of Pgp. In Pgp-enriched membrane fractions DCK moderately stimulated basal Pgp-ATPase activity, suggesting some transport substrate-like function. However, DCK also inhibited Pgp-ATPase activity stimulated by the standard substrates verapamil or progesterone with decreased V(max)s but K(m)s were relatively unchanged, suggesting a primarily non-competitive mode of inhibition. While the binding of substrates to active Pgp would increase the reactivity of the Pgp-specific antibody UIC2, DCK decreased UIC2 reactivity. These results suggest that DCK could bind simultaneously with substrates to Pgp but perhaps at an allosteric site and thus affect Pgp-substrate interactions.
