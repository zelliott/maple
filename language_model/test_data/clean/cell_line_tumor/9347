Administration of expanded tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in association with lymphodepleting chemotherapy is effective in some patients with advanced malignant melanoma. However, obtaining lymphocytes and subsequent expansion is labor intensive, making it impractical for broad clinical application. Allogeneic transplantation may have anti-melanoma efficacy because of a graft vs. tumor effect. The disappointing tumor control observed post-transplant suggests that adoptive immunotherapy using melanoma-reactive cells will be essential for sustained responses.

Melanoma cell lines were grown from two patients with advanced disease. High-level CD80 and CD86 expression was obtained in the tumor lines using a retroviral vector for gene transfer. Transduced melanoma and controls were cultured with mononuclear cells from HLA-identical sibling donors.

Expression of CD80 and CD86, particularly the former, promoted marked expansion of lymphocytes from HLA-matched sibling donors. Proliferation of up to 300-fold after 4 weeks of culture was observed. Lymphocytes from cultures stimulated with CD80 demonstrated cytotoxicity against recipient-untransfected melanoma (45-75% specific lysis at an E:T ratio of 50:1). Although expanded lymphocytes were predominantly CD4(+), cytotoxicity was greatest in the numerically smaller CD8(+) subpopulation. Both CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells secreted IFN-gamma (but not IL-4) on exposure to untransduced stimulator melanoma cells.

Our strategy generates a large number of melanoma-reactive lymphocytes from HLA-identical siblings using a 4-week culture strategy. Lymphocytes expanded in this way offer an alternative to tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes for allogeneic cellular immunotherapy after stem cell transplantation in young patients.
