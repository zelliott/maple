Water-in-oil (w/o) microemulsion synthesis of 70 nm size monodisperse TAT (a cell penetrating peptide, CPP) conjugated, FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) doped silica nanoparticles (TAT-FSNPs) is reported; human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cells (in vitro) and rat brain tissue (in vivo) were successfully labeled using TAT-FSNPs.
