Prompt phagocytosis of apoptotic cells prevents inflammatory and autoimmune responses to dying cells. We have previously shown that the blood anticoagulant factor protein S stimulates phagocytosis of apoptotic human B lymphoma cells by human monocyte-derived macrophages. In this study, we show that protein S must first undergo oxidative activation to stimulate phagocytosis. Binding of human protein S to apoptotic cells or to phosphatidylserine multilamellar vesicles promotes auto-oxidation of Cys residues in protein S, resulting in covalent, disulfide-linked dimers and oligomers that preferentially bind to and activate the human Mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK) receptor on the macrophages. The prophagocytic activity of protein S is eliminated when disulfide-mediated oligomerization is prevented, or when MerTK is blocked with neutralizing Abs. Protein S oligomerization is independent of phospholipid oxidation. The data suggest that membranes containing phosphatidylserine serve as a scaffold for protein S-protein S interactions and that the resulting auto-oxidation and oligomerization is required for the prophagocytic activity of protein S. In this way, apoptotic cells facilitate their own uptake by macrophages. The requirement for oxidative modification of protein S can explain why this abundant blood protein does not constitutively activate MerTK in circulating monocytes and tissue macrophages.
