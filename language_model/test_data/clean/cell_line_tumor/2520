CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPα) induction induces monocytic differentiation even in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). In this study, the induction/activation of C/EBPα in myelomonocytic AML was investigated using a combination of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and RAD001 (Everolimus), a mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibitor. Combining these agents increased PU.1, C/EBPε and C/EBPα expression, increased the p42/p30 C/EBPα ratio, and decreased C/EBPα phosphorylation at serine 21, and was accompanied by growth inhibition, induction of CD11b expression and apoptosis in AML cell lines. Thus, agents that induce sufficient levels of C/EBPα expression might be useful in treating AML.
