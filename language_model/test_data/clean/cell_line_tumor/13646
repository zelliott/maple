Microencapsulation of rasagiline mesylate (RM) into PLGA microspheres was performed by method A (O/W emulsion) and method B (W/O/W double emulsion). The best formulation regarding process yield, encapsulation efficiency and in vitro drug release was that prepared with method A, which exhibited constant drug release for two weeks (K(0)=62.3 μg/day/20mg microspheres). Exposure of SKN-AS cells to peroxide-induced oxidative stress (1 mM) resulted in cell apoptosis which was significantly reduced by RM (40.7-102.5 μM) as determined by cell viability, ROS production and DNA fragmentation. Daily doses of rotenone (2 mg/kg) given i.p. to rats for 45 days induced neuronal and behavioral changes similar to those occurring in PD. Once an advanced stage of PD was achieved, animals received RM in saline (1 mg/kg/day) or encapsulated within PLGA microspheres (amount of microspheres equivalent to 15 mg/kg RM given on days 15 and 30). After 45 days RM showed a robust effect on all analytical outcomes evaluated with non-statistically significant differences found between its administration in solution or within microparticles however; with this controlled release system administration of RM could be performed every two weeks thereby making this new therapeutic system an interesting approach for the treatment of PD.
