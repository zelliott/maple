Prostate cancer (PCA) is the most common cancer diagnosed in men and the second most common cause of death due to cancers after lung cancer. Metastasis of cancer cells involves multiple processes and various cytophysiological changes, including changed adhesion capability between cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) and damaged intercellular interaction. Silibinin, a naturally occurring flavonoid antioxidant found in the milk thistle, has recently been shown to have potent antiproliferative effect against various malignant cell lines. In the present study, PC-3 cells were incubated with various concentrations of silibinin for different times; then, cell cytotoxicity, cell adhesion and cell motility were assessed using MTT assay, cell-matrix adhesion assay and cell migration assay, respectively. The results showed that silibinin exerted a dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect on the viability, motility and adhesion of highly metastatic PC-3 cells. These observations indicate that silibinin can probably inhibit metastasis in PCA.
