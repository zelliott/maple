Fibroblast growth factor 8-isoform b (FGF8b) has been detected in human clinical sex-organ related cancers including hormone-refractory prostate cancer. There are, however, few relevant experimental models. A murine monoclonal anti-FGF8 antibody, KM1334, has been shown to neutralize FGF8b and inhibit the growth of androgen-dependent mouse mammary SC-3 cells in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we evaluated the anti-tumor activity of KM1334 against androgen-dependent and -independent progression of FGF8b-expressing human prostate cancer xenografts.

FGF8b cDNA was transfected into androgen-dependent human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, and its xenograft tumors were established subcutaneously in SCID mice with or without castration. KM1334 at the dose of 400 microg/head was injected twice weekly.

FGF8b-expressing LNCaP cells secreted FGF8b, showed enhanced level of Erk1/2 phosphorylation, and showed more potent growth properties than mock-expressing cells in vitro and in vivo. KM1334 reduced these properties in vitro, inhibited tumorigenecity in vivo (T/C=0.33), and showed anti-tumor activity against established tumors (T/C=0.47) of FGF8b-expressing cells. FGF8b-expressing LNCaP tumors were androgen-dependent. However, they recurred as androgen-independent FGF8b positive tumors after castration. KM1334 also inhibited the growth of established FGF8b-expressing tumors in the androgen-independent states (T/C=0.47).

These results indicate that humanized monoclonal antibodies, conserving the paratope of KM1334, are a promising candidate for therapy of FGF8b-expressing clinical prostate cancers. Follow-up studies using xenograft models with clinical FGF8b-expressing tumors are required to validate these early findings.
