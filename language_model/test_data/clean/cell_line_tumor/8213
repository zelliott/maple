To investigate the mechanism of quercetin on the inhibition of the lymphatic metastasis in human gastric cancer cells MGC-803.

Cells were divided into the control group and the quercetin (Que)-treated group. Immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR were used to detect the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) and VEGFR-3 of human gastric cancer cells MGC-803 in response to Que.

Que significantly decreased the expression of VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 at 40 mumol/L compared with the control group after 48 h ( p<0.01).

Que can down-regulate the expression of VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 in human gastric cancer cells MGC-803.
