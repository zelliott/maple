Newcastle disease virus (NDV) has a potential oncolytic effect due to its ability to induce apoptosis in tumor cells. However, previous studies have indicated discrepancies regarding the apoptosis signaling pathways induced by NDV in tumor cells. Here, we show that NDV infection induces simultaneous activation of intrinsic and extrinsic death pathways in A549 human lung cancer cells. In contrast, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is not activated in NDV-induced apoptosis. We demonstrate for the first time that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are activated in NDV-infected A549 cells, and p38 MAPK is involved in NDV-induced cell death. Together, our findings provide novel insights into the underlying mechanisms by which NDV induces apoptosis in tumor cells.
