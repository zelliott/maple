We investigated the anti-tumor efficiency of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) on human tongue squamous carcinoma SAS cell line using low intensity ultrasound (LIU) of 0.6 and 0.8 W/cm(2), plus 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). Xenograft in vivo experiments using Balb/ca nude mice and MTT assays in vitro showed that ALA-LIU therapy significantly suppressed the proliferation of SAS cells. ALA-LIU therapy markedly enhanced SAS cell apoptosis rate compared to LIU alone. Based on TEM and fluorescence microscopy observations, there are notably morphology changes and seriously swollen mitochondria in xenograft tissues, and ALA-induced PpIX bond strongly to mitochondria of SAS cells. Immunohistochemical staining and western blotting demonstrated upregulation of Bax, cytochrome c and caspase-3, and downregulation of Bcl-2 for both in vivo and in vitro cases after ALA-LIU treatment. Increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the ALA-LIU treatment groups were found using 2, 7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) staining. Administration of the ROS scavenger, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), suppressed ALA-LIU-induced apoptosis and the expression of mitochondria apoptosis-related proteins, which confirmed that the ALA-LIU induced SAS cell apoptosis is through the generation of ROS. The process initially damaged mitochondria, activated pro-apoptotic factors Bax and cytochrome c and suppressed the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2, activated caspase-3 to executed apoptosis through mitochondrial signaling pathway.
