To investigate the correlation of ZNF217 gene expression with the biological behavior of human ovarian cancer HO-8910 cells.

The expression of ZNF217 in ovarian carcinoma cell lines was detected by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. The biological behaviors of the transfectants were investigated by MTT, in vitro Boyden chamber and in vivo invasion assay, respectively.

RT-PCR and Western blotting revealed that transfection of ZNF217 into the HO-8910 cells significantly increased their proliferation along with markedly enhanced in vitro and in vivo invasion and metastatic abilities. MTT assay showed that the proliferation ability of pEGFP-N1-ZNF217/HO-8910 cells was significantly higher than that of pEGFP-N1/HO-8910 cells and HO-8910 cells (P < 0.001). The Boyden chamber assay showed that the numbers of migrating pEGFP-N1-ZNF217/HO-8910, pEGFP-N1/HO-8910 and HO-8910 cells were (141.25 ± 13.91) cells/200×field, (82.50 ± 11.73) cells/200×field and (81.75 ± 12.12)cells/200×field, with a significant difference between them (F = 29.247, P < 0.001). The nude mouse experiment showed that the in vivo tumor formation ability of pEGFP-N1-ZNF217/HO-8910 cells was significantly higher than that of pEGFP-N1/HO-8910 cells (P < 0.001).

ZNF217 gene plays an important role in the invasion and metastasis of ovarian cancer. ZNF217 gene expression may be a useful marker indicating invasion and metastasis of ovarian cancer.
