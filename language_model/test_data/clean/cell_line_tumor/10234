In this article the synthesis of new 1H-(2'-pyridyl)-3-methyl-5-hydroxypyrazole and 1H-(2'-pyridyl)-3-phenyl-5-hydroxypyrazole complexes with palladium(II) ions is reported. The structures of obtained compounds have been characterized by X-ray crystallography and DFT (density functional theory) calculations. The cytotoxicity of complexes and ligands has been examined for two human leukemia cell lines (HL-60 and NALM-6) and one human melanoma cell line (WM-115). The palladium(II) complex with 1H-(2'-pyridyl)-3-phenyl-5-hydroxypyrazole has been shown to possess greater activity than carboplatin against the WM-115 melanoma cell line. Additionally, the ligands' tautomeric forms existence in different solvents (chloroform, methanol, DMSO) has been characterized by (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis and DFT calculations. The obtained results have been compared with those from other studies of similar compounds.
