The polysomal ribonuclease 1 (PMR1) mRNA endonuclease forms a selective complex with its translating substrate mRNAs where it is activated to initiate mRNA decay. Previous work showed tyrosine phosphorylation is required for PMR1 targeting to this polysome-bound complex, and it identified c-Src as the responsible kinase. c-Src phosphorylation occurs in a distinct complex, and the current study shows that 90-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) is also recovered with PMR1 and c-Src. Hsp90 binding to PMR1 is inhibited by geldanamycin, and geldanamycin stabilizes substrate mRNA to PMR1-mediated decay. PMR1 is inherently unstable and geldanamycin causes PMR1 to rapidly disappear in a process that is catalyzed by the 26S proteasome. We present a model where Hsp90 interacts transiently to stabilize PMR1 in a manner similar to its interaction with c-Src, thus facilitating the tyrosine phosphorylation and targeting of PMR1 to polysomes.
