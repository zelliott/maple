Fourty-two thiazolyl-pyrazoline derivatives were synthesized to screen for their EGFR kinase inhibitory activity. Compound 4-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-(3-(3,4-dimethylphenyl)-5-p-tolyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)thiazole (11) displayed the most potent EGFR TK inhibitory activity with IC(50) of 0.06 μM, which was comparable to the positive control. Molecular docking results indicated that compound 11 was nicely bound to the EGFR kinase. Compound 11 also showed significant antiproliferative activity against MCF-7 with IC(50) of 0.07 μM, which would be a potential anticancer agent.
