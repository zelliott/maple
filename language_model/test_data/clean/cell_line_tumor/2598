In our previous work, we showed for the first time that the voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 is specifically expressed in highly metastatic human breast tumor tissues and cell lines. However, the contribution of Hv1 to breast carcinogenesis is not well known. In this study, we showed that Hv1 expression was significantly correlated with the tumor size (p = 0.001), tumor classification (p = 0.000), lymph node status (p = 0.000), clinical stage (p = 0.000), and Her-2 status (p = 0.045). High Hv1 expression was associated significantly with shorter overall (p = 0.000) and recurrence-free survival (p = 0.000). In vitro, knockdown of Hv1 expression in the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells decreased the cell proliferation and invasiveness, inhibited the cell proton secretion and intracellular pH recovery, and blocked the cell capacity of acidifying extracellular milieu. Furthermore, the gelatinase activity in MDA-MB-231 cells that suppressed Hv1 was reduced. In vivo, the breast tumor size of the implantation of the MDA-MB-231 xenografts in nude mice that were knocked down by Hv1 was dramatically smaller than that in the control groups. The results demonstrated that the inhibition of Hv1 function via knockdown of Hv1 expression can effectively retard the cancer growth and suppress the cancer metastasis by the decrease of proton extrusion and the down-regulation of gelatinase activity. Based on these results, we came to the conclusion that Hv1 is a potential biomarker for prognosis of breast cancer and a potential target for anticancer drugs in breast cancer therapy.
