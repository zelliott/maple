With the use of dual-color fluorescent cells and a highly sensitive whole-mouse imaging system with both macro-optics and micro-optics, we report here the development of subcellular real-time imaging of cancer cell trafficking in live mice. To observe cytoplasmic and nuclear dynamics in the living mouse, tumor cells were labeled in the nucleus with green fluorescent protein and with red fluorescent protein in the cytoplasm. Dual-color cancer cells were injected by a vascular route in an abdominal skin flap in nude mice. The mice were imaged with an Olympus OV100 whole-mouse imaging system with a sensitive CCD camera and five objective lenses, parcentered and parfocal, enabling imaging from macrocellular to subcellular. We observed the nuclear and cytoplasmic behavior of cancer cells in real time in blood vessels as they moved by various means or adhered to the vessel surface in the abdominal skin flap. During extravasation, real-time dual-color imaging showed that cytoplasmic processes of the cancer cells exited the vessels first, with nuclei following along the cytoplasmic projections. Both cytoplasm and nuclei underwent deformation during extravasation. Different cancer cell lines seemed to strongly vary in their ability to extravasate. With the dual-color cancer cells and the highly sensitive whole-mouse imaging system described here, the subcellular dynamics of cancer metastasis can now be observed in live mice in real time. This imaging technology will enable further understanding of the critical steps of metastasis and provide visible targets for antimetastasis drug development.
