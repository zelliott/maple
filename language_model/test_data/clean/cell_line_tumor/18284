A new diterpene, 16-hydroxy communic acid (1), along with thirty one known compounds including five norditerpenes (2-6), twenty two flavonoids containing four biflavonoids (7-10), nine monoflavonoids (11-19) and nine flavanoid glycosides (20-28), as well as four phenolic constituents (29-32) were isolated from the 95% ethanolic extract of Podocarpus fasciculus. The structure of 1 was elucidated using spectral methods. Of these isolates, nagilactone C (2) showed the most significant inhibitory effects against DLD cells (human colon carcinoma) (ED(50)=2.57 microg/ml) and compounds 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12 had moderate cytotoxic activity against human KB (human oral epithelium carcinoma), Hela (human cervical carcinoma), Hepa (human hepatoma), DLD (colon carcinoma), and A-549 (human lung carcinoma) tumor cell lines. Preliminary structure-activity relationship studies of the isolated diterpenoids and biflavonoids are discussed.
