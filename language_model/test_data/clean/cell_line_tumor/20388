Four kinds of symmetrically branched oligoglyceryl trimeric (BGL003)-paclitaxel conjugates and a corresponding heptameric (BGL007) conjugate were synthesized. Molecular weights of all the compounds were less than two times that of paclitaxel. The anti-tumor activity of the most water-soluble BGL003 conjugate was examined and found to be preserved in spite of the chemical modification that is displacement of the N3'-debenzoyl residue with the BGL003 succinyl residue.
