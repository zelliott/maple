To provide a possible targeted gene therapy scheme for prostate cancer, and explore the expression efficiency and tissue-specific expression of prostate specific antigen (PSA) promoter.

Three plasmids with egfp, pa-EGFP(including ARI, ARII), pba-EGFP (including ARI, ARII, ARIII) and pdeltaba-EGFP (including ARI, ARII and mutated ARIII) were designed, and the expression status was observed by transfecting into HepG2, SMMC-7721, Hela and PC-3.

In prostate cancer cell PC-3, pba-EGFP expressed more GFP than pa-EGFP and pdeltaba-EGFP, which showed that ARIII could notably increase the transcription efficiency of PSA promoter. Further, there was no GFP expression in HepG2, SMMC-7721 and Hela transfected with pa-EGFP, p deltaba-EGFP and pba-EGFP.

An expression vector based on elements of the PSA gene regulatory sequences has been developed and shown to be tightly regulated in a panel of cells from tissues of various origins. With the tissue-specific functional protein, it should provide a solid platform for clinical studies.
