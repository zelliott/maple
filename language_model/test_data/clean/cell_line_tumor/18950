The procoagulatory serine protease, thrombin, is known to induce invasion and metastasis in various cancers, but the mechanisms by which it promotes tumorigenesis are poorly understood. Because the 92-kDa gelatinase (MMP-9) is a known mediator of tumor cell invasion, we sought to determine whether and how thrombin regulates MMP-9. The thrombin receptor, PAR-1, and MMP-9 are expressed in osteosarcomas, as determined by immunohistochemistry. Stimulation of U2-OS osteosarcoma cells with thrombin and a thrombin receptor-activating peptide induced pro-MMP-9 secretion as well as cell surface-associated pro-MMP-9 expression and proteolytic activity. This was paralleled by an increase in MMP-9 mRNA and MMP-9 promoter activity. Thrombin-induced invasion of U2-OS cells through Matrigel was mediated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway and could be inhibited with an MMP-9 antibody. The stimulation of MMP-9 by thrombin was paralleled by an increase in beta1-integrin mRNA and beta1-integrin expression on the cell surface, which was also mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and was required for invasion. Thrombin activation induced and co-localized both beta1-integrin and pro-MMP-9 on the cell membrane, as evidenced by co-immunoprecipitation, confocal microscopy, and a protein binding assay. The thrombin-mediated association of these two proteins, as well as thrombin-mediated invasion of U2-OS cells, could be blocked with a cyclic peptide and with an antibody preventing binding of the MMP-9 hemopexin domain to beta1-integrin. These results suggest that thrombin induces expression and association of beta1-integrin with MMP-9 and that the cell surface localization of the protease by the integrin promotes tumor cell invasion.
