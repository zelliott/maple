This paper presents a novel microchip with nanoporous anodic alumina membrane for the study of anti-cancer drug effect of retinoic acid (RA) on human esophageal squamous epithelial KYSE30 cancer cells in vitro with impedance spectroscopy. The impedance experiments with 0.01 M retinoic acid (RA) were explored for the study of anti-cancer drug effects on KYSE30 cancer cells. The impedance was monitored in the time domain at 0.1 Hz. After addition of 0.01 M RA to the cell chip, the impedance magnitude decreased with time from the value with confluent cell layer and returned to the initial base line after around 12h. The fluorescence experiments testified that this impedance decrease was due to the cell morphology change induced by RA.
