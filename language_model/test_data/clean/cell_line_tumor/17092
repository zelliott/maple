In this study, the role of exogenous fatty acids in the regulation of proteolipid protein (PLP) gene expression was investigated using the following model culture system: C6 glioma cells expressing the green-fluorescent protein (eGFP) driven by different segments of PLP promoter. Eicosapentanoic acid (EPA; 20:5 n-3), but not arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4 n-6), induced a significant increase in medium fluorescence intensity (MFI) determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The induction of PLP promoter was time-dependent showing maximal activity between 24 and 48 h after EPA exposure. PLP promoter activation was dependent on fatty acid concentration, with maximum activation at 200 microM. Northern blot analysis confirmed the fluorescence data in C6 cells incubated with EPA. Furthermore, this treatment increased the adenylyl cyclase-cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation in C6 cells. PLP promoter activity was inhibited by pre-treatment with H89 (protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor), but not with PD98059 (MAPK inhibitor), suggesting that EPA stimulates the expression of PLP via cAMP-mediated pathways.
