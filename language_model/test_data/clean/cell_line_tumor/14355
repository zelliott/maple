Sialic acids containing glycoconjugates are very common in human neoplasias and their expression frequently correlates with malignant phenotype and the tumor grade. The majority of tumor markers containing sialic acids in man involve changes in the amount of total sialic acids and in the presence of the two main sialic acid types, Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc, and their derivatives. The aim of the present study was to examine whether malignant mesothelioma cell lines synthesize sialic acid containing glycoconjugates at both the extracellular and cell membrane levels and particularly whether the type and the content of Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc are of biological importance for mesothelioma cell differentiation and evaluation of its prognosis. The study was performed in three human malignant mesothelioma cell lines, two with a fibroblast like phenotype (STAV-FCS and Vester) and one of epithelial differentiation (STAV-AB), which developed from the pleural effusions of patients with malignant mesothelioma and in one human adenocarcinoma cell line (Wart). Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc were determined following a mild hydrolysis step and a sample clean-up procedure. The determination was performed by reversed-phase HPLC after the NeuAc and NeuGc had been converted to per-O-benzoylated derivatives. It was found that Neu5Gc is the major sialic acid in the culture media of all cell lines examined. Molar ratios of Neu5Ac to Neu5Gc showed that Neu5Gc is the predominant sialic acid in the culture medium of the fibroblast-like mesothelioma cells. Neu5Ac is almost undetectable in the cell membrane, whereas Neu5Gc is present in considerable amounts. The obtained results suggest that the type and the content of Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc in culture media are of biological importance for mesothelioma cell differentiation and may be of value in the evaluation of prognosis.
