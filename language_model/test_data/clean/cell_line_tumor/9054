The effects of prolactin (PRL) and N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)-glycine (MPG) on the growth of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, and the influence of MPG on PRL-induced MCF- 7 cell proliferation, when added simultaneously to the culture medium, were examined. Prolactin at concentrations of 200 ng/ml - 350 ng/ml enhanced the growth of MCF-7 cells, while at lower and higher concentrations its action was diminished. MPG alone at concentrations above 2 mM caused a decrease in cell proliferation. When PRL and MPG were added simultaneously to the culture medium, an inhibitory effect on PRL-induced MCF-7 cell proliferation was observed, at concentrations of MPG lower than 2 mM.
