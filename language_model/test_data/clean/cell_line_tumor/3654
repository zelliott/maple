Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS), a disorder of organelle biogenesis, affects lysosomes, melanosomes, and platelet dense bodies. Seven genes cause HPS in humans (HPS1-HPS7) and at least 15 nonallelic mutations cause HPS in mice. Where their function is known, the HPS proteins participate in protein trafficking and vesicle docking/fusion events during organelle biogenesis. HPS-associated genes participate in at least 4 distinct protein complexes: the adaptor complex AP-3; biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 (BLOC-1), consisting of 4 HPS proteins (pallidin, muted, cappuccino, HPS7/sandy); BLOC-2, consisting of HPS6/ruby-eye, HPS5/ruby-eye-2, and HPS3/cocoa; and BLOC-3, consisting of HPS1/pale ear and HPS4/light ear. Here, we report the cloning of the mouse HPS mutation reduced pigmentation (rp). We show that the wild-type rp gene encodes a novel, widely expressed 195-amino acid protein that shares 87% amino acid identity with its human orthologue and localizes to punctate cytoplasmic structures. Further, we show that phosphorylated RP is part of the BLOC-1 complex. In mutant rp/rp mice, a premature stop codon truncates the protein after 79 amino acids. Defects in all the 5 known components of BLOC-1, including RP, cause severe HPS in mice, suggesting that the subunits are nonredundant and that BLOC-1 plays a key role in organelle biogenesis.
