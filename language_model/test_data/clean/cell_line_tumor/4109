Series of 2-pyridineformamide thiosemicarbazones were synthesized. Their preferential cytotoxicity in nutrient deprived medium (NDM) was evaluated using PANC-1 human pancreatic cancer cells by employing an antiausterity strategy. 2-Pyridineformamide thiosemicarbazones induced apoptosis and exhibited preferential cytotoxic activity toward PANC-1 cells in NDM, with potencies in the submicromolar range. These compounds are potential candidates for the development of therapeutics against pancreatic cancer.
