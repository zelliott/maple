To observe the expression of the A melanoma antigen (MAGE), G melanoma antigen (GAGE) and B melanoma antigen (BAGE) genes in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines.

The MAGE-1,MAGE-3,GAGE1-8,GAGE1-2 and BAGE mRNA lever in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines SMMC-7721, QQY-7701, BEL-7402 were studied by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and were compared with biopsied liver tissues.

MAGE-1 and BAGE mRNA were expressed in SMMC-7721, MAGE-3 and BAGE in QGY-7701, MAGE-1 and GAGE1-2 in BEL-7402. None of these genes was expressed in biopsied liver tissues.

MAGE-1, MAGE-3, GAGE1-8, GAGE1-2 and BAGE were expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, respectively. These tumor-specific antigens can be used as molecular markers and possible targets of immunotherapy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
