Cystine disulfide bond is a common feature in numerous biologically active peptides and proteins and accordingly its replacement by various surrogates presents a potential route to obtain analogs with improved pharmacokinetic characteristics. The purpose of the present study was to assess whether an azo-bridge can serve as such a surrogate. In view of the marked clinical significance of somatostatin and the brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) we choose these peptides as a model. Three cyclic-azo somatostatin analogs and three cyclic-azo BNP analogs were effectively prepared in solution through azo bond formation between p-amino phenylalanine and His or Tyr residues that were positioned in the peptide sequences in place of the native Cys residues. The peptides binding affinities to the sst₂ and ANP-receptor (NPR-A) expressed on rat acinar pancreating carcinoma AR4-2J cell membranes and HeLa cells, respectively, were examined. The somatostatin analogs displayed good to moderate affinities to the rat sst₂ in the nM range with best results obtained with peptide 2, that is, IC₅₀ = 8.1 nM. Molecular dynamics simulations on these peptides suggests on a correlation between the observed binding potencies and the degree of conformational space overlapping with that of somatostatin. The BNP analogs exhibited binding affinities to the NPR-A in the nM range with best results obtained with BNP-1, that is, IC₅₀ = 60 nM.
