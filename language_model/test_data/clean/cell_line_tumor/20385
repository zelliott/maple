We have identified a new class of triarylmethyl amine compounds that can inhibit apolipoprotein E (apoE) production. ApoE is a cholesterol- and lipid-carrier protein implicated in aging, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and other neurological and lipid-related disorders. Attenuation of apoE production is generally considered to be of therapeutic value. A majority of the apoE in the brain is produced by astrocytes. Here, we describe the design, synthesis, and biological screening of a small library of compounds that led to the identification of four triarylmethyl amines as potent inhibitors of apoE production in CCF-STTG1 astrocytoma cells.
