The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of recombinant human leptin (rhLep) on the proliferation of human gastric cancer MGC-803 cells and its underlying mechanisms. RT-PCR was performed to identify the expression of leptin receptor (Ob-R). Cell proliferation was measured with MTT assay. DNA content and cell cycle were analyzed by flow cytometry. Apoptosis was assessed by DNA ladder assay and flow cytometry analysis using Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining. Underlying mechanisms of rhLep-induced apoptosis were evaluated by the activities of caspase-3, -8, -9, and cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Moreover, the phosphorylation of STAT3 in MGC-803 cells upon rhLep administration was detected by Western blot analysis. Our results demonstrated that two leptin receptors (Ob-Ra and Ob-Rb) were expressed in MGC-803 cells. rhLep diminished the proliferation rate of MGC-803 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and induced MGC-803 cell apoptosis involving in the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 but not caspase-9. In addition, rhLep failed to induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria and had no effect on the activation of STAT3 in MGC-803 cells. Therefore, from these results, we concluded that rhLep significantly inhibited cell proliferation via G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis through the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in human gastric cancer MGC-803 cells.
