In this study we investigated the effect of the Enhanced Data rate for GSM Evolution (EDGE) signal on cells of three human brain cell lines, SH-SY5Y, U87 and CHME5, used as models of neurons, astrocytes and microglia, respectively, as well as on primary cortical neuron cultures. SXC-1800 waveguides (IT'IS-Foundation, ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland) were modified for in vitro exposure to the EDGE signal radiofrequency (RF) radiation at 1800 MHz. Four exposure conditions were tested: 2 and 10 W/kg for 1 and 24 h. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured by flow cytometry using the dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) probe at the end of the 24-h exposure or 24 h after the 1-h exposure. Rotenone treatment was used as a positive control. All cells tested responded to rotenone treatment by increasing ROS production. These findings indicate that exposure to the EDGE signal does not induce oxidative stress under these test conditions, including 10 W/kg. Our results are in agreement with earlier findings that RF radiation alone does not increase ROS production.
