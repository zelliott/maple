Chemical and physical stimuli trigger a cutaneous response by first inducing the main epidermal cells, keratinocytes, to produce specific mediators that are responsible for the initiation of skin inflammation. Activation modulates cell communication, namely leucocyte recruitment and blood-to-skin extravasation through the selective barrier of the vascular ECs (endothelial cells). In the present study, we describe an in vitro model which takes into account the various steps of human skin inflammation, from keratinocyte activation to the adhesion of leucocytes to dermal capillary ECs. Human adult keratinocytes were subjected to stress by exposure to UV irradiation or neuropeptides, then the conditioned culture medium was used to mimic the natural micro-environmental conditions for dermal ECs. A relevant in vitro model must include appropriate cells from the skin. This is shown in the present study by the selective reaction of dermal ECs compared with EC lines from distinct origins, in terms of leucocyte recruitment, sensitivity to stress and nature of the stress-induced secreted mediators. This simplified model is suitable for the screening of anti-inflammatory molecules whose activity requires the presence of various skin cells.
