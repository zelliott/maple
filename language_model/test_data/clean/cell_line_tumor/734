To investigate the effect of antisense RNA against vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (VEGF165) on human esophagus squamous cell carcinoma cell line EC109.

Eukaryotic expression vector for VEGF165 antisense RNA was constructed and identified. Recombinant plasmid was transfected into EC109 cells and the transfected EC109 cells were inoculated subcutaneously to nude mice. The biological characteristics and tumorigenicity of transfected EC109 cells were observed by in situ hybridization, laser confocal microscope, transmission electron microscopy and flow cytometry.

The eukaryotic expression vector pCEP-AVEGF165 was successfully constructed and expressed in transfected EC109 cells. The rate of VEGF165 expression dropped by 75% in transfected cells. The morphology and cell cycle of transfected EC109 cells were not affected by the antisense RNA, but the tumorigenicity and angiogenesis of transfected EC109 cells were greatly reduced in nude mice. The volume of tumors in pCEP-AVEGF165 transfected group, empty vector transfected group and control group were (820+/-112.5) mm3, (7 930+/-1 035) mm3 and (7 850+/-950) mm3, respectively. The microvessel density of the three groups were (8.5+/-1.2)/mm2, (44.3+/-9.4)/mm2 and (46.4+/-12.6)/mm2, respectively.

The angiogenesis and tumorigenicity of human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were effectively inhibited by VEGF165 antisense RNA, which may be applied to treat solid tumor in the future.
