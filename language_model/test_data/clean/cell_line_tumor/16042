Antimalarial drug artesunate inhibits cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication in human fibroblasts. Astrocytes, the major cell type of the brain, support cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication. The aim of the study was to assess the antiviral activity of artesunate in astrocytoma cell line U373MG in comparison with ganciclovir. The antiviral concentration inhibiting by 50% (IC(50)) the synthesis of viral DNA was measured by real-time PCR in parallel in U373MG and MRC-5 cells. Reference HCMV strains susceptible and resistant to ganciclovir, and clinical isolates were tested. Ganciclovir and artesunate had similar activity in U373MG cells and MRC-5 fibroblasts. The artesunate IC(50)s in U373MG cells (1.5-2.25 Î¼M) were at least 36-fold lower than the 50% cytotoxicity concentrations. Then, the anti-HCMV activity of artesunate was demonstrated in a cancer cell line.
