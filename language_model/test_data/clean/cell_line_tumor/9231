Assessment of foreign chemical inducibility on CYP3A4 is necessary to optimize drug therapies. The properties of chemicals such as pesticides, however, are not well investigated. In the present study, properties of various pesticides on human CYP3A4 induction have been tested using HepG2-derived cells stably expressing the CYP3A4 promoter/enhancer (3-1-10 cells) and the human pregnane X receptor (hPXR)-small interfering RNA (siRNA) system. Among the examined pesticides, 13 pesticides were observed to activate the CYP3A4 gene. Surprisingly, pyributicarb was found to increase the CYP3A4 reporter activity at 0.1 to 1 microM more strongly than typical CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin. Expression of hPXR-siRNA clearly diminished the pyributicarb-stimulated CYP3A4 reporter activity in 3-1-10 cells and decreased the endogenous CYP3A4 mRNA levels in HepG2 cells. Pyributicarb caused enhancement of CYP3A4-derived reporter activity in mouse livers introduced with hPXR by adenovirus. These results indicate pyributicarb as a potent activator of CYP3A4 gene, suggesting the existence of pesticides leading to CYP3A4 induction in our environment.
