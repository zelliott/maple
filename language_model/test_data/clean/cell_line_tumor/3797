Certain amide-containing anthraquinone, xanthone, and carbazole derivatives have been synthesized and evaluated in vitro for their antiproliferative activities against a panel of human cancer cell lines including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC-TW01), lung carcinoma (NCI-H661), and leukemia (Jurkat). Among them, 2-(9,10-dioxo-9,10-dihydroanthracen-2-yloxy)-N-(naphthalen-2-yl)acetamide (13) was the most active against NPC-TW01 with an IC50 value of 2.62 µM while its xanthone and dibenzofuran counterparts, 14 and 15, were inactive with an IC50 value of 16.10 and 11.09 µM, respectively. Studies on NPC-TW01 cell cycle distribution revealed that compound 13 inhibited proliferation of NPC-TW01 by the alteration of cell division and the accumulation of cells in G0/G1 phase.
