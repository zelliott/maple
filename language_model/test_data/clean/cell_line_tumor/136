Surgical treatment following breast cancer, i.e. lumpectomy and mastectomy, may not efficiently remove all cancerous cells. As such, when mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are incorporated into the breast reconstruction process, it is likely that those MSCs will encounter remnant cancerous cells after transplantation into the defect site. The potential interaction between breast cancer cells and MSCs remains unclear. We hypothesized that paracrine interactions might occur between cells and various proteinases, growth factors and other cytokine molecules in the local microenvironment. Conditioned media (CM) from two mouse mammary cancer cell lines (4T1 and 4T07) and one mouse mammary epithelial cell line (NMuMG) were studied in the experimental model. Post-confluent mouse MSCs (D1 cells) were differentiated with an adipogenic hormonal cocktail. Conditioned media from the three cell types did not have an inhibitory effect on D1 cell viability; however, triglyceride (TG) and Oil red O (ORO) analysis results showed that 4T1-CM significantly inhibited D1 adipocyte differentiation and reduced lipid vesicle accumulation in the differentiating D1 cells. Preliminary analysis of the conditioned media revealed that a higher presence of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) was present in the 4T1-CM as compared to the levels found in 4T07-CM and NMuMG-CM, which were below the detection limit. Additionally, the conditioned medium of differentiated D1 cells on day 12 had a negative effect on 4T1 and 4T07 cell viability but no effect on NMuMG cell viability. The results suggest that mouse breast cancer cells modulate mouse MSC adipogenic differentiation, the level of modulation specific to the metastatic level.
