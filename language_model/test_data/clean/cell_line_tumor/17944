In order to find new indolin-2-one derivatives as antitumor agents, a series of 3-pyrrole substituted 1-(5-formyl-2-furanylmethyl) indolin-2-one derivatives were designed and synthesized. 5-Formyl-2 ,4-dimethyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester was condensed with 5-substituted indolin-2-one 2a-2d to afford 3-[(pyrrol-2-yl) -methylidenyl] indolin-2-ones 3a-3d. Through N-alkylation, 1-(5-formyl-furfuryl) -indolin-2-one 4a-4d were prepared. Compounds 4a-4d were then condensed with indolin-2-one to afford bis-indolin-2-one derivatives 5a-5d. The structures of the synthesized compounds were determined by 1H NMR, MS and element analysis. Antitumor activities of all the synthesized compounds in vitro were tested. All the 12 synthesized compounds possess antitumor activities against SPC-A1 strain. Especially the compounds 5a-5d possess potent antitumor activities better than sunitinib. Their IC50 are all below 5 micromol x L(-1).
