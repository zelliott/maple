A novel series of diaryl thiourea containing sorafenib derivatives 9a-t was designed and synthesized. The structures of all the newly synthesized compounds were determined by (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and HRMS. Their antiproliferative activities against HCT116 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, and their inhibitory activities against the phosphorylation of VEGFR were evaluated and described. Some of the compounds showed significant activities against both cell lines and VEGFR. Compounds 9g, 9m, 9o and 9p demonstrated competitive antiproliferative activities to sorafenib, the reference standard, while compounds 9d, 9m, and 9p showed significant inhibitory activities against the phosphorylation of VEGFR.
