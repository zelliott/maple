The overexpression of prosurvival members of the Bcl-2 family is commonly associated with the enhanced malignancy of hematological tumors. There has been great interest in a novel set of agents that are able to mimic the function of the BH3 domain by binding to the groove of Bcl-2-like proteins and initiating the cell death sequence. We sought to examine the efficacy of BH3 mimetics in a spontaneous mouse model of B-cell neoplasia. We evaluated the ability of the BH3 mimetics to preferentially target tumor cells while sparing normal cells. In addition, we examined the contributions of Bim and Puma to the sensitivity of tumor cells to the BH3 mimetics. We report here that two BH3 mimetics (HA-14-1 and BH3-I-2') were able to induce apoptosis of murine B-cell lymphoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Tumors that arose from transplantation of primary lymphoma cells regressed following 7 days of treatment with BH3-mimetic drugs. The long-term benefits of the transient treatment of tumor-bearing mice with the BH3 mimetics, however, could not be properly evaluated, due to the high levels of toxicity we observed in vivo with these drugs. Decreased expression of either Bim or Puma from B-cell tumor cells was able to protect these cells from the apoptosis induced by these BH3 mimetics, suggesting that they function through other means. We conclude that while the BH3-mimetic drugs are effective at inducing cell death of lymphoma cells in vitro and in vivo, their unclear molecular specificity and their ability to kill normal cells may limit their therapeutic uses in humans.
