In situ estrogen production by aromatase conversion from androgens plays an important role in breast tumor promotion. Here, we show that 17beta-estradiol (E2) can rapidly enhance aromatase enzymatic activity through an increase of aromatase protein phosphorylation in breast cancer cell lines. In vivo labeling experiments and site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrated that phosphorylation of the 361-tyrosine residue is crucial in the up-regulation of aromatase activity under E2 exposure. Our results demonstrated a direct involvement of nonreceptor tyrosine-kinase c-Src in E2-stimulated aromatase activity because inhibition of its signaling abrogated the up-regulatory effects induced by E2 on aromatase activity as well as phosphorylation of aromatase protein. In addition, from our data it emerges that aromatase is a target of cross talk between growth factor receptors and estrogen receptor alpha signaling. These findings show, for the first time, that tyrosine phosphorylation processes play a key role in the rapid changes induced by E2 in aromatase enzymatic activity, revealing the existence of a short nongenomic autocrine loop between E2 and aromatase in breast cancer cells.
