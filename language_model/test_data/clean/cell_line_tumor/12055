We have previously shown that the recombinant human fibronectin (FN) fragment composed of central cell binding domains (CCBD) spanning the ninth and tenth type III domains promotes cell adhesion and proliferation of osteoblasts. In the present study, we investigated the biological potency of heparin-binding domain (HBD) of FN spanning the twelfth and fourteenth type III domains. The HBD of FN significantly enhances the RGD-containing CCBD-mediated cell adhesion and proliferation in HOS cells (P < 0.05).
