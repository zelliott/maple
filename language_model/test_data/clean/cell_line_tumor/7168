To investigate the effect of ginsenoside Rg1 on the influence of neprilysin expression induced by LPS in BT325 cell line.

MTT was used to measure the levels of the survival rate of BT325 cultured with ginsenoside Rg1 and LPS in different concentrations. The expression of NEP was measured by RT-PCR.

The survival rate of BT325 was obviously inhibited by LPS, and the expression of NEP was decreased. The survival rate of BT325 was obviously raised by ginsenoside Rg1, and the expression of NEP was increased.

LPS can cause cell damage, and decrease the expression of NEP. Ginsenoside Rg1 can exert neuroprotective properties which protects BT325 cell line from the cell toxicity of LPS.
