The N-(2-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-4-yl)anthranilic acid 6 and a series of its ester and amide derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxic activity against human cancer cells. Ester derivatives 13 and 18 exhibited potent growth inhibitory activity with GI(50) values at nanomolar concentrations. Among amide derivatives, N-anthraniloylglycinate 19 shown moderate inhibitory activity in the full panel cancer cell line screening.
