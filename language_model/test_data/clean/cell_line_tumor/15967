Tissue factor (TF) is a molecular marker that is up-regulated in cancer cells and aids tumoral dissemination. Our purpose was to develop a nested RT-PCR strategy against TF for detecting blood-borne tumour cells. Our method detected TF expression in a minimum of 1.5 pg total RNA from MCF7 cells. A preliminary study in blood samples from 16 advanced breast carcinoma patients showed that 80% of patients with high TF load progressed and died, while only 18% with low TF load showed the same behaviour. Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed worse overall survival in patients with high TF load.
