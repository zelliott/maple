Paired related homoeobox 1 (PRRX1) has been identified as a new epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) inducer in breast cancer. However, the function of PRRX1 in colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been elucidated.

We utilised ectopic PRRX1-expressing cell lines to analyse the function of PRRX1 in CRC. The clinical significance of PRRX1 was also examined on three independent CRC case sets.

PRRX1 induced EMT and the stem-like phenotype in CRC cells. In contrast to studies of breast cancer, abundant expression of PRRX1 was significantly associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in CRC.

PRRX1 is an indicator of metastasis and poor prognosis in CRC cases. Further investigation is required to uncover the signalling network regulating PRRX1.
