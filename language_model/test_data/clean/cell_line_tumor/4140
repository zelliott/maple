Four new oleanane-type triterpene glycosides were isolated from the methanol extract of the roots of Paronychia anatolica subsp. balansae along with three known oleanane-type triterpene glycosides. Structures of the new compounds were established as 3-O-β-D-glucuronopyranosyl-28-O-[α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)-β-D-quinovopyranoside] zahnic acid, 3-O-β-D-glucuronopyranosyl-28-O-[β-D-xylopyranosyl-(1→4)-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)-β-D-quinovopyranoside] zahnic acid, 3-O-β-D-glucuronopyranosyl-28-O-[α-L-arabinofuranosyl-(1→2)-β-D-quinovopyranoside] zahnic acid, 28-O-[α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→4)-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→6)-β-D-glucopyranosyl]-medicagenic acid, by using 1D and 2D-NMR techniques and mass spectrometry. The cytotoxic activity of the isolated compounds was evaluated against a small panel of cancer cell lines including human breast cancer (MCF-7), human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) and human leukemia (U937) cell lines.
