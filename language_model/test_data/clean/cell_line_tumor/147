To investigate the relationship of the metastasis-associated genes and its copy numbers variation in the highly metastatic human epithelial ovarian cancer cell line HO-8910PM.

The differentially expressed genes and its copy number variation between HO-8910PM cell line and normal ovarian tissues was detected by human genome U133A 2.0 gene chip and human mapping 10K array 2.0 gene chip, and the data was analyzed by bioinformatics. Some of metastasis-associated genes were validated the results of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and cDNA chips by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and real-time quantitative PCR.

Integrate analysis of two gene chips data showed that there were 385 differentially expressed genes in the same and 379 SNP positional point (6 of them, included 2 genes) between HO-8910PM cell line and normal ovarian tissues, these copy number amplification of 379 SNP positional point of chromosome were > or = 3, which had 240, deletion < or = 1 had 139. Chromosome location analysis showed that there were 385 differentially expressed genes located at all chromosomes, and 261 of them (67.8%, 261/385) located at 10 chromosomes, included that 34 (8.8%), 33 (8.6%), 28 (7.3%), 27 (7.0%), 25 (6.5%), 24 (6.2%) of them located at chromosome 3, 2, 9, 10, 1 and 11 respectively, and 23 (6.0%) of them at chromosome 6 and 12 each, 22 (5.7%) of them at chromosome 4 and 5 each. For the function of differentially expressed genes, the results showed that 99 (25.7%) genes belonged to the family of enzymes and their regulators, 54 (14.0%) genes associated with signal transduction, 50 (13.0%) genes associated with nucleic acid binding, and 36 (9.4%) genes associated with protein binding.

We have demonstrated that there are 4 kinds of differentially expressed genes related to metastasis of ovarian cancer, which belonged to the families enzyme and its regulator, nucleic acid binding, signal transduction and protein binding, and located at chromosome 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11 and 12.
