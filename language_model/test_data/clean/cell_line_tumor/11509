Procaspase-8, the zymogen form of the apoptosis-initiator caspase-8, undergoes phosphorylation following integrin-mediated cell attachment to an extracellular matrix substrate. Concordant with cell attachment to fibronectin, a population of procaspase-8 becomes associated with a peripheral insoluble compartment that includes focal complexes and lamellar microfilaments. Phosphorylation of procaspase-8 both impairs its maturation to the proapoptotic form and can promote cell migration. Here we show that the cytoskeletal adaptor protein CrkL promotes caspase-8 recruitment to the peripheral spreading edge of cells, and that the catalytic domain of caspase-8 directly interacts with the SH2 domain of CrkL. We show that the interaction is abolished by shRNA-mediated silencing of Src, in Src-deficient MEFs, and by pharmacologic inhibitors of the kinase. The results provide insight into how tyrosine kinases may act to coordinate the suppression caspase-8 mediated apoptosis, while promoting cell invasion.
