The purposes of this study were to investigate the effects of the SASH1 gene on the growth, proliferation, apoptosis, invasiveness, and metastatic potential of lung cancer cells and explore the potential use of SASH1 for the treatment of human lung cancer. The SASH1 gene was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 eukaryotic expression vector, and SASH1 shRNA were designed and constructed. The resulting constructs were transfected into A549 human lung cancer cells, and the changes in the relevant biological characteristics of the cells overexpressing SASH1 and cells with downregulated expression of SASH1 were analyzed using the MTT assay, transwell invasion assay, and flow cytometry. The effects of the SASH1 gene on the expression of cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and MMP-2/9 were also concurrently examined. In the A549 cells from the pcDNA3.1-SASH1 transfected group, cell viability, proliferation, and migration were significantly reduced compared to the control cells (p = 0.039, p = 0.013), and a cell cycle arrest in G1 was observed. The A549 cells transfected with the SASH1 shRNA demonstrated significantly higher cell viabilities, proliferation, and migration compared to the control cells (p = 0.012, p = 0.045). Additionally, the percentage of A549 cells undergoing apoptosis was significantly higher in the pcDNA3.1-SASH1 transfected cells and significantly lower in the SASH1 shRNA transfected cells compared to the control cells (p = 0.010, p = 0.000). The cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and MMP-9/2 protein expression levels were significantly lower in the pcDNA3.1-SASH1-transfected cells and were significantly higher in the SASH1 shRNA-transfected cells than that in the control cells. The SASH1 gene may inhibit A549 cell growth and proliferation as well as promote cellular apoptosis. The overexpression of the SASH1 gene may also be related to the decreased migration of A549 human lung cancer cells.
