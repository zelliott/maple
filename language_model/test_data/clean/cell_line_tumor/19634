The efficiency of photodynamic effect (PDE) for Photofrin II (PfII), Verteporfin, and Merocyanine 540 (MC540) was compared against neoplastic cells. Triplet state lifetimes and singlet molecular oxygen quantum yields were correlated with biological effect. PfII triplet lifetime was two times longer than that of Verteporfin, however, its singlet molecular oxygen quantum yield was two times lower in comparison with Verteporfin. High singlet molecular oxygen quantum yield of Verteporfin resulted in high biological efficacy. To achieve 50% mortality of cells four times lower light dose and five times lower concentration of Verteporfin were applied in comparison with PfII. The same level of cell damage was reached using 10 times higher light dose and two times higher concentration of MC540 in comparison with PfII. Our results confirm that singlet molecular oxygen based mechanism, prevalent for Verteporfin and PfII, was highly effective against melanoma cells. Verteporfin can be used at small doses with high cellular damage efficiency.
