The selective delivery of bioactive agents to tumors reduces toxicity and enhances the efficacy of anticancer therapies. In this study, we show that the antibody F8, which recognizes perivascular and stromal EDA-fibronectin (EDA-Fn), when conjugated to interleukin-2 (F8-IL2) can effectively inhibit the growth of EDA-Fn-expressing melanomas in combination with paclitaxel. We obtained curative effects with paclitaxel administered before the immunocytokine. Coadministration of paclitaxel increased the uptake of F8 in xenografted melanomas, enhancing tumor perfusion and permeability. Paclitaxel also boosted the recruitment of F8-IL2-induced natural killer (NK) cells to the tumor, suggesting a host response as part of the observed therapeutic benefit. In support of this likelihood, NK cell depletion impaired the antitumor effect of paclitaxel plus F8-IL2. Importantly, this combination reduced both the tumor burden and the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules. The combination did not cause cumulative toxicity. Together, our findings offer a preclinical proof that by acting on the tumor stroma paclitaxel potentiates the antitumor activity elicited by a targeted delivery of IL2, thereby supporting the use of immunochemotherapy in the treatment of metastatic melanoma.
