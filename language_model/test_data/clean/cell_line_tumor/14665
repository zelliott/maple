Stroke is one of the major medical burdens in industrialized countries. Animal experiments indicate that blockade of the angiotensin AT1 receptor (AT1R) improves neurological outcome after cerebral ischemia. These protective effects are partially mediated by the angiotensin AT2 receptor (AT2R). The transcription factor promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) was identified as a direct adapter protein of the AT2R. Furthermore, our group was able to demonstrate that PLZF also directly binds and mediates the effects of the human (pro)renin receptor [(P)RR] which is involved in brain development. Therefore, we hypothesized that PLZF is involved in neuroprotection. Here we show that PLZF and its receptors (P)RR and AT2R exhibited an ubiquitous expression pattern in different brain regions. Furthermore, stable PLZF overexpression in human neuronal cells was able to mediate neuroprotection in a glutamate toxicity model in vitro. Consistently, PLZF mRNA and protein were downregulated on the ipsilateral side in a stroke model in vivo, whereas the neurodetrimental PLZF target genes cyclin A2 and BID were upregulated under this condition. Further analyses indicated that the neuroprotective AT2R is upregulated upon stable PLZF overexpression in cultured neuronal cells. Finally, reporter gene assays demonstrated the functionality of (P)RR promoter polymorphisms regarding basal and PLZF-induced activity.
