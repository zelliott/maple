Sulindac analogs represent one of the most efficacious groups of NSAIDs             reducing the risk of colon cancer. Recent studies have shown that sulindac sulfide,             a sulindac analog effective at lower doses compared to its parent compound, triggers             the death receptor (DR)5-dependent extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Induction of apoptosis             via activation of the DR-mediated pathway would be an ideal therapeutic strategy             to eliminate cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the possibility that             colon cancer cells are sensitized to sulindac sulfide-induced apoptosis by docosahexaenoic             acid (DHA), via activation of the DR/extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Our data demonstrated             that DHA combination sensitized colon cancer cells to sulindac sulfide-induced             apoptosis, leading to enhanced growth suppression of human colon cancer xenografts.             The combination effect was primarily attributed to increased cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)             polymerase (PARP) and caspase-8 activation. Moreover, pretreatment with z-IETD-FMK             (caspase-8 inhibitor) or stable expression of dominant negative caspase-8 genes             blocked DHA/sulindac sulfide cotreatment-induced apoptosis. In view of the finding             that DR5 silencing abrogated the combination-stimulated apoptosis, we propose             that apoptotic synergy induced by sulindac sulfide plus DHA is mediated via DR5.             Our findings collectively support the utility of a combination of sulindac sulfide             and DHA in the effective prevention and treatment of colon cancer.
