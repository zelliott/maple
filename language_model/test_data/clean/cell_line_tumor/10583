MYEOV and NEGR1 are novel candidate gene targets in neuroblastoma that were identified by chromosomal gain in 11q13 and loss in 1p31, respectively, through single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis. In the present study, to assess the involvement of MYEOV and NEGR1 in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma, we analyzed their mutation status and/or expression profiles in a panel of 55 neuroblastoma samples, including 25 cell lines, followed by additional functional studies. No tumor-specific mutations of MYEOV or NEGR1 were identified in our case series. Expression of MYEOV was upregulated in 11 of 25 cell lines (44%) and in seven of 20 fresh tumors (35%). The siRNA-mediated knockdown of MYEOV in NB-19 cells, which exhibit high expression of MYEOV, resulted in a significant decrease in cell proliferation (P = 0.0027). Conversely, expression studies of NEGR1 revealed significantly lower expression of this gene in neuroblastomas at an advanced stage of the disease. Exogenous NEGR1 expression in neuroblastoma cells induced significant inhibition of cell growth (P = 0.019). The results of these studies provide supporting evidence for MYEOV and NEGR1 as gene targets of 11q13 gains and 1p31 deletions in a neuroblastoma subset. In addition, the findings suggest a possible prognostic value for NEGR1 in neuroblastoma.
