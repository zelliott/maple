Radiotherapy is an effective treatment for head and neck, skin, anogenital, and breast cancers. However, radiation-induced skin morbidity limits the therapeutic benefits. A low-toxicity approach to selectively reduce skin morbidity without compromising tumor killing by radiotherapy is needed. We found that the antitumor agents known as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (phenylbutyrate, trichostatin A, and valproic acid) could suppress cutaneous radiation syndrome. The effects of HDAC inhibitors in promoting the healing of wounds caused by radiation and in decreasing later skin fibrosis and tumorigenesis were correlated with suppression of the aberrant expression of radiation-induced transforming growth factor beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Our findings implicate that the inhibition of HDAC may provide a novel strategy to increase the therapeutic gain in cancer radiotherapy by not only inhibiting tumor growth but also protecting normal tissues.
