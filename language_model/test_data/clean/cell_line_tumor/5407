The targeting of a glycosylated antibody Fc fragment to bind to cancer cells by site-selective incorporation of a synthetic ligand is described. Homogeneously glycosylated immunoglobulin G subclass 1 fragment crystallizable (IgG1 Fc) was produced by expression in a glycosylation-deficient yeast strain and subsequent treatment with mannosidase IA. A N-terminal cysteine was generated on the expressed IgG1 Fc by utilizing proteolytic processing enzymes in the yeast secretory pathway. A cyclic RGD peptide thioester 2 was synthesized and then site-selectively attached to the N-terminus of the IgG1 Fc glycoprotein using native chemical ligation. The resulting chemically modified antibody fragment, RGD-Man(5)-IgG1 Fc (5), retained biological activity similar to that of the free cyclic RGD peptide 1 when assayed for its ability to both promote and inhibit the adhesion of alpha(v)beta(3) integrin receptor-expressing WM-115 melanoma cells. In addition, fluorescent microscopy experiments were conducted using FITC-labeled 5 and confirmed binding of 5 to WM-115 melanoma cells. Site-selectively modified antibody fragments such as the one described here may be used to combine the beneficial properties of synthetic receptor ligands with antibody fragments to develop useful biochemical tools and improved therapeutics. The methods described here can also be used to produce glycoprotein fragments for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of homogeneous glycoproteins.
