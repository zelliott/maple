Novel liposomes composed of L-Î±-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and trehalose surfactant (DMTre) were produced and inhibitory effects of DMTre on the growth of human colon carcinoma (HCT116) and gastric carcinoma (MKN45) in vitro were examined. The remarkably high inhibitory effects of DMTre on the growth of HCT116 and MKN45 cells were obtained without affecting the growth of normal cells. The thickness of fixed aqueous layer of DMTre was larger than that of DMPC liposomes and increased in a dose-dependent manner. The induction of apoptosis by DMTre was revealed on the basis of flow cytometric analysis. DMTre induced apoptosis through the activation of caspases and mitochondria via Bax. It is noteworthy that remarkable inhibitory effects of DMTre on the growth of human colon and gastric carcinoma cells leading to apoptosis were obtained for the first time.
