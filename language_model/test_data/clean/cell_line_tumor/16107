Human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) is a beta-herpesvirus. HHV-6 infects and replicates in T cells. The HHV-6-encoded major immediate early gene (MIE) is expressed at the immediate-early infection phase. Human cytomegalovirus major immediate early promoter (CMV MIEp) is commercially available for the expression of various heterologous genes. Here we identified the HHV-6 MIE promoter (MIEp) and compared its activity with that of CMV MIEp in various cell lines.

The HHV-6 MIEp and some HHV-6 MIEp variants were amplified by PCR from HHV-6B strain HST. These fragments and CMV MIEp were subcloned into the pGL-3 luciferase reporter plasmid and subjected to luciferase reporter assay. In addition, to investigate whether the HHV-6 MIEp could be used as the promoter for expression of foreign genes in a recombinant varicella-zoster virus, we inserted HHV-6 MIEp-DsRed expression casette into the varicella-zoster virus genome.

HHV-6 MIEp showed strong activity in T cells compared with CMV MIEp, and the presence of intron 1 of the MIE gene increased its activity. The NF-ÎºB-binding site, which lies within the R3 repeat, was critical for this activity. Moreover, the HHV-6 MIEp drove heterologous gene expression in recombinant varicella-zoster virus-infected cells.

These data suggest that HHV-6 MIEp functions more strongly than CMV MIEp in various T-cell lines.
