Sodium meta-arsenite (NaAsO2), a novel compound synthesized by Komipham International Co. Ltd, is an orally bioavailable, water-soluble trivalent arsenical that has shown potent cytotoxic activity in human solid cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, and is currently undergoing phase I/II clinical trials for the treatment of prostate cancer. In this study, mechanisms of cell death induced by sodium meta-arsenite were investigated. Sodium meta-arsenite reduced cell viability and increased the sub-G1 population in cell cycle analysis in both androgen-sensitive LNCaP and androgen-insensitive CWR22RV1 cells. The apoptosis induced by sodium meta-arsenite was associated with cleavage of caspases 3, 8, and 9, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and increased annexin V-positive cells, and was inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. Sodium meta-arsenite also increased the level of the autophagy marker microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-II and the number of autophagic vacuoles as shown by electron microscopy. Both the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine and the necrosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 blocked cell death induced by sodium meta-arsenite. Moreover, sodium meta-arsenite led to the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger, decreased sodium meta-arsenite-induced levels of cleaved PARP and LC3-II. Propidium iodide (PI) staining also showed that NAC restored membrane integrity, damaged by sodium meta-arsenite. Therefore, these results suggest that sodium meta-arsenite induces apoptotic, necrotic, and autophagic cell death through intracellular ROS accumulation in both androgen-sensitive and androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells and may be used as a new anticancer drug for the treatment of prostate cancer.
