In human neuroblastoma cell lines (LAN5, SHEP and IMR32), mycophenolic acid (MPA) at concentrations (10(-7)-10(-6) M) readily attainable during immunosuppressive therapy with mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept), induces guanine nucleotide depletion leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through a p53 mediated pathway (up-regulation of p53, p21 and bax and down-regulation of bcl-2 and survivin). MPA-induced apoptosis is also associated to a marked decrease of p27 protein. In the same cell lines MPA, at lower concentrations (50 nM), corresponding to the plasma levels of the active free drug during Cellcept therapy, induces differentiation toward the neuronal phenotype by causing a partial chronic guanine nucleotide depletion. MPA-induced differentiation is not associated to p27 accumulation as occurs using retinoic acid. At a fixed concentration of MPA a higher percentage of apoptotic or differentiated cells is obtained when non dialysed serum substitutes for the dialysed one, due to the higher hypoxanthine concentration in the former (about 10 microM) leading to competition on HPRT-mediated salvage of guanine. At hypoxanthine or oxypurinol concentrations higher than 1 microM (up to 100 microM) no further enhancement of MPA effects was obtained, in agreement with the recently described safety of the allopurinol-mycophenolate mofetil combination in the treatment of hyperuricemia of kidney transplant recipients. The apoptotic effects of MPA do not appear to be significantly increased by the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase inhibitor niflumic acid.
