Estrogen blocks apoptosis of human ectocervical epithelial cells by modulating P2X7/Ca2+ influx. The effect involves decreased Ca2+-influx and cytosolic-calcium-increase via ATP-activated P2X7 pores. This mechanism may have physiological significance in the human cervix, in-vivo, and the results suggest a physiological role for estrogen in the cervix as an anti-apoptotic factor.
