Bisphosphonates are used in cancer-related hypercalcaemia, in complications of bone metastasis and in postmenopausal osteoporosis, and have often been associated with adverse complications.

To determine the protective effect of apigenin against growth inhibition of normal epithelial human prostatic (PNT2), transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP-C1) and metastatic melanoma cells (B16F10) in combined treatments with bisphosphonates and ionizing radiation (IR).

The growth inhibition on PNT2, TRAMP-C1 and B16F10 cells in the combined treatments with bisphosphonates (zoledronic acid, ibandronate and pamidronate) and IR in the presence and absence of apigenin was studied using a cell viability test.

Zoledronic acid had a cytotoxic effect on PNT2, TRAMP-C1 and B16F10 cells ( p<0.001). However, ibandronate and pamidronate had a cytotoxic effect only on PNT2 cells ( p<0.001). The administration of apigenin in combined treatment with bisphosphonates and IR showed: a decrease in the cytotoxic effect on TRAMP-C1 and B16F10 cells in the treatment with ibandronate; a protective effect on normal PNT2 and melanoma cells, but not on TRAMP-C1 cells in the treatment with zoledronic acid; and provided protection only to PNT2 cells in the treatment with pamidronate.

The use of the antioxidant produced a greater decrease in the cytotoxic effect on the non-tumor than in tumor cells when treated with bisphosphonates-alone and could be used in non-tumor pathologies. However, in a combined treatment with IR, it can also provide protection to tumor cells, thus reducing the intended effect of the IR.
