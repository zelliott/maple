To study the inhibitory effects of lipofectamine-mediated deleted colorectal carcinoma gene on ovarian epithelial carcinoma (ovarian cancer) cell line SKOV3.

We constructed a recombinant eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1 (+)-DCC containing exogenous human DCC cDNA and vector with neomycin resistance gene, which were introduced by lipofectamine-mediated gene transfection into SKOV3 cell line that does not express DCC endogenously, thus forming SKOV3/DCC. Therefore, the experimental cells were classified into SKOV3/DCC, SKOV3/Neo and SKOV3. By using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry, the expression of DCC mRNA and its protein were examined.

Exogenous DCC had successfully been transferred into SKOV3 cells and obtained permanent expression. The growth speed of SKOV3/DCC was slower than the other two groups, there was significant difference between them (P < 0.01). SKOV3/DCC clones number was 38 +/- 8, while SKOV3 and SKOV3/Neo were 192 +/- 8 and 186 +/- 10, respectively, there was significant difference between them (P < 0.01). The percentage of G(1) phase cells increased to 78.0%, which that of S phase decreased to 5.3% by analyzing cell cycle, there was significant difference between them (20.0% and 3.2%, P < 0.01). The ultrastructural changes of the cells were observed under electron microscope, revealing growth retardation.

DCC gene played an important role in generation and development of ovarian carcinomas.
