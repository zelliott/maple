In this study, we tested the antiproliferative effects of mannan from Aloe saponaria using normal murine (SpMC) and human cells (PBMC) and several tumoral cell lines. Employing flow cytometry, it could be determined that mannan inhibits the proliferative response in normal and tumoral cells. Mannan affects the expression of CD3(+) SpMC indicating that mannan inhibits mainly T lymphocyte proliferative response. Also in SpMC cultured with or without mitogen mannan produces an increase of an activation marker (CD25). On C1498 cell line, mannan reduces CD3 expression and abolishes the CD25 expression. In conclusion, mannan has a dual beneficial effect when applied to normal and tumoral cells at the same time by inhibiting the activation of cancer cells and improving that of normal ones.
