Protein kinase A (PKA) or cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK) mediates the synergistic effects of cAMP- and glucocorticoid (GC)-induced apoptosis in lymphoid cells. Using two human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell (CEM) clones with respective GC-sensitive and GC-resistant phenotypes, we discovered that the PKA regulatory subunit isoform RII(beta) is preferentially expressed in the GC-sensitive clone C7-14 cells, whereas other intracellular cAMP receptors, including the exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epac), are expressed at similar levels in both GC-sensitive and GC-resistant clones. High RII(beta) expression level in C7-14 cells is associated with elevated total PKA cellular activity and cAMP sensitivity, which consequently lead to an increased basal PKA activity. cAMP analogs that selectively activate type II PKA recapitulate the effects of forskolin of promoting apoptosis and antagonizing AKT/PKB activity in both GC-sensitive and GC-resistant clones, whereas type I PKA-selective agonists do not. Furthermore, down-regulation of RII(beta) leads to increased AKT/PKB activation and enhanced GC resistance in C7-14 cells. These results demonstrate that PKA RII(beta) is responsible for increased GC sensitivity, critical for cAMP-mediated synergistic cell killing in CEM cells, and may represent a novel therapeutic target for GC-resistant lymphoid malignancy.
