Metastatic spread to regional lymph nodes is one of the earliest events of tumor cell dissemination and presents a most significant prognostic factor for predicting survival of cancer patients. Real-time in vivo imaging of the spread of tumor cells through the lymphatic system can enhance our understanding of the metastatic process. Herein, we describe the use of in vivo fluorescence microscopy imaging to monitor the progression of lymph node metastasis as well as the course of spontaneous metastasis through the lymphatic system of orthotopic MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer tumors in severe combined immunodeficient mice. High-resolution noninvasive visualization of metastasizing cancer cells in the inguinal lymph nodes was achieved using cells expressing high levels of red fluorescent protein. Sequential imaging of these lymph nodes revealed the initial invasion of the tumor cells through the lymphatic system into the subcapsular sinuses followed by intrusion into the parenchyma of the nodes. FITC-dextran injected i.d. in the tumor area enabled simultaneous tracking of lymphatic vessels, labeled in green, and disseminated red cancer cells within these vessels. Fast snapshots of spontaneously metastasizing cells in the lymphatic vessels monitored the movement of a few tumor cells and the development of clumps clustered at lymphatic vessel junctions. Quantification of high interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) in the tumors and fast drainage rates of the FITC-dextran into the peritumoral lymphatic vessels suggested an IFP-induced intravasation into the lymphatic system. This work presents unprecedented live fluorescence images that may help to clarify the steps occurring in the course of spontaneous lymphogenic metastasis.
