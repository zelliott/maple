EGCG [(-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate], the major polyphenol of green tea, has cancer chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic activities. EGCG selectively inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in cancer cells without adversely affecting normal cells; however, the underlying molecular mechanism in vivo is unclear. In the present study, we show that EGCG-induced apoptotic activity is attributed to a lipid-raft clustering mediated through 67LR (67 kDa laminin receptor) that is significantly elevated in MM (multiple myeloma) cells relative to normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and that aSMase (acid sphingomyelinase) is critical for the lipid-raft clustering and the apoptotic cell death induced by EGCG. We also found that EGCG induces aSMase translocation to the plasma membrane and PKCδ (protein kinase Cδ) phosphorylation at Ser664, which was necessary for aSMase/ceramide signalling via 67LR. Additionally, orally administered EGCG activated PKCδ and aSMase in a murine MM xenograft model. These results elucidate a novel cell-death pathway triggered by EGCG for the specific killing of MM cells.
