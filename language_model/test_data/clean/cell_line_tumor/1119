We describe herein the synthesis and biological activity of two indoloazepines that are structurally related to the marine sponge metabolite hymenialdisine. The natural product hymenialdisine was found to be a potent inhibitor of interleukin-2 (IC(50) = 2.4 microM) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (IC(50) = 1.4 microM) production. One of the hymenialdisine derived indoloazepines was found to also inhibit interleukin-2 (IC(50) = 3.5 microM) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (IC(50) = 8.2 microM) production.
