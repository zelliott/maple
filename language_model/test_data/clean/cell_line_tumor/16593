We report the synthesis and characterization of eight new Mo, W, or V-containing polyoxometalate (POM) bisphosphonate complexes with metal nuclearities ranging from 1 to 6. The compounds were synthesized in water by treating Mo(VI), W(VI), V(IV), or V(V) precursors with biologically active bisphosphonates H(2)O(3)PC(R)(OH)PO(3)H(2) (R = C(3)H(6)NH(2), Ale; R = CH(2)S(CH(3))(2), Sul and R = C(4)H(5)N(2), Zol, where Ale = alendronate, Sul = (2-Hydroxy-2,2-bis-phosphono-ethyl)-dimethyl-sulfonium and Zol = zoledronate). Mo(6)(Sul)(2) and Mo(6)(Zol)(2) contain two trinuclear Mo(VI) cores which can rotate around a central oxo group while Mo(Ale)(2) and W(Ale)(2) are mononuclear species. In V(5)(Ale)(2) and V(5)(Zol)(2) a central V(IV) ion is surrounded by two V(V) dimers bound to bisphosphonate ligands. V(6)(Ale)(4) can be viewed as the condensation of one V(5)(Ale)(2) with one additional V(IV) ion and two Ale ligands, while V(3)(Zol)(3) is a triangular V(IV) POM. These new POM bisphosphonates complexes were all characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The stability of the Mo and W POMs was studied by (31)P NMR spectroscopy and showed that all compounds except the mononuclear Mo(Ale)(2) and W(Ale)(2) were stable in solution. EPR measurements performed on the vanadium derivatives confirmed the oxidation state of the V ions and evidenced their stability in aqueous solution. Electrochemical studies on V(5)(Ale)(2) and V(5)(Zol)(2) showed reduction of V(V) to V(IV), and magnetic susceptibility investigations on V(3)(Zol)(3) enabled a detailed analysis of the magnetic interactions. The presence of zoledronate or vanadium correlated with the most potent activity (IC(50)~1-5 Î¼M) against three human tumor cell lines.
