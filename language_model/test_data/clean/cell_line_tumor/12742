Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with porphyrin precursors has been established for tumor treatment. This study aimed at examining applicability of hexaminolevulinate (HAL) for photodynamic purging of leukemic cells from BM grafts and evaluating the clinical relevance of in vitro models. The PDT dose resulting in no colony formation by leukemic cells in vitro, in pure form or in a mixture with BM cells, was insufficient for complete killing of the leukemic cells ex vivo and for the treatment of the leukemia-bearing animals in vivo. The efficacy of HAL-PDT in cell lines in vitro should be verified in clinically relevant in vivo models.
