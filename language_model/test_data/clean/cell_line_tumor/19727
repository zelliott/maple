We have generated murine T cells expressing chimeric immune receptors (CR) against human 5T4 oncofetal Ag (h5T4) and evaluated their tumor therapeutic efficacy alone and in combination with immunization using a replication-defective adenovirus encoding h5T4 (Rad.h5T4) and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC). The h5T4-specific engineered T cells demonstrated Ag-specific, non-MHC-restricted cytolysis of h5T4-positive B16 and CT26 tumor cells in vitro by cytotoxicity assay and antitumor activity in vivo using a Winn assay. In the s.c. injected B16h5T4 melanoma model, early local but not systemic i.v. administration of syngeneic h5T4-specific CR T cells significantly increased mice survival. This improvement was further enhanced when combined with immunization with Rad.h5T4, followed by post-CR T cell treatment with BMDC in the active therapy model, possibly through mechanisms of enhancing Ag-specific cellular immune responses. This synergistic effect was lost without delivery of the BMDC. Our findings suggest that combining engineered T cells with specific vaccination strategies can improve the active tumor therapy.
