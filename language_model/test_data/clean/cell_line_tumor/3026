Interferon-beta (IFN-beta) has been found to have anti-tumor properties against a variety of malignancies through different mechanisms. However, clinical trials involving systemic administration of IFN-beta have been hampered by secondary toxicity and the short half-life of IFN-beta in the circulation. In order to circumvent these limitations, we have developed an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector gene-therapy approach to deliver IFN-beta to tumors. In this study, we tested the efficacy of AAV-mediated local delivery of IFN-beta for the treatment of retinoblastoma in preclinical models. Retinoblastoma is an ideal candidate for gene-therapy-based anti-cancer treatment because target cell transduction and, therefore, IFN-beta delivery can be contained within the ocular environment, thereby minimizing systemic toxicity. We report here that retinoblastoma cell lines exhibit pleiotropic responses to IFN-beta consistent with previous studies on a variety of tumor cell lines. Intravitreal injection of AAV-IFN-beta resulted in efficient retinal infection and sustained IFN-beta production in the eye with minimal systemic exposure. Vector spread outside of the eye was not detected. Using our orthotopic xenograft model of retinoblastoma, we found that intravitreal injection of AAV-IFN-beta had a potent anti-tumor effect in vivo. These data suggest that AAV-mediated delivery of IFN-beta may provide a complementary approach to systemic chemotherapy which is the standard of care for retinoblastoma around the world.
