Survivin has been shown to be an ideal target for cancer gene therapy because of its strong antiapoptotic effect. MicroRNA-34a (miR-34a) can function as a tumor suppressor in some cancers through negative regulation of gene expression. However, the relationship between miR-34a and survivin in larynx squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) has not been explored. The abundance of survivin mRNA and miR-34a in LSCC tissues were measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Their expression levels were analyzed and correlated with tumor differentiation, lymphatic metastasis, clinical stages, and survival rates. MiR-34a mimic was transfected using liposomes to increase its level in LSCC cancer cell line, Hep-2. The effects of miR-34a on survivin protein expression were tested using western blot analysis. Cell cycle analyses were performed using flow cytometry. The results showed that transfection of miR-34a mimic significantly suppressed cell proliferation with decreased survivin protein expression, but did not affect mRNA expression level. The results from LSCC tissue samples showed that miR-34a was downregulated, while survivin expression was upregulated. The miR-34a levels were negatively correlated with histologic differentiation and were positively correlated with survival rate. MiR-34a significantly suppressed cell proliferation by arresting cells at G0/G1 phase in Hep-2 cells. These results indicated that miR-34a may affect the occurrence of LSCC by targeting survivin.
