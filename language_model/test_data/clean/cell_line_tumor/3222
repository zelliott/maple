The anticancer activity of anti-bacterial cecropins makes them potentially useful as peptide anti-cancer drugs. We used the cell-attached patch to study the effect of cecropin B (CB; having one hydrophobic and one amphipathic alpha-helix) and its derivative, cecropin B3 (CB3; having two hydrophobic alpha-helices) on the membrane of Ags cancer cells. Application of 10-60 microM CB onto the membrane of the cancer cell produces short outward currents. Comparative study with CB3, which induces no outward currents, shows that the amphipathic group of CB is necessary for the pore formation. The results provide a rationale to study the cell-killing activity of antimicrobial peptides at the single cancer cell level.
