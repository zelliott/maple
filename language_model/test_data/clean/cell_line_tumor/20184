To investigate the anti-leukemia effect of oridonin on Ph(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line SUP-B15.

Human Ph(+) ALL cell line was cultured in vitro. The 50% inhibition concentration (IC(50)) of oridonin against SUP-B15 cell line was examined using modified MTT assay. The cellular morphologic changes were observed using a light microscope. The percent of apoptosis of SUP-B15 cell line after drug treatment was evaluated by flow cytometric analysis. The active levels of ABL kinase and its downstream Akt/mTOR, Raf/MEK/ERK, STAT5 signaling pathways and the expression levels of Bcl-2 and BAX were examined by Western blot.

Oridonin inhibited the growth of SUP-B15 cell line in both time- and dose-dependent manner with the IC(50) of oridonin as (7.08 ± 1.21) µmol/L after 72 h treatment. The cellular membrane of SUP-B15 cell line treated with oridonin became unsharp, some of them disintegrated. Oridonin induced apoptosis in SUP-B15 cell line with the apoptosis rates following 0, 5, 10 µmol/L oridonin treatment for 24 h were (6.67 ± 0.83)%, (18.30 ± 1.79)% and (37.63 ± 7.12)%, respectively. Oridonin inhibited activation of ABL kinase and its downstream Akt/mTOR, Raf/MEK/ERK and STAT5 signaling pathways, which were constitutively activated in SUP-B15 cell line, down-regulated the level of anti- apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and up-regulated the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax.

Oridonin exerted anti-leukemia effect in Ph(+)ALL cell line SUP-B15 by inhibiting the activation of ABL kinase and its downstream Akt/mTOR, Raf/MEK/ERK and STAT5 signaling pathways, down-regulating the expression of Bcl-2 and up-regulating the expression of BAX.
