Synthesis, characterization and biological studies of silver and gold complexes with 6-mercaptopurine (H2MP) are described. The Ag(I) and Au(I) complexes with HMP-, AgHMP and AuIHMP, were obtained by mixing an acidified H2MP aqueous solution with an equimolar aqueous solution of AgNO3 or Au(CN)2. The Au(III) complex with HMP-, AuIIIHMP, was obtained by adding an aqueous solution of K(AuCl4) to an acidified H2MP aqueous solution (1:1 molar ratio) and the final solution was acidified with HCl to pH=1.0. The Au(III)MP complex, KAu(MP)2, was obtained by adding an aqueous solution of K(AuCl4) to a basic H2MP solution (M:L - 1:2 molar ratio). Formulas for the complexes are: (Ag[C5H3N4S])*½H2O for AgHMP, (Au[C5H3N4S]) for AuIHMP, (Au[C5H3N4S][Cl]2)*2H2O for AuIIIHMP and K(Au[C5H2N4S]2)·2H2O for KAu(MP)2. The AuIHMP and KAu(MP)2 complexes decreased cell viability of HeLa cancer cells in vitro. The IC50 values for AuIHMP and KAu(MP)2 are 3.0 and 30.0 μM, respectively. Anti-M.tuberculosis assays showed a MIC value of 2.24 μM for AuIHMP and 5.12 μM for free MP while AgHMP is active at the concentration 93.2 μM.
