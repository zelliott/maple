A series of 8-phenylaminopyrimido[4,5-c]isoquinoline-7,10-quinone derivatives were prepared by regioselective amination reaction of pyrimido[4,5-c]isoquinoline-7,10-quinones with arylamines in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst. Preliminary evaluation of the members of the series against cancer cell lines and assays of activation of their cytotoxic activity on K562 cells with ascorbic acid are reported.
