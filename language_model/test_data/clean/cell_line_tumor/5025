To observe the change of invasion ability of the bladder cancer cell line BIU87 after transfected with LRIG1 gene.

Plasmid pLRIG1-GFP was transfected into bladder cancer cells (BIU87) by Lipofectamine 2000, and cells that could express LRIG1 stably was screened out by G418. The alteration of cellular invasion property of BIU87, BIU87-neo and BIU87-LRIG1 cells was evaluated by Boyden chamber. The expression of mRNA and protein of LRIG1 and EGFR was detected by RT-PCR and Western-blot.

Compared with BIU87 and BIU87-neo cells, after BIU87 cell line was transfected with plasmid pLRIG1-GFP, the invasion ability decreased significantly, the expression of mRNA and protein of LRIG1 was obviously up-regulated and that of EGFR was down-regulated (P < 0.01).

LRIG1 gene can significantly inhibit the invasion ability of BIU87 cell line.
