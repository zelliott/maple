We recently reported that adhesion molecule CD82 is aberrantly expressed in CD34(+) /CD38(-) leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Here, we report the results of a functional analysis of CD82 in CD34(+) /CD38(-) acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells. Short hairpin (sh)RNA-mediated downregulation of CD82 resulted in a decrease in the level of IL-10. In contrast, forced expression of CD82 in CD34(+)/CD38(+) AML cells by transduction with CD82-expressing lentiviral particles resulted in an increase in the levels of IL-10. Notably, exposure of CD34(+)/CD38(-) AML cells to IL-10 stimulated clonogenic growth of these cells. Moreover, downregulation of CD82 by a shRNA dephosphorylated STAT5 in CD34(+)/CD38(-) AML cells. On the other hand, forced expression of CD82 resulted in increase in the levels of p-STAT5 in CD34(+)/CD38(+) AML cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay results indicated that STAT5A binds to the promoter region of the IL-10 gene, while reporter gene assay results indicated stimulation of IL-10 expression at the transcriptional level. These results suggest that CD82 positively regulates the STAT5/IL-10 signaling pathway. Moreover, shRNA-mediated downregulation of CD82 expression in CD34(+)/CD38(-) AML cells dephosphorylated STAT5 in immunodeficient mice. Taken together, our data suggest that the CD82/STAT5/IL-10 signaling pathway is involved in the survival of CD34(+)/CD38(-) AML cells and may thus be a promising therapeutic target for eradication of AML LSCs.
