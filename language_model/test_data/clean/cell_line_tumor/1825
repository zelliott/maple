The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and related family member, HER-2, are often overexpressed simultaneously in patients with a variety of malignant tumors, and the combination may cooperatively promote cancer cell growth and survival. The purpose of this study was to examine antitumor effects of the combination treatment of cetuximab and trastuzumab on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) using 16 HNSCC cell lines in terms of antiproliferative effect and antibody-dependent cell-mediated-cytotoxicity (ADCC). Previously we have reported the expression levels of EGFR mRNA on 16 HNSCC cell lines. All cell lines expressed mRNA for EGFR, HER-2 and HER-3; 12 cell lines expressed mRNA for HER-4; and 4 cell lines did not express mRNA for HER-4. In in vitro proliferation assay, the combination treatment of cetuximab and trastuzumab significantly lowered cell viability compared to either drug alone. The mRNA expression levels of EGFR and HER-2 were not correlated with the efficacy of the combination treatment of cetuximab and trastuzumab and the expression levels of HER-3 and HER-4 also showed no correlation with the efficacy of the combination treatment. We evaluated the gene status of HER-2 exons 23 and 24 in 16 HNSCC cell lines, but there was no mutation of HER-2 in any of the cell lines. Either drug showed ADCC in the 3 cell lines using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), however, a significant combination effect was not observed. Combined molecular targeted antibody drug therapy for EGFR and HER-2 may be useful in the treatment of HNSCC.
