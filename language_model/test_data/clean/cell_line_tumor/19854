Human interleukin-6 is involved in the maintenance and progression of several diseases such as multiple myeloma (MM), rheumatoid arthritis, or osteoporosis. Our previous work demonstrated that an interleukin-6 antagonist peptide (named PT) possessed potential bioactivity to antagonize the function of hIL-6 and could efficiently induce the growth arrest and apoptosis of XG-7 and M1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In this study, the theoretical interaction of the peptide PT with its receptor was analyzed further more with molecular docking and molecular dynamics methods. The theoretical studies showed that PT possessed very high affinity to interleukin-6R and offered a practical means of imposing long-term blockade of interleukin-6 activity in vivo. According to the theoretical results, the biological evaluation of PT was researched on two different cells models with more sensitive approaches: (1) The antagonist activity of PT was studied on the interleukin-6 dependent MM cells (XG-7) cultured with interleukin-6. In the other interleukin-6 dependent MM cells (SKO-007), they survived themselves by auto/paracrine without the exogenous interleukin-6, and also could be antagonized by PT. The therapeutic value of PT only limited on the interleukin-6 dependent category in MM. (2) Myeloid leukemia M1 cells were induced for growth arrest and apoptosis in response to interleukin-6. The results supported our previous findings and showed that PT could be evaluated by protecting the cells from interleukin-6 induced apoptosis. In conclusion, PT could induce interleukin-6-dependent XG-7 and SKO-007 cells to apoptosis while inhibit interleukin-6-stimulated apoptosis in M1 cells.
