There are several strategies that can be utilized to improve transfection efficiency while reducing the cytotoxicity of polyethyleneimine (PEI) as a promising non-viral gene delivery vector. In this study, we evaluated the potential use of lysine-histidine (KH) peptides in modifying the PEI 10 kDa structure and enhancing its efficiency while maintaining low toxicity of PEI. PEI 10 kDa was modified with 6-bromohexanoic acid (alkyl) to increase its lipophilicity. Then, ethylenediamine (EDA) was attached to the carboxylic groups of PEI-hexanoate to restore the primary amines of PEI. Subsequently, six different KH short peptides were conjugated to PEIs and evaluated for the effect of the KH sequence on vector transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity. The transfection efficiency of PEI-peptides complexed with a luciferase reporter gene (pRLCMV) in Neuro-2A murine neuroblastoma cells showed that the PEI conjugated to KHHHKKHHHK peptide had a significantly higher rate of gene transfection efficiency in comparison with other KH peptides. This peptide was conjugated to PEI-alkyl and PEI-alkyl-EDA and significant improvement in efficiency with minimal cytotoxicity was observed. The results obtained suggest that the sequence and content of KH peptides will have a significant impact on the transfection efficiency of modified PEI 10 kDa.
