Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of tongue is an aggressive head and neck cancer with high propensity of regional spreading and invasion. Tongue carcinoma cells treated with curcumin, the major curcuminoid of the turmeric, demonstrated reduction in adhesion, migration, and invasion ability. High-throughput microarray analysis indicated that curcumin treatment suppressed matrix metallopeptidase 10 (MMP10) expression. MMP10 is overexpressed in tongue carcinoma tissues in comparison with the normal epithelia. Curcumin treatment on tongue carcinoma cell lines suppressed MMP10 expression at both mRNA and protein levels. Our results suggested that curcumin is a promising inhibitor to tongue cancer cells migration and invasion.
