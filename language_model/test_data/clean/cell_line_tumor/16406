To investigate the expression of a novel biomarker, human short-type myofibrillogenesis regulator-1 (MR-1S), in ovarian carcinoma and explore its biological significance.

The MR-1S mRNA levels were analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 23 specimens of ovarian cancers and 20 specimens of control ovarian tissues. The expression of MR-1S in these specimens was detected by real-time PCR and immunohistochemical analysis. In addition, the expression of MR-1S in ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells was determined by immunocytochemisty. MR-1S mRNA and protein level of SKOV3 cells was compared in the two groups treated by carboplatin and paclitaxel at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, respectively. Furthermore, the expression of MR-1S was analyzed in liner concentration range of the anti-cancer drug, and the potential relation between MR-1S expression and cell apoptosis rate was predicted.

The level of MR-1S mRNA was significantly higher in ovarian cancer tissues than those of control tissues by RT-PCR and Real-time PCR analysis. MR-1S protein was overexpressed in ovarian cancer tissues with a positive rate of 78.3% (18/23) than that in the control tissues (30.0%,  p<0.05) through IHC analysis. The expression of MR-1S was markedly decreased by treatment with carboplatin and paclitaxel, and there was a direct correlation between MR-1S expression and apoptosis rate, especially in a liner concentration range of paclitaxel at 48 h.

MR-1S is highly expressed in ovarian cancer cells and tissues, and it may be a promising biomarker for diagnosis and a new target for ovarian cancer therapy.
