Although randomized clinical trials showed no benefit from combining epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with standard chemotherapy for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), better results might be obtained by combining EGFR-TKI with individual agents that are substrates for the adenosine triphosphate binding cassette transporters (ABCTs) because EGFR-TKIs can inhibit their efflux. The combination effects deserved to be further examined in vitro.

The combination effects of gefitinib with three antimicrotubule agents (AMTAs), paclitaxel, docetaxel or vinorelbine, or with gemcitabine were tested in 17 NSCLC cell lines using the tetrazolium colorimetric assay and classical isobole method. The effects of drug combinations, identified by the values of mean combination index (mCIs), were correlated with the expression levels of ABCTs. Dose-versus-log-response curves were analyzed to further evaluate the possible mechanisms of drug interactions.

Synergistic gefitinib/AMTA interactions were observed in the tested cell lines. The synergism was more robust in the four lines overexpressing de novo or acquired P-glycoprotein (Pgp; individual mCIs range, 0.484-0.859; all p values were < 0.05), or in 12 cell lines exhibiting no sensitizing EGFR mutations (group mCIs for gefitinib/paclitaxel, gefitinib/docetaxel, and gefitinib/vinorelbine were 0.869, 0.82, and 0.853, respectively. All p values were < 0.02). The synergism could be observed in cells expressing nearly undetectable Pgp and other ABCTs tested in this study. The combination of gefitinib/gemcitabine was additive (mCI = 1.027).

Combined gefitinib/AMTAs showed synergism in NSCLC cells harboring no sensitizing EGFR mutations. Gefitinib could enhance AMTA effects through mechanisms not restricted to Pgp blockage.
