Corynebacterium diphtheriae strains displayed different degrees of attachment to HEp-2 cell monolayers with two distinct adherence patterns, termed localised (LA) and diffuse (DA). The LA phenotype predominated over the DA phenotype. The non-sucrose fermenting strains expressing DA pattern adhered mostly with high index values (> or =10bact/cell). Low adhesion index (<10bact/cell) was mainly observed among sucrose fermenting strains. The fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled phalloidin assay (fluorescent-actin staining test) showed positive results for microorganisms of both LA and DA phenotypes. The FITC-labelled C. diphtheriae non-fimbrial surface proteins 67-72p interacted directly with HEp-2 cell membranes. Therefore, toxigenic C. diphtheriae exhibited LA and DA adherence patterns and ability to induce actin polymerisation. The experimental evidences also pointed to 67-72p as putative adhesins of C. diphtheriae to HEp-2 cells.
