The glutamatergic system (Glu system) comprises the Glu receptors (GluRs), the Glu transporters (GluTs) and glutamine synthetase (GS).

Using PCR-based detection and Western blot analysis, the expression of Glu system components was assessed in human androgen-independent PC-3 and androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cells.

iGluRs, such as NR1, NR2A, NR2C, NR2D and NR3B; mGLuRs such as mGluR1, mGluR2, mGluR3, mGluR4 and mGluR5; GluTs such as EAAT1, EAAT2, EAAT3 and EAATS; and GS mRNA were steadily expressed in both cell lines. In addition, NR3A, mGluR6, mGluR8 and EAAT4 mRNA were differentially expressed in PC-3 and LNCaP cells, mGluR7 and EAAT4 mRNA expression was induced and mGluR8 was silenced by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatment in LNCaP cells. GS, EAAT1 and mGLuR5 were also detected at the protein level in both PC-3 and LNCAP cells.

These data suggest that the Glu system could be an important regulator of prostate cancer cell biology.
