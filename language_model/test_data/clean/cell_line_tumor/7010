Adeno-associated virus (AAV) Rep 78 protein is known to inhibit the promoter site of several oncogenes and viral genes, including the human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 E6 transforming genes. The biochemical studies of Rep 78 have been reported, but the effects of Rep 78 gene-mediated inhibition of HPV 16 E6 promoter activity on the various human cervical carcinoma cells have not been characterized. pEGFP-N1 vector, cloned by AAV-mediated Rep 78, is transfected into cervical carcinoma cells. Transfection efficiency of Rep 78 was approximately 30-60% different. Messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression of Rep 78 gene was significantly higher on day 1 of the transfection of Rep 78 DNA in CaSki cells, and DNA level of HPV 16 E6 was decreased on day 1 of the transfection. The growth of CaSki cervical cancer cells was only 10-15% inhibited by Rep 78, and the other cervical cells, HeLa, HeLaS3, HT3, and QGU, were unaffected by Rep 78 transfection. In spite of the high efficiency of Rep 78 gene transformation and expression rate, we could not show the significant growth inhibition in various cervical cancer cell lines. Taken together, long-term expression of Rep 78 strategy might be needed for cervical carcinoma gene therapy using AAV vector.
