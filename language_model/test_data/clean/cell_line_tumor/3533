Melanoma cells typically express wild-type p53, yet they are notoriously resistant to DNA-damaging agents. Here, we show that sodium butyrate (NaB), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, induced apoptosis in human melanoma cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Apoptosis was associated with HDAC1-dependent induction of Bax and acetylation of p53. Down-regulation of HDAC1 by an antisense vector sensitized the cells to NaB-induced apoptosis, whereas its overexpression conferred resistance to this agent. Increased HDAC1 levels and activity impaired NaB-mediated activation of Bax promoter and Bax protein levels. Finally, using p53-null melanoma cell line and RNA interference in cells expressing wild-type p53 protein, we show that Bax induction and NaB-mediated apoptosis is p53 dependent.
