Our previous studies demonstrated that two cytotoxic β-nitrostyrene derivatives, 3,4-methylenedioxy-β-nitrostyrene (MNS) and 4-O-benzoyl-3-methoxy-β-nitrostyrene (BMNS) exhibit potent anti-platelet activities. In this study, a series of β-nitrostyrenes were synthesized and subjected to anti-platelet aggregation assay and cytotoxicity assay. The mono- and di-substitutions on the B ring of BMNS tended to increase the anti-platelet activity and decrease the cytotoxic activity. Of these, compounds 19 and 24 exhibited the most potent inhibitory effects on thrombin- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation (IC(50)≤0.7 μM) without significant cytotoxicity on a human cancer cell line (up to 20 μM). Further studies indicated that compounds 19 and 24 inhibited platelet aggregation via prevention of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa activation. The potent and novel effects of BMNS derivatives make them attractive candidates for the development of new anti-platelet agents.
