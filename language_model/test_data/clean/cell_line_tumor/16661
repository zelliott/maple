The rhizoma of Paris polyphylla var. yannanensis or P. polyphylla var. chinensis called Rhizoma Paridis as a traditional Chinese medicine has an effect of heat-clearing and detoxicating, detumescence and acesodyne in folk for a long time. The increasing application of Rhizoma Paridis resulted in the shortage of wildlife resources. Here, we compared the major activities of other species of genus Paris to find the replacement plants.

Six species (P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis, P. delavayi var. delavayi, P. fargesii var. Fargesii, P. bashanensis Wang et Tang, P. polyphyllar var. minora, and P. polyphylla var. pseudothibetical) were collected from three Provinces in China, and compared the hemostatic, cytotoxic and hemolytic activities by different assays.

For the hemostatic activity, all the plants except Paris fargesii var. Fargesii could significantly shorten the tail bleeding time and blood clotting time ( p<0.05). For further mechanism study, they reduced the prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), but they had no significant effect on thrombin time (TT). P. fargesii var. Fargesii showed the similar cytotoxicity to P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis (IC(50): 18.21 and 15.73 Î¼g/mL, respectively). HD(50) was used as the index of hemolytic activity. P. delavayi var. delavayi and P. bashanensis Wang et Tang were the last to have this activity as the values were 3.027 and 1.222 mg/mL.

The different species of genus Paris have different activities. Paris delavayi var. delavayi and Paris bashanensis Wang et Tang could be used as the resources of hemostatic drugs and P. fargesii var. Fargesii as the antitumor medicine.
