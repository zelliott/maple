Evidence is accumulating that compounds of plant origin (phytochemicals) exert anti-cancer effects. The purpose of this study was to determine if resveratrol, cinnamaldehyde, and piperine (from red grapes, cinnamon, black pepper respectively) have anti-proliferative effects on colon cancer.

Quantitative effects of each phytochemical on concentration responses and time courses of proliferation of cultured human colon cancer cells (DLD-1) were assessed.

Research was performed at Saint Louis University.

Responses were measured by spectrophotometry of surviving cells stained by a dye method.

Phytochemicals displayed anti-proliferative effects on DLD-1 cells in concentration- and kinetic-dependent manners. Cinnamaldehyde offered statistically significant effects at 24 hours [200 microM], 48 hours [100 - 200 microM], and 72 hours [200 microM]. Piperine displayed a trend towards anti-proliferation at 24 hours and statistically significant inhibition at 48 and 72 hours [100 - 200 microM]. Resveratrol displayed significant anti-proliferative effects at 24 hours [50-200 microM], 48 hours [10-200 microM], and 72 hours [10-200 microM].

Cinnamaldehyde, piperine, and resveratrol offer significant in vitro anti-proliferative effects on cultured human colon cancer cells. While each phytochemical exhibited significant anti-proliferative effects, resveratrol results were most impressive in that lower concentrations administered at regular intervals were significantly effective. These results taken together with everyday dietary availability of concentrations used in this study strongly suggest that regular intake of low doses of these phytochemicals offer preventive effects against colon cancer.
