Analyzing molecular biomarkers using blood is an important approach for             clinical assessment of malignant glioma. We investigated a molecular proteomic             biomarker-based approach for glioblastoma using patients' blood samples. The expression             levels of a list of candidate proteins were quantified in plasma and serum samples             from two different cohorts of patients with malignant glioma and normal controls.             The biological function was studied for one of the identified markers. Additionally,             the prognostic significance of protein marker expression was measured by survival             analysis. As a result, protein biomarkers associated with malignant glioma were             identified from the blood specimens and five of the protein biomarkers were common             to both cohorts. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that many of the protein             biomarkers identified in peripheral blood specimens were expressed in malignant             gliomas. Staining levels for one of the biomarkers, MIP-1α, was found to correlate             with WHO grade among invasive gliomas, and we demonstrate that MIP-1α promotes             human glioblastoma cell proliferation and migration. Additionally, four prognostic             protein biomarkers were identified. In conclusion, we demonstrate that both peripheral             blood plasma and serum specimens are highly valuable and complementary to each             other in the quest for protein biomarkers of malignant glioma. Sets of novel protein             biomarkers were identified that may aid in the diagnosis and prognosis of patients             with malignant glioma.
