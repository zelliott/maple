Osteoblast attachment on titanium surfaces is necessary to achieve new bone formation and osseointegration. The purpose of this study was to examine osteoblast attachment on irradiated titanium disks.

Machined, hydroxyapatite (HA)-coated, sandblasted, and titanium plasma-sprayed (TPS) surfaces were irradiated with either a carbon dioxide (CO2) or an Er,Cr:YSGG laser. A control group of nonirradiated disks was also examined. Osteoblast cultures were cultivated on the titanium disks and examined with scanning electron microscopy.

The findings demonstrated that osteoblasts could be grown on all of the surfaces. Pseudopodia and a spread of cells that demonstrated maturation were observed on the lased irradiated titanium disks.

The data show that laser irradiation of titanium surfaces may promote osteoblast attachment and further bone formation.
