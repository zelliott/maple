Bone formation in the vertebrate skeleton occurs via the processes of endochondral and membranous ossification. Bone matrices contain chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains that regulate endochondral ossification. However, the function of CS in membranous ossification is unclear. Here, using preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells we demonstrate that chondroitin sulfate-E (CS-E) promotes osteoblast differentiation by binding to both N-cadherin and cadherin-11. Differentiated MC3T3-E1 cells exhibited an increase in the total amount of CS and of E-disaccharide units of CS over time. In addition, CS-E polysaccharide, but not CS-A polysaccharide, bound to N-cadherin and cadherin-11 and enhanced osteoblast differentiation. In contrast, osteoblast differentiation was inhibited in chondroitinase ABC-digested MC3T3-E1 cells. Notably, CS-E polysaccharide and hexasaccharide activated intracellular signaling during osteoblast differentiation in non-contacting MC3T3-E1 cells, decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and activated Smad3 and Smad1/5/8; these reactions were blocked by neutralizing antibodies against N-cadherin or cadherin-11, even though cell-cell adhesion is reported to be required for initiation of MC3T3-E1 cell differentiation. Furthermore, CS-E-unit overexpression in MC3T3-E1 cells increased adhesion of the cells to N-cadherin and cadherin-11, and promoted osteoblast differentiation. Collectively, these results suggest that CS-E is a selective ligand for the potential CS receptors, N-cadherin and cadherin-11, leading to osteoblast differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells.
