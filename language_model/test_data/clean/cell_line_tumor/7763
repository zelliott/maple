Many different types of magnetic particles have been developed for the purpose of hyperthermia cancer therapy. In this study, a magnetic nanoparticle based on dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) was formed by co-precipitation method. Addition of different concentrations of ferrous chloride to DCPD can alter its material properties. Various physical, chemical and magnetic tests of the magnetic DCPD nanoparticles (mDCPD) were performed, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES), superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The heating efficiency of mDCPD in alternating magnetic field was proved to be suitable for hyperthermia. The results of cytotoxicity tests (WST-1 and LDH assay) showed no harmful effect. The mDCPD showed relative cancer-killing ability without damaging normal cells in vitro.
