Chemoresistance of ovarian carcinoma has been associated previously to the absence of Bcl-x(L) expression downregulation in response to cisplatin. Among BH3-mimetic molecules constituting promising anticancer agents able to inhibit the activity of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, we evaluated the effect of one of them, HA14-1, on various ovarian carcinoma cell lines. In response to HA14-1, the cisplatin-resistant IGROV1-R10 cell line underwent massive cell death, whereas other cell lines presented a partial response (IGROV1, SKOV3, and A2780) or did not respond to this molecule (OAW42 and OAW42-R). However, the expression of HA14-1 targets (Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L)) did not correlate to these different responses. In contrast, cell death was associated with the disappearance of Mcl-1 after exposure to HA14-1. We showed that, in the HA14-1 nonresponsive cell lines (SKOV3 and OAW42), small interfering RNA-mediated Mcl-1 downregulation allowed HA14-1-induced massive apoptosis in the absence of chemotherapy. Furthermore, cisplatin-induced Mcl-1 downregulation was also able to sensitize highly chemoresistant SKOV3 cells to HA14-1. Taken together, these results show that Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1 are able to cooperate to protect ovarian carcinoma cells against oncogenic stress or chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and suggest that the development of multitargeted strategies directed against these two antiapoptotic proteins may constitute a major challenge for the therapeutic care of chemoresistant ovarian carcinomas. BH3-mimetic compounds represent promising tools for this purpose either on their own (direct or indirect pan-inhibitors) or in combination with new drugs aiming to inactivate Mcl-1.
