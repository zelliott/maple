To allow the longitudinal investigation of molecular events associated with the progression of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we sought to develop a murine model by orthotopic implantation of tumor fragments obtained from patients diagnosed at early stage.

Tumor pieces (2 x 2 mm) were implanted on the liver surface of nu/nu mice. After xenograft growing, subsequent passages were performed to achieve long-term implant viability. Isolation of tumoral hepatocytes was done to establish new cell lines. HCC characteristics, proliferation rate, apoptotic index (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling), and expression of cell-cycle regulators (cyclins E and A, p21(Cip1), p27(Kip1), p16(INK4a), pRb, and p53) were assessed by Western Blot and immunohistochemistry, to correlate them with tumor progression.

Five (50%) of the 10 primary HCCs resulted in small slow-growing liver implants. Three of them are viable after 48 months, whereas the remaining two survived for 15 and 13 months. Xenografts throughout passages exhibited a more aggressive phenotype with a poorer degree of differentiation, intense proliferation, moderate apoptosis, cell-cycle deregulation, p53 alterations, microvascular invasion, and dissemination. In one single passage, we observed critical growth delay, which was associated with significant p27(kip1) overexpression. We established the anchor-free growing BCLC-9 cell line from one xenograft. This has gains of chromosomes 7, 5p, 6q, and 9q, is hepatitis B virus-DNA positive, does not secrete alpha-fetoprotein, and has TP53 missense mutations in codons 192 and 242.

The orthotopic implantation of early HCC fragments in nude mice provides a useful model to investigate the mechanisms of human HCC evolution and to establish new cell lines.
