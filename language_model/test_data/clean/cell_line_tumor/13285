Photodynamic therapy has been developed as a viable treatment for cancer,             while apoptin is an apoptosis-inducing protein. This study was undertaken to evaluate             the feasibility and efficacy of apoptin with photodynamic therapy (PDT) in the             treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). RT-PCR and western blotting were             used to detect the expression of apoptin in CNE-2 NPC cells. MTT and flow cytometry             analysis were used to detect cell proliferation and cell apoptosis, respectively.             Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe cell structures. Hematoxylin             and eosin staining was used to observe the xenograft morphology. The expression             of apoptin was analyzed by RT-PCR and western blotting in CNE-2 cells stably transfected             with PVP3 plasmid. Apoptin restrained cell proliferation and enhanced cell apoptosis             compared to controls. Furthermore, we demonstrated that apoptin augmented the             effect of PDT with stronger cell proliferation restraint and cell apoptosis and             induced severe ultrastructural morphology changes compared to controls. Additionally,             we found that the combination of apoptin and PDT produced the strongest inhibition             of xenograft growth and tumor necrosis in in vivo experiments. Collectively, we             show that apoptin in combination with PDT has a better therapeutic effect in NPC             than PDT therapy or apoptin gene therapy alone.
