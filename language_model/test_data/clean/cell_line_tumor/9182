To investigate the early diagnosis value of bile K-ras mutation responsible for hepatic metastasis of pancreatic cancer.

While building the animal models with pancreatic cancer and hepatic metastasis of pancreatic cancer of rats, we collected bile from the model animals, and used the polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment-length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) to evaluate the point mutation at exon codon 12 of K-ras gene in bile. Then, the above result was compared with pathological slice.

The positive rates of K-ras point mutation in bile were 84.2% (16/19) for the model with hepatic metastasis of pancreatic cancer, and 0.0% (0/16) for the model with pancreatic cancer without hepatic metastasis. For the model with hepatic metastasis of pancreatic cancer, the sensitivity, specificity, positive prediction or negative prediction value of surveying K-ras mutation in bile was 84.2%, 85.7%, 84.2% or 85.7% respectively.

Both the mutability and the specificity of K-ras gene mutation at codon 12 in bile are high. Our above work can supply a new elemental filter method for the early diagnosis of hepatic metastasis of pancreatic cancer.
