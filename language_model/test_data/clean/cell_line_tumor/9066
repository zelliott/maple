The translocator protein (18 kDa; TSPO), previously known as peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, is a high-affinity cholesterol- and drug-binding mitochondrial protein involved in various cell functions including steroidogenesis, apoptosis, and proliferation. TSPO is highly expressed in secretory and glandular tissues, especially in steroidogenic cells, and its expression is altered in certain pathological conditions such as cancer and neurological diseases. In this study, we characterized the regulatory elements present in the region of the TPSO promoter extending from 515 to 805 bp upstream of the transcription start site, an area previously identified as being important for transcription. Promoter fragments extending 2.7 kb and 805 bp upstream of the transcription start site were able to direct enhanced green fluorescent protein expression to Leydig cells of the testis, theca cells of the ovary, and cells of the adrenal cortex in transgenic animals. This expression pattern perfectly mimicked endogenous TSPO expression. Functional characterization of the 515-805 bp region revealed the presence of one specificity protein 1/specificity protein 3 (Sp1/Sp3) and two v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homologue (Ets) binding sites that are important for transcriptional activity in both MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells and NIH/3T3 whole mouse embryo fibroblasts. GA-binding protein alpha (GABPalpha), a member of the Ets family of transcription factors, was found to be associated with the endogenous TSPO promoter. We conclude that Sp1/Sp3 and members of the Ets family of transcription factors bind to specific binding sites in the TSPO promoter to drive basal TSPO gene transcription.
