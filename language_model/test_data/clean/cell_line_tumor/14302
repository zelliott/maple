Glutathione (GSH), the most prevalent intracellular non-protein thiol, plays an important role in the interleukin-2 (IL-2)-induced proliferative activity of normal and tumour cells expressing IL-2 receptor (IL-2R). In the present study, we investigate the effect of IL-2 on proliferation of the human melanoma A375 cell line, and the possible selective cytomodulation effect of this cytokine by L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate (OTZ) on these melanoma cells and on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We found that recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2) significantly increased the proliferation rate of A375 melanoma cells, which was associated with an increase in GSH levels, the enhancement of IL-2Ralpha expression and the endogenous production of IL-2 in these tumour cells. In contrast, OTZ decreased GSH content and the proliferation rate of A375 cells, and abrogated the growth-promoting effects of rIL-2. Thus, compared to cells treated with rIL-2, pre-treatment with OTZ reduced IL-2Ralpha expression, and also decreased the consumption of rIL-2 and the endogenous secretion of IL-2 by these tumour cells. With regard to PBMCs, the combination of OTZ plus rIL-2 resulted in a more rapid and greater increase of IL-2Ralpha expression than rIL-2 alone, with the proliferation rate being similar in the first 24 h, but with a lower PBMC' count found thereafter compared to rIL-2 treatment alone. These results suggest that OTZ plays a crucial role in obtaining a selective cytomodulation of rIL-2, enabling it to exert its growth-promoting effect on normal cells, but not on melanoma cells, thereby possibly improving biochemotherapy with rIL-2.
