PEN-2 is a component of the gamma-secretase complex, which is involved in the cleavage of the beta-amyloid precursor protein. The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism by which PEN-2 overexpression regulates gamma-secretase expression and the production of Abeta-42. In order to determine this, a hybrid gene harboring human PEN-2 was constructed, and used in the transfection of SK-N-MC human neuroepitheliomal cells. This cell line was also co-transfected with a combination of human mutant presenilin 2 (hPS2m) and APPsw. Our results indicated that (i) human PEN-2 overexpression induced an increase in gamma-secretase activity and its proteins, including PS1-CTF, APH-1, and nicastrin, thus production of Abeta-42, (ii) co-transfection of human PEN-2 with both hPS2m and APPsw exerted no more profound effects on the induction of gamma-secretase proteins and its activity than did transfection with hPEN-2 alone. Thus, PEN-2 overexpression may facilitate assembly into the more active gamma-secretase complex, and may also induce an increase in activity, thus affecting Abeta-42 production.
