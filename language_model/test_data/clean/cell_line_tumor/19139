The antitumor effect of black pine (Pinus nigra) pollen nuclease (PN) tested in vitro was negligible in comparison with bovine seminal ribonuclease (BS-RNase). However, in the experiments in vivo a significant decrease of the human melanoma tumor size was observed in the mice treated with this nuclease and also with the animal RNases and DNase I. In nude mice injected intratumoraly with PN (10 microg/dose) the tumor size decreased from 100% in the control mice to 46% in treated mice whereas in counterparts treated with BS-RNase and DNase I the tumor growth was reduced a little more, however after ten times higher doses (100 and 80 microg per dose). Certain aspermatogenic and embryotoxic activity as an expression of side effects of PN and comparative enzymes also appeared, but it was lower compared to the effect of bovine seminal ribonuclease. Immunogenicity of PN was significantly weaker in comparison with BS-RNase. The antibodies against black pine nuclease produced in the injected mice did not inactivate the biological effects of this plant nuclease in vivo. In conclusion PN nuclease proved in vivo higher antitumor activity against human melanoma tumors growing in athymic mice in comparison with animal bovine seminal ribonuclease and DNase I.
