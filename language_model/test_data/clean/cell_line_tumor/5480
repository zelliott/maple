To observe the effect of anti-tumor and mechanism of the extract of Spatholobus suberctus (SSCE) in vivo.

The mouse model of Lewis lung carcinoma was used to investigate the effects of SSCE on tumor growth and metastasis. Furthermore, we explored the mechanism of anti-tumor by analyze the cell cycle and determine the apoptosis.

The studies demonstrated that the tumor inhibitory rate of SSCE in low dose group was the highest (30.65%) on Lewis lung cancer. SSCE can resist metastasis, at the same time, it can induce cell cycle arrested in G1 phase, whereas, there was no significant difference in apoptotic rate each group.

We verified that SSCE exits anti-tumor effect and resist metastasis, furthermore, it can arrest function cell in G1 phase.
