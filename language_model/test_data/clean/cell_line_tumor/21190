We analysed the involvement of proteases during taxol-mediated cell death of human A549 non-small-cell lung carcinoma cells using a proteomics approach that specifically targets protein N termini and further detects newly formed N termini that are the result of protein processing. Our analysis revealed 27 protease-mediated cleavages, which we divided in sites C-terminal to aspartic acid (Asp) and sites C-terminal to non-Asp residues, as the result of caspase and non-caspase protease activities, respectively. Remarkably, some of the former were insensitive to potent pancaspase inhibitors, and we therefore suggest that previous inhibitor-based studies that report on the caspase-independent nature of taxol-induced cell death should be judged with care. Furthermore, many of the sites C-terminal to non-Asp residues were also uniquely observed in a model of cytotoxic granule-mediated cell death and/or found by in vitro cataloging human mu-calpain substrates using a similar proteomics technique. This thus raises the hypothesis that killing tumor cells by chemotherapy or by immune cells holds similar non-Asp-specific proteolytic components with strong indications to calpain activity.
