Phytochemical investigation of the ethanol extract of the bulbs of Lycoris caldwellii afforded four new alkaloids, (+)-N-methoxylcarbonyl-nandigerine (1), (+)-N-methoxycarbonyl-lindcarpine (2), (+)-10-O-methylhernovine N-oxide (3), and (+)-3-hydroxy-anhydrolycorine N-oxide (4). Structural elucidation of all the compounds were performed by spectral methods such as 1D and 2D (¹H-¹H COSY, HMQC, and HMBC) NMR spectroscopy, in addition to high resolution mass spectrometry. All the alkaloids were in vitro evaluated for their cytotoxic activities against eight tumor cell lines (BEN-MEN-1, CCF-STTG1, CHG-5, SHG-44, U251, BGC-823, HepG2, and SK-OV-3). Alkaloids 1 and 2 exhibited particular cytotoxic activities against astrocytoma and glioma cell lines with IC₅₀ of 9.2-11.3 μM and 10.4-12.2 μM respectively.
