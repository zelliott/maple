Cobalt chloride (CoCl(2)) can mimic hypoxia in inducing hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). Several cultured cells were examined for susceptibility to CoCl(2) in DMEM, MEM and RPMI 1640 medium. Here we report that HIF-1α expression of mammalian cells by CoCl(2) was largely dependent on the culture medium. HIF-1α protein and hypoxia response element (HRE)-dependent reporter activity were strongly induced in RPMI 1640 but not in DMEM in several cultured cells including MCF-7, a human breast cancer cell line. Analysis of causal nutrients has revealed that histidine, which is contained richer in DMEM, acts as the inhibitory nutrient for cobalt-induced HIF-1α expression of MCF-7 cells in DMEM. D-Histidine also inhibited the HIF-1α activity at the same level as L-histidine, suggesting that sequestration of free cobaltous ion by chelation with histidine was the cause of the inhibition. These results demonstrate that selection of the culture medium must be considered with caution in cell culture experiments using CoCl(2) as a hypoxia-mimetic reagent.
