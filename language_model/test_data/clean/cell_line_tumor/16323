The breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), an ATP binding cassette (ABC) efflux transporter, plays a role in multiple drug resistance (MDR). Previous studies of the subcellular location of the ABC transporter P-glycoprotein indicated that this protein is expressed in nuclear membranes. This study examines the nuclear distribution of BCRP in seven human-derived glioblastoma (GBM) and astrocytoma cell lines. BCRP expression was observed in the nuclear extracts of 6/7 cell lines. Using the GBM LN229 cell line as a model, nuclear BCRP protein was detected by immunoblotting and confocal laser microscopy. Importantly, nuclear BCRP staining was found in a subpopulation of tumour cells in a human brain GBM biopsy. Mitoxantrone cytotoxicity in the LN229 cell line was determined with and without the BCRP inhibitor fumitremorgin C (FTC) and after downregulation of BCRP with small interfering RNA (siRNA). FTC inhibition of BCRP increased mitoxantrone cytotoxicity with a ~7-fold reduction in the IC₅₀ and this effect was further potentiated in the siRNA-treated cells. In conclusion, BCRP is expressed in the nuclear extracts of select GBM and astrocytoma cell lines and in a human GBM tumour biopsy. Its presence in the nucleus of cancer cells suggests new role for BCRP in MDR.
