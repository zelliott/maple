Cancer prevention is effective and reduces health care costs because cancer is often a preventable disease that can be affected by lifestyle factors. Therefore, researchers are interested in discovering natural compounds that have anticancer activities, such as delaying the development of cancer and preventing its progression. One such natural agent is ginseng (Panax ginseng), which is traditionally used in some parts of the world as a popular remedy for various diseases including cancer. We hypothesized that the ginsenoside Rp1, a component of ginseng, reduces cancer cell proliferation through inhibition of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R)/Akt pathway. We first tested the efficacy of Rp1 against human breast cancer cell lines. Treatment with Rp1 inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation and inhibited both anchorage-dependent and -independent breast cancer cell colony formation. In addition, treatment with 20 Î¼M Rp1 induced cycle arrest and apoptosis-mediated cell growth suppression. Our findings further indicated that Rp1 decreased the stability of the IGF-1R protein in breast cancer cells. Therefore, we suggest that Rp1 has potential as an anticancer drug and that IGF-1R is an important target for treatment and prevention of breast cancer.
