The first stereoselective total synthesis of new natural amide alkaloids 1-3 have been achieved from commercially available starting materials. Wittig olefination, Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation, epoxidation, a trans regioselective opening of 2,3-epoxy alcohol, Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons (HWE) olefination and amide coupling are the key steps. The amide alkaloids 1-3 are evaluated for their anticancer activity against colon (HT-29), breast (MCF-7) and lung (A-549) human cancer cell lines for the first time.
