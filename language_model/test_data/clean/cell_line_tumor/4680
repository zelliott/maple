Many cancer cells are characterized by increased glycolysis and decreased respiration, even under aerobic conditions. The molecular mechanisms underlying this metabolic reprogramming are unclear. Here we show that hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) negatively regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and O(2) consumption in renal carcinoma cells lacking the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL). HIF-1 mediates these effects by inhibiting C-MYC activity via two mechanisms. First, HIF-1 binds to and activates transcription of the MXI1 gene, which encodes a repressor of C-MYC transcriptional activity. Second, HIF-1 promotes MXI-1-independent, proteasome-dependent degradation of C-MYC. We demonstrate that transcription of the gene encoding the coactivator PGC-1beta is C-MYC dependent and that loss of PGC-1beta expression is a major factor contributing to reduced respiration in VHL-deficient renal carcinoma cells.
