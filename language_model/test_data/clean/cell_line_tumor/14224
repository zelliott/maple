We sought to demonstrate that a single systemic administration of L19mTNFalpha (a fusion protein constituted by the scFv L19 specific for the oncofetal ED-B domain of fibronectin and tumor necrosis factor alpha, TNFalpha) in combination with melphalan induced complete and long-lasting tumor eradication in tumor-bearing mice and triggered the generation of a specific T cell-based immune response that protects the animals from a second tumor challenge, as well as from challenges with syngeneic tumor cells of different histologic origin.

Treatment with L19mTNFalpha, in combination with melphalan, induced complete tumor regression in 83% of BALB/c mice with WEHI-164 fibrosarcoma and 33% of animals with C51 colon carcinoma. All cured mice rejected challenges with the same tumor cells and, in a very high percentage of animals, also rejected challenges with syngeneic tumor cells of different histologic origin. In adoptive immunity transfer experiments, the splenocytes from tumor-cured mice protected naive mice both from C51 colon carcinoma and from WEHI-164 fibrosarcoma. Similar results were also obtained in adoptive immunity transfer experiments using severely immunodepressed mice. Experiments using depleted splenocytes showed that T cells play a major role in tumor rejection.

The results show that the selective targeting of mTNFalpha to the tumor enhances its immunostimulatory properties to the point of generating a therapeutic immune response against different histologically unrelated syngeneic tumors. These findings predicate treatment approaches for cancer patients based on the targeted delivery of TNFalpha to the tumor vasculature.
