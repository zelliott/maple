Toosendanin, a triterpenoid derivative isolated from the barks of Melia toosendan Sieb et Zucc, has been used as an anthelmintic vermifuge against ascaris for more than fifty years in China. In the present study, we investigated the growth inhibition and apoptosis-induced effect of toosendanin on human cancer cells. The result showed that toosendanin significantly suppressed the proliferation of tested human cancer cell lines. The IC(50) values were less than 1.7 x 10(-7) M and U937 was the most sensitive cell line with a IC(50) of 5.4 x 10(-9) M. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that treatment of U937 cells with toosendanin resulted in a dose- and time-dependent accumulation of cells in the S phase with a concomitant decrease in cells processing to G(0)/G(1) phase. The growth inhibition of U937 cells after exposure to toosendanin was subsequently associated with the induction of apoptosis, as evidence by the typical condensed and fragmented nuclei, DNA fragmentation, and exposure of phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet of plasma membrane. All these results indicated that toosendanin could serve as a potential candidate for anticancer drug.
