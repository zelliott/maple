The role that transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) plays in influencing growth of glioma cells is somewhat controversial. To further understand the potential growth-regulatory effects of TGF-beta1,we constructed an animal astroglial tumor model by injecting either wild-type or virally transduced human U-87 glioblastoma cells into nude rat brains. Wild type U-87 cells produced very low amounts of TGF-beta1 and were highly tumorigenic. In contrast, U-87 cells transduced to express high levels of TGF-beta1 showed reduced tumor size in vivo, in a dose-dependent manner. This reduction in tumor size was not due to either decreased vascularity or increased apoptosis. To test whether TGF-beta1 overproduction inhibited tumor growth through an autocrine mechanism, the highest TGF-beta1 producing cells were then double transduced with a vector expressing the kinase-truncated type II TGF-beta receptor. Cells expressing high levels of truncated TGF-beta receptor were less sensitive to TGF-beta1 mediated growth inhibition in vitro and produced more aggressive tumors in vivo. The data suggest that the degree of tumorigenicity of the U-87 high-grade glioblastoma cell line may be associated with correspondingly low level of production of TGF-beta1. These results also would tend to support the possibility that TGF-beta1 may be useful in treating some high-grade gliomas.
