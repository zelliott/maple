Three-dimensional organotypic cultures of human urinary tract tissue have been established as intact and reconstituted tissues, with the latter generated by combining cultured normal human urothelial (NHU) cells with an appropriate stroma. Organoids may be maintained at an air-liquid interface in static culture for periods of up to 20 weeks, with analysis by immunohistology for expression of urothelial differentiation-associated markers providing a qualitative, but objective assessment criterion. Where reconstructed using bladder cancer cell lines, the resultant organoids recapitulate the invasive characteristics of the originating tumour, but the need to use authenticated cell line stocks is emphasised. The organoid approach represents an important tool for investigating urothelial-stromal cell interactions during homeostasis and disease, and for testing bladder tissue engineering and reconstructive strategies. Potential future developments of the technique are discussed and include genetic manipulation of the urothelial cells to generate disease models and incorporation of biomaterial scaffolds to support artificial stroma development.
