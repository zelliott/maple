Three new ENT-kaurane diterpenoids, glaucocalyxin H ( 1), glaucocalyxin I ( 2), and glaucocalyxin J ( 3), together with four known diterpenoids ( 4- 7), were isolated from the leaves of Isodon japonica Hara var. glaucocalyx. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis, and the structures of compounds 2 and 3 were further confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. Compounds 1, 4, and 5 were evaluated for their cytotoxicity IN VITRO against CE-1, U87, A-549, MCF-7, Hela, K-562, and HepG-2 human tumor cell lines. Compound 1 showed potent inhibitory activities against six tumor cell lines with IC (50) values ranging from 1.86-10.95 ÂµM, and compounds 4 and 5 exhibited significant selective cytotoxicity on seven tumor cell lines.
