Luminescent near-infrared (NIR) CdTe/CdSe QDs were synthesized and encapsulated in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanospheres to prepare stable and biocompatible QDs-loaded nanospheres for in vivo imaging. QDs were encapsulated with PLGA nanospheres by a solid dispersion method and optimized to have high fluorescence intensity for in vivo imaging detection. The resultant QDs-loaded PLGA nanospheres were characterized by various analytical techniques such as UV-Vis measurement, dynamic light scattering (DLS), fluorescence spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Finally, we evaluated toxicity and body distribution of QDs loaded in PLGA nanospheres in vitro and in vivo, respectively. From the results, the QDs loaded in PLGA nanospheres were spherical and showed a diameter range of 135.0-162.3 nm in size. The QD nanospheres increased their stability against photooxidation and photobleaching, which have the high potential for applications in biomedical imaging. We have also attained non-invasive in vivo imaging with light photons, representing an intriguing avenue for obtaining biological information by the use of NIR light.
