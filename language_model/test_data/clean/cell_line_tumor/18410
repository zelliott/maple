Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is characterized by an abnormality in craniofacial development during early embryogenesis. TCS is caused by mutations in the gene TCOF1, which encodes the nucleolar phosphoprotein treacle. Genetic and proteomic characterizations of TCS/treacle are based on the previously reported 26 exons of TCOF1. Here, we report the identification of 231-nucleotide (nt) exon 6A (between exons 6 and 7) and 108-nt exon 16A (between exons 16 and 17). Isoforms with exon 6A are up to 3.7-fold more abundant than alternatively spliced variants without exon 6A, but only minor isoforms contain exon 16A. Exon 6A encodes a peptide sequence containing basic and acidic domains similar to 10 other exons of TCOF1. Unlike the other exons, exon 6A encodes a nuclear localization signal (NLS) which does not, however, alter the nucleolar localization of full-length treacle. The discovery of exons 6A and 16A is relevant to mutational analysis of the TCOF1 gene in TCS patients, and to functional analysis of its gene product.
