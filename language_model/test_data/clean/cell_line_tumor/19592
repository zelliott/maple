Although the structure has been elucidated for the binding of colchicine and podophyllotoxin as potent destabilizer for microtubule formation, very little is known about MDL-27048, a competitive inhibitor for colchicine and podophyllotoxin. The structural basis for the interaction of antimitotic agents with tubulin was investigated by molecular modeling, and we propose binding models for MDL-27048 against tubulin. The proposed model was not only consistent with previous competition experiment data between colchicine and MDL-27048, but further suggested an additional binding cavity on tubulin. Based on this finding from the proposed MDL-tubulin complex, we performed molecular design studies to identify new antimitotic agents. These new chalcone derivatives exerted growth inhibitory effects on all four human hepatoma and one renal epithelial cell lines tested and induced strong cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase. Furthermore, these compounds exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on tubulin polymerization in vitro. Therefore, we suggest that the validated MDL-27048 model would serve as a potent platform for designing new molecular entities for anticancer agents targeted to microtubules.
