CD24, a mucin-like adhesion molecule that enhances the metastatic potential of malignant cells, has been suggested to be a marker of poor prognosis in breast carcinomas. The tumor-initiating potential of CD44posCD24pos cell populations has been recently recognized and, accordingly, distant metastases are largely composed of CD24-positive cells in breast cancer patients refractory to treatment. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies aimed at down-regulating CD24 may negatively regulate the dissemination of tumor cells and formation of metastasis. Here, we reveal that suppression of CD24 protein expression is a crucial event in the molecular mechanisms underlying the growth-inhibitory effects of the anti-diabetic drug metformin in MDA-MB-468 triple-negative (basal-like) breast cancer cells. First, we confirmed that, among the different molecular classes of breast cancer, basal-like breast cancer cells were significantly more sensitive to the growth-inhibitory effects of metformin. Second, we observed a positive correlation between the growth inhibitory activity of metformin and the relative enrichment in cells bearing the CD44posCD24pos immunophenotype. Third, high-content indirect immunofluorescence imaging assays revealed that CD24 protein levels were drastically decreased in the presence of growth-inhibitory concentrations of metformin. Fourth, to preliminary assess the clinical relevance of metformin's anti-CD24 effects we took advantage of the recently developed ROCK online interface (http://rock.icr.ac.uk/), a publicly accessible portal that allows rapid integration of breast cancer functional and molecular profiling datasets. When we evaluated the impact of CD24 expression on distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) in microarray gene expression breast cancer datasets, Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and log-rank tests comparing DMSF for CD24-high and CD24-low breast carcinomas revealed that patients with CD24-high tumors tended to have a shorter DMFS. These findings, altogether, suggest that the ability of metformin to suppress the oncogene, metastasis promoter and breast cancer stem cell marker CD24 may open a novel molecular avenue in the therapeutic management of highly-metastastic subgroups of triple-negative (basal-like) breast cancers naturally enriched with CD44posCD24pos tumor-initiating cell populations.
