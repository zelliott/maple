Various studies in vitro suggest that low electric and magnetic fields may modify cancer cell growth and recent studies in vivo have revealed anti-tumoral effects. After screening different tumor cell lines, we identified specific sequences of localized magnetic and electric fields (MESQ) that reduce cancer cell survival in vitro. This finding led us to design an experiment to determine the actual efficacy of above sequences in selectively destabilizing tumor cells and their effect on healthy cells.

We exposed the MCF7 cancer cell line and normal fibroblasts to MESQ for 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours, evaluating cell survival and induction of apoptosis.

Exposure to MESQ reduced MCF7 survival, inducing apoptosis in a timedependent way, whereas fibroblasts were completely unaffected.

These results have promising implications for the treatment of cancer and warrant further research.
