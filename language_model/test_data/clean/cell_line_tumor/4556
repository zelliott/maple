Isomeric oxathiolone fused chalcones were prepared by condensation of appropriate acetylbenzo[1,3]oxathiol-2-ones with benzaldehydes under acidic conditions. The synthesized compounds were screened for cytotoxic activity using HeLa cells, as well as for antibacterial activity against Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, antifungal activity against Candida albicans, and tuberculostatic activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37)Rv and Mycobacterium kansasii strains.
