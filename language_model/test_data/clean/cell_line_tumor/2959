Previously, we discovered linomide analogues as novel HIV-1 integrase (IN) inhibitors. Here, to make possible structure-activity relationships, we report on the design and synthesis of a series of substituted dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acids. The crystal structure of the representative compound 2c has also been solved. Among the eight new analogues, 2e showed a potency in inhibiting IN strand transfer catalytic activity similar to the reference diketo acid inhibitor L-731,988 (IC(50)=0.9 microM vs. 0.54 microM, for 2e and L-731,988, respectively). Furthermore, none of the compounds showed significant cytotoxicity in two tested cancer cell lines. These compounds represent an interesting prototype of IN inhibitors, potentially involved in a metal chelating mechanism, and further optimization is warranted.
