RPMI 1640 culture medium was chosen to simulate body fluids, and after exposure to 0.085 approximately 0.092 T static magnetic fields (SMF), surface tension, pH, dissolved oxygen, and UV-visible spectrum were measured. Compared with the control group in the normal geomagnetic field, the pH value increased about 0.14 units, dissolved oxygen increased about 14%, and the UV-visible spectra were different in peak intensity but without a shift in the peak. Surface tension showed no significant difference in the two groups. This data suggests that SMF can change some of the physical and chemical properties of RPM1 1640 solution, and may contribute to understanding biological effects of SMF.
