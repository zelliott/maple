To evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic potential of a new protein-binding contrast medium, B22956/1, for quantitatively characterizing tumor microvessels by MRI and monitoring response to antiangiogenic therapy.

Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) was performed in an experimental cancer model with the use of the novel protein-binding agent B22956/1, a low molecular contrast agent (ProHance), and a macromolecular contrast medium, albumin-(Gd-DTPA). MDA-MB-435, a human cancer cell line, was implanted in 22 athymic rats. Animals were assigned randomly to a control (saline) or drug-treated (Avastin) group. MRI was performed at baseline and after nine days of treatment. The transendothelial permeability (KPS) and the fractional blood volume (fBV) were estimated from the kinetic analysis of dynamic MR data using a two-compartment model. Tumor growth was also measured from volumetric MRI.

Tumors grew more slowly, although not significantly (P=0.07), in the drug-treated group. The KPS determined for B22956/1 decreased significantly in the drug-treated group compared to baseline (P <0.05), and progressed significantly in the control group. However, no significant changes were resolved with the use of ProHance or albumin-(Gd-DTPA).

With the use of appropriate contrast media, the therapeutic effects of an anti-VEGF antibody on tumor microvessels can be monitored by dynamic MRI. The dynamic range of permeability to B22956/1, and the sensitivity to change of this parameter suggest a potential application in the clinical setting.
