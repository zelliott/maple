Using a chemoproteomic strategy, we recently demonstrated the expression of teneurin-2, a transmembrane glycoprotein, in the majority of malignant mesothelioma cell lines. This finding was unexpected since no formally organized evidence existed to implicate teneurins in human malignancy. For this reason, here we provide a comprehensive review on the expression of teneurins in human tumors and cell lines. Current evidence supports the aberrant expression of teneurins in various tumor types, their involvement in cancer-related regulatory networks, and their potential participation in drug resistance. Structural attributes of teneurins could enable the detection of shedded forms in body fluids for clinical applications.
