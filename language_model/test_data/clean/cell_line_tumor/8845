Alpha-solanine, a naturally steroidal glycoalkaloid, is found in leaves and fruits of plants as a defensive agent against fungi, bacteria and insects. Herein, we investigated solanine toxicity in vitro and in vivo, and assessed its protective and the therapeutic effects on a typical animal model of breast cancer. The study conducted in three series of experiments to obtain (i) solanine effects on cell viability of mammary carcinoma cells, (ii) in vivo toxicity of solanine, and (iv) the protective and therapeutic effects of solanine on animal model of breast cancer. Alpha-solanine significantly suppressed proliferation of mouse mammary carcinoma cells both in vitro and in vivo ( p<0.05). Under the dosing procedure, 5 mg/kg solanine has been chosen for assessing its protective and therapeutic effects in mice breast cancer. Tumor take rate in the solanine-treated group was zero compared with a 75% rate in its respective control group ( p<0.05). The average tumor size and weight were significantly lower in solanine-treated animals than its respective control ones ( p<0.05). Proapoptotic Bax protein expression increased in breast tumor by solanine compared with its respective control group ( p<0.05). Antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression found to be lower in solanine-treated animals ( p<0.05). Proliferative and angiogenic parameters greatly decreased in solanine-treated mice ( p<0.05). Data provide evidence that solanine exerts a significant chemoprotective and chemotherapeutic effects on an animal model of breast cancer through apoptosis induction, cell proliferation and angiogenesis inhibition. These findings reveal a new therapeutic potential for solanine in cancer.
