High-mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) protein acts as an oncofoetal transcriptional regulator. In mesenchymal tissues, its expression can be induced by a variety of growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF1) and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) as well as by foetal bovine serum (FBS), thus enhancing proliferation.

To examine these effects in epithelial malignancies, we used the PC-3 prostate cancer cell line for assaying proliferation and HMGA2 expression in response to incubation with growth factors and FBS. The HMGA2 locus was investigated by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) for loss, amplification or re-arrangement.

PC-3 is a cell line that moderately overexpresses HMGA2. None of the growth factors nor FBS caused significantly increased expression of HMGA2. In contrast, a significantly augmented proliferation rate was observed when applying FGF1 or PDGF-BB for 12 h.

HMGA2 is expressed independently of external stimuli, whereas proliferation stimulated by growth factors is independent of further elevated HMGA2 expression.
