Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are thought to have potential as a new generation of anti-cancer drugs. Since invasiveness, the main characteristic of malignant behaviour, is believed to depend on altered cell-matrix interactions, we investigated the effect of two potent TKIs, genistein and tyrphostin AG-1478, on the interaction of prostate cancer cells with extracellular matrix components. PC-3 and DU-145 cells were treated with various concentrations of genistein and tyrphostin AG-1478. Adhesion to extracellular matrix was assayed using fluorescence-labelled cells seeded on collagen type I, collagen type IV, fibronectin, laminin and vitronectin. The expression levels of integrin beta1, alpha2, alpha3 and alpha5 subunits were measured using flow cytometry of cells labelled with monoclonal murine antibodies. Genistein treatment reduced the ability of both cell lines to adhere to the matrix proteins tested. This effect was more pronounced for PC-3 cells than for DU-145 cells. Genistein treatment decreased the expression of beta1 integrins by 40% in PC-3 cells and 22% in DU-145. AG-1478 treatment slightly reduced the ability of DU-145 cells to adhere, but did not decrease PC-3 cell adhesion. Nevertheless, expression levels were reduced for most integrins tested, except the expression of alpha-5, for which no significant effect was measured. Our results point to a possible role of TKIs as suppressors of prostate carcinoma cell adhesion to extracellular matrix components, by acting as inhibitors of integrin expression.
