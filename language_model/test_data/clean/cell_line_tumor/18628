Increased expression of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) and ErbB-2 is implicated into the development and progression of breast cancer. Constant ligand-induced activation of EGFR and ErbB-2 receptor-tyrosine kinases is thought to be involved in the transformation of fibroblasts and mammary epithelial cells. Data herein show that ligand stimulation of cells that express both the EGFR and the ErbB-2 may result either in cell proliferation or apoptosis depending on the expression levels of EGFR and ErbB-2. Mammary tumor cells that express low levels of both receptors or high levels of ErbB-2 and low levels of EGFR survive and proliferate in the presence of EGF. In contrast, fibroblastic cells or mammary tumor cells, which co-express high levels of EGFR and ErbB-2 invariably undergo apoptosis in response to EGF. In these cells persistent activation of p38 MAPK is an essential element of the apoptotic mechanism. Also, the data implicate a p38-dependent change in mitochondrial membrane permeability as a downstream effector of apoptosis. Ligand-dependent apoptosis in cells co-expressing high levels of EGFR and ErbB-2 could be a natural mechanism that protects tissues from unrestricted proliferation in response to the sustained activation of receptor-tyrosine kinases.
