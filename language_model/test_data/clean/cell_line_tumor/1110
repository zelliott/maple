It has been shown that endoribonuclease activity of alpha-RNP particles and 26S proteasomes are changed under the action of inductors of programmed cell death. Treatment of K562 cells with inductors of apoptosis--doxorubicin (adriamycin) and diethylmaleate--lead to a significant stimulation of RNAse activity of alpha-RNP and to reduction of proteasome RNase activity. The enzymatic activity under study has been shown to be specifically and selectively dependent on phosphorylation of subunits of alpha-RNP particles and 26S proteasomes. The characteristics of RNAse activity of different subpopulations of proteasomes differ. The specificity of a subpopulation of proteasomes exported from the cell has been demonstrated. Proteasome and alpha-RNP involvement in the coordinated control of stability of various specific messenger RNA molecules is suggested, and one of the mechanisms of this control might be the export of specific subpopulation of proteasomes from the cell.
