To further study the effect of apoptin in inducing cancer cell specific apoptosis and the possible applications in cancer therapy.

Apoptin gene was amplified by PCR and inserted into pcDNA3.1(+) with a FLAG tag in front of the multi-cloning-site. Apoptin gene with the FLAG tag was sub-cloned into an adenovirus vector. Several cancer cell lines were transfected with pcDNA3.1/FLAG/apoptin or infected with apoptin containing recombinant adenoviruses to study the morphologic changes. Ad/apoptin infected cells were also analyzed by flowcytometry after staining with PI.

Expressed apoptin was localized in the nucleus of cancer cells. Chromatin condensation occurred 2 or 3 days after Ad/apoptin(+) infection. Cell number in G(2)-M phase increased dramatically after Ad/apoptin(+) infection.

Apoptin can induce cell cycle G(2)-M arrest and chromatin condensation in cancer cells.
