In this study, we demonstrate a correlation between T antigen expression on a panel of human carcinoma cell lines and their sensitivity to porcine NK cell lysis. Specifically, the more T antigen is expressed, the more sensitive the cancer cells are to porcine NK cell lysis. Furthermore, this correlation also exists for these cells and their ability to induce tumors in vivo. In this porcine animal model, the less T antigen is expressed, the more prolific the tumor growth in vivo and vice versa. Using the human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line SW-48, we used limiting dilution to clone 2 populations of cells, one expressing high and the other low levels of T antigen, clones 143 and 111, respectively. In these cloned cells, the clone that expressed more T antigen was more NK-sensitive in vitro and weakly induced tumor growth in vivo. Inversely, the clone that expressed less T antigen clone was more NK-resistant in vitro and grew more prolific tumors in vivo. Using soluble T antigen in a competitive inhibition assay, there was a decrease in porcine NK cell killing of the T antigen+ human cell line Colo 320HSR. Taken together, these findings suggest a novel role for T antigen in the NK cell recognition of cancer cells, specifically as markers for NK sensitivity in carcinoma cell lines. The significance of T antigens as targets for NK cell-mediated lysis is novel and identifies NK cell-T antigen interactions as potentially significant in the immunotherapy of cancer and its associated metastases.
