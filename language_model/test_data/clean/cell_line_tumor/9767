A unique acquisition method is proposed for quantitative, high-sensitivity (19)F MR spectroscopic imaging for the study of drug distribution aiming at nmol-level metabolite information in mice. The use of fast spin echo (FSE) at 9.4T allowed us to obtain whole-body images with minimal effect of magnetic susceptibility and to acquire several metabolite signals simultaneously by the method of interleaved multifrequency selection. Modified 2-shot FSE was designed for simultaneous, high-sensitivity (19)F imaging and T(2) mapping. A time course study including all the main metabolites at 10-minute resolution was attained with an oral dose of 1-2 mmol 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (130-260 mg)/kg in mice. With acquisition parameters optimized for in vivo T(2) of 40 ms, images of F-nucleotides/-sides, effective anabolites of the anticancer drug 5-FU, were obtained at the level of 200 nmol in the tumor for all the mice studied with a linear correlation (R = 0.96) between image intensity and the quantity determined in the excised tissue. The method exhibits potential capability of molecular imaging with a variety of (19)F-labeled compounds and drug evaluation.
