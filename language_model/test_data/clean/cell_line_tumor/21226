This study evaluates whether the inhibitory effects of prednisolone phosphate (PLP) encapsulated in long-circulating liposomes (LCL-PLP) on tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis described previously can be generalized to other types of glucocorticoids (GC) encapsulated in LCL (LCL-GC). Four types of synthetic GC, i.e. budesonide disodium phosphate (BUP), dexamethasone disodium phosphate (DXP), methylprednisolone disodium phosphate (MPLP), and PLP, were selected based on the difference in their potency to activate the human glucocorticoid receptor. The effects of all LCL-GC on the production of angiogenic/inflammatory factors in vivo in the B16.F10 murine melanoma model as well as on the viability and proliferation of tumor cells and endothelial cells in vitro were investigated. Our results show that all four selected LCL-GC formulations inhibit tumor growth, albeit to different degrees. The differences in antitumor activity of LCL-GC correlate with their efficacy to suppress tumor angiogenesis and inflammation. The strongest antitumor effect is achieved by LCL-encapsulated BUP (LCL-BUP), due to the highest potency of BUP versus the other three GC types. The in vitro results presented herein suggest that LCL-BUP has strong cytotoxic effects on B16.F10 melanoma cells and the anti-proliferative effects of all LCL-GC towards angiogenic endothelial cells play a role in their antitumor activity.
