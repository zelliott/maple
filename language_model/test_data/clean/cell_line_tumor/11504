MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous molecules that post-transcriptionally regulate target gene expression and play an important role in many developmental processes. Matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE) is related to bone metabolism. We recently reported that MEPE protects cells from DNA damage-induced killing. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether miRNAs targeting MEPE play an important role in DNA damage response. We report in this study that miR-376a directly targets MEPE, and overexpression of miR-376a reduces the G2 arrest of the cells and sensitizes the cells to DNA damage-induced killing. These results indicate an association of MEPE gene inactivation with decreased survival after DNA damage and also provide useful information for miRNA-based drug development: a new target for sensitizing human tumor cells to radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
