It is well known that small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SNEC) arising at extrapulmonary sites has a poor prognosis and an interesting biological characterization. To understand biological characterization and elucidation of the origin of the histogenesis of SNEC, we report the establishment of a new SNEC cell line and characteristics of neuroendocrine properties including neuronal differentiation by treatment with dibutyryl cyclic AMP (db-cAMP).

We established a new cell line (SNEC-MI) derived from SNEC of the maxillary sinus by a modified spill-out method, and verified neuroendocrine properties including neuronal differentiation by immunocytochemical and immunoblotting methods.

The established cell line showed spherical or spindle shape in monolayer culture and was positive for neuron-specific enolase (NSE), neuronal cell adhesion protein (N-CAM, CD56) and gastrin-releasing peptide. NSE was also demonstrated in the cultured medium and dense-core neuroendocrine granules were detected ultrastructurally in the cytoplasm. Treatment of cells with db-cAMP markedly induced the development and elongation of neuronal processes, which formed a netlike arrangement. Characterization of these elongated neuronal processes revealed them immunoreacting intensely with high molecular-weight neurofilament, and a time-dependent increase of microtubule-associated protein-2 in cell lysates.

These findings indicated that this cell line possesses the capability to differentiate into neuronal cells, and supported the hypothesis that extrapulmonary SNEC might be derived from a pluripotent stem cell.
