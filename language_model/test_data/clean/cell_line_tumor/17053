Increased glycolysis is among the biochemical characteristics of cancerous tissue. The glucose transporter isoform 1 (GLUT1) gene encodes a key factor for glucose transport into cancerous tissue. However, the expression and functional significance of GLUT1 in neuroblastoma have not been fully characterized. Therefore, we investigated the association of GLUT1 expression with clinical outcomes in patients with neuroblastoma using immunohistochemical staining for GLUT1 in neuroblastoma tissues. We also assessed the efficacy of glycolysis inhibition as an anticancer treatment in neuroblastoma cell lines with altered expression of GLUT1.

We obtained total RNA from cancerous tissue by microdissection in 47 patients with neuroblastoma. GLUT1 expression levels were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. We analyzed the association of GLUT1 expression levels with clinical outcomes. We also examined changes in GLUT1 expression and proliferative responses in vitro using 4 neuroblastoma cell lines treated with a glycolysis inhibitor, 3-Bromopyruvate acid.

Elevated GLUT1 expression was associated with poor prognosis. Moreover, elevated GLUT1 expression independently predicted overall survival. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that GLUT1 expression tended to be localized to the centers of neuroblastoma cell nests. Our in vitro studies showed that 3-Bromopyruvate acid significantly suppressed the proliferation of neuroblastoma cells with high GLUT1 gene expression compared with those with low expression.

Glycolysis inhibitors are a potential therapeutic option for treating aggressive tumors expressing GLUT1.
