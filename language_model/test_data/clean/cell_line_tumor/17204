We developed a new experimental animal model of human multiple myeloma using immunodeficient NOD/SCID/gammac(null) (NOG) mice. A human myeloma cell line, U266, was intravenously inoculated into 20 NOG mice, all of which developed hind leg paralysis and distress around 6 weeks after transplantation. Pathological studies showed that only the bone marrow was infiltrated with U266 cells, and no cells were present in other organs. Osteolytic lesions in cortical bones and loss of trabecular bones were prominent in U266-transplanted NOG mice. In contrast, U266 cells were not detected in CB17scid or NOD/SCID mice 6 weeks after intravenous inoculation. Human IgE, produced by U266 cells, was detected in the serum of U266-transplanted NOG mice by ELISA. The results indicated that this hu-myeloma NOG model might be useful for studying the pathogenesis of myeloma and related osteolytic lesions, and are suggestive of its applicability to the future development of new drugs.
