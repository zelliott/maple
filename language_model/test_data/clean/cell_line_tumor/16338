A rhenium tris-carbonyl derivative has been designed to couple infrared and luminescent detection in cells. Both spectroscopies are consistent with one another; they point out the reliability of the present SCoMPI (for Single Core Multimodal Probe for Imaging) for bimodal imaging and unambiguously indicate a localization at the Golgi apparatus in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.
