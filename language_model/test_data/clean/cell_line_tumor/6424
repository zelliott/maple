To generate the cancer stem cells (CSCs) specific protein CD133 polyclonal antibody for the study of the biological characteristics of CSCs in tumor tissues and CSCs screening for the mouse model.

The extracellular peptide of the human CD133 was injected into rabbits to generate polyclonal antibody which was used for glioblastoma(GBM) Western blot and immunohistochemistry.

The CD133 antiserum we made could detect both overexpressed myc-CD133 and endogenous CD133 efficiently by Western blot. Immunohistochemistry indicated that the CD133 polyclonal antibody can label CSCs in GBM sections.

High efficient and specific CD133 antibody was generated successfully and could be used to label CSCs in tumor sections and screen CSCs for the mouse model.
