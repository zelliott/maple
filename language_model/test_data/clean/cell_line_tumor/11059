GnRH, acts via the GnRH receptor (GnRHR), plays a pivotal role in human reproduction by stimulating the synthesis and secretion of gonadotropins from pituitary gonadotropes. Studies have also suggested that it has other extra-pituitary functions. To date, the transcriptional regulation of human GnRHR gene in the brain remains largely unknown. Recently, the human cerebellar medulloblastoma cell line TE-671 is found to express GnRH. We report here for the first time that GnRHR is also expressed in this neuronal cell line. Treatment with GnRHR agonist stimulated the phosphorylation of both ERK1/2 and JNK in the cells. Moreover, transient transfection of various human GnRHR promoter-luciferase constructs into the cells identified an upstream promoter region located between -2197 and -1018. Important cis-acting regulatory elements were found at -1300/-1018 and -2197/- 1900, as deletion of either region caused a dramatic decrease in the promoter activity. An upstream GnRHR promoter element was identified to be important for basal transcription in the human neuronal TE-671 cells, in contrast to the previous finding that a downstream promoter is responsible for the gonadotrope-specific expression. Furthermore, we showed that antide (GnRHR antagonist) significantly stimulated the GnRHR promoter activity and inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) pathway by staurosporine could also up-regulate the promoter activity in dose- and time-dependent manners. Taken together, these data suggest that activation of the GnRHR by interacting with GnRH may transcriptionally down-regulate itself via the PKC pathway in human neuronal cells.
