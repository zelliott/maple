The objective of this study was to find out which N-terminal segment/s of amyloid precursor protein (APP) has any neurotrophic properties, since soluble APP-alpha (sAPP-alpha) has neurotrophic effects. We investigated neurotrophic properties of eight peptide segments of N-terminal APP. The APP63-73 was able to enhance neuronal growth; augment axonal and cell body growth in human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y. Neurotrophic effects of chronic APP63-73 treatment were assessed in vivo using streptozotocin-induced diabetes and ovariectomized rats. Thus, this study demonstrated that APP63-73 peptide has neurotrophic effects both in vivo and in vitro.
