Interferon-gamma (IFNγ) is a cytokine with roles in immune responses as well as in tumor control. Interferon is often used in cancer treatment together with other therapies. Here we report a novel approach to enhancement of cancer cell killing by combined treatment of IFNγ with ionizing radiation.   We found that IFNγ treatment alone in HeLa cells induced phosphorylation of Chk1 in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and resulted in cell arrest. Moreover IFNγ treatment was correlated with attenuation of Chk1 as the treatment shortened protein half-life of Chk1. As Chk1 is an essential cell cycle regulator for viability after DNA damage, attenuation of Chk1 by IFNγ pre-treatment in HeLa cells resulted in increased cell death following ionizing radiation about 2-folds than ionizing radiation treatment alone whereas IFNγ treatment alone had little effect on cell death.   X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis-associated factor 1 (XAF1), an IFN-induced gene, seems to partly regulate IFNγ-induced Chk1 destabilization and radiation sensitivity because transient depletion of XAF1 by siRNA prevented IFNγ-induced Chk1 attenuation and partly protected cells from IFNγ-enhanced radiation cell killing.   Therefore the results provide a novel rationale to combine IFNγ pretreatment and DNA-damaging anti-cancer drugs such as ionizing radiation to enhance cancer cell killing.
