Previously, NK cells have been reported to kill the opportunistic fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans through a perforin-dependent mechanism; however, the receptor and signaling involved are unknown. In this report we sought to identify the signaling pathways activated and required for direct perforin-mediated killing of microbes. In this study, using the NK-like cell line YT and primary peripheral blood NK cells, it is demonstrated that YT cells kill C. neoformans and that the killing is accompanied by the activation of PI3K. We demonstrate that inhibition of either the catalytic subunit (using a pharmacological inhibitor) or the alpha-regulatory subunit (using small interfering RNA knockdown) of PI3K significantly inhibited the killing of C. neoformans. Downstream of PI3K, ERK1/2 was activated in a PI3K-dependent fashion and was required for cryptococcal killing. Furthermore, we demonstrate that perforin release from YT cells can be detected by 4 h after contact of the YT cells with C. neoformans and that the release of perforin is blocked by pharmacological inhibition of either PI3K or ERK1/2. Defective degranulation is rooted in the inability to polarize perforin-containing granules toward the target. Finally, we demonstrate that PI3K-ERK1/2-dependent signaling is activated and required for the killing of C. neoformans by primary NK cells. Taken together, these data identify a conserved PI3K-ERK1/2 pathway that is used by NK cells during the direct killing of C. neoformans and demonstrate that the pathway is essential in the formation and activation of the microbicidal mechanism.
