We isolated three orange or yellow pigment-producing marine bacteria, strains 04OKA-13-27 (MBIC08261), 04OKA-17-12 (MBIC08260), and YM6-073 (MBIC06409), off the coast of Okinawa Prefecture in Japan. These strains were classified as novel species of the family Flavobacteriaceae based on their 16S rRNA gene sequence. They were cultured, and the major carotenoids produced were purified by chromatographic methods. Their structures were determined by spectral data to be (3R)-saproxanthin (strain 04OKA-13-27), (3R,2'S)-myxol (strain YM6-073), and (3R,3'R)-zeaxanthin (strains YM6-073 and 04OKA-17-12). Saproxanthin and myxol, which are monocyclic carotenoids rarely found in nature, demonstrated significant antioxidative activities against lipid peroxidation in the rat brain homogenate model and a neuro-protective effect from L-glutamate toxicity.
