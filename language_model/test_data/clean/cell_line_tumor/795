To explore the influence of TLSF(JM) on the proportion of alloantigen activated Th1 and Th2-like cell subsets.

TLSF(JM) or IL-4 was added to mixed lymocyte reaction(MLR) system. The influence of TLSF(JM) on the proportion of Th1 and Th2-like cell subsets was analyzed by intracellular immunofluorescence staining and FACS.

In the TLSF(JM) group, the proportion of IFN-gamma(+) cells differentiated from activated lymphoblast descended from 49.8% to 43.1%, IL-4(+) cells from 75.4% to 43.7% and IL-6(+) cells from 67.8% to 52.6%. The similar tendency was also observed in the unactivated small lymphocytes.

TLSF(JM) can inhibit both the Th1 and Th2-like cell subsets, but mainly inhibit the Th2-like cell subset, thereby reducing the proportion of Th2-like cell subsets.
