Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and angiogenic factors is associated with the progression of androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC). We examined the effects of vandetanib, an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR), EGFR, and rearranged during transfection (RET) tyrosine-kinase activities, alone or combined with docetaxel, on PC3 docetaxel-sensitive (PC3wt) or docetaxel-resistant (PC3R) AIPC cell growth in vivo and in vitro.

Mice bearing PC3wt or PC3R tumors were treated for 3 weeks with vandetanib (25 or 50 mg/kg/d p.o., 5 d/wk), docetaxel (10 or 30 mg/kg i.p., 1 d/wk), or their combination (low or high doses). Xenograft tumors were analyzed for expression of Ki-67, EGFR, VEGFR2, and production of VEGFA.

On PC3wt, vandetanib at both doses stimulated tumor growth, whereas docetaxel at both doses exerted strong growth-inhibiting effects. The low-dose vandetanib-docetaxel combination resulted in tumor growth similar to that of control, whereas the high-dose combination induced a significant antiproliferative effect. In contrast, on PC3R, the low-dose of vandetanib had no effect on tumor growth, whereas the high-dose of vandetanib significantly inhibited tumor growth. Docetaxel at both doses exerted moderate and transient antitumor effects. The combination of high-dose vandetanib with high-dose docetaxel resulted in antiproliferative effects, which were lower than expected from the sum of individual drug effects. Importantly, tumor analyses revealed overexpression of the EGFR/VEGFR pathways in PC3R relative to PC3wt.

Present results suggest that vandetanib should not be associated with docetaxel in treatment-naive or docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer (CaP). The use of high-dose vandetanib alone may warrant further investigation in patients with docetaxel-resistant AIPC overexpressing VEGFR/EGFR pathways.
