We investigated the localization of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and three proteins related to intercellular junctions in the McA-RH 7777 rat hepatoma cell line to determine if the formation of junctions between adjacent McA-RH 7777 cells triggers translocation of ALP from cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. Contact between adjacent McA-RH 7777 cells promotes translocation of ALP from the Golgi area of the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane, and also promotes translocation of two proteins, E-cadherin and ZO-1, related to intercellular junctions, from cytoplasm to the plasma membrane.
