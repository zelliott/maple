In Alzheimer's disease amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) is considered to induce cell death. To clarify the molecular mechanism underlying Abeta neurotoxicity, we established the cell line overexpressing wild or mutant (His684Arg) APP in human SH-SY5Y cells. This paper presents that overexpression of wild-APP in the cells (SH/w-APP) increased the levels of APP and Abeta(1-40) but not Abeta(1-42), and reduced Bcl-2 level and proteasome activity with increased susceptibility to oxidative stress. The intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species in SH/w-APP increased significantly by H(2)O(2) treatment. The level of Bcl-2 protein, but not mRNA, was markedly decreased in SH/w-APP cells, which was inversely correlated with APP expression among subcloned SH/w-APP cells. These results indicate that increased expression of wild type APP renders neuronal cells more vulnerable to oxidative stress leading to cell death.
