1alpha,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] is the biological active form of vitamin D. Its antiproliferative capacities make it a potential drug to treat diseases such as cancer. The clinical use of 1,25-(OH)2D3 as an antiproliferative agent is hampered by its calcemic effects. Hence, structural analogs such as the seco-9,11-bisnor-17-methyl analog, WY1112, have been developed with superagonistic capacities. This study aims to distinct the molecular activities of 1,25-(OH)2D3 and WY1112 and identify possible differences in gene expression.

Total RNA was extracted from MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 or WY1112 and was used for microarray analysis.

The experiments revealed that WY1112 induces the same genes as 1,25-(OH)2D3, but the induction level of the individual genes is higher. Microarray analysis did not reveal genes that were exclusively regulated by WY1112.

The superagonistic vitamin D analog WY1112 induces the same set of genes as 1,25-(OH)2D3, but the level of induction of the individual genes is higher.
