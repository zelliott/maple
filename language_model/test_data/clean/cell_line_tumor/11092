To investigate the effects of curcumin on the acetylation of histone H3, P53 and the proliferation of NB4 cells.

The total protein was extracted from NB4 cells treated without or with different concentrations of curcumin ( 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25 and 3.125 micromol/L) for different time (0, 4, 8, 12, 24 h). Western blot analysis was performed to determine the levels of acetylated histone H3, P53 and acetylated P53. MTT assay was performed to examine the growth inhibition effect of curcumin on NB4 cells.

Curcumin could inhibit the proliferation of NB4 cells in a time- and dose- dependent manner, with the IC50 at 24 h and 36 h of 40 micromol/L and 25 micromol/L, respectively. The levels of histone H3 acetylation, P53 expression and P53 acetylation were increased obviously.

Curcumin functions as a deacetylase inhibitor,which could increase the level of acetylated histone H3, enhance the expression and activity of tumor suppressor P53, and inhibit the proliferation of NB4 cells.
