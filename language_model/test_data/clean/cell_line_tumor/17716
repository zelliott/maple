In this study, we show that engagement of CTLA-4 on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from low-dose melphalan (L-phenylalanine mustard (L-PAM))-treated MOPC-315 tumor bearers led to IL-10 secretion. In addition, the inhibitory activity of CTLA-4 ligation for IFN-gamma secretion following stimulation with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 mAb depended on IL-10 production. Consistent with the importance of IL-10 for CTLA-4-mediated inhibition, administration of neutralizing anti-IL-10 mAb to low-dose L-PAM-treated MOPC-315 tumor bearers (administration of blocking anti-CTLA-4 mAb) resulted in enhanced tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte-mediated anti-MOPC-315 cytotoxicity and led to complete tumor eradication in a higher percentage of mice than that observed with low-dose L-PAM alone. The percentage of MOPC-315 tumor-bearing mice cured following administration of neutralizing anti-IL-10 mAb to low-dose L-PAM-treated MOPC-315 tumor bearers was comparable to that observed following administration of blocking anti-CTLA-4 mAb. Moreover, IL-10 neutralization together with CTLA-4 blockade did not provide added therapeutic benefits to low-dose L-PAM-treated MOPC-315 tumor bearers. Taken together, these results indicate that CTLA-4 blockade improves the therapeutic outcome of low-dose L-PAM for MOPC-315 tumor bearers by inhibiting IL-10 secretion as a consequence of blocking CTLA-4 ligation.
