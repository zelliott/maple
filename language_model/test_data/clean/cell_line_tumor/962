Success of human gene therapy depends upon the development of delivery vehicles or vectors, which can selectively deliver therapeutic genes to target cells with efficiency and safety. Previous studies have shown an efficient, systemic trans-gene expression in many cell lines (in vitro) by using an anionic liposomal vector, based on the composition of retroviral envelopes (artificial viral envelopes, AVEs). The AVE-liposomes and their complexes with plasmid (DNA) were characterized according to zeta potential measurements and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We successfully demonstrated that AVE liposomes, dispersed in 10% serum-containing growth medium, efficiently delivered plasmid DNA to HuH-7 (human hepatoma cell line) cells. We assessed the utility of liver-targeted vesicles as a drug/gene delivery system for the treatment of liver diseases. We found that small unilamellar AVE vesicles containing 15 mol% digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) are efficiently targeted to the liver via the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor.
