Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is becoming an increasingly popular vertebrate cancer             model. In this study, we established a xenotransplanted zebrafish embryo glioma             model to further investigate the molecular mechanisms of tumor angiogenesis. We             find that the glioma cell line U87 can survive, proliferate and induce additional             SIV branches in zebrafish embryos. In addition, by the means of in situ hybridization             and quantitive RT-PCR analyses we find that the transplanted U87 cells can induce             the ectopic zebrafish vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF A) and its receptor             VEGFR2/KDR mRNA expression and increase their expression levels, resulting in             additional SIV branches.
