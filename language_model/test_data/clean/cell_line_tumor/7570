Gallic acid (GA), a natural agent, is widely distri-buted in plants with a range of biological effects and has been of potential interest as anticancer agent. However, its effects on chondrosarcoma cell apoptosis are still undefined. In the present study, the possible mechanisms of GA-induced apoptosis were explored in SW1353 cells, a human chondrosarcoma cell line. Our results showed that GA inhibited cell viability dose- and time-dependently. Morphological examination of GA-treated cells exhibited the typical features of cell death, such as rounding up of the cells and cell shrinkage. Wound-healing assay indicated that GA inhibited the migratory abilities of SW1353 cells. Hoechst 33258 staining assay and Annexin V/PI staining assay exhibited apoptosis induction by GA. To determine the molecular mechanism of GA-induced apoptosis, the expression levels Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3 and caspase-9 were determined in SW1353 cells treated with GA. We found that GA downregulated the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, and upregulated the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, and the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9. To identify the possible mechanisms, the changes of microRNA expression were tested using the miRCURYâ„¢ LNA expression array. It was observed that the miR-518b gene was upregulated in treated cells. Taken together, these data show that GA induces apoptosis and inhibits cell migration by upregulating miR-518b in SW1353 cells.
