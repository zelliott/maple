Cultured rat astrocytes and C6 rat glioma were used as a differential screen for a variety of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (THI) derivatives. Compound 1 [1-(biphenyl-4-ylmethyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-6,7-diol hydrochloride] selectively blocked the growth of C6 glioma leaving normal astrocytes relatively unaffected. The potential for clinical utility of 1 was further substantiated in human gliomas and other tumor cell lines. Preliminary SAR of this activity was characterized by synthesis and testing of several THI and conformationally flexible variants.
