Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is an ideal biomarker for prostate cancer. A previously reported 2-5A conjugate RBI1033 (3) showed binding affinity more than 10 times higher than the parent urea-based compound (S)-2-(3-((S)-5-amino-1-carboxypentyl)ureido) pentanedioic acid (1). The purpose of this work is to further optimize the structure of 3 to identify highly selective ligands of PSMA. It was found that conjugates having 2-5A in their structure showed extraordinary improved binding affinity to PSMA compared with compound 1. Removal of 2-5A significantly reduced its biological activity. The results will provide a path to agents for targeted imaging and treatment of prostate cancer.
