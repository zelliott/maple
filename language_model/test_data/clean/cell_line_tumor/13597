To explore the influence of three central venous catheter biomedical materials (polyurethane, silicone, and polyvinyl chloride) on the proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle of Xuanwei Lung Cancer-05 (XWLC-05) cells so as to provide the basis for clinical choice of central venous catheter.

XWLC-05 cells were cultured and subcultured, and the cells at passage 3 were cultured with polyurethane, silicone, and polyvinyl chloride (1.0 cm x 1.0 cm in size), and only cells served as a control. At 24, 48, and 72 hours after cultured, MTT assay was used to detect the cellular proliferation and flow cytometry to detect the cell cycle and apoptosis. At 72 hours after cultured, inverted microscope was used to observe the cell growth.

Inverted microscope showed the cells grew well in control group, polyurethane group, and silicone group. In polyvinyl chloride group, the cells decreased, necrosed, and dissolved; residual adherent cells had morphologic deformity and decreased transmittance. At 24 and 48 hours, no significant difference in proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle was found among 4 groups (P > 0.05). At 72 hours, the proliferations of XWLC-05 cells in three material groups were significantly inhibited when compared with control group (P < 0.05), and the cells in polyvinyl chloride group had more significant proliferation inhibition than polyurethane group and silicone group (P < 0.05), but there was no signifcant difference in proliferation inhibition between polyurethane group and silicone group (P > 0.05). Compared with the control group, three material groups had significant impact on the rate of apoptosis and cell cycle: polyvinyl chloride group was the most remarkable, followed by silicone group, polyurethane group was minimum (P < 0.05).

Polyvinyl chloride can significantly impact the proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle of XWLC-05 cells; polyurethane has better biocompatibility than polyvinyl chloride and silicone.
