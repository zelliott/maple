To determine the expression of miR-130a in cisplatin resistant cell lines of ovarian cancer and its impact on cisplatin resistance.

Cisplatin resistant ovarian cancer cell lines were established by stepwise selection with gradual increase of cisplatin. MTT assay was applied to indentify the cisplatin resistant cell lines and determine their resistance index. The expression of miR-130a was measured by SYBR green real-time PCR.

The resistance index of A2780/CIS1, A2780/CIS2 and SKOV3/CIS was 30.2, 5.3 and 24.5 respectively. The SYBR green real-time PCR showed that miR-130a was over-expressed in all of the cisplatin resistant cell lines (P < 0.05). The expression of miR-130a was 30.51 times higher in A2780/CIS1, 4.87 times higher in A2780/CIS2 and 24.43 times higher in SKOV3/CIS than in their parental cell lines (P < 0.05), which was almost equally reflected in their resistance index.

The over expression of miR-130a is associated with cisplatin resistance of ovarian cancer. Inhibiting miR-130a expression may help reverse the cisplatin resistance of ovarian cancer. miR-130a is expected to be a new potential target of genetic therapy for cisplatin resistant ovarian cancer.
