It is hypothesized that anti-inflammatory drugs regulate breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) expression. Hence, we examined the effects of indomethacin and dexamethasone on BCRP expression in MCF cells. For evaluation of BCRP mRNA expression, relative quantitative PCR and comparative C1 method was exploited. BCRP protein expression was measured flow cytometrically with the monoclonal antibody (mAb) BXP-21. Dexamethasone showed a dose-independent and a time-dependent effect on decreasing the mRNA level of BCRP gene in comparison with control in MCF-7 and MCF-7/MX breast cancer cell lines, whereas no changes were noted in the presence of indomethacin. The level of BCRP protein, expressed as a ratio of the corresponding control, was decreased in dexamethasone-treated MCF-7/MX cells. These results could be of great importance when combination therapy protocols with cytotoxic agents and dexamethasone regimens are considered in breast cancer patients.
