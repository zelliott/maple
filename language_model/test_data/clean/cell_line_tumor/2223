The distinguishable morphologic features of nuclei of acute myelogenous leukemia cells with enlarged size and finely distributed nuclear chromatin indicate incomplete chromosome condensation that can be related to elevated gene expression. To confirm this, interphase chromosome structures were studied in exponentially growing rat myelomonocytic leukemia 1 cells isolated at the University of Debrecen (My1/De cells). This cell line was established from primary rat leukemia chemically induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene treatment. The enlarged nuclei of My1/De cells allowed improved fluorescent visualization of chromosomal structures. Increased resolution revealed major interphase intermediates consisting of (1) veil-like chromatin, (2) chromatin ribbon, (3) chromatin funnel, (4) chromatin bodies, (5) elongated prechromosomes, (6) seal-ring, spiral shaped, and circular chromosomal subunits, (7) elongated, bent, u- and v-shaped prechromosomes, and (8) metaphase chromosomes. Results confirmed the existence of the chromatin funnel, the first visible interphase chromosome generated by the supercoiling of the chromatin ribbon. Other intermediates not seen previously included the spiral subunits that are involved in the chromonemic folding of metaphase chromosomes. The existence of spiral subunits favors the helical coil model of chromosome condensation. Incomplete chromatin condensation in leukemia cells throughout the cell cycle is an indication of euchromatization contributing to enhanced gene expression and is regarded as a leukemic factor.
