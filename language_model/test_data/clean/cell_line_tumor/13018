Aurora-A kinase is frequently overexpressed/activated in various types of human malignancy, including prostate cancer. In this study, we demonstrate elevated levels of Aurora-A in androgen-refractory LNCaP-RF but not androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells, which prompted us to examine whether Aurora-A regulates the androgen receptor (AR) and whether elevated Aurora-A is involved in androgen-independent cell growth. We show that ectopic expression of Aurora-A induces AR transactivation activity in the presence and absence of androgen. Aurora-A interacts with AR and phosphorylates AR at Thr(282) and Ser(293) in vitro and in vivo. Aurora-A induces AR transactivation activity in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Ectopic expression of Aurora-A in LNCaP cells induces prostate-specific antigen expression and cell survival, whereas knockdown of Aurora-A sensitizes LNCaP-RF cells to apoptosis and cell growth arrest. These data indicate that AR is a substrate of Aurora-A and that elevated Aurora-A could contribute to androgen-independent cell growth by phosphorylation and activation of AR.
