Recently, we have reported that (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG) acts as an inhibitor of degranulation. However, the inhibitory mechanism for degranulation is still poorly understood. Here we show that suppression of exocytosis-related myosin II regulatory light chain phosphorylation and alteration of actin remodeling are involved in the inhibitory effect of EGCG on the calcium ionophore-induced degranulation from human basophilic KU812 cells. Surface plasmon resonance assay also revealed that EGCG binds to the cell surface, and the disruption of lipid rafts resulted in reduction of EGCG's ability. We have previously identified the raft-associated 67kDa laminin receptor (67LR) as an EGCG receptor on the cell surface. Treatment of the cells with anti-67LR antibody or RNA interference-mediated downregulation of 67LR expression abolished the effects of EGCG. These findings suggest that EGCG-induced inhibition of the degranulation includes the primary binding of EGCG to the cell surface 67LR and subsequent modulation of cytoskeleton.
