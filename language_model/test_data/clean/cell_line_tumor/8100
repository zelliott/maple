Photodynamic therapy (PDT) using methyl aminolaevulinate (MAL) provides a new, approved method for treatment of skin cancer and its precursors. However, MAL-based PDT is not very efficient for poorly differentiated skin carcinoma. Thus, novel strategies to enhance the PDT effect are needed.

In order to improve the efficacy of MAL-based PDT, we investigated the effect of adding calcitriol, a prodifferentiation hormone, to human squamous cell carcinoma A431 cells in vitro.

A short course (24 h) of calcitriol pretreatment was applied in A431 cells, and, subsequently, MAL-induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) was measured.

Calcitriol pretreatment of the cells elevated their PpIX levels. Furthermore, the cell damage after exposure to blue light was significantly higher in calcitriol-treated cells. Increased photoinactivation correlated with higher levels of PpIX in the calcitriol-pretreated cells.

Calcitriol enhances MAL-based PDT in A431 cells.
