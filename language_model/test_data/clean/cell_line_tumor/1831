Pancreatic cancer is a highly aggressive malignant disease. Gemcitabine             is currently the standard first-line chemotherapeutic agent for pancreatic cancer.             As members of apoptosis inhibitors, Survivin and XIAP play an important role in             chemotherapy resistance in pancreatic cancer. Emodin has therapeutic potential             against cancers. This study was designed to investigate whether combination therapy             with gemcitabine and emodin enhanced antitumor efficacy in pancreatic cancer.             The application of the combination therapy triggered significantly higher frequency             of pancreatic cancer cell apoptosis. Our research demonstrated that the combination             of emodin and gemcitabine resulted in significantly reduced tumor volumes compared             to gemcitabine or emodin treatment alone. Immunohistochemistry and western immunoblot             analyses showed that Survivin and XIAP expression were downregulated in emodin             and the combination groups compared to the other two groups. Reverse transcriptase             polymerase chain reaction analyses showed that Survivin and XIAP mRNA expression             in emodin and the combination groups were downregulated significantly compared             to the other two groups. Furthermore, the expression of the nuclear transcription             factor κB (NF-κB) protein and NF-κB mRNA were downregulated in the emodin and             the combination groups. DNA-binding activity of NF-κB was inhibited in emodin             and combination groups compared to the other groups. This study suggests that             emodin potentiates the antitumor effects of gemcitabine in PANC-1 cell xenografts             via promotion of apoptosis and IAP suppression.
