We herein report a faster and less cumbersome synthesis of the biologically attractive, alpha-galactosyl ceramide (alpha-GalCer), known as KRN7000, and its analogues. More importantly, the use of a silicon tethered intramolecular glycosylation reaction gave easy access to the diglycosyl ceramide Gal(alpha1-->2)GalCer, which has been shown to require uptake and processing to the biologically active alpha-GalCer derivative.
