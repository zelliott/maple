Oxidative stress has long been linked to cell death in many neurodegenerative conditions. Treatment with antioxidants is a promising approach for slowing disease progression. In this study, we used the neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells as an in vitro model to first assess the effect of polypeptide from Chlamys farreri (PCF), a natural marine antioxidant, on H(2)O(2)-induced neuronal cell death. Pre-treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with PCF inhibited H(2)O(2)-induced cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. In parallel, intracellular reactive oxygen species generation and lipid peroxidation were inhibited by PCF. Under severe H(2)O(2) insult, PCF promoted endogenous antioxidant defense components including glutathione peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione. PCF also protected DNA from oxidative damage and enhanced the removal of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine from DNA. Further, we found that PCF potentially prevented H(2)O(2)-induced cell apoptosis. When investigated mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, we found that pre-treatment of cells with PCF significantly blocked H(2)O(2)-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family. However, PCF had little inhibitory effect on the H(2)O(2)-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Taken together, these data demonstrate that PCF prevents oxidative stress-induced reactive oxygen species production and c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation and may be useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
