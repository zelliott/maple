To investigate the impact of interferon-gamma-mediated upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class I expression on tumor-specific T-cell cytotoxicity and T-cell trafficking into neuroblastoma tumors in vivo.

Restoration of major histocompatibility complex class I expression by interferon-gamma treatment enhances killing of neuroblastoma cells. To understand the potential of this approach in vivo, we developed a novel model of neuroblastoma in which NOD/scid/IL2R gamma(null) immunodeficient mice are engrafted with both human T cells and tumor cells.

Here, we show enhanced killing of neuroblastoma cells by patient-derived, tumor-specific T cells in vitro. In addition, interferon-gamma treatment in vivo induces efficient upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class I expression on neuroblastoma tumor cells, and this is accompanied by significantly enhanced infiltration of T cells into the tumor. In a pilot clinical trial in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma, we similarly observed augmented T-cell trafficking into neuroblastoma nests in tumor biopsy specimens obtained from patients after 5 days of systemic interferon-gamma therapy.

Interferon-gamma overcomes critical obstacles to the killing of human neuroblastoma cells by specific T cells. Together, these findings provide a rationale for the further testing of interferon-gamma as an approach for improving the efficacy of T cell-based therapies for neuroblastoma and other major histocompatibility complex class I-deficient malignancies. In addition, we describe a model that may expedite the preclinical screening of approaches aimed at augmenting T-cell trafficking into human tumors.
