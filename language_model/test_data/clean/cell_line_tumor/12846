To explore the biological function and possible underlying mechanism of aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10) gene during hepatocarcinogenesis.

A pair of chemically synthesized small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting on AKR1B10 was transfected into liver cancer cell line MHCC97H by LipofectamineTM 2000. After confirming the interfering effects of AKR1B10-siRNAs through Quant SYBR Green polymerase chain reaction (Real-time PCR), Western blot and enzymatic activity assay, the capabilities of proliferation and apoptosis of the transfected cells were observed by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry analysis, and the expressions of a group of tumor-related gene such as c-myc, c-fos, N-ras were observed through Real-time PCR.

The expressions of AKR1B10 and the enzymatic activity were down-regulated significantly in AKR1B10-siRNA-transfected cells. Compared with mock and blank control groups, cell growth in AKR1B10-siRNA-transfected group was inhibited by 26.6%+/-3.1% at 72h after transfection. The ratio of apoptotic cells was 37.3%+/-1.0% in AKR1B10-siRNA-transfected group, which was significantly higher than that in mock and blank control groups (P < 0.01). Real-time PCR showed that the expressions of oncogene c-myc, c-fos and N-ras, and the proliferation-associated gene ki-67 were down-regulated in AKR1B10-siRNA-transfected cells, while the expressions of apoptosis-promoting gene caspas-3 and bax were up-regulated.

AKR1B10 might promote proliferation, inhibit apoptosis and then induce malignant transformation of hepatocytes by regulating the expression level of some tumor-related genes.
