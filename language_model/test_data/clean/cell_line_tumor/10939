The aim of the present study was to investigate regulation of mRNA, coding for TGFbeta ligands and specific receptors, by novel antitumor antibiotic landomycin E (LE) in human breast adenocarcinoma cells of MCF-7 line, sensitive and resistant to anti-cancer agent doxorubicin.

Semi-quantitative analysis of mRNA expression was estimated using RT-PCR and DNA gel-electrophoresis methods. For comparison, another anti-cancer drug doxorubicin (adriamycin) was utilized. THE RESULTS obtained indicate that LE induces up-regulation of mRNA coding for TGFbeta receptors type I and type II in MCF-7 cells, as well as in their doxorubicin-resistant sub-line.

Anti-tumor action of LE may be mediated by TGFbeta, and a signaling pathway of this cytokine is not affected by the development of tumor cell resistance to doxorubicin.
