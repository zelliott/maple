Recent studies have provided increasing evidence that postnatal neovascularization does not rely exclusively on sprouting of preexisting vessels, but also involves bone marrow-derived circulating endothelial precursors (BM-EPCs). Animal studies revealed that neovascularization of ischemic tissue can be enhanced by BM-EPCs transplantation. But a possible limitation to the use of vascular precursors for therapeutic angiogenesis is the relatively low number of these cells. In this study, we demonstrate that ex vivo expanded differentiated endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), may home to the tumor vasculature allowing targeting of transgene expression to the neoangiogenic site.

Mononuclear cells (MNCs) or CD34+ -enriched cells were purified from cord blood. We have defined culture conditions in which we observed two types of clones easily differentiated according to their morphology: cobblestone or spindle-shaped. Phenotypic characterization was assessed by immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry analysis and polymerase reaction with reverse transcription. Formation of capillary-like network in vitro was studied in three-dimensional collagen culture. And recruitment of these cells to a tumoral neoangiogenic site was assessed into tumor-bearing Severe Combined Immunodeficient (SCID) mouse model.

The cobblestone cells uniformly positive for CD31, VE-cadherin, vWF, VEGF R1 and R2, ecNOS and incorporating acetylated LDL were ECs. Spindle-shaped cells expressed alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), Smooth Muscle Heavy Chain (SMHC), SM22 and calponin. They also displayed a carbachol-induced contractility in a medium containing IGF1. So we concluded that spindle-shaped cells were SMCs. ECs and SMCs interacted with each other to form a capillary like network in three-dimensional type I collagen culture. Moreover, these ex vivo differentiated cells are able to home to the tumor vasculature.

We provide evidence that progenitors for ECs and SMCs circulate in human cord blood and differentiate into functional ECs and SMCs. These differentiated cells could provide a biomaterial for vascular cell therapy, because of their homing capacity to the neovascularization site.
