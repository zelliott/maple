A clinical role for nonquantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using prostate-specific antigen in blood samples from patients with prostate cancer remains undefined. Assay variation and detection of prostate-specific antigen mRNA illegitimate transcription may explain inconsistent results between studies. Defining levels of prostate-specific antigen mRNA expression in blood samples from healthy volunteers and patients with prostate cancer would allow cutoffs to be established to distinguish the two groups.

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR for prostate-specific antigen mRNA was established and levels of prostate-specific antigen mRNA measured in bloods samples from healthy volunteers (n=21) and patients with localized (n=27) and metastatic (n=40) prostate cancer.

Levels of prostate-specific antigen mRNA were significantly higher in blood samples from patients with metastatic prostate cancer than in blood samples from patients with localized prostate cancer (P <0.001) or in blood samples from healthy volunteers (P <0.01); levels between patients with localized prostate cancer and healthy volunteers were no different. Assay sensitivity to detect patients with metastatic prostate cancer was 68% with specificity of 95%. In patients with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer, monitoring response to hormonal therapy was possible with this assay. No correlation between levels of prostate-specific antigen mRNA and serum prostate-specific antigen protein levels was found, suggesting that prostate-specific antigen mRNA and serum prostate-specific antigen protein levels reflect different features of prostate cancer, i.e., circulating tumor cells and total tumor bulk, respectively.

Quantitative RT-PCR discriminates patients with metastatic prostate cancer from healthy volunteers and patients with localized prostate cancer but cannot discriminate patients with localized prostate cancer from healthy volunteers. A role for quantitative RT-PCR has been identified in the assessment and monitoring of patients with metastatic prostate cancer.
