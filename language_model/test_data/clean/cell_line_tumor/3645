This study were designed to investigate the inhibition of matrine on C6 glioma cell line and its mechanism.

MTT was used to measure the levels of the proliferation of C6 cultured with matrine in different concentrations. The effects of matrine on cell cycle of C6 were observed by FCM. The expression of proto-oncogenes C-myc was measured by RT-PCR.

The proliferation of C6 was obviously inhibited by matrine in a dose dependent manner. The inhibitory rate came to 53.8% +/- 5.6%, when cultured with matrine at 0.20 g/L. The outcome of FCM showed that the proportion of G0/G1 phase cells was decreased obviously, the proportion of S phase cells was reduced when cultured with matrine at 0.20 g/L in 3 days. The outcome of RT-PCR showed that the expression of proto-oncogene C-myc was notably decreased when the dose of matrine was increased.

Matrine can inhibit the proliferation of C6 and inhibit the expression of proto-oncogenc C-myc.
