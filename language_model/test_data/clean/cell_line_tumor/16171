The purpose of the present study was to explore the utilization of cinnamon-coated gold nanoparticles (Cin-AuNPs) as CT/optical contrast-enhancement agents for detection of cancer cells.

Cin-AuNPs were synthesized by a "green" procedure, and the detailed characterization was performed by physico-chemical analysis. Cytotoxicity and cellular uptake studies were carried out in normal human fibroblast and cancerous (PC-3 and MCF-7) cells, respectively. The efficacy of detecting cancerous cells was monitored using a photoacoustic technique. In vivo biodistribution was studied after IV injection of Cin-AuNPs in mice, and also a CT phantom model was generated.

Biocompatible Cin-AuNPs were synthesized with high purity. Significant uptake of these gold nanoparticles was observed in PC-3 and MCF-7 cells. Cin-AuNPs internalized in cancerous cells facilitated detectable photoacoustic signals. In vivo biodistribution in normal mice showed steady accumulation of gold nanoparticles in lungs and rapid clearance from blood. Quantitative analysis of CT values in phantom model revealed that the cinnamon-phytochemical-coated AuNPs have reasonable attenuation efficiency.

The results indicate that these non-toxic Cin-AuNPs can serve as excellent CT/ photoacoustic contrast-enhancement agents and may provide a novel approach toward tumor detection through nanopharmaceuticals.
