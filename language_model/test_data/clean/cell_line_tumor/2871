We have previously reported that human adenovirus (HAdV) reference strains clearly show species-dependent resistance to ribavirin, whereas different species of HAdV are equally sensitive to cidofovir. All the serotypes tested were susceptible to cidofovir, whereas only serotypes from species C were sensitive to ribavirin. Here, we aimed to extend these investigations to clinical isolates.

In vitro, we tested 126 isolates obtained from 65 patients included in a European survey of HAdV infection.

Among the 126 isolates tested, all presented cidofovir 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the same range as the HAdV 5 reference strain. Regarding ribavirin, all isolates from species C (79 tested) showed an IC50 comparable with previously reported results for reference strains; however, 24/32, 2/6 and 3/3 tested isolates from species A, B and D, respectively, were shown to have a ribavirin IC50 comparable with the HAdV 5 reference strain (species C), contrary to previous observations for reference strains of the same species. Among patients who were treated with cidofovir for disseminated HAdV infection, > or = 4 sequential isolates could be obtained from 9 patients; no variation in cidofovir susceptibility could be detected.

Cidofovir is active in vitro in all HAdV clinical isolates. Ribavirin was revealed to be active on most HAdV isolates from species A, B and D, and in all isolates from species C. Finally, no resistance to cidofovir became apparent in sequential isolates obtained from treated patients.
