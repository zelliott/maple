A series of 4,5-di-substituted acridones have been designed and synthesized. Several compounds show high affinity for telomeric G-quadruplex DNA in classical and competition FRET assays, together with low duplex DNA affinity, although they do not show activity in a telomerase assay or evidence of telomere shortening. They have low toxicity against a panel of cancer cell lines and a normal human fibroblast line, and produce potent senescence-based long-term growth arrest in the MCF7 and A549 cancer cell lines.
