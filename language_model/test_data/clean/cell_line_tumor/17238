Luminescent semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are a new class of fluorescent label with wide-ranging applications for cell imaging. The electron density and elemental composition of these materials permit the extension of their use as probes in conventional electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-filtered TEM (EFTEM). Here we illustrate the feasibility of using streptavidin-conjugated QDs as TEM tags by labeling a nuclear protein on cell sections and obtaining correlative fluorescence and TEM data. We also show that QD probes can be employed in conjunction with immunogold for co-localization of proteins at the ultrastructural level. Furthermore, by obtaining cadmium elemental maps of CdSe/ZnS QDs distributed on a nuclear structure, we demonstrate the potential of QDs for co-localization of multiple proteins when used in combination with EFTEM.
