Vestibular schwannomas (VSs) are slow-growing benign tumors but, on rare occasion, can invade adjacent cranial nerves, causing significant morbidity, especially in association with neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2). We aimed to determine the role of the growth factors EGF, bFGF, and the hormone, Epo, in promoting such invasive behavior in VS, as well as their mechanisms of action.

Immunohistochemical staining showed expression of EGFR, bFGF, Epo, EpoR in archived VS tissue. Western blots and immunofluorescence showed expression of EGFR, EpoR and FGF in HEI-193, an immortalized cell line derived from human NF2-related VS. Matrigel invasion assays were used to study the effect of Epo, FGF and bFGF on invasive behavior in HEI-193. Western blotting showed levels of phospho-Akt and phospho-Erk in HEI-193 upon addition of growth factors plus PI3K or MEK inhibitors. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to determine the expression of MMP2 and MMP9 after treatment with growth factors.

EGFR, bFGF, Epo and EpoR were expressed in VS tissue and HEI193. Addition of EGF and bFGF increased cellular invasion by 10 and 3.5-fold, respectively. Epo had minimal effect on invasion. Results indicated that Erk is involved in bFGF but not EGF-induced invasion, while Akt is involved in both pathways. EGF treatment moderately induced MMP9, but is unlikely to account for the observed invasion.

Activation of EGFR and FGFR may promote invasive behavior in VS through ERK and Akt signaling pathways. Further investigation will be necessary to elucidate their potential as useful targets in the treatment of VS.
