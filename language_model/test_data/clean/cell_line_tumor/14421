To dissect the isoform-specific roles of Akt in breast cancer cells, constitutively active Akt isoforms were introduced into MDA-MB-231 cells. Both Akt1 and Akt2 efficiently inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells. Overexpression of Akt1 down-regulated ERK activity inhibiting Ser 259 phosphorylation of c-Raf and subsequent downstream signaling. Akt2 overexpression up-regulated the cell cycle inhibitor p27. Cycloheximide decay assays showed that Akt2 increased the stability and nuclear localization of p27, thus inhibiting the cyclin E/CDK2 complex. These results suggest that the inhibition of cell proliferation by Akt1 and Akt2 is mediated by isoform-specific mechanisms.
