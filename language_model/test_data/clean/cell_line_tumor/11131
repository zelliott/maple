IL-18 is a multifunctional cytokine that augments both innate and acquired immunity and potentiates Th1 and Th2 reactions. We studied the expression of IL-18 receptor (IL-18R) on renal and respiratory epithelial cell lines. Both cell lines upregulated IL-18R mRNA and IL-18R membrane expression in response to TNF alpha and other proinflammatory cytokines. The function of IL-18R was confirmed by induction of IL-8 release from epithelial cells in response to recombinant IL-18. Epithelial cells may represent an important target for IL-18, mainly under inflammatory conditions associated with TNF alpha release.
