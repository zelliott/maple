Carcinoma progression is associated with the loss of epithelial features, and the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype by tumour cells. Herein we show that exposure of MCF-7 cells to epidermal growth factor (EGF) resulted in morphological alterations characteristic of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EGF treatment resulted in increased motility along with an up-regulation of transcription factors Slug, Zeb1, Zeb2, and mesenchymal markers Vimentin and N-cadherin. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with a combined stimulation of EGF and resveratrol, a naturally occurring stilbene with antitumor properties, failed to alter cell morphology, motility and overexpression of EMT markers induced by EGF. Using specific chemical inhibitors, we demonstrated that EGF-induced EMT is mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) signalling pathway and that resveratrol is able to repress EGF-induced ERK activation. In summary, these data provide new evidence of the inhibitory effect of resveratrol on EGF-induced EMT cell transformation.
