To explore the regulative effect of expression of VEGF gene in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and to discuss the future application of microRNA in the gene therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

We constructed the recombination miRNA plasmid vectors which target VEGF gene and plasmids were transfected into CNE-2 cells by using Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent. The VEGF mRNA and VEGF protein were detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting respectively. WST-8 assay was used to determine the inhibitory effect of microRNA on cell growth. Stable cell lines and wild type CNE-2 cell line were inoculated to subcutis of nude mice to establish animal models. The tumor growth and volume were observed.

After the transfection of CNE-2 cells , the expressions of VEGF mRNA and VEGF protein were down-regulated at different degree. Whereas, CNE-2 cell growth showed no change by observation of fluorescence microscopy, and cell proliferation was not inhibited in WST-8 assay. However, in vivo, growth of xenograft was inhibited in preliminary experiments of nude mice.

By miRNA plasmid constructed artificially, miRNA can effectively interfere nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells by down-regulating the expressions of VEGF gene, therefore can inhibit the growth of tumor xenografted in vivo. Future application of microRNA in the gene therapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma might be expected.
