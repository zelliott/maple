Cyclophilin A (CypA) has been reported to be overexpressed in cancer cells, especially in solid tumors. To determine the role of CypA in tumorigenesis, we investigated the induction of CypA as well as the role it plays in cancer cells. Here, we have shown that induction of CypA is associated with hypoxia in a variety of cells, including DU145 human prostate cancer cell line. Our analysis of the CypA promoter clearly showed that CypA up-regulation is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha transcription factor. Interestingly, overexpression of CypA prevented hypoxia- and cisplatin-induced apoptosis, and this was associated with the suppression of reactive oxygen species generation and depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, whereas small interfering RNA-based CypA knockdown aggravated these factors. These results suggest that CypA is important in tumorigenesis, especially in tumor apoptosis.
