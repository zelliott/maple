Indian monocellate cobra (Naja kaouthia) and Russell's viper (Vipera russelli) are common snakes of the East Indian sub-peninsula. The anticarcinogenic activities of their crude venoms were studied on carcinoma, sarcoma and leukemia models. Sub-lethal doses of venoms showed cytotoxicity on Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cells in vivo. The venoms increased lifespan of EAC mice and strengthened the impaired host antioxidant system. Sarcoma formation in mice (3-methylcholanthrene induced) after venom treatment was significantly less (p < 0.005). Histopathological examination of tumors showed tissue necrosis. The venoms displayed potent cytotoxic and apoptogenic effect on human leukemic cells (U937/K562). The venoms reduced cell proliferation rate (p < 0.005) and produced morphological alterations indicative of apoptosis induction. Different degree and nature of anticarcinogenic property of cobra and viper venoms may be attributed to the difference in their constituents.
