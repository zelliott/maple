The ubiquitin specific peptidase 22 (USP22) is a positive regulator of the growth of tumors. However, little is known about the impact of USP22 knockdown on the growth of human bladder cells. In the present study, we designed a series of asymmetric interfering RNAs (aiRNAs) and compared the efficacy of aiRNA and conventional symmetric interfering RNA (siRNA) in the silencing of USP22 expression and the growth of human bladder EJ cells in vitro and in vivo. In comparison with transfection with the USP22-specific siRNA, transfection with 15/21 aiRNA was more potent in down-regulating the USP22 expression and inhibiting EJ cell proliferation in vitro. Furthermore, transfection with 15/21 aiRNA induced higher frequency of EJ cells arrested at the G0/G1 phases, but did not trigger EJ cell apoptosis. Moreover, transfection with either the siRNA or 15/21 aiRNA up-regulated the expression of p53 and p21, but down-regulated the expression of cyclin E and Mdm2 in EJ cells. The up-regulated p53 expression induced by the specific siRNA or aiRNA was abrogated by induction of Mdm2 over-expression. In addition, treatment with the specific siRNA or aiRNA inhibited the growth of implanted human bladder tumors in mice and the aiRNA had more potent anti-tumor activity in vivo. Therefore, our data suggest that knockdown of USP22 expression by the aiRNA may down-regulate the expression of Mdm2 and cyclin E, resulting in the up-regulated expression of p53 and p21 and leading to cell cycling arrest and inhibition of human bladder EJ cell proliferation. Our findings indicate that the USP22-specific aiRNA may be a novel approach for the intervention of human bladder tumors.
