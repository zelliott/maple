Together with twenty-six known compounds, a new phenylpropanosid, named cremanthodioside, was isolated from the whole plant of Cremanthodium ellisii Kitam. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic methods MS, IR, UV, NMR, including 2D NMR techniques, and by chemical methods. The anti-bacterial activity of compounds 1-6 and the anti-tumor activity of compound 1 were tested.
