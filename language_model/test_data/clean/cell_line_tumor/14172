The influence of zinc status on the expression of proteins known to be involved in the stability of p53, the human tumor suppressor gene product, was examined in hepatoblastoma (HepG2) cells. Cells were cultured in zinc-deficient (ZD0.2, ZD0.4), zinc normal (ZN), zinc adequate (ZA), or zinc-supplemented (ZS) medium, which contained 0.2, 0.4, 4, 16, or 32 microM zinc, respectively. Nuclear p53 levels were almost 100% and 40% higher in ZD0.2 and ZD0.4 cells, respectively, than in ZN cells. Mdm2 protein, which mediates p53 degradation, was 174% and 148% higher in the nucleus of ZD0.2 and ZD0.4 cells, respectively, than in ZN cells. In addition, the observed reductions of nuclear c-Abl in ZD0.2 and ZD0.4 cells to 50% and 60% of ZN cells, respectively, may be a cellular response attempting to normalize nuclear p53 accumulation because nuclear c-Abl is known to down-regulate ubiquitination and nuclear export of p53. Moreover, no changes in total cellular p53, Mdm2, and c-Abl or nuclear Mdmx were observed among the treatment groups. Furthermore, in ZD0.2 and ZD0.4 cells, the reduction in total and nuclear p300, which is known to complex with CREB-binding protein and Mdm2 in the nucleus for the generation of degradable polyubiquitinated form of p53, may have depressed the degradation pathway for p53 and Mdm2, and contributed to the nuclear accumulation of these proteins in ZD cells.
