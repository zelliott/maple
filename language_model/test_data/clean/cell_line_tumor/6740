A new series of 1,3-(oxytetraethylenoxy)cyclotriphosphazene derivatives bearing 2-chloroethylamine or salicylaldehyde (2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) or its Schiff base (after condensation with 2-chloroethylamine) units and having also 2-naphthyl or anthraquinone groups as cosubstituents has been synthesized. The in vitro cytotoxic activity of these compounds against a panel of four cancer cell lines has been studied. Most of the compounds exhibited antiproliferative activity in the range of the international criterion for synthetic agents (4 microg/mL) against the MOLT4, L 1210, HL-60, and P388 cell lines chosen for testing.
