Methotrexate (MTX) is one of the leading drugs in the treatment of leukemia, but extensive metabolism to 7-hydroxymethotrexate (7-OHMTX) can limit its therapeutic efficacy. In this study we investigated whether 7-OHMTX itself can provoke anti-folate resistance that may further disrupt MTX efficacy. For this purpose, we developed resistance to 7-OHMTX as well as MTX in 2 human leukemia cell lines (CCRF-CEM and MOLT-4) by stepwise exposure to increasing concentrations of 7-OHMTX and MTX. Consequently, both leukemia cell lines displayed marked levels of resistance to 7-OHMTX (> 10-fold) and MTX (> 75-fold). The underlying mechanism of resistance in the MTX-exposed cells was a marked decrease (> 10-fold) in reduced folate carrier (RFC)-mediated cellular uptake of MTX. This was associated with transcriptional silencing of the RFC gene in MTX-resistant CCRF-CEM cells. In contrast, the molecular basis for the resistance to 7-OHMTX was due solely to a marked decreased (> 95%) in folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) activity, which conferred more than 100-fold MTX resistance upon a short-term exposure to this drug. This is the first demonstration that 7-OHMTX can provoke distinct modalities of antifolate resistance compared with the parent drug MTX. The implications of this finding for MTX efficacy and strategies to circumvent MTX resistance are discussed.
