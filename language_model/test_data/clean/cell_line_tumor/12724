Suberoyl bishydroxamic acid (SBHA) as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor has various cellular effects such as cell growth and apoptosis. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of SBHA on the growth and death of A549 lung cancer cells. SBHA inhibited the growth of A549 cells with an IC(50) of approximately 50 μM at 72 h in a dose-dependent manner. DNA flow cytometric analysis indicated that SBHA induced a G2/M phase arrest of the cell cycle. This agent also induced apoptosis, as evidenced by sub-G1 cells and annexin V-FITC staining cells. SBHA-induced apoptosis was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP; ΔΨ(m)), Bcl-2 decrease, Bax increase, and the activation of caspase-3. All of the tested caspase inhibitors significantly rescued some cells from SBHA-induced A549 cell death. However, none of the caspase inhibitors prevented the loss of MMP (ΔΨ(m)) induced by SBHA. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels including O(2)(•-) were increased in 50 μM SBHA-treated A549 cells. None of the caspase inhibitors attenuated ROS levels in these cells. SBHA also elevated the number of glutathione (GSH)-depleted cells in A549 cells, which was reduced by treatment with caspase inhibitors. In conclusion, this is the first report that SBHA inhibited the growth of A549 lung cancer cells via caspase-dependent apoptosis, which was related to GSH depletion rather than changes in ROS level.
