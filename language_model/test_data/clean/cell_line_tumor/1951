Hypoxia is a common characteristic of solid tumors. Recent studies confirmed that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays a significant role in cancer invasion and progression. In this study, the correlation between the expression of TLR4 and the change of the protein level of Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) was studied.

We examined 84 human pancreatic cancer tissues for expression of HIF-1α and TLR4 proteins. Panc-1 cells were exposed to normoxia (20% O(2)) or hypoxia (<1% O(2)) or treated with CoCl(2). TLR4 protein was analyzed by flow cytometry and immunostaining. Growth studies were conducted on cells with the HIF-1α inhibition isolated from stable transfected cell lines. Finally, TLR4 protein was detected by immunohistochemistry in vivo tumors.

There was a positive correlation between TLR4 and HIF-1α protein in pancreatic cancer tissues. Hypoxic stress induced TLR4 mRNA and protein expression in Panc-1 cells. Cells transfected with HIF-1α siRNA showed attenuation of hypoxia stress-induced TLR4 expression. In vivo growth decreased in response to TLR4 and HIF-1α inhibiton. Transient HIF-1α siRNA treatment could effectively curb tumor growth in vivo.

These results suggest that TLR4 expression in pancreatic cancer cells is up-regulated via HIF-1α in response to hypoxic stress and underscore the crucial role of HIF-1α-induced TLR4 in tumor growth.
