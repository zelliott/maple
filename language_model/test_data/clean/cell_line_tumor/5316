Bacterial LPS induces the release of ATP from immune cells. Accruing evidence suggests that extracellular ATP participates in the inflammatory response as a proinflammatory mediator by activating the inflammasome complex, inducing secretion of cytokines (IL-1, IL-18) and cell damaging agents such as oxygen radicals, cationic proteins, and metalloproteases. It is not known whether ATP can also act as a proinflammatory mediator by inhibiting production of molecules down-modulating the immune response. Here, we show that extracellular ATP impairs in an IL-10-dependent fashion the expression of the tolerogenic soluble and membrane-bound HLA-G Ag in human monocytes. The effect of ATP was mimicked by BzATP (3'-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl-ATP) and greatly reduced by pretreatment with oATP (periodate-oxidized ATP), KN-62 (1-[N,O-bis(5-isoquinoline-sulfonyl)-N-methyl-l-tyrosyl]-4-phenylpiperazine), and an anti-P2X(7) mAb, thus pointing to a specific role of the P2X(7) receptor. The effect of ATP was time- and dose-dependent and was not due to a decrease in expression of IL-10 receptor. Inhibition by ATP was reverted by supplementation of culture medium with exogenous IL-10. Due to the well-known immunosuppressive activity of IL-10 and soluble HLA-G, this novel effect of ATP might be relevant for the pathophysiology and therapy of inflammatory disorders.
