One pot synthesis of three structurally different Ni(II) thiosemicarbazone complexes 1, 2 and 3 were obtained from the reaction between [NiCl(2)(PPh(3))(2)], 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane, and [H(2)-(Sal-tsc)]. The obtained products were characterized by various spectral and analytical techniques. From the X-ray crystallographic analysis, an unexpected N-arylation on the coordinated salicylaldehydethiosemicarbazone was found in complex 2. The comparative biological evolutions such as DNA/protein binding, antioxidant, cytotoxicity (MTT, LDH, and NO) and cellular uptake studies have been examined for [Ni(Sal-tsc)(PPh(3))] (1) and [(Ni(Sal-tsc))(2)(Î¼-dppe)] (3). When comparing the cytotoxicity of the complexes, 1 exhibited higher activity than 2 and 3 and by comparing with standard cis-platin, both of them were found to exhibit better activity under identical conditions.
