In the search for new and improved anticancer therapies, researchers have identified several potentially useful compounds. One of these agents is 2-methoxyestradiol-bis-sulphamate (2ME-BM), a sulphamoylated derivative of 2-methoxyestradiol. The objective of this study was to evaluate 2ME-BM's in vitro efficacy as antiproliferative agent in the MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cell line. Light- and fluorescent microscopy showed decreased cell density, increased apoptotic characteristics and significant ultrastructural aberrations indicative of autophagic cell death after 24 hours of exposure at a concentration of 0.4 microM. In addition, mitotic indices revealed that 2ME-BM induces a G2M block. The latter was confirmed by flow cytometric analyses where increased sub-G1 and G2/M fractions, as well as an increase in cyclin B1 levels were observed. Further in vitro research into the mechanism of this potentially useful anticancer compound is thus warranted.
