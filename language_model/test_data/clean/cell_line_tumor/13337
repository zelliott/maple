A nanoformulated trinuclear hydrolysis product of a bis(alkoxo) salan-Ti(IV)  complex shows high antitumor activity, which identifies it as an active species in cells. Additional highly stable mononuclear derivatives also show high activity, when formulated into nanoparticles, thus evincing that biologically friendly Ti(IV)  can provide high cytotoxicity with controlled biological function.
