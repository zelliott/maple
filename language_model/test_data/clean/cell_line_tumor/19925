Previous single-molecule studies have shown a long-term diffusion superimposed to a short-term confinement of the human mu opioid (hMOP) receptors at the surface of heterologous cells. However, additional ensemble average measurements are required to reach a complete understanding of the undergoing process. Here, we analyse, by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching measurements, the lateral diffusion of fully functional T7-EGFP-hMOP receptors in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells naturally expressing a low level of the wild-type receptor. Experiments carried out at variable observation radii demonstrate the restriction of the receptors diffusion to sub-micrometer sized domains. Furthermore, consistently with the long-term single-molecule data, the domains are found permeable.
