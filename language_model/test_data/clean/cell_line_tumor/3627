Strains of bifidobacteria have many health-promotion effects. Whole cells or cytoplasm extracts of Bifidobacterium bifidum BGN4, isolated from human feces, inhibited the growth of several cancer cell lines. The polysaccharide fraction (BB-pol) extracted from B. bifidum BGN4 had a novel composition, comprising chiroinositol, rhamnose, glucose, galactose, and ribose. Three human colon cancer cell lines were treated with BB-pol: HT-29, HCT-116, and Caco-2. Trypan blue exclusion assay and BrdU incorporation assay showed that BB-pol inhibited the growth of HT-29 and HCT-116 cells but did not inhibit the growth of Caco-2 cells.
