Abnormal aspartyl residue formation such as L-isoaspartates occurs frequently during aging in long-lived proteins, resulting in the alteration of their structures and biological functions. In this study, we investigated the alteration of aspartyl residues in extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, type-I collagen and fibronectin, and in integrin- and ECM-binding motifs during aging, as well as the resulting effects on cell biological functions such as migration and attachment. Using protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase (PIMT) to monitor the presence of L-isoaspartyl residues, we showed their accumulation during in vivo aging in type-I collagen from rats. In vitro aging of fibronectin as well as of peptides containing an integrin- or ECM-binding motif such as RGDSR, KDGEA and KDDL also resulted in the formation of L-isoaspartyl residues. While aged fibronectin does not alter cell adhesion and migration, type-I collagen aged 20 months reduced by 65% cell motility, but not adhesion, when compared to 3-month-aged type-I collagen. Finally, by repairing 20-month-old type-I collagen with recombinant PIMT (rPIMT), cell migration was recovered by 72%. These results strongly suggest that L-isoaspartyl residue formation in ECM proteins such as type-I collagen could play an important role in reducing cell migration and that PIMT could be a therapeutic tool to restore normal cell migration in pathological conditions where cell motility is crucial.
