Gold and pearls: Multifunctional nanoparticles, each composed of a single, amine-modified gold nanorod, decorated with multiple "pearls" of Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles capped with carboxy groups, are prepared. Their effectiveness in simultaneous targeting, dual-mode imaging, and photothermal ablation of breast cancer cells is demonstrated.
