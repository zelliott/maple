A new cytotoxic lanostane triterpenoid, 24(E)-3beta-hydroxylanosta-8,24-dien-26-al-21-oic acid (1), was isolated from the fruiting bodies of the mushroom Hebeloma versipelle. The structure was elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic studies including 2D NMR experiments. Compound 1 moderately inhibited the growth of several tumor cell lines (IC50 10-25.0 microg/ml).
