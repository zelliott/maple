The physical and biological properties of a water-soluble polymeric contrast agent based on a complex of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide copolymer with gadolinium (HE-24.8) were investigated, and its potential for experimental magnetic resonance (MR) angiography was assessed. Relaxivities of Gd-DTPA-BMA, Gd-DTPA-HSA (human serum albumin), and HE-24.8 were determined at 1.5 T. Thermic stability and biocompatibility of HE-24.8 were assessed in vitro and by analyzing kinetics and organ distribution in rats for up to 2 weeks. For comparison, HE-24.8- and Gd-DTPA-HSA-enhanced micro-MR angiographies of brain, chest, and subcutaneous tumors in rats were performed. T1 relaxivity of HE-24.8 (21.3 +/- 1.1 mM(-1) s(-1)) was 5-fold higher than that of Gd-DTPA-BMA (4.1 +/- 0.1 mM(-1) s(-1)) and twice as high as that of Gd-DTPA-HSA (12.4 +/- 0.2 mM(-1) s(-1)). Varying the molecular weight of the polymer (15-46 kDa) did not significantly change the T1 relaxivity. In rats, 20 and 10% of the injected dose of HE-24.8 was detected at 24 and 168 h postinjection, respectively. Upon a relatively rapid initial renal clearance, no specific retention in any organ was noted, with some exception for the reticulo-endothelial system. No measurable release of gadolinium from the polymer-Gd complex or cell toxicity was observed during its incubation in aqueous environment. Excellent display of rat and tumor vascularization was achieved with Gd-DTPA-HSA and HE-24.8; however, contrast of vessels was higher in HE-24.8-enhanced scans. HE-24.8 is considered a macromolecular contrast agent highly suited for experimental MR studies.
