This study was undertaken to investigate the expression of connexins in ovarian cancer cell lines and assess correlation with chemosensitivity.

Eight cell lines were used in this study. Cytotoxicity assays with carboplatin and paclitaxel were performed. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to analyze the expression of gap junction proteins. Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining of selective gap junction proteins (connexin 26 and 43) were performed.

All 11 connexins were detected with RT-PCR profiling in ovarian cancer cells. Further experiments were performed to analyze protein expression with connexins 26 and 43. Levels of connexin proteins did not correlate with gene expression obtained with RT-PCR. Results obtained with immunoblotting were confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Carboplatin and paclitaxel sensitivities were determined and connexin 43 expression was associated with sensitivity to paclitaxel.

Expression of connexins is regulated at the translational level in ovarian cancer. Sensitivity to paclitaxel maybe associated with connexin 43.
