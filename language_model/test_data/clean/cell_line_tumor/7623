To explore the role of Syk and VEGF-C in the development of NSCLC.

Transfered these genes(eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1-VEGF-C and pLNCX-syk)into A549 cells with the liposomes. Tested the expression of VEGF-C mRNA and Syk mRNA with RT-PCR.Investigated the cell invasion assay with transwell chamber in vitro. Analysis the expression of VEGF-C proteins in A549 cells and detect Syk and VEGF-C proteins of 81 NSCLC tissue samples with immunohistochemical staining.

Higher expression of VEGF-C was revealed in VEGF-C-construct-transfected A549 cell than that in controls through RT-PCR (P < 0.05) and immunohistochemistry(P < 0.01).RT-PCR also revealed that Syk expression was higher in Syk-construct-transfected cells than in controls (P < 0.05). The cell invading experiments showed that there was more invaded cells in both transfected terms than in controls (P < 0.05). The expression of Syk protein in NSCLC tissue were significantly lower than that in the normal lung tissue (P < 0.05), while the expression of VEGF-C protein in NSCLC tissue were significantly higher than that in the normal lung tissue(P < 0.05). The expression of Syk and VEGF-C has a negative correlationship (r = -1.000, P = 0.019).

The expression of Syk and VEGF-C has a negative correlationship in NSCLC tissue, VEGF-C-construct-transfected A549 cells are more aggressive than Syk-construct-transfected cells. And they may cooperated with each other in the development of NSCLC.
