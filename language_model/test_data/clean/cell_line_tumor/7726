To study the effects of total flavones of Chrysanthemum indicum on proliferation and apoptosis of human osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells and its mechanism.

The effect of the total flavones of Chrysanthemum indicum on the proliferation of human osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells was detected by CCK assay, and the morphological changes of cells treated with total flavones of Chrysanthemum indicum were observed using contrast microscope. Flow cytomerty was performed to analyze the apoptotic rate of the cells, and the gene expression levels of Caspase-3, BCL-2, BAX were detected by RT-PCR.

The total flavones of Chrysanthemum indicum suppressed the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Under a microscope observation of cell morphology, the volume became smaller ,the number of internal particles was increased. Cell apoptosis rate was positively related to the drug concentration. After treated for 48 hours, Caspase-3 and BAX expression were up-regulated, BCL-2 and BCL-2/BAX were decreased.

The total flavones of Chrysanthemum indicum can inhibit the proliferation of osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2 by inducing cell apoptosis,the mechanism of which might be related with reducing BCL-2/BAX and activating Caspase-3.
