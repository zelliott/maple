Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a promising cancer therapeutic agent because of its tumor selectivity. TRAIL is known to induce apoptosis in cancer cells but spare most normal cells. In this study, we examined whether treatment of docetaxel (DTX) can enhance apoptotic cell death by TRAIL against androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC). The cell death effect of combinations of TRAIL and docetaxel on prostate cancer cell lines (androgen-dependent LNCaP and its derived androgen-independent, metastatic C4-2B) was evaluated by synergisms of apoptosis. Western blot assay and DNA fragmentation assay were used to study the underlying mechanisms of cell death and search for any mechanisms of enhancement of TRAIL induced apoptosis in the presence of docetaxel. In addition, we investigated the in vitro anti-tumor effects of combined docetaxel and TRAIL using MAP kinase inhibitors. Docetaxel itself could not induce apoptotic cell death in 24 h even in high concentration. Apoptotic cell death, however, was drastically enhanced by pretreatment of docetaxel 20 h before TRAIL treatment. Docetaxel enhanced the PARP-1 cleavage and caspases activation by TRAIL especially in androgen-independent, metastatic C4-2B cell line, mainly by phosphorylation of Bcl-2 by JNK activation. It appears that apoptotic cell death was protected by the JNK inhibitor SP600125. The results of our study show that pretreatment of docetaxel is able to enhance the apoptosis produced by TRAIL in prostate cancer cells, especially in hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC).
