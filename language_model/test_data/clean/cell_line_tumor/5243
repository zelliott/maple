Neuroblastomas, which mostly occur in children, are aggressive metastatic tumors of the sympathetic nervous system. The failure of the previous therapeutic regimens to target multiple components of N-Myc pathway resulted in poor prognosis. The present study investigated the efficacy of the combination of N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (4-HPR, 0.5 microM) and genistein (GST, 25 microM) to control the growth of human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y and SK-N-BE2) harboring divergent molecular attributes. Combination of 4-HPR and GST down regulated N-Myc, Notch-1, and Id2 to induce neuronal differentiation. Transition to neuronal phenotype was accompanied by increase in expression of e-cadherin. Induction of neuronal differentiation was associated with decreased expression of hTERT, PCNA, survivin, and fibronectin. This is the first report that combination of 4-HPR and GST mediated reactivation of multiple tumor suppressors (p53, p21, Rb, and PTEN) for early cell cycle exit (due to G1/S phase arrest) in neuroblastoma cells. Reactivation of tumor suppressor(s) repressed N-Myc driven growth factor mediated angiogenic and invasive pathways (VEGF, b-FGF, MMP-2, and MMP-9) in neuroblastoma. Repression of angiogenic factors led to the blockade of components of mitogenic pathways [phospho-Akt (Thr 308), p65 NF-kappaB, and p42/44 Erk 1/2]. Taken together, the combination of 4-HPR and GST effectively blocked survival, mitogenic, and angiogenic pathways and activated proteases for apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells. These results suggested that combination of 4-HPR and GST could be effective for controlling the growth of heterogeneous human neuroblastoma cell populations.
