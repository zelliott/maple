The carbodiimides 2, obtained from aza-Wittig reactions of iminophosphorane 1 with aromatic isocyanates, reacted with ammonia to give ethyl 3,4-dihydro-6-methyl-4-oxo-2-arylamino-furo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5-carboxylate 3. Further reaction of 3 with POCl(3) and various amines generated ethyl 4-alkylamino-2-arylamino-6-methyl-furo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5-carboxylate 5 in good yields. Their structures were confirmed by (1)H NMR, EI-Ms, IR and elemental analysis. Compound 5b was further analyzed by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Compound 5 exhibited cytotoxicity against two lung cancer cell lines. For example, compound 5a showed the best inhibition activities against A459 with IC(50) 0.8Î¼M.
