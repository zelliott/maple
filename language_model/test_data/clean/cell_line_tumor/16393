To investigate the expression of G protein-coupled ER (GPER) and ER in the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) induced by 17β-estradiol (17β-E(2))in endometrial carcinoma cells, Ishikawa and HEC-1A.

Expressions of GPER, ERα and ERβ protein in Ishikawa and HEC-1A cells were detected by immunohistochemical SP method. Levels of GPER, ERα and ERβ were examined by western blot in Ishikawa and HEC-1A cells after treated with 1×10(-6) mol/L 17β-E(2) at different time (0, 15, 30, 60, 120 minutes).

GPER was positive expressed in Ishikawa and HEC-1A cells. ERα and ERβ were both positive expressed in Ishikawa cells. While, ERα was weakly expressed and ERβ was almost negatively expressed in HEC-1A cells. Western blot analysis showed that 1×10(-6) mol/L 17β-E(2) treatment, the Ishikawa and HEC-1A cells GPER protein level for 15 minutes markedly increased (P < 0.05), which Ishikawa 30 minutes, when cells reached the highest level (0.192 ± 0.004), HEC-1A cells for 15 minutes and reached the highest level (0.184 ± 0.006); Ishikawa and HEC-1A cells, Akt, activation of 15 minutes from the treatment start was significantly increased (P < 0.05), which Ishikawa cells for 30 minutes and reached the highest level (0.666 ± 0.021), HEC-1A cells for 15 minutes and reached maximum (0.788 ± 0.035); Ishikawa and HEC-1A cells, ERα and ERβ protein expression did not change significantly (P > 0.05).

GPER likely involved in non-nuclear activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathways in endometrial carcinoma cells, Ishikawa and HEC-1A.
