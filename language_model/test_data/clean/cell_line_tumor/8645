Progestins are reported to increase the risk of more aggressive estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor positive (ER+ PR+) breast cancers in postmenopausal women. Using an in vivo rat model of ER+ PR + mammary cancer, we show that tumors arising in the presence of estrogen and progesterone exhibit increased proliferation and decreased nuclear expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 compared with tumors growing in the presence of estrogen alone. In human T47D breast cancer cells, progestin increased proliferation and decreased nuclear p27 expression. The decrease of nuclear p27 protein was dependent on activation of Src and PI3K by progesterone receptor isoforms PRA or PRB. Importantly, increased proliferation and decreased nuclear p27 expression were observed in invasive breast carcinoma compared with carcinoma in situ. These results suggest that progesterone specifically regulates intracellular localization of p27 protein and proliferation. Therefore, progesterone-activated pathways can provide useful therapeutic targets for treatment of more aggressive ER+ PR+ breast cancers.
