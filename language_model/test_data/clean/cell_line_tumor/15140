This study examines the performance of novel hyaluronidase enzyme core-5-fluorouracil-loaded chitosan-polyethylene glycol-gelatin polymer nanocomposites, which were prepared using an ionic gelation technique, as targeted and controlled drug delivery vehicles. These hyaluronidase-loaded nanoparticles have recently been proposed as targeted and controlled drug delivery vehicle systems to tissues due to their ability to loosen the intercellular connective matrix of hyaluronic acid. The encapsulation efficiency and loading capacities of the nanoparticles demonstrated that these nanocomposites displayed sufficient binding ability, which depends on the pH and initial concentration of the drug. The cytotoxic effects of the chitosan-hyaluronidase-5-fluorouracil (CS-HYL-5-FU), chitosan-hyaluronidase-5-fluorouracil polyethylene glycol (CS-HYL-5-FU-PEG), and chitosan-hyaluronidase-5-fluorouracil polyethylene glycol-gelatin (CS-HYL-5-FU-PEG-G) nanoparticles were assessed using MTT assays, and the nanovectors were found to be less cytotoxic than the chemotherapeutic 5-FU after incubation for 3-12h. The particle sizes of the CS-HYL-5-FU, CS-HYL-5-FU-PEG and CS-HYL-5-FU-PEG-G polymer composites were between 300 and 580 nm, as determined by a Zetasizer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis indicated that the nanocomposites exhibit a clear, smooth surface and fine morphology. Linkages of the polymers, enzyme, and drug were confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy. Atomic fluorescence microscopy (AFM) analysis confirmed the size of the polymer composite nanoparticles. Therefore, this work established that the drug can be successfully encapsulated in chitosan-polyethylene glycol-gelatin-accompanied hyaluronidase nanoparticles with a homogeneous distribution. These nanoparticles can be potential carriers for targeted and controlled drug delivery to cancer cells.
