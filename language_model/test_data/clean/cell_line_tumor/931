Amplification of 3q26 is one of the most frequent chromosomal alterations in many solid tumors, including ovarian, lung, esophageal, prostate, breast, and nasopharyngeal cancers. A candidate oncogene to eukaryotic initiation factor 5A2 (eIF-5A2), a member of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A subfamily, has been isolated from a frequently amplified region at 3q26.2. In this work, the tumorigenic ability of eIF-5A2 was demonstrated by anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and tumor formation in nude mice. Furthermore, antisense DNA against eIF-5A2 could inhibit cell growth in ovarian cancer cell line UACC-1598 with amplification of eIF-5A2 in form of double minutes. Cell growth rate in UACC-1598 was also inhibited when the expression level of EIF-5A2 was decreased by the reduction of the copy number of double minutes. The correlation of EIF-5A2 overexpression and clinical features of ovarian cancer was investigated using tissue microarray, and the result showed that eIF-5A2 overexpression was significantly associated with the advanced stage of ovarian cancer. These findings suggest that eIF-5A2 plays important roles in ovarian pathogenesis.
