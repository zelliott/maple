Tubular particles presenting heterogeneous regions of chemistry on the tube-ends versus the side are fabricated and are shown to control the particle orientation on the surface of live lymphocytes. Controlling the orientation of anisotropic microparticles on cell surfaces is of interest for biomedical applications and drug delivery in particular, since it can be used to promote or resist particle internalization.
