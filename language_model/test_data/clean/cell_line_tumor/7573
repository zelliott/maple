The highly aggressive pediatric sarcomas are characterized by high levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9, which play crucial roles in tumor invasion and metastasis by degradation of the extracellular membrane leading to cancer cell spread to distal organs. We examined the effects of cytokines, mitogens, inducers and inhibitors on MMP-2 and -9 expression in osteosarcoma (U2OS) and rhabdomyosarcoma (RD). The selected compounds included natural cytokines and growth factors, as well as chemical compounds applied in therapy of sarcoma and natural compounds that have demonstrated anticancer therapeutic potential. These cell lines were cultured in their respective media to near confluence and the cells were washed with PBS and incubated in serum-free medium with various concentrations of several cytokines, mitogens and inhibitors. After 24 h the media were removed and analyzed for MMP-2 and -9 by gelatinase zymography and quantitated by densitometry. Osteosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma showed bands corresponding to MMP-2 and -9 with dose-dependent enhancement of MMP-9 with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment. Tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β and LPS enhanced osteosarcoma U2OS MMP-9 secretion but had no effect on MMP-2 secretion. Tumor necrosis factor-α stimulated rhabdomyosarcoma MMP-2 expression, but had no effect on MMP-9 secretion. Doxycycline, epigallocatechin gallate, nutrient mixture (NM), actinomycin-D, cyclohexamide, retinoic acid and dexamethasone inhibited MMP-2 and -9 in U2OS osteosarcoma cells. PMA-treated RD cells showed dose-response inhibition of MMP-9 by doxycycline and epigallocatechin gallate and both MMPs by NM. Dexamethasone and actinomycin-D showed inhibition of MMP-2 secretion of RD cells. Our results show that cytokines, mitogens and inducers show variable upregulation of U2OS osteosarcoma and RD rhabdomyosarcoma MMP-2 and -9 secretion, and inhibitors demonstrate downregulation under stimulatory conditions, suggesting the application of these agents for the development of effective therapies in pediatric sarcomas.
