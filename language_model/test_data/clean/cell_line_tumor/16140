Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an emerging cancer treatment modality based on the excitation of a nontoxic photosensitizer with harmless visible light to produce reactive-oxygen species (ROS) that induce apoptosis and/or necrosis in cancer cells. As the efficacy of this therapy strongly depends of the nature of the photosensitizer, there is a great interest to develop new photoactive molecules. Here we report for the first time the synthesis, characterization and bioactivity of metal complexes between the non-aromatic expanded porphyrin, namely 20-[[4'-(Trimethylsilyl)ethoxycarbonyl]phenyl-2,13-dimethyl-3,12-diethyl-[24] iso-pentaphyrin (PCRed) and Zn(II) [Zn(II)-PCRed] or Lu(III) [Lu(III)-PCRed]. The complexation of these two diamagnetic heavy metal ions to PCRed improved the properties of the free photosensitizer as a PDT drug. We discovered that the 1:1 complex between PCRed and Lu(III) significantly increases the cellular uptake, ROS production and antiproliferative capacity in four cancer cell lines. Our study shows that metal complexation is a useful strategy to potentiate iso-pentaphyrin as a PDT drug.
