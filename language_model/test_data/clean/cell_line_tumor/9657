A novel chlorophenol, 4-chloro-2-(hepta-1,3,5-triyn-1-yl)-phenol (1), was isolated as the major phenolic compound from the cells of Helichrysum aureonitens suspension cultures. Compound 1 has been proposed to be an intermediate in the acetylene biosynthetic pathway of other acetylenic compounds in Helichrysum spp. The ethanol extract of cell suspension cultures and compound 1 were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against monkey kidney Vero (Vero cells) and human prostate epithelial carcinoma (DU145) cell lines, also, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv were determined as well.
