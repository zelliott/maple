To evaluate the therapeutic effects of a (32)P-patch in the treatment of a murine melanoma.

Thirty male C57BL6 mice were divided into two groups: treated and control. Superficial tumors were induced in both groups by injecting B16F1 melanoma at about 10 cells/mouse subcutaneously. Tumors developed 10-15 days after transplantation and the (32)P-patch was applied on palpable tumors of the treated group. Tumor growth was followed up in both groups by measuring tumor size with a caliper. After the follow-up period, the animals were killed and tumor samples of the treated and control groups were collected for histological study by preparing paraffin sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin.

The (32)P-patch showed the absence of radioactivity leakage in vitro and the homogeneous distribution of the radionuclide. The skin surface at the application site of the (32)P-patch appeared hairless, and erythema developed, but reversed to normal after a few days in the treated group. Control of tumor growth was achieved in the treated group compared with the control group, although complete remission did not occur.

The (32)P-patch tested for the treatment of a murine melanoma model showed its efficacy, as tumor growth was retarded after application of the patch Nevertheless, adjustment of some therapeutic parameters and/or combining the patch with other treatment modalities may be necessary to achieve complete regression. The P-patch represents a powerful tool to individualize the treatment of melanoma.
