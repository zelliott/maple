Uterine leiomyomas are the most common gynecological benign tumor and greatly affect reproductive health and well-being. They are the predominant indication for hysterectomy in premenopausal women. Current epidemiological study reported that soy products intake is inversely associated with diseases leading to hysterectomy. Genistein is a soy-derived phytoestrogen and its inhibitory effect on leiomyoma cell proliferation is reported. In this study, we investigated the siginificant inhibitory effect of genistein on estradiol (E(2))-induced leiomyoma cells proliferation.

The Eker rat-derived uterine leiomyoma cell line ELT-3 cells were used. Cell proliferation was assessed by counting the number of cells. The expression of estrogen receptors and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) was evaluated by Western blot analysis.

PPARgamma was expressed in ELT-3 cells and genistein acted as PPARgamma ligand. This inhibitory effect of genistein was attenuated by the treatment of cells with PPARgamma antagonist bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) or GW9662.

These experimental findings in vitro show that the repressive effect of genistein on E(2)-induced ELT-3 cell proliferation is through the activation of PPARgamma. Genistein may be useful as an alternative therapy for leiomyoma.
