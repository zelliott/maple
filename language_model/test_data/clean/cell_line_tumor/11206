Anoikis, a form of programmed cell death that occurs due to cell detachment from the extracellular matrix, is a critical mechanism in preventing ectopic cell growth. Acquisition of resistance to anoikis is a prerequisite for epithelial ovarian cancer cells to survive in ascitic fluids before forming metastatic foci. Here we describe a colorimetric method for monitoring the resistance of anoikis of ovarian cancer cells in vitro.
