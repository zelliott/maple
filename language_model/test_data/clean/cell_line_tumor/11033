To investigate the prediction value of radiosensitivity of hepatocarcinoma cells for apoptosis and micronucleus assay.

Clonogenic assay, flow cytometry, and CB micronuclei assay were used to survey the cell survival rate, radiation-induced apoptosis and micronucleus frequency of hepatocarcinoma cell lines SMMC-7721, HL-7702, and HepG2 after being irradiated by X-ray at the dosage ranging 0-8 Gy.

After irradiation, there was a dose-effect relationship between micronucleus frequency and radiation dosage among the three cell lines ( p<0.05). A positive relationship was observed between apoptosis and radiation dosage among the three cell lines. The HepG2 cells had a significant correlation ( p<0.05) but apoptosis incidence had a negative relationship with micronucleus frequency. There was a positive relationship between apoptosis and radiation dosage and the correlation between SMMC-7721 and HL-7702 cell lines had a significant difference ( p<0.01). After irradiation, a negative relationship between cell survival rate and radiation dosages was found among the three cell lines ( p<0.01). There was a positive relationship between cell survival rate and micronucleus frequency ( p<0.01). No correlation was observed between apoptosis and cell survival rate.

The radiosensitivity of hepatocarcinoma cells can be reflected by apoptosis and micronuclei. Detection of apoptosis and micronuclei could enhance the accuracy for predicting radiosensitivity.
