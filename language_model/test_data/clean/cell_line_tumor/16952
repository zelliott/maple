Mutual regulation of expression between p53 and AR has been reported. To further investigate the role of p53 in the regulation of AR expression, an ARE-Luciferase vector was inserted into LNCaP and into LNCaP-sip53 transfectants, and AR activity was quantitatively estimated after treatment with proteasome inhibitors. LNCaP expresses a mutated form of AR. Therefore, to investigate whether p53 can modulate the expression of wild-type (wt) of AR, we transfected PC3-wtAR with a p53 vector together with ARE-Luc and showed that p53 expression decreased DHT-dependent activity of wtAR. Since proteasomes also participate in AR transcriptional activity, we investigated the role of p53 in proteasome-dependent inhibition of AR activity. More than 80% of AR activity was inhibited by 3 Î¼M of lactacystin in LNCaP whereas no inhibition was noted in LN-sip53. We also found that lactacystin decreased AR-DNA binding 3-fold in LNCaP but no binding decrease was observed in LN-sip53. Taken together, our data show that the inhibitory effects of proteasome inhibitors are dependent on p53 status, at least in prostate cancer. Therefore, the role of p53 during treatment with proteasome inhibitors in different tumors should be further investigated.
