To prepare anti-Sperm protein 17 (Sp17) immunomagnetic nanoparticles (IMNPs), and make foundation for target diagnosis of ovarian cancer by magnetic resonance imaging.

The anti-human Sp17 IMNPs were prepared by grafting anti-Sp17 antibodies on the surface of chitosan-coated magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) using the linker of EDC/NHS (1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide). The morphology and properties of the nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electronic microscopy (TEM), the conjugation of the antibodies was evaluated by native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the immunologic activity of IMNPs was evaluated by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A set of in vitro magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiments were performed after incubated the IMNPs with human Sp17 gene transfected ovarian cancer HO-8910 cells.

We had successfully grafted the MNPs with anti-Sp17 antibody and the IMNPs kept good bioactivity. The MRI showed that the IMNPs were targeted successfully to the positive cells, and no obviously non-specific adsorption was observed.

The anti-Sp17 IMNPs with good specificity can used for further study of ovarian cancer target therapy.
