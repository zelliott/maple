Oridonin, an extract from the Chinese herb Rabdosia rubescens, is currently one of the most important traditional Chinese herbal medicines. We investigated the anti-proliferative effect of oridonin on the lung cancer cell line SPC-A-1 and its mechanism of action. Growth inhibition was measured using a microculture tetrazolium assay and apoptosis was measured by several standard methods. Western blot analysis measured the expression of bcl-2 and bax proteins. Oridonin (> 28 micromol/l) inhibited the growth of SPC-A-1 cells and induced apoptosis. Marked morphological changes indicative of apoptosis were observed, especially in cells treated with oridonin for 48 - 60 h. Western blot analysis revealed downregulation of bcl-2 and upregulation of bax proteins following treatment with oridonin for 48 h. We conclude that oridonin demonstrated anti-proliferative and apoptosis-inducing effects on SPC-A-1 cells in vitro, and that changes in bcl-2 and bax protein levels may play an important role in its mechanism of action.
