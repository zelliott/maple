In orthodontic tooth movement, some cytokines released from periodontal ligament fibroblasts and alveolar bone osteoblasts on the pressure side can alter the normal processes of bone remodelling, resulting in physiological bone resorption. We examined the effect of compressive force and interleukin (IL)-1 type I receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) on the expression of inflammatory cytokines that promote osteoclast formation, as well as on their receptors, in osteoblastic Saos-2 cells.

The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum with or without continuous compressive force (0.5-3.0 g/cm(2)) and/or IL-1ra for up to 24h. The gene expression levels of the cytokines and their receptors were estimated by determining mRNA levels using real-time PCR; the protein levels were determined using ELISA or immunohistochemical staining.

The expression of IL-1beta, IL-1 receptor, IL-6, IL-6 receptor, IL-8 receptor, IL-11 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) increased depending on the strength and duration of the compressive force, whereas the expression of IL-8, IL-11 receptor and TNFalpha receptor did not change with the application of compressive force. The expression of cytokines and their receptors produced by 3.0 g/cm(2) of compressive force decreased with the simultaneous addition of IL-1ra and the decrease was remarkable in IL-8 receptor, IL-11 and TNFalpha.

These results indicate that mechanical stress induces the production of inflammatory cytokines and their receptors in osteoblasts and the phenomenon is enhanced by the autocrine action of IL-1beta, which is increased in amount by mechanical stress.
