The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay was addressed for its sensitivity, disturbances by foaming, and cell number and size. Cells were from a U-251 MG grade IV human glioblastoma brain tumor cell line used in 100-microl well volumes. Cells were counted by microscopy and Coulter counting; assays were LDH or trypan blue. The results indicate increased 490 nm signals (level, variance) by using phenol red or by increasing fetal bovine serum from 5% to 10%. The data also indicate that defoaming results in reduced variances ranging from a factor of 2 at 1-3 units of absorption, up to a factor of 4-5 at <1 units of absorption. Coulter counting indicated a decrease in cell volume with increasing end-point cell density, attributed to general shrinking at increasing density. In comparisons, total LDH was considered relative to both cell total volume and cell numbers. The result suggests that total LDH should be regarded as reflecting cell total volume rather than cell numbers. In a comparative Cu exposure test, signals of both LDH and a sodium salt of 4-[3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulfonate (WST-1) decreased with increasing Cu supply, while bromodeoxyuridine signals remained largely unaffected. The data show the differences in responses in cell viability and proliferation, but, above all, indicate that LDH should be expressed on a per cell volume basis rather than per cell, to avoid the problem that mere density effects contribute to signals on compound or metal toxicity.
