Investigation of the secondary metabolites of the marine-derived fungus Spicellum roseum yielded two new cyclohexadepsipeptides, spicellamide A (1) and spicellamide B (2). The structures of 1 and 2 were determined based on extensive evaluations of NMR and MS data. The absolute configuration was deduced after hydrolysis using Marfey's method, chiral chromatography, as well as NOESY and modeling data.
