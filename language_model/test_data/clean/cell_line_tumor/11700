4-(3',3'-Dimethylallyloxy)-5-methyl-6-methoxy-phthalide (DMMP) has previously been isolated from the endophytic fungus Pestalotiopsis photiniae. Although the cytotoxic activities of DMMP have been reported, little is known concerning the molecular mechanism of its cytotoxic effect. In the present study, we investigated the effect of DMMP on the growth of several types of cancer cell lines and investigated the mechanism of its antiproliferative effect. DMMP caused the growth inhibition of human cancer lines HeLa, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231, but had little antiproliferative effect on MRC5 normal lung cells. DMMP also significantly caused cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and upregulated the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27KIPI protein in the HeLa cells. Moreover DMMP was able to induce marked nuclear apoptotic morphology in HeLa cells. DMMP induced apoptosis and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) in the HeLa cells. Although the activated forms of caspase-9 and -3 in HeLa cells were detected, pretreatment with caspase inhibitors (Ac-DEVD-CHO and Z-VAD-FMK) failed to attenuate DMMP-induced cell death. In addition, protein levels of the p53 family members, p53 and p73, were upregulated, and DMMP significantly increased the mRNA expression of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family genes (PUMA, NOXA, Bax, Bad and Bim). HPV E6-E7 mRNA levels were reduced. In conclusion, DMMP demonstrates potential for use in the treatment of cervical cancer.
