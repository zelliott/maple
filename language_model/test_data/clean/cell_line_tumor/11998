Novel analogs of (-)-saframycin A are described. The analogs are shown to be potent inhibitors of the in vitro growth of several tumor cells in a broad panel and promising as leads for further optimization. The first in vivo studies in a solid tumor model (HCT-116) reveal potent antitumor activity with associated toxicity of daily administration.
