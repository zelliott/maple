DNA Topoisomerase I can cause DNA breaks and play a key role during cell proliferation and differentiation. It is an important target for anticancer agents. While screening for anticancer compounds, seven natural compounds, 1-7, showed potent cytotoxicities against a panel of ten cancer cell lines. Moreover, an inhibition assay demonstrated that they are also DNA topoisomerase I inhibitors, in which inhibitors 1-5 are new ones.
