4-1BB (CD137, TNFRSF9) is a costimulatory receptor expressed on several subsets of activated immune cells. Numerous studies of mouse and human T cells indicate that 4-1BB promotes cellular proliferation, survival, and cytokine production. 4-1BB agonist mAbs have demonstrated efficacy in prophylactic and therapeutic settings in both monotherapy and combination therapy tumor models and have established durable anti-tumor protective T-cell memory responses. PF-05082566 is a fully human IgG2 that binds to the extracellular domain of human 4-1BB with high affinity and specificity. In preclinical studies, this agonist antibody demonstrated its ability to activate NF-ÎºB and induce downstream cytokine production, promote leukocyte proliferation, and inhibit tumor growth in a human PBMC xenograft tumor model. The mechanism of action and robust anti-tumor efficacy of PF-05082566 support its clinical development for the treatment of a broad spectrum of human malignancies.
