To investigate whether cisplatin (DDP) enhances the anti-tumor activity of cytokine- induced killer (CIK) cells in a murine colon adenocarcinoma model.

Tumor size and weight served as indicators of therapeutic response. Immunohistochemistry was performed to observe intratumoral lymphocyte infiltration and tumor microvessel density. Changes in the percentage of regulatory T (Treg) cells within the spleens of tumor-bearing mice preconditioned with DDP were monitored using flow cytometry.

A marked T cell-dependent, synergistic anti-tumor effect of the combined therapy was observed (1968 ± 491 mm³ vs 3872 ± 216 mm³; P = 0.003). Preconditioning chemotherapy with DDP augmented the infiltration of CD3+ T lymphocytes into the tumor mass and reduced the percentage of both intratumoral and splenic Treg cells.

Preconditioning with DDP markedly enhances the efficacy of adoptively transferred CIK cells, providing a potential clinical modality for the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer.
