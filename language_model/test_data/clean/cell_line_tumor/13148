Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare but aggressive form of B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma in which therapy resistance is common. New therapeutic options have extended survival in refractory MCL but have not provided durable remission. Tools are needed to assess the molecular and genetic changes associated with therapy resistance. Therefore, therapy-resistant MCL cell lines were established from the liver, kidney and lungs of human Granta 519-bearing NOD-SCID (non-obese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficiency) mice following treatment with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) chemotherapy in combination with bortezomib. The cytomorphologies, immunophenotypes, growth patterns in semi-solid agar, cytogenetic profiles and gene expression differences between these cell lines were characterized to identify major changes associated with therapy resistance. Therapy-resistant cell lines exhibit more aggressive growth patterns and markedly different gene expression profiles compared to parental Granta 519 cells. Thus, these stable therapy-resistant cell lines are useful models to further study the molecular basis of drug resistance and to identify clinically relevant molecular targets in MCL.
