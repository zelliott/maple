Proteins of the 14-3-3 family are universal participate in multiple cellular processes. However, their exact role in the pathogenesis of prion diseases remains unclear. In this study, we proposed that human PrP was able to form molecular complex with 14-3-3β. The domains responsible for the interactions between PrP and 14-3-3β were mapped at the segments of amino acid (aa) residues 106-126 within PrP and aa 1-38 within 14-3-3β. Homology modeling revealed that the key aa residues for molecular interaction were D22 and D23 in 14-3-3β as well as K110 in PrP. Mutations in these aa residues inhibited the interaction between the two proteins in vitro. Our results also showed that recombinant PrP encouraged 14-3-3β dimer formation, whereas PrP106-126 peptide inhibited it. Recombinant 14-3-3β disaggregated the mature PrP106-126 fibrils in vitro. Moreover, the PrP-14-3-3 protein complexes were observed in the brain tissues of normal and scrapie agent 263K infected hamsters. Colocalization of PrP and 14-3-3 was seen in the cytoplasm of human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, as well as human cervical cancer cell line HeLa transiently expressing full-length human PrP. Our current data suggest the neuroprotection of PrPC and neuron damage caused by PrPSc may be associated with their functions of 14-3-3 dimerization regulation.
