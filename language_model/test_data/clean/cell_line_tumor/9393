Fibulin-2, an extracellular matrix protein expressed by normal epithelia, was found to be down-regulated in several breast cancer cell lines. Fibulin-2 protein expression was also decreased in breast cancer tissue samples as evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Reintroduction of Fibulin-2 into breast cancer cell lines that do not express Fibulin-2 reduced cancer cell motility and invasion in vitro but had no effect on cell growth and adhesion properties. Together with evidence that Fibulin-2 contributes to wound healing and inhibits smooth muscle cell migration, our findings suggest that loss of Fibulin-2 expression may facilitate migration and invasion in breast cancer.
