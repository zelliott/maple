Various novel 10-alkyl-2-deoxo-2-methylthioflavin-5-oxides and their 2-alkylamino derivatives were prepared by facile nitrosative cyclization of 6-(N-alkylanilino)-2-methylthiopyrimidin-4(3H)-ones followed by nucleophilic replacement of the 2-methylthio moiety by different amines, and acidic hydrolysis of the 2-methylthio moiety afforded the corresponding flavin derivatives. 2-Deoxo-2-methylthio-5-deazaalloxazines and 2-deoxo-2-methylthioalloxazine-5-oxides were also prepared by Vilsmeier reaction and by nitrosation of 6-anilino-2-methylthiopyrimidin-4(3H)-ones, respectively. Then, they were subjected to nucleophilic replacement with appropriate amines to produce the corresponding 2-alkylamino derivatives. Regiospecific N(3)-alkylation of 2-deoxo-2-methylthioalloxazine-5-oxides was carried out with various alkylating agents in the usual way. The antitumor activities against CCRF-HSB-2 and KB tumor cells have been investigated in vitro, and many compounds showed promising antitumor activities. Furthermore, AutoDock molecular docking into PTK (PDB: 1t46) has been done for lead optimization of the aforementioned compounds as potential PTK inhibitors.
