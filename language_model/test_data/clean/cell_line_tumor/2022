Histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) is crucial for embryonic development, affects cytokine signaling relevant for immune responses, and is often significantly overexpressed in solid tumors, but little is known of its role in human lung cancer. In this study, we demonstrated the aberrant expression of HDAC2 in lung cancer tissues and investigated oncogenic properties of HDAC2 in human lung cancer cell lines. HDAC2 inactivation resulted in regression of tumor cell growth and activation of cellular apoptosis via p53 and Bax activation and Bcl2 suppression. In cell cycle regulation, HDAC2 inactivation caused induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 expression, and simultaneously suppressed the expressions of cyclin E2, cyclin D1, and CDK2, respectively. Consequently, this led to the hypophosphorylation of pRb protein in G1/S transition and thereby inactivated E2F/DP1 target gene transcriptions of A549 cells. In addition, we demonstrated that HDAC2 directly regulated p21WAF1/CIP1 expression in a p53-independent manner. However, HDAC1 was not related to p21WAF1/CIP1 expression and tumorigenesis of lung cancer. Lastly, we observed that sustained-suppression of HDAC2 in A549 lung cancer cells attenuated in vitro tumorigenic properties and in vivo tumor growth of the mouse xenograft model. Taken together, we suggest that the aberrant regulation of HDAC2 and its epigenetic regulation of gene transcription in apoptosis and cell cycle components play an important role in the development of lung cancer.
