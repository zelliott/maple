Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis in cancer cells. However, TRAIL is not toxic against most normal cells. We have accordingly examined by in vivo electroporation whether TRAIL induces apoptosis in renal cell carcinoma. In addition, combination treatment with TRAIL and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) against renal cell carcinoma was also investigated. The NC65 renal cell carcinoma line was used as a target. pCAGGS TRAIL was injected into the NC65 tumors in the right flanks of severe combined immunodeficient mice. Tumors were pulsed with the CUY21 electroporator. Electroporation was done once on day 0 or thrice on days 0, 2, and 4. Apoptosis was determined by terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated nick-end labeling assay. When TRAIL gene therapy using in vivo i.t. electroporation was done once only, the growth of NC65 tumors was not inhibited. However, when TRAIL gene therapy was done thrice, growth suppression of the NC65 tumors was observed. Transfection of the TRAIL gene by in vivo electroporation induced apoptosis in NC65 tumors. When NC65 cells were treated with TRAIL gene therapy in combination with 5-FU, stronger growth suppression was obtained. TRAIL gene therapy did not induce liver dysfunction in severe combined immunodeficient mice. This study shows that TRAIL gene therapy induced growth suppression and apoptosis in NC65 tumors without severe side effects, and that combination treatment of NC65 cells with TRAIL gene therapy and 5-FU resulted in higher antitumor activity. These findings suggest that TRAIL gene therapy and/or 5-FU may be effective against renal cell carcinoma without harmful toxic effects.
