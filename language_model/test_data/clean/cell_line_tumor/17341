Papain-like cysteine proteases are the most numerous family of the cysteine protease class. They are expressed throughout the animal and plant kingdoms as well as in viruses and bacteria. More recently, this protease family has drawn attention as a potential pharmaceutical drug target in diseases characterized by excessive extracellular matrix degradation such as in osteoporosis, arthritis, vascular diseases, and cancer. Moreover, papain-like cysteine proteases have been identified as critical components of the life cycle and invasive potential of various human and live stock pathogens as well as major allergens. Therefore, this protease class is rigorously studied and requires sufficient amounts of protease protein to analyze structure-activity relationships, their 3-D structures as well as to screen for and optimize potent and selective inhibitors. This review summarizes approaches to generate active papain-like cysteine proteases by heterologous expression in a variety of expression systems.
