Tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate (TOCP), an organophosphorus ester, can cause neurotoxicity such as organophosphorus ester-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN) in humans and sensitive animals. Moreover, it also affects the development of central nervous system and differentiation of neuronal cells. In this study, retinoic acid-induced differentiated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells are utilized to investigate the effects of TOCP on neurite outgrowth and the underlying mechanisms. We found that low concentrations of TOCP induced autophagy and inhibited neurite outgrowth in a dose-dependent manner with no effect on cell viability. The protein levels of high molecular weight neurofilament (NF-H), low molecular weight neurofilament (NF-L) and β-tubulin also decreased. Pretreatment cells with 3-methyladenine (3-MA), an autophagy inhibitor, not only inhibited the TOCP-induced autophagy, but also reversed the inhibition of neurite outgrowth and the degradation of NF-H, NF-L, and β-tubulin by TOCP. Taken together, these results indicated that TOCP treatment induced autophagy in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, which lead to degradation of cytoskeletal components and inhibition of neurite outgrowth.
