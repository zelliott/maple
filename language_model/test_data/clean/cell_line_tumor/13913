The expression of specific mRNA isoforms may uniquely reflect the biological state of a cell because it reflects the integrated outcome of both transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation. In this study, we constructed a splicing array to examine approximately 1,500 mRNA isoforms from a panel of genes previously implicated in prostate cancer and identified a large number of cell type-specific mRNA isoforms. We also developed a novel "two-dimensional" profiling strategy to simultaneously quantify changes in splicing and transcript abundance; the results revealed extensive covariation between transcription and splicing in prostate cancer cells. Taking advantage of the ability of our technology to analyze RNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues, we derived a specific set of mRNA isoform biomarkers for prostate cancer using independent panels of tissue samples for feature selection and cross-analysis. A number of cancer-specific splicing switch events were further validated by laser capture microdissection. Quantitative changes in transcription/RNA stability and qualitative differences in splicing ratio may thus be combined to characterize tumorigenic programs and signature mRNA isoforms may serve as unique biomarkers for tumor diagnosis and prognosis.
