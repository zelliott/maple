Electrostatic amino acid interactions between receptor subunits within the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) transmembrane domain are critical for the formation of the TCR-CD3 complex. Core peptide, a short peptide corresponding to the TCR-alpha transmembrane region, containing two positively charged amino acids, is known to inhibit T-cell function in vitro and in vivo. The aim of this study was to examine peptides corresponding to the syntactic transmembrane CD3 region binding to TCR-alpha for their ability to inhibit T-cell activation in vitro and in vivo. Three peptides matching the transmembrane sequence of CD3-delta, -epsilon and -gamma were synthesized and tested in different biological in vitro and in vivo systems for their effect on T-cell activity. The CD3-peptides had no impact on T-cell function in vitro, but surprisingly, decreased signs of inflammation in the adjuvant arthritis rat model in vivo. Preliminary evidence suggests that peptides with CD3 transmembrane-derived sequences can inhibit an immune response as assessed by adjuvant-induced arthritis. The lack of in vitro activity may lead to a wasteful disregard of active compounds in the process of drug discovery and development.
