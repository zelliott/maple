Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most frequent cancer worldwide, comprising approximately 50% of all malignancies in some developing nations. Our recent work identified protein kinase Cepsilon (PKCepsilon) as a critical and causative player in establishing an aggressive phenotype in HNSCC. In this study, we investigated the specificity and efficacy of HN1-PKCepsilon, a novel bifunctional cancer cell homing, PKCepsilon inhibitory peptide, as a treatment for HNSCC. HN1-PKCepsilon peptide was designed by merging two separate technologies and synthesized as a capped peptide with two functional modules, HN1 (cancer cell homing) and PKCepsilon (specific PKCepsilon inhibitory), connected by a novel linker module. HN1-PKCepsilon preferentially internalized into UMSCC1 and UMSCC36 cells, two HNSCC cell lines, in comparison with oral epithelial cells: 82.1% positive for UMSCC1 and 86.5% positive for UMSCC36 compared with 1.2% positive for oral epithelial cells. In addition, HN1-PKCepsilon penetrated HNSCC cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Consistent with these in vitro observations, systemic injection of HN1-PKCepsilon resulted in selective delivery of HN1-PKCepsilon into UMSCC1 xenografts in nude mice. HN1-PKCepsilon blocked the translocation of active PKCepsilon in UMSCC1 cells, confirming HN1-PKCepsilon as a PKCepsilon inhibitor. HN1-PKCepsilon inhibited cell invasion by 72 +/- 2% (P < 0.001, n = 12) and cell motility by 56 +/- 2% (P < 0.001, n = 5) in UMSCC1 cells. Moreover, in vivo bioluminescence imaging showed that HN1-PKCepsilon significantly (83 +/- 1% inhibition; P < 0.02) retards the growth of UMSCC1 xenografts in nude mice. Our work indicates that the bifunctional HN1-PKCepsilon inhibitory peptide represents a promising novel therapeutic strategy for HNSCC.
