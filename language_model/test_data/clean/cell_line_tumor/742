cpQSOx1 is a member of the QSOx family of proteins, expressed in the guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) and ortholog of the rat rQSOx1. In this study, in vitro experiments were conducted and showed that, as other member of this family, cpQSOx1 has a sulfydryl oxidase activity, and is a secreted protein. Then, the expression of this enzyme was researched in the guinea pig brain, as very little information exists yet on the expression of QSOx family members in the central nervous system. By immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR and in situ hybridization, cpQSOx1 is synthesized by neurons throughout the whole guinea pig central nervous system. Reticular structures as the basal forebrain, reticular thalamic nucleus and reticular nuclei of the brainstem contained the densest labeling. These results are discussed in terms of putative roles of this protein in synaptic strengthening and in redox activities.
