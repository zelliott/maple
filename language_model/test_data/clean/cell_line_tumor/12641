Several novel molecules, 1-(3'-(9H-carbazol-4-yloxy)-2'-hydroxypropyl)-3-aryl-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylic acid derivatives 3a-g were synthesized and screened to evaluate their cytotoxicity against cancer cells in vitro. The compounds 3a-g has been prepared by the reaction of ethyl 3-aryl-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylate with 4-oxiranylmethoxy-9H-carbazole in moderate to excellent yields. The cytotoxicity of synthesized compounds was evaluated by a SRB (sulforhodamine B) assay against cancer cell such as SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma (NB), human A549 lung carcinoma, human breast cancer MCF-7 cell lines. The results showed that seven compounds can suppress SK-N-SH tumor cancer cell growth. Among them, compound 3d was the most effective small molecule in inhibiting SK-N-SH cell growth.
