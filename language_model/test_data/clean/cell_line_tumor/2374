A novel ruthenium complex, linked to a cholesterol-containing nucleolipid (named ToThyCholRu), stabilized by lipid aggregates for antineoplastic therapy is presented. In order to retard the degradation kinetics typically observed for several ruthenium-based antineoplastic agents, ToThyCholRu is incorporated into a liposome bilayer formed by POPC. The resulting nanoaggregates contain up to 15% in moles of the ruthenium complex, and are shown to be stable for several weeks. The liposomes host the ruthenium-nucleolipid complex with the metal ion surrounded by POPC lipid headgroups and the steroid moiety inserted in the more external acyl chain region. These ruthenium-containing liposomes are more effective in inhibiting the growth of cancer cells than a model NAMI-A-like ruthenium complex, prepared for a direct evaluation of their anti-proliferative activity. These results introduce new perspectives in the design of innovative transition-metal-based supramolecular systems for anticancer drug vectorization.
