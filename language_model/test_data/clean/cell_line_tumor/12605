To prepare polyrotaxane-camptothecin conjugates and evaluate its anti-tumor effect, polyrotaxane-camptothecin conjugates were successfully synthesized, and the release behavior was performed; MTT assay and cell morphology were used to examine the inhibition of cells' proliferation effect in vitro. The experimental study of the antitumor effect on S180 mice in vivo was also performed to further evaluate the anti-tumor effect of conjugate. The result showed polyrotaxane-camptothecin conjugates can effectively inhibit the proliferation in a dose dependent effect. In vivo study and cell morphology observation of S180 mice showed significant decrease in growth of tumor, degree of tumor infiltration and blood vessel number. The result indicated anti-tumor mechanism may be through affect the angiogenesis and reduced blood supply to tumor cells and then leading to necrosis.
