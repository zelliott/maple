Cytokines play important roles in the expression of adhesion molecules and the function of anti-tumor effector cells in the immune system. In this study, the influence of interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-18 on the expression of ICAM-1 and natural killer (NK)-cell mediated lysis in a human osteosarcoma cell line (HOS) was evaluated. ICAM-I expression of HOS cells were analyzed by flow cytometry following treatment with IL-12, IL-18 or both, and in co-cultures with peripheral lymphocytes. NK-cell activation in response to IL-12 and IL-18 was investigated by selective flow cytometry using propidium iodide. ICAM-1 expression on HOS cells was significantly enhanced by IL-12, but only when co-cultured in cell-to-cell contact with peripheral lymphocytes. Antibodies to interferon-gamma abrogated this effect. If HOS cells and peripheral lymphocytes were separated in co-cultures, IL-18 could substitute for cell-to-cell contact, facilitating IL-12-mediated enhancement of ICAM-1. Addition of IL-18 also enhanced NK-mediated cytolysis of HOS cells. These findings demonstrate that IL-12 can enhance the expression of ICAM-1 in the presence of IFN-gamma and, with IL-18, enhances NK anti-tumor activity. Immunomodulation via cytokine therapy may lead to improved eradication of chemotherapy-resistant osteosarcomas.
