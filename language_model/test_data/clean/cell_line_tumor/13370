Multiple myeloma (MM) is preceded by the asymptomatic pre-malignant state, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Although MGUS patients may remain stable for years, they are at increased risk of progressing to MM. A better understanding of the relevant molecular changes underlying the transition from an asymptomatic to symptomatic disease state is urgently needed. Our studies show for the first time that the CD147 molecule (extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer) may be having an important biological role in MM. We first demonstrate that CD147 is overexpressed in MM plasma cells (PCs) vs normal and pre-malignant PCs. Next, functional studies revealed that the natural CD147 ligand, cyclophilin B, stimulates MM cell growth. Moreover, when MM patient PCs displaying bimodal CD147 expression were separated into CD147(bright) and CD147(dim) populations and analyzed for proliferation potential, we discovered that CD147(bright) PCs displayed significantly higher levels of cell proliferation than did CD147(dim) PCs. Lastly, CD147-silencing significantly attenuated MM cell proliferation. Taken together, these data suggest that the CD147 molecule has a key role in MM cell proliferation and may serve as an attractive target for reducing the proliferative compartment of this disease.
