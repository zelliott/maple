The effects of pulmonary surfactant on the morphology and functioning of young macrophages were studied on the model of monocyte/macrophage differentiation in vitro and on macrophages of the bronchial alveolar lavage fluid. Surfactant is not a differentiation inductor, but it stimulated the maturation and phagocytic activity of young macrophages. The stimulatory effect of surfactant on phagocytic activity of macrophages persisted even after its removal from the culture medium.
