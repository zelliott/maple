A new and efficient synthetic pathway employed the aldol condensation between the acetophenone (3) and vanillin derivative (4) resulted in the precursor chalcone intermediate (14). The target compound viscolin (1) could be afforded through the hydrogenation of the chalcone and followed by deprotection. The present strategy described the development of a more efficient procedure that allowed large-scale production of viscolin for the further research of biological activity both in vitro and in vivo.
