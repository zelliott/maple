Lung cancers with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-activating mutations show good clinical response to gefitinib and erlotinib, selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) to EGFR, but these tumors invariably develop drug resistance. Host stromal cells have been found to have a considerable effect on the behavior of cancer cells. Little is known, however, about the role of host cells on the sensitivity of cancer cells to receptor TKIs. We have therefore assessed the effect of crosstalk between stromal cells and lung cancer cells harboring EGFR mutations on susceptibility to EGFR-TKIs.

We evaluated the gefitinib sensitivity of lung cancer cells with EGFR-activating mutations, PC-9 and HCC827, when cocultured with fibroblasts and coinjected into severe combined immunodeficient mice. We also examined the effect of lung cancer cells to fibroblast recruitment.

Both human fibroblast cell lines and primary cultured fibroblasts produced various levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Lung cancer cells markedly recruited fibroblasts. The lung cancer cells became resistant to EGFR-TKIs when cocultured in vitro with HGF-producing fibroblasts and coinjected into severe combined immunodeficient mice. Importantly, combined use of gefitinib plus anti-HGF antibody or the HGF antagonist, NK4, successfully overcame the fibroblast-induced EGFR-TKI resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Colocalization of fibroblasts and HGF was detected in both xenograft tumors in mouse model and lung cancer patient specimens.

These findings indicate that crosstalk to stromal fibroblasts plays a critical role in lung cancer resistance to EGFR-TKIs and may be an ideal therapeutic target in lung cancer with EGFR-activating mutations.
