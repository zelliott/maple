To investigate the effect of small interfering RNA-mediated receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1) knockdown on the sensitivity of human oral squamous carcinoma cells to to oxaliplatin (L-OHP)-induced apoptosis and explore a new target for clinical treatment of oral squamous carcinoma.

The viability of human oral squamous carcinoma cell line KB exposed to different concentrations (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 µmol/L) of L-OHP were detected by MTT assay. PI/Annexin V staining was used to observe cell apoptosis in naive KB cells, cell and transfected with pSH1Si-RIP1 or with the empty plasmid. Western blotting was used to detect RIP1 expression in KB cells exposed to L-OHP and in cells transfected with pSH1Si-RIP1.

Exposure to L-OHP (1µmol/L) for 24, 48, 72 h resulted in KB cell survival rates of 67.66%, 55.17%, and 41.34%, respectively, but the cell apoptosis rate was only 9.6% following a 24-h exposure. KB cells transfected with pSH1Si-RIP1 showed an apoptotic rate of 9.4%, which increased to 29.1% following L-OHP exposure. RIP1 expression was first up-regulated and then down-regulated in KB cells treated with L-OHP, and was significantly reduced after cell transfection with pSH1Si-RIP1.

Suppression of RIP1 expression increases the apoptotic rate of human oral squamous carcinoma cells, suggesting the potential of RIP1 as a new candidate target for clinical treatment of oral squamous carcinoma.
