1-O-methyl-fructofuranose (1-O-MFF) from the fruit of Schisandra chinensis is a traditional Korean medicinal herb that has a variety of beneficial properties. The effect of purified 1-O-MFF on melanogenesis including the activation of related signaling pathways was investigated.

The inhibitory activities of 1-O-MFF were examined by melanin synthesis, tyrosinase activity assay, Western blot and flow cytometric analyses in B16F0 mouse melanoma cells.

1-O-MFF significantly inhibited both melanin synthesis and tyrosinase activity in a concentration-dependent manner, and reduced the expression of melanogenic proteins including microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related protein-1. 1-O-MFF phosphorylated and activated melanogenesis inhibitory proteins such as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt. Flow cytometry confirmed that 1-O-MFF phosphorylated ERK and Akt proteins and recovered partially phosphorylated forms in cells treated with the MEK/ERK inhibitor compound PD98059 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt inhibitor compound LY294002.

The suppressive effects of 1-O-MFF on melanogenesis may involve down-regulation of MITF and its downstream signal pathway via the activation of MEK/ERK or PI3K/Akt.
