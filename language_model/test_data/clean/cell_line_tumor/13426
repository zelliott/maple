Calyculin A (Cal A) is a serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor that is capable of inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. In this study, we examined whether Cal A could modulate TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human renal carcinoma-derived Caki cells. Our results show that Cal A is capable of sensitizing Caki cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, as well as U2OS human osteosarcoma cells and A549 human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells. Cal A increases intracellular ROS production and down-regulates c-FLIP(L) expression. Interestingly, the down-regulation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) by PP1 siRNA also reduced c-FLIP(L) expression via reactive oxygen species production. Furthermore, Cal A induced death receptor 4 (DR4) mRNA and protein expression by enhancing DR4 mRNA stability. We also found that PP4 siRNA up-regulated DR4 mRNA and protein expression. Collectively, our results suggest that Cal A could enhance TRAIL-mediated apoptosis via the down-regulation of c-FLIP(L) and the up-regulation of DR4 in human renal cell carcinoma cell line Caki.
