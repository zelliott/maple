Expression of the Wilms' tumor gene W T1 in primary astrocytic tumors was examined using a quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or immunohistochemistry. Real-time RT-PCR showed that W T1 mRNA was expressed at various levels in all of the 25 astrocytic tumors examined. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that W T1 protein was expressed in 5 of 6 low-grade astrocytic tumors (grade I-II) and all of 18 high-grade ones (grade III-IV), and that expression levels of W T1 protein in high-grade tumors were significantly higher than those in low-grade ones. W T1 protein was not detected in the normal glial cells contained in the tumor specimens. Furthermore, treatment with W T1 antisense oligomers specifically inhibited growth of glioblastoma cell lines, U87-MG, A172, and T-98G. These results may indicate that the W T1 gene plays an important role in tumorigenesis of primary astrocytic tumors.
