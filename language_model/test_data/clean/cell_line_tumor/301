Anti-tumor potential of root extracts of Calotropis procera: methanolic extract (CM), hexane extract (CH), aqueous extract (CW) and ethylacetate extract (CE) and its possible mechanism against Hep2 cancer cells has been investigated. Cellular proliferation activities were assayed by tetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetry. Morphological changes of cancer cells were observed under inverted microscope and cell cycle parameters were determined by flow cytometry following propidium iodide staining. Treatment with the extracts at various doses of 1, 5, 10 and 25 microg/ml revealed that CM, CH and CE possessed cytotoxicity, whereas CW did not have cytotoxic effect. CE (10 microg/ml) showed strongest cytotoxic effect (96.3%) on Hep2 at 48 hr following treatment, whereas CM and CH showed cytotoxicity of 72.7 and 60.5%, respectively. Extract-treated cells exhibited typical morphological changes of apoptosis. Results of flow cytometric analysis clearly demonstrated that root extracts initiated apoptosis of Hep2 cells through cell cycle arrest at S phase, thus preventing cells from entering G2/M phase. Results of the study indicate that the root extracts of C. procera inhibit the proliferation of Hep2 cells via apoptotic and cell cycle disruption based mechanisms.
