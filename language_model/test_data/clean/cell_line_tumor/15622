The objective of the study was to evaluate the utility of NV1042, a replication competent, oncolytic herpes simplex virus (HSV) containing the interleukin-12 (IL-12) gene, as primary treatment for hepatic tumors and to further assess its ability to reduce tumor recurrence following resection. Resection is the most effective therapy for hepatic malignancies, but is not possible in the majority of the patients. Furthermore, recurrence is common after resection, most often in the remnant liver and likely because of microscopic residual disease in the setting of postoperative host cellular immune dysfunction. We hypothesize that, unlike other gene transfer approaches, direct injection of liver tumors with replication competent, oncolytic HSV expressing IL-12 will not only provide effective control of the parent tumor, but will also elicit an immune response directed at residual tumor cells, thus decreasing the risk of cancer recurrence after resection. Solitary Morris hepatomas, established in Buffalo rat livers, were injected directly with 10(7) particles of NV1042, NV1023, an oncolytic HSV identical to NV1042 but without the IL-12 gene, or with saline. Following tumor injection, the parent tumors were resected and measured and the animals were challenged with an intraportal injection of 10(5) tumor cells, recreating the clinical scenario of residual microscopic cancer. In vitro cytotoxicity against Morris hepatoma cells was similar for both viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 1 (MOI, ratio of viral particles to target cells), with >90% tumor cell kill by day 6. NV1042 induced high-level expression of IL-12 in vitro, peaking after 4 days in culture. Furthermore, a single intratumoral injection of NV1042, but not NV1023, induced marked IL-12 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) expression. Both viruses induced a significant local immune response as evidenced by an increase in the number of intratumoral CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes, although the peak of CD8(+) infiltration was later with NV1042 compared with NV1023. NV1042 and NV1023 reduced parent tumor volume by 74% ( p<.003) and 52% ( p<.03), respectively, compared to control animals. Treatment of established tumors with NV1042, but not with NV1023, significantly reduced the number of hepatic tumors after resection of the parent tumor and rechallenge (16.8+/-11 (median=4) vs. 65.9+/-15 (median=66) in control animals,  p<.025). In conclusion, oncolytic HSV therapy combined with local immune stimulation with IL-12 offers effective control of parent hepatic tumors and also protects against microscopic residual disease after resection. The ease of use of this combined modality approach, which appears to be superior to either approach alone, suggests that it may have clinical relevance, both as primary treatment for patients with unresectable tumors and also as a neoadjuvant strategy for reducing recurrence after resection.
