The evaluation of the in vitro cytotoxic properties of two pyrazole compounds: 1-(4-nitrophényl)-3,5-diméthylpyrazole (1) and 1,1'-di(4-nitrophényl)-5,5'-diisopropyl-3,3'-bipyrazole (2) was investigated against Hep cell line (Human laryngeal carcinoma). These two compounds showed an important cytotoxic activity on the Hep cell line, with IC(50): 8.25 microg mL(-1) for the compound 1; IC(50): 10.20 microg mL(-1) for the compound 2 while the IC(50) for adriamycine used as positive control was 3.62 microg mL(-1).
