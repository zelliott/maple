Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are thought to be of importance for the migratory ability of natural killer (NK) cells. Their expression and production may influence the amount of tumour-infiltrating NK cells and thereby any therapeutic capability. In this study, we sought to investigate the importance of MMPs for human NK cells' ability to degrade and migrate through the extracellular matrix (ECM). The two human NK cell lines, NK-92 and YT, migratory ability, MMP expression and production as well as their morphological appearance when cultured in the ECM equivalent Matrigel were analysed and compared. The quantitatively more migratory NK-92 cells were found to express invadopodia/podosomes at a significantly higher degree when cultured in Matrigel and gave rise to a general disintegration of the Matrigel. The NK-92 cells had a higher mRNA expression of MMP-2, -9, -13, MT1-, MT3- and MT6-MMP and a significantly higher production of MMP-9 compared to YT cells. These differences could explain the substantial functional difference observed between the two cell lines with respect to migratory capacity. In addition, the number of Matrigel invading NK-92 cells decreased significantly in the presence of the MMP inhibitor GM6001, demonstrating that MMPs have a critical function in their migration.
