The principal aim of this study was to analyze in estrogen receptor-positive             MCF7 cells the response of three estrogen-dependent proteins to 27-hydroxycholesterol             (27OHC), a major circulating cholesterol metabolite. Immunofluorescence, immunoblotting             and immunogold labelling analyses of MCF7 cells exposed for up to 72 h to 2 nM             estradiol (E2) or to 2 µM 27OHC demonstrated similar responses in the expression             of MnSOD and ERβ compared to the non-stimulated cells. Thus, the results confirm             27OHC's function as a novel selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). The             epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), observed in MCF7 cells stimulated             for longer than 48 h with 2 µM 27OHC, was accompanied by lower immunoreactive             levels of nuclear FOXM1 in comparison to E2-treated cells. The results presented             in this study are discussed taking into consideration the relationship of hypercholesterolemia,             27OHC production, ROS synthesis and macrophage infiltration, potentially occurring             in obese patients with ERα-positive, infiltrated mammary tumors.
