As-cast Ti-xGe (x = 2, 5, 10, 20 wt %) binary alloys were produced in this work, and various experiments were carried out to investigate the microstructure, mechanical properties, in vitro electrochemical and immersion corrosion behaviors as well as cytotoxicity with as-cast pure Ti as control, aiming to study the feasibility of Ti-xGe alloy system as potential dental materials. The microstructure of Ti-xGe alloys changes from single α-Ti phase to α-Ti + Ti(5)Ge(3) precipitation phase with the increase of Ge content. Mechanical tests show that Ti-5Ge alloy has the best comprehensive mechanical properties. The corrosion behavior of Ti-xGe alloys in artificial saliva with different NaF and lactic acid addition at 37°C indicates that Ti-2Ge and Ti-5Ge alloys show better corrosion resistance to fluorine-containing solution. The cytotoxicity test indicates that Ti-xGe alloy extracts show no obvious reduction of cell viability to L-929 fibroblasts and MG-63 osteosarcoma cells, similar to pure Ti which is generally acknowledged to be biocompatible. Considering all these results, Ti-2Ge and Ti-5Ge alloys possess the optimal comprehensive performance and might be used as potential dental materials.
