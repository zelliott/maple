SHEN QI JIN KANG (SQJK) capsule is a complex preparation, consisting of effective components extracted from radix astragali, ginseng, curcuma, etc. It has been demonstrated to be able to decrease tumor volume, increase life quality and prolong survival time in clinic application. The study was to investigate the antitumor effects of SQJK capsule in vivo and in vitro, and further explore the possible mechanisms.

The proliferation of cancer cells treated with SQJK was measured by MTT assay in twelve cell lines; cell apoptosis was observed under an electric microscopic and detected by flow cytometry in MCF-7 and MA891 cells; altered telomerase activity in A549 cells was examined by a telomerase activity detection kit. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of SQJK on tumors was also surveyed in vivo by using mice and nude mice models bearing transplanted tumors.

Inhibitory concentration 50% (IC(50)) of SQJK on A549, U251, MCF-7, Ketr-3, EJ, and A2780 cells was 30.954 microg/ml, 31.746 microg/ml, 37.220 microg/ml, 40.366 microg/ml, 41.398 microg/ml, and 45.083 microg/ml, respectively. Typical sub-G1 peaks, indicating the occurrence of apoptosis, were revealed in MA891and MCF-7 cells treated with SQJK. Morphological changes including cell shrinkage and condensation of chromosomes were observed. The telomerase activity of A549 was inhibited after 48 h of SQJK treatment. SQJK 1.8 g/kg inhibited the weights of transplanted tumors (MA891, H22, S180 in mice and PC-3 (M), MCF-7 and Ketr-3 in nude mice) by 50.84%, 48.91%, 40.88%, 62.50%, 47.83% and 30.06%, while SQJK 3.6 g/kg inhibited the weights by 56.49%, 59.62%, 55.70%, 70.76%, 58.66% and 50.18%, respectively.

SQJK has demonstrated antitumor bioactivity both in vitro and in vivo, which may be related to its effects of inducing apoptosis and decreasing telomerase activity.
