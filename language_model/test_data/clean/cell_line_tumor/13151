Gold nanorods have been reported as potential tumor photothermal therapy in vivo and in vitro. However, development of the safe and efficient tumor-targeting gold nanorods for in vivo localized tumor therapy is still a challenge. In our present study, we synthesized the PEG modified gold nanorods and demonstrated its negligible cytotoxicity in vitro. These nanorods also have been demonstrated to efficiently ablate the different kinds of tumor cells in vitro after exposure to the near-infrared laser. When the PEG modified gold nanorods conjugated with the 12P (sequence: TACHQHVRMVRP), this conjugate showed great tumor-targeting and hyperthermia effects on the human liver cancer cell line HepG2 in vitro when coupled with the near-infrared laser treatment. To determine the potential hyperthermia effect of PEG modified gold nanorods or 12P conjugate on tumor cells in vivo, the mice hepatic cancer cells were used to induce the subcutaneous tumor-bearing model in ICR mice. The significant inhibition effects of near-infrared laser mediated PEG modified gold nanorods or 12P conjugate on the tumor growth were observed. These composite results suggest that the 12P-conjugated PEG modified gold nanorods exhibit great biocompatible, particular tumor-targeting and effective photothermal ablation of tumor cells, which warrant the potential therapeutic value of this conjugate for further application in in vivo localized tumor therapy.
