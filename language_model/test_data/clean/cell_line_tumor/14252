The study was aimed to detect expression rate of survivin gene in APL cell and to explore the relationship between its expression and clinical manifestation. PML/RARalpha and survivin mRNA expression were analyzed by using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique. The results showed: (1) the survivin gene expression was detected in NB4 cell line. By treatment with ATRA, survivin mRNA expression in NB4 cell gradually decreased along with time delay and almost could not be detected at the 72th hour. (2) the positive and negative rate of survivin mRNA expression was 67% and 33% respectively, while in all 36 cases of de novo and relapse APL patients, the PML/RAR(alpha) fusion gene expression was positive. In 22 cases at remission stage, the PML/RARalpha fusion gene expression was negative, and the positive and negative rate of survivin mRNA expression was 36% and 64% respectively. The survivin mRNA expression positive rates in the de novo group, relapse group and PML/RARalpha fusion gene L-type positive group were obviously higher than those in remission period group (P < 0.05) and were significantly lower than those in acute leukemia group (P < 0.05, < 0.001). (3) whether the survivin mRNA expression was positive or negative in 36 cases of de novo and relapse APL patients, all the 36 cases could obtain complete remission. 4 APL patients with positive expression of survivin mRNA had DIC and serious infection (one patient died). The clinical symptom showed slight skin or mucosa bleeding, fever and asthenic in the patients with negative expression of survivin mRNA. When 2 APL patients with positive expression of survivin mRNA had been treated with ATRA, induction differentiation sign in their peripheral blood and bone marrow figures was not obvious. It is concluded that the survivin gene positive expression rate is lower in acute promyelocytic leukemia than that in any other types of leukemia and is related to clinical manifestation.
