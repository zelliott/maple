The Akt-Mdm2 pathway plays an important role in carcinogenesis in a variety of malignant tumors. However, the Akt-Mdm2 pathway in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has not been fully studied. We investigated the proteins and mRNA expression of Akt and Mdm2 to elucidate the roles of these proteins in ESCC. We also examined the effect of Akt knockdown on Mdm2 expression in ESCC cells. ESCC tissue samples were obtained from 23 individuals who underwent surgical resection with no preoperative treatment. Akt1-3 and Mdm2 gene and protein expression were analyzed. The effect of siRNA-mediated Akt knockdown on Mdm2 expression was also studied, using ESCC cell lines. Akt1 and Mdm2 immunoreactivity was detected in 77.8 and 66.7% of tumor specimen from ESCC patients, respectively. Akt1 and Mdm2 mRNA expressions were correlated and significantly elevated in tumor tissue ( p<0.0001 and  p<0.05, respectively). The siRNA-targeted reduction of each Akt isoform reduced Mdm2 protein expression. The overexpression of Akt1 and Mdm2 may be related to esophageal carcinogenesis. Furthermore, Akt expression regulates Mdm2 expression, which may in turn regulate the function of wild-type p53. These results may provide the basis for future preventative or clinical therapies for esophageal cancer.
