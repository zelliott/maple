The application of nanostructured luminescent silicon nitride (SiN(X)) thin films for label-free cell imaging is reported for the first time. Different strong local fields ensured by various molecules concentrated in various cell compartments can lead to the creation of preferential electronic conditions for radiative recombination of photogenerated charge carriers via a given electronic channel. Thus, highly contrasted multicolor luminescent cell imaging under one photon excitation becomes possible. The described label-free bio-imaging approach has good compatibility with fluorescence optical microscopy, and allows rapid and efficient cell imaging and cell line recognition.
