Analogs of the anti-tumor agent camptothecin with both closed E-rings (lactone and ether) and open E-rings (reduced acid, hydrazide, and protected Weinreb amide) have been prepared and tested in topoisomerase and cellular assays. The results provide insights into the structural features of the camptothecin E-ring that affect biological activity.
