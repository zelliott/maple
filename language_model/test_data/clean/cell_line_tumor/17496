To study the effect of staurosporine (ST) on the cell cycle of human gastric cancer cell lines MGC803 and SGC7901.

Cell proliferation was evaluated by trypan blue dye exclusion method. Apoptotic morphology was observed under a transmission electron microscope. Changes of cell cycle and apoptotic peaks of cells were determined by flow cytometry. Expression of p21WAF1 gene was examined using immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR.

The growth of MGC803 and SGC7901 cells was inhibited by ST. The inhibitory concentrations against 50% cells (IC50) at 24 h and 48 h were 54 ng/ml and 23 ng/ml for MGC803, and 61 ng/ml and 37 ng/ml for SGC7901. Typical apoptotic bodies and apoptotic peaks were observed 24 h after cells were treated with ST at a concentration of 200 ng/ml. The percentage of cells at G0/G1 phase was decreased and that of cells at G2/M was increased significantly in the group treated with ST at the concentrations of 40 ng/ml, 60 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml for 24 h, compared with the control group ( p<0.01). The expression levels of p21WAF1 gene in both MGC803 and SGC7901 cells were markedly up-regulated after treatment with ST.

ST can cause arrest of gastric cancer cells at G2/M phase, which may be one of the mechanisms that inhibit cell proliferation and cause apoptosis in these cells. Effect of ST on cells at G2/M phase may be attributed to the up-regulation of p21WAF1 gene.
