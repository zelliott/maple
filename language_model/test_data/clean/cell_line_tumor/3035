Macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1) belongs to the bone morphogenic protein/transforming growth factor-beta (BMP/TGF-beta) superfamily. Serum MIC-1 concentrations are elevated in patients with advanced prostate cancer. The effects of MIC-1 on prostate cancer bone metastases are unknown.

In vitro effects of MIC-1 on osteoblast differentiation and activity were analyzed with alkaline phosphatase and mineralization assays; osteoclast numbers were counted microscopically. MIC-1 effects on TLR9 expression were studied with Western blotting. Human Du-145 prostate cancer cells were stably transfected with a cDNA encoding for mature MIC-1 or with an empty vector. The in vivo growth characteristics of the characterized cells were studied with the intra-tibial model of bone metastasis. Tumor associated bone changes were viewed with X-rays, histology, and histomorphometry. Bone formation was assayed by measuring serum PINP.

MIC-1 induced osteoblast differentiation and activity and osteoclast formation in vitro. These effects were independent of TLR9 expression, which was promoted by MIC-1. Both MIC-1 and control tumors induced mixed sclerotic/lytic bone lesions, but MIC-1 increased the osteolytic component of tumors. Osteoclast formation at the tumor-bone interface was significantly higher in the MIC-1 tumors, whereas bone formation was significantly higher in the control mice. At sacrifice, the mice bearing MIC-1 tumors were significantly lighter with significantly smaller tumors.

MIC-1 up-regulates TLR9 expression in various cells. MIC-1 stimulates both osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation in vitro, independently of TLR9. MIC-1 over-expressing prostate cancer cells that grow in bone induce osteoclast formation and cachexia.
