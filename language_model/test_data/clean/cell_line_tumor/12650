Three novel 2-oxo-quinoline-3-carbaldehyde Schiff-bases and their Cu(II) complexes were synthesized. The molecular structures of Cu(II) complexes were determined by X-ray crystal diffraction. The DNA-binding modes of the complexes were also investigated by UV-vis absorption spectrum, fluorescence spectrum, viscosity measurement and EB-DNA displacement experiment. The experimental evidences indicated that the ligands and Cu(II) complexes could interact with CT-DNA (calf-thymus DNA) through intercalation, respectively. Comparative cytotoxic activities of ligands and Cu(II) complexes were also determined by MTT [3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazoyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide] and SRB (sulforhodamine B) methods. The results showed that the three Cu(II) complexes exhibited more effective cytotoxic activity against HL60 cells and HeLa cells than corresponding ligands. Also, CuL(3) showed higher cytotoxic activity than CuL(1) and CuL(2).
