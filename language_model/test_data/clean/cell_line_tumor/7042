To investigate the activation of chlorogenic acid (CHA) purified from Flos Lonicerae to calcineurin and its effects on macrophage functions in vivo and in vitro.

According to the screening results that Flos Lonicerae could activate calcineurin, the active component which could activate calcineurin was purified from Flos Lonicerae by column chromatography on silica gel and identified as CHA. The activation of CHA on calcineurin had been validated with both p-NPP and 32P-labeled RII peptide as the substrates. The clearance of charcoal particles in normal mice and the cytotoxicity of U937 to MCF-7 were used together to determine the effects of CHA on macrophage functions.

CHA could activate calcineurin, and the concentration of CHA on maximal activating calcineurin was 282.5 micromol/L. CHA administration (10 mg/kg, ig, 7 d) significantly enhanced the macrophage functions in normal mice. CHA (70.6, 141.2, and 282.5 micromol/L) obviously increased the cytotoxicity of U937 to MCF-7.

CHA could activate calcineurin and enhance the macrophage functions in vivo and in vitro, and its functions in vivo may be realized via the signal pathways of calcineurin.
