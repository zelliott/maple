Alternative splicing configurations and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) gene expression are both modified in neurons under stress. However, it is unclear if these phenomena are functionally interrelated. Using a home-made spotted microarray focused on splicing-associated transcripts, we tested the effects of excess 3' splice variants of human AChE on splicing-related gene expression in semi-differentiated neuronal P19 cells. Of the tested transcripts, 17.3% and 20.2% showed modified expression levels (log2 of the ratio<-0.3 or>0.3) in transfected P19 cells overexpressing the stress-inducible AChE-R variant or the synaptic AChE-S protein, respectively. Multiple transcripts encoding serine-arginine rich (SR) and SR-related splicing regulators were suppressed in cells expressing either of these variants, whereas the gene groups including splicing-related helicases and transcripts involved in apoptosis displayed variant-specific changes. Our findings are compatible with the assumption that both neuronal overexpression and alternative splicing of pre-AChE mRNA may be causally involved in initiating global changes in neuronal alternative splicing, causing subsequent modifications in the expression patterns of numerous target genes.
