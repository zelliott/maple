Metastatic breast cancer is a deadly disease which requires new therapeutic strategies. Endogenous TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) functions as a metastasis suppressor by activating proapoptotic TRAIL receptors (TRAIL-R1/DR4 and/or TRAIL-R2/DR5) in transformed cells, making it an attractive pathway for antimetastatic therapies. However, it is unclear whether TRAIL-R1 or TRAIL-R2 is a better therapeutic target in metastatic breast cancer.

Several metastatic, triple (estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2)-negative cancer cell lines were treated with human agonistic monoclonal antibodies targeting TRAIL-R1 (mapatumumab) or TRAIL-R2 (lexatumumab). The effects on cell viability, apoptosis, and caspase-8 activation were determined. An orthotopic model of triple-negative breast cancer in which fluorescently labeled breast cancer cells metastasize from the mammary gland to lymph nodes and lung was utilized to evaluate the effects of mapatumumab, lexatumumab, or doxorubicin on primary and metastatic tumor burden in vivo.

Lexatumumab was more effective than mapatumumab in activating caspase-8, inducing apoptosis and inhibiting long-term survival of metastatic cancer cells, which expressed both TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2. Human mammary epithelial cells transformed by oncogenic Ras were more sensitive to lexatumumab than nontransformed cells. Lexatumumab inhibited lymph node and lung metastases more robustly than mapatumumab in an orthotopic model of triple-negative breast cancer; both agents inhibited mammary tumor growth. In addition, lexatumumab was more effective than doxorubicin at suppressing metastases at doses of doxorubicin that were associated with toxicity, even though doxorubicin reduced primary tumor burden more robustly than lexatumumab.

Targeting TRAIL-R2 receptor may be an effective therapeutic strategy for metastatic breast cancer.
