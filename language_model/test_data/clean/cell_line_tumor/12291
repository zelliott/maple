CD8+ T cells recognize antigenic peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on normal antigen-presenting cells (APC), as well as on virus-infected cells or tumour cells (pMHC). At least two receptor types participate in recognition of these complexes: T-cell receptor (TCR) alphabeta heterodimers and CD8alphabeta molecules. The former molecules react with antigenic peptide and variable regions of MHC class I molecules, whereas the latter molecules react with constant alpha3 regions of MHC class I molecules. As the avidity of both receptor-MHC interactions is low, it is believed that TCRalphabeta and CD8alphabeta heterodimers collaborate in T-cell recognition. We have established a TCR/CD3-CD8 capture ELISA, which can measure the interaction of pMHC with CD8alphabeta molecules and with TCR/CD3 complexes. The major findings are: (1) TCR/CD3 complexes derived from in vitro activated T cells and captured by anti-CD3 MoAb, do bind specific pMHC and (2) CD8+ T cells express at least three forms of CD8alphabeta molecules: single CD8alphabeta, CD3-CD8 and TCR/CD3-CD8 complexes. Only the latter complexes are associated with CD3zeta homodimers, and the quantity of TCR/CD3-CD8 complexes relative to total CD8alphabeta molecules appears to increase and to be selected into sucrose-gradient microdomains as a function of TCRalphabeta-mediated T-cell activation.
