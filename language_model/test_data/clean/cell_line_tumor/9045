Bacteria and cancer cells develop resistance to more than one agent as a consequence of being exposed to ineffective levels of the agent for a prolonged period of time. The resistance of these cells is mediated by over-expressed efflux pumps that have the ability to extrude a large variety of unrelated chemicals. This review discusses the main types of multidrug resistant (MDR) efflux systems of bacteria and cancer cells, and shows the similarity of specific efflux systems between them with respect to given agents that inhibit efflux, thus rendering these cells once more susceptible to agents to which they had developed MDR.
