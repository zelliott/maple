Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most incident malignancies worldwide. Although efficient therapy is available for early-stage PCa, treatment of advanced disease is mainly ineffective and remains a clinical challenge. microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation is associated with PCa development and progression. In fact, several studies have reported a widespread downregulation of miRNAs in PCa, which highlights the importance of studying compounds capable of restoring the global miRNA expression. The main aim of this study was to define the usefulness of enoxacin as an anti-tumoral agent in PCa, due to its ability to induce miRNA biogenesis in a TRBP-mediated manner. Using a panel of five PCa cell lines, we observed that all of them were wild type for the TARBP2 gene and expressed TRBP protein. Furthermore, primary prostate carcinomas displayed normal levels of TRBP protein. Remarkably, enoxacin was able to decrease cell viability, induce apoptosis, cause cell cycle arrest, and inhibit the invasiveness of cell lines. Enoxacin was also effective in restoring the global expression of miRNAs. This study is the first to show that PCa cells are highly responsive to the anti-tumoral effects of enoxacin. Therefore, enoxacin constitutes a promising therapeutic agent for PCa.
