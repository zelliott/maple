The CD146 cell membrane adhesion molecule is highly expressed on the cell surface of several tumours. The level of its expression has been found to correlate directly with tumour progression and metastatic potential, thus establishing CD146 as an important candidate of tumour growth and metastasis. In order to characterize its expression in human osteosarcoma (OS) cell lines, we have examined the CD146 expression at protein and RNA levels in both normal and tumour osteoblast-like cell lines by several methods. Our results indicate that CD146 protein is expressed at low levels in normal osteoblast cells whereas it is highly expressed in all OS cell lines analysed, (SaOS, MG-63, U-2OS). Moreover, CD146 overexpression was partially reduced in shYY1 cells, where the Yin Yang 1 transcription factor, also found over-expressed in human OS cells, has been silenced.
