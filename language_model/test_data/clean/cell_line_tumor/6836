The essential regulators in the pathogenesis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) are still largely unknown. The malignant Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells of cHL secrete various cytokines leading to the activation of signaling pathways such as the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway. In this study, we investigate the role of distinct JAK/STAT pathway components in the regulation of proliferation and survival of cHL cell lines. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and western blot analysis revealed that the activation status of STAT family members varies in different cHL cell lines. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors of the JAK/STAT pathway blocked the activation of most of the STAT family members. This was accompanied with a strong antiproliferative effect and enhanced death of the treated cHL cell lines. Specific downregulation of STAT3 by siRNA expression decreased cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. Overexpression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 resulted in a proliferation arrest of cells with limited endogenous amount of these negative regulators, but not in cells that already express high amounts of SOCS1 and SOCS3. Our findings highlight the importance of STAT3 in cHL transformation and suggest SOCS1 and SOCS3 as potential targets for therapeutic intervention in distinct forms of cHL.
