Three new depsidones ( 1, 3, and  4), a new diaryl ether ( 5), and a new natural pyrone ( 9) (synthetically known), together with three known depsidones, nidulin ( 6), nornidulin ( 7), and 2-chlorounguinol ( 8), were isolated from the marine-derived fungus  ASPERGILLUS UNGUIS CRI282-03. Aspergillusidone C ( 4) showed the most potent aromatase inhibitory activity with the IC (50) value of 0.74 µM, while depsidones  1, 3, 6- 8 inhibited aromatase with IC (50) values of 1.2-11.2 µM. It was found that the structural feature of depsidones, not their corresponding diaryl ether derivatives (e.g.  5), was important for aromatase inhibitory activity. Aspergillusidones A ( 1) and B ( 3) showed radical scavenging activity in the XXO assay with IC (50) values of 16.0 and < 15.6 µM, respectively. Compounds  1 and  3- 7 were mostly inactive or showed only weak cytotoxic activity against HuCCA-1, HepG2, A549, and MOLT-3 cancer cell lines.
