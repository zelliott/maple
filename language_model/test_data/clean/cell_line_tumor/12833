Calcium flux through L-type voltage-activated calcium (Cav1) channels is crucial for regulating brain functions including memory formation and behavior. Alterations in Ca²+ homeostasis have been linked to many cognitive disorders, and understanding the regulation of this process is crucial for their remedy. Therefore, here, we have evaluated the effect of a multifunctional protein known to be involved in memory functions called regulator of G-protein signaling 14 (RGS-14) on Cav1 channel activity in neuronal cell lines NG108-15 and SH-SY5Y. RGS-14 protein produced significant reduction in Ca²+ influx in both cell lines and this effect was dependent on nifedipine-sensitive Cav1 channels. Thus, our results provide evidence supporting the idea that RGS-14 may facilitate the cognitive processing by modulating Cav1 channel-mediated intracellular Ca²+ transients.
