Two dinuclear platinum(IV) prodrugs were prepared from cisplatin and oxaliplatin, and tethered to amphiphilic biodegradable block copolymers. The polymeric dinuclear platinum(IV) prodrugs were allowed to self-assemble into nanomicelles, which showed reduced systemic toxicity, relatively long blood circulation, and enhanced antitumor efficacy. In this way, the bottleneck of present multinuclear platinum drugs, especially their severe systemic toxicity, might be overcome.
