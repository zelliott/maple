The novel aroylthiourea analogue of podophyllotoxin HY-1 (4Î²-[benzoyl-thioureido]-4-deoxypodophyllotoxin) was synthesized in our laboratory with the aim of developing multitargeted DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors. The compound showed significant antiproliferative effects on seven cancer cell lines and induced G2 /M phase arrest in HCT116 cells. Moreover, HY-1 showed a potent inhibitory effect on topoisomerase II-mediated kinetoplast DNA decatenation in a dose-dependent manner. Our results showed that cdc2 phosphorylation and decreased cdc2 kinase acitivity through the ATR-Chk1-Cdc25C and Weel pathways were the central mechanisms for G2 /M phase arrest in human colon cancer cells.
