Gliomas are a group of heterogeneous primary central nervous system tumors. Hyperthermia has proven to be a potential therapeutic tool for cancers in the clinic. However, the molecular mechanisms of hyperthermia remain unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of hyperthermia on the invasiveness in C6 glioma cells and related molecular pathways. Here our data show hyperthermia stimulated the release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and decreased C6 glioma cell migration and invasive capability at 30, 60, 120 and 180 min; with increased spontaneous apoptosis in C6 glioma cells at 120 min. We also found mitogen-activated protein kinase (P38 MAPK) protein expression to be increased and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) protein expression decreased. Based on the results, we conclude that hyperthermia alone reduced invasion of C6 glioma cells through stimulating TNF-α signaling to activate apoptosis, enhancing P38 MAPK expression and inhibiting the NF-κB pathway, a first report in C6 rat glioma cells.
