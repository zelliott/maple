Psoriasin, also known as S100A7 and first identified as a protein highly expressed in psoriatic lesions, is a calcium binding protein that has been indicated in various malignancies. The current study aimed to examine the implication of psoriasin in prostate cancer (CaP), particularly its impact on functions of CaP cells.

Expression of psoriasin was examined in a variety of prostatic cell lines and human CaP tissues using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Knockdown and overexpression of psoriasin in CaP cells was performed using specifically constructed plasmids, which either had an anti-psoriasin ribozyme transgene or the full-length human S100A7 coding sequence. The effects of manipulating psoriasin expression on cellular functions of CaP cells were assessed using in vitro assays.

Psoriasin was expressed in prostate epithelia and cancer cells. Elevated expression of psoriasin was evident in CaP from its IHC staining in CaP frozen specimens. Psoriasin promoted cell survival under serum starvation. Its expression was inversely correlated with cell-matrix adhesion. Psoriasin increased invasiveness of PC-3 cells via a regulation of matrix metalproteinases (MMPs).

Aberrant expression of psoriasin is implicated in CaP. Its expression in CaP cells is associated with cell survival, adhesion, and in vitro invasion, which is via the regulation of MMPs.
