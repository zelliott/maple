Diiodo-, dibromo- and dichloro-platinum(II) complexes containing L-histidine ligand were prepared. Their spectra and X-ray crystal structure of the dibromo-platinum(II) complex were described. Only the dichloro-platinum(II) complex showed comparable cytotoxic activity with carboplatin against A549/ATCC, HT-29, and LNcap cell lines. Nevertheless the complexes with COOH-substituted ligands histidine may be good starting materials to synthesize targeting platinum complexes since they could be easily linked to suitable carrier molecules via esterification.
