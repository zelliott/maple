Conjugates of organometallic osmium carbonyl clusters and gold nanoparticles show a strong carbonyl signal in surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. The ease of bio-functionalization and the high stability and good dispersibility in aqueous solution make these conjugates excellent candidates for biomedical applications, as demonstrated by live-cell imaging with the carbonyl signals of OM-NP(PEG)-L conjugates.
