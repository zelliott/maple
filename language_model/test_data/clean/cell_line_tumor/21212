PEG10 is an imprinted gene which is up-regulated in hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC). However, the mechanism of PEG10 regulation remains to be elucidated. In this work the transcription factors E2F-1 and -4 were demonstrated to bind directly to the promoter of PEG10 and thereby regulate its expression. The expression profile of HCC tissues also suggested E2Fs were involved in PEG10 regulation. Further functional analysis showed that PEG10 was involved in the repression of apoptosis induced by serum deprivation and chemotherapeutic drugs. These findings link cancer genetics and epigenetics by showing that E2F acts directly upstream of an anti-apoptosis imprinted gene, PEG10.
