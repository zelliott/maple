The relationship between the structures of glycans on the surface of H7721 cells, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, and the cell behaviors was studied by using neuraminidase and alpha-L-fucosidase to remove the terminal sialyl or fucosyl residues of surface glycans respectively. The cell adhesion to fibronectin (Fn), laminin (Ln) and human umbilical vein epithelial cell (HUVEC), as well as cell chemotactic migration and invasion were selected as the parameters of the cell behaviors. It was found that sialyl residue was not essential for the cell adhesion to Fn, but was important in the cell adhesion to Ln and chemotactic cell invasion, and very crucial in the cell adhesion to HUVEC and chemotactic migration. In contrast, fucosyl residue was probably participate in cell adhesion to Fn, Ln and HUVEC, but not important in chemotactic migration and invasion. The cell adhesion to HUVEC, chemotactic migration and invasion were inhibited by the monoclonal antibody of sialyl Lewis X (SLex), but not by the antibody of non-sialyl Lewis X (Lex). This result supports the finding that sialyl residue is more important than fucosyl residue in the contribution to the above-mentioned three cell processes.
