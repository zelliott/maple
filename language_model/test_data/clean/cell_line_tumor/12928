A series of novel purine and pyrimidine derivatives were prepared and biologically evaluated for their in vitro anti-CDK2/cyclin A3 and antitumor activities in Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cell based assay. The novel purine derivatives 13a,b demonstrated potent inhibitor activities with IC(50) values of 14±9 and 13±9 μM, respectively. Additionally, compound 15a showed the highest potency (IC(50)=10±6 μM) in EAC cell based assay. Molecular modeling study, including fitting to a 3D-pharmacophore model and their docking into cyclin dependant kinase2 (CDK2) active site showed high fit values and docking scores.
