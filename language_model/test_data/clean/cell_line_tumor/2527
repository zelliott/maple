ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10) has been demonstrated to act as the main physiological α-secretase. Enzymatic activity of the α-secretase on the one hand prevents the formation of toxic Aβ peptides and on the other hand promotes the secretion of a neurotrophic and neuroprotective amyloid precursor protein fragment (APPs-α) by cleaving the amyloid precursor protein within its Aβ sequence. Enhancement of ADAM10's gene expression may therefore present a valuable therapeutic approach for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), where Aβ peptides are severely involved in the pathogenesis.

In cell culture and in a transgenic mouse model of AD, retinoids led to increased ADAM10 expression and activity. We therefore endeavor to develop a clinical application of synthetic retinoids such as acitretin in AD.

The effect of synthetic retinoids on ADAM10 gene expression was analyzed by reporter gene assays in human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. Penetrance of acitretin into the murine brain was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) double-knockout mice with a deficiency in both isoforms, mdr1a and 1b, were used to analyze a possible role of P-gp-dependent efflux on acitretin distribution.

Acitretin and tamibarotene are both potent activators of ADAM10 promoter activity. Acitretin crosses the murine blood-brain barrier and its level in the mouse brain is not reduced by P-gp.

Synthetic retinoids and especially acitretin seem to be ideal candidates to establish an ADAM10-based AD treatment, and therefore have already entered first clinical trials.
