Efficient in vitro systems to study the life cycle of hepatitis C virus (HCV) were recently developed for JFH1 (genotype 2a), which has unique replication capacity in Huh7 cells. We developed 4a/JFH1 intergenotypic recombinants containing the structural genes (Core, E1, and E2), p7, and all or part of NS2 of the 4a prototype strain ED43 that, after transfection of Huh7.5 cells with RNA transcripts, produced infectious viruses. Compared with the J6/JFH control virus, production of viruses was delayed. However, efficient spread of infection and high HCV RNA and infectivity titers were obtained in serial passages. Sequence analysis of recovered viruses and subsequent reverse genetic studies revealed a vital dependence on one or two NS2 mutations, depending on the 4a/2a junction. Infectivity of ED43/JFH1 viruses was CD81 dependent. The genotype 4 cell culture systems permit functional analyses as well as drug and vaccine research on an increasingly important genotype in the Middle East, Africa, and Europe. We also developed genotype 1a intergenotypic recombinants from H77C with vital mutations in NS3. Using H77C/JFH1 and ED43/JFH1 viruses, we demonstrated high homologous neutralizing antibody titers in 1a and 4a patient sera, respectively. Furthermore, availability of JFH1 viruses with envelope proteins of the six major HCV genotypes permitted cross-neutralization studies; 1a and 4a serum cross-neutralized 1a, 4a, 5a, and 6a but not 2a and 3a viruses. Thus, the JFH1 intergenotypic recombinants will be of importance for future studies of HCV neutralization and accelerate the development of passive and active immunoprophylaxis.
