Multilayered, core/shell nanoprobes (MQQ-probe) based on magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and quantum dots (QDs) have been successfully developed for multimodality tumor imaging. This MQQ-probe contains Fe(3)O(4) MNPs, visible-fluorescent QDs (600 nm emission) and near infrared-fluorescent QDs (780 nm emission) in multiple silica layers. The fabrication of the MQQ-probe involves the synthesis of a primer Fe(3)O(4) MNPs/SiO(2) core by a reverse microemulsion method. The MQQ-probe can be used both as a fluorescent probe and a contrast reagent of magnetic resonance imaging. For breast cancer tumor imaging, anti-HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) antibody was conjugated to the surface of the MQQ-probe. The specific binding of the antibody conjugated MQQ-probe to the surface of human breast cancer cells (KPL-4) was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis in vitro. Due to the high tissue permeability of near-infrared (NIR) light, NIR fluorescence imaging of the tumor mice (KPL-4 cells transplanted) was conducted by using the anti-HER2 antibody conjugated MQQ-probe. In vivo multimodality images of breast tumors were successfully taken by NIR fluorescence and T(2)-weighted magnetic resonance. Antibody conjugated MQQ-probes have great potential to use for multimodality imaging of cancer tumors in vitro and in vivo.
