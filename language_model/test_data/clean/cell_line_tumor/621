A series of 2,4-disubstituted 6-aryl-7H-pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidin-7-one 5-oxides were synthesized and in vitro antiproliferative activities were examined in the human solid tumor cell lines A2780, HBL-100, HeLa, SW1573, T-47D, and WiDr. The most potent analog induced considerably growth inhibition in the range 0.35-2.0microM. Cell cycle studies in the breast and lung cancer cells revealed arrest in the G(2)/M compartment. The results showed that the title compounds bearing alkylamino or dialkylamino moieties in position 2 of the pyrimidine ring are more active than those bearing hydrogen or methylthio groups.
