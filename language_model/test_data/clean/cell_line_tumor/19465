Gelatinase A (matrix metalloproteinase-2, MMP-2) binds to several proteins through its collagen-binding domains (CBDs). Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed a strong interaction between CBD123 and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), with a K(D) value of 2x10(-9) M. CBD123, as well as individual domains, behave as competitive inhibitors of the TSP-1-directed endocytic clearance of active MMP-2, but not of its latent form, by HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells. Enhanced level of active MMP-2 in conditioned medium was associated to increased matrigel invasion. Similarly, GGWSHWSPWSS and GGWSHW peptides, as tryptophan-rich peptides within properdin-repeat motifs (TSRs) of TSP-1, promoted MMP-2 accumulation and cell invasiveness. Our data document the importance of TSP-1 in promoting MMP-2-mediated cancer cell invasion through interaction between CBDs of the enzyme and TSRs motifs of TSP-1.
