Osteosarcomas are primary malignant tumors of bone or soft parts arising from bone-forming mesenchymal cells. Despite dramatic therapeutic advances, namely neo-adjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy, progress is at a plateau. Cytokine-mediated gene therapy might represent a further advance in the therapy of the osteosarcoma.

We transfected UMR 108 osteosarcoma cells with different plasmids encoding IL-12, IL-23, proIL-18 and ICE (Interleukin-converting enzyme). IFN-gamma induction, which is known to induce antitumor effects mediated by the immune system, and cytotoxic effects of various cytokine combination were investigated.

Our results show that local secretion of IL-12 by UMR 108 cells led to an induction of cytotoxic effects mediated by mononuclear cells, which were enhanced by additional administration of recombinant IL-18. In contrast to IL-18, IL-23 showed a moderate increase of IFN-gamma induction when transfected alone and could only slightly increase the IFN-gamma induction mediated by IL-12. IL-18 enhanced IFN-gamma induction when applied alone and was able to increase the IFN-gamma production that was induced by IL-12.

IL-23 seems to be a less effective immuno-therapeutic for adjuvant treatment of osteosarcomas than IL-12 and IL-18, when taking only IFN-gamma induction into consideration.
