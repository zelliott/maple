The therapeutic value of donor lymphocyte infusions in patients who relapse with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is limited by a low efficacy and the risk of graft-versus-host disease. We aimed at generating leukemia-reactive donor T cells for patients with AML.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the donor were stimulated with mature donor dendritic cells, pulsed with irradiated patient leukemic blasts (LB), or directly with cytokine-treated LB. After 3 weekly stimulations, donor cells were tested for anti-leukemic reactivity in an IFNgamma Elispot.

In 5 of 6 donors, cells with reactivity against patient LB with low or absent reactivity against non-leukemic cells could be generated. T cell subset analyses in 2 donors indicated that specific anti-leukemic reactivity was mainly mediated by CD4+ T cells, which were also the predominant cell fraction in 4 of 6 donors. One leukemia-reactive donor T cell line was expanded with a recently developed system. One week of expansion resulted in a 10-fold increase in reactivity with sustained specificity of the resulting T cell line.

Our results show the feasibility of the in vitro generation of leukemia-reactive donor lymphocytes, rendering this method a promising tool for post-HSCT immunotherapy.
