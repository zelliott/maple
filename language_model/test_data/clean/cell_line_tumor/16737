To aim of this was to observe emodin-mediated cytotoxicity and its influence on Rad51 and ERCC1 expressionin non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC cells were cultured in vitro with emodin at various concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 μmol/L) for 48 h and the proliferation inhibition rate was determined by the MTT method. Then, NSCLC were treated with emodin (SK-MES-1 40 μmol/L, A549 70 μmol/L) or 20 μmol/L U0126 (an ERK inhibitor) for 48 h, or with various concentrations of emodin for 48 h and the protein and mRNA expressions of ERCC1 and Rad51 were determined by RT-PCR and Western blot assay, respectively. Emodin exerted a suppressive effect on the proliferation of NSCLC in a concentration dependent manner. Protein and mRNA expression of ERCC1 and Rad51 was also significantly decreased with the dose. Vacuolar degeneration was observed in A549 and SK-MES-1 cell lines after emodin treatment by transmission electron microscopy. Emodin may thus inhibited cell proliferation in NSCLC cells by downregulation ERCC1 and Rad51.
