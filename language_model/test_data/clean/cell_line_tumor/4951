Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1) is the etiological agent of adult T-cell leukemia. The viral transforming protein Tax regulates the transcription of viral and cellular genes by interacting with cellular transcription factors and coactivators. The effects of Tax on cellular gene expression have an important impact on HTLV-1-mediated cellular transformation. Expression of the c-fos cellular oncogene is regulated by serum response factor (SRF), and Tax is known to induce c-fos gene expression by activating SRF-responsive transcription. SRF activates cellular gene expression by binding to a consensus DNA sequence (CArG box) located within a serum response element (SRE). Since SRF activates transcription of many growth regulatory genes, this pathway is likely to have a significant impact on Tax-mediated transformation. Here we demonstrate that Tax interacts with SRF and enhances the binding of SRF to SREs located in the c-fos, Nur77, and viral promoters. Also, we establish that in the presence of Tax, SRF selects more divergent CArG box sequences than in the absence of Tax, revealing a novel mechanism for regulating SRF-responsive gene expression. Finally, increased association of SRF with chromatin and specific promoters was observed in Tax-expressing cells, correlating with increased c-fos and Nur77 mRNA levels in Tax-expressing cells. These results suggest that Tax activates SRF-responsive transcription by enhancing its binding affinity to multiple different SRE sequences.
