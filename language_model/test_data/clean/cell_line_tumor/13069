Aryl-guanidino polyamine conjugates were prepared to evaluate their recognition for polyamine transporter (PAT) via a-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) and spermidine (SPD)-treated B16 cell lines. The potent synergistic effects of DFMO on guanidino polyamine conjugates indicated that the presence of DFMO strongly facilitates the transport of conjugates into cells via PAT on cell membrane. The apoptotic mechanisms of triamine conjugates 10 and 1 (with and without guanidine groups) revealed that they induced apoptosis of Hela cells through the mitochondrial pathway associated with lysosomes, while DFMO strongly synergizes the function of 10 without changing the apoptotic route. Taken together, guanidino polyamine conjugates can target PAT for transport as normal polyamine ones, and the presence of guanidine in the polyamine vectors does not seem to alter the cellular targets of the conjugates, which may depend mainly on the pharmacophore.
