The small hepatitis B virus surface antigen (S-HBsAg) is capable of driving the assembly and secretion of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) particles by interacting with the HDV ribonucleoprotein (RNP). Previously, a specific domain of the S-HBsAg protein carboxyl terminus, including a tryptophan residue at position 196 (W196), was proven essential for HDV maturation (S. Jenna and C. Sureau, J. Virol. 73: 3351-3358, 1999). Mutation of W196 to phenylalanine (W196F) was permissive for HBV subviral particle (SVP) secretion but deleterious to HDV virion assembly. Here, the W196F S-HBsAg deficiency was assigned to a loss of its ability for interaction with the large HDV antigen (L-HDAg), a major component of the RNP. Because the overall S-HBsAg carboxyl terminus is particularly rich in tryptophan, an amino acid frequently involved in protein-protein interactions, site-directed mutagenesis was conducted to investigate the function of the S-HBsAg Trp-rich domain in HDV assembly. Single substitutions of tryptophan between positions 163 and 201 with alanine or phenylalanine were tolerated for SVP secretion, but those affecting W196, W199, and W201 were detrimental for HDV assembly. This was proven to result from a reduced capacity of the mutants for interaction with L-HDAg. In addition, a W196S S-HBsAg mutant, which has been described in HBV strains that arose in a few cases of lamivudine-treated HBV-infected patients, was deficient for HDV assembly as a consequence of its impaired capacity for interacting with L-HDAg. Interestingly, the fact that even the most conservative substitution of phenylalanine for tryptophan at positions 196, 199, or 201 was sufficient to ablate interaction of S-HBsAg with L-HDAg suggests that W196, W199, and W201 are located at a binding interface that is central to HDV maturation.
