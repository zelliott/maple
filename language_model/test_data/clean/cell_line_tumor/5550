Poly(beta-benzyl-L-aspartate)-block-poly(vinylpyrrolidone) diblock copolymers (PAsp(OBzl)-b-PVP) having both hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments of various lengths were synthesized by a combination of ATRP and ROP. These amphiphilic diblock copolymers formed polymeric micelles consisting of a hydrophobic PAsp(OBzl) core and a hydrophilic PVP shell in aqueous solution. The block copolymer was characterized using (1)H NMR and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis. Due to its core-shell structure, this block polymer forms unimolecular micelles in aqueous solutions. The micelle properties of PAsp(OBzl)-b-PVP diblock copolymer were extensively studied by dynamic light scattering (DLS), fluorescence spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). PAsp(OBzl)-b-PVP copolymers displayed the lowest CMC and demonstrated little cytotoxicity when exposed to SW-1990 pancreatic cancer cells. In order to assess its application in biomedical area, the anti-inflammation drug prednisone acetate was loaded as the model drug in the polymeric nanoparticles. In vitro release behavior of prednisone acetate was investigated, which showed a dramatic responsive fast/slow switching behavior according to the pH-responsive structural changes of a micelle core structure. All of theses features are quite feasible for utilizing it as a novel intelligent drug-delivery system.
