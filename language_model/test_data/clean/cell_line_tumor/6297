Five licofelone ([2,2-dimethyl-6-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolizin-5-yl]acetic acid) nitric oxide donor conjugates were developed by a parallel synthesis approach. The biological screening revealed that compounds with a propyl (6b), butyl (6c), or octyl (6d) chain between licofelone and the nitric oxide donor exhibited high antiproliferative potency at MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer as well as at HT-29 colon cancer cells. Moreover, 6b-d possessed at least 2-fold higher cytotoxicity at MDA-MB-231 cells than the parent compound licofelone although they showed less inhibitory activity at COX-1 and COX-2. A correlation between COX inhibition and growth inhibitory properties is not visible. However, the high levels of nitric oxide production of the compounds may result in their high cytotoxic activity.
