To study the antitumor effects of photodynamic therapy (PDT) treated by ovarian cancer cell lysates in rat epithelial ovarian cancer in vivo.

Female Fischer344 rats of 6 - 8 weeks were allocated to four groups (n = 8 each): PDT group (inoculated intraperitoneal with PDT tumor cell lysates), freeze/thaw group (inoculated intraperitonealy with freeze-thaw tumor cell lysates), normal saline group (inoculated intraperitoneal with normal saline) and control group. Rat epithelial ovarian cancer NuTu19 cells were injected into all rats by intraperitoneal at day 7, while injected with normal saline in control group. The number of tumor specific interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) secreting splenocytes was quantified by enzyme linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay, the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity of splenocytes was measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) analysis and tumor growth and the survival time of rats were also observed.

Stimulated by PDT tumor cell lysates, the number of tumor specific IFN-gamma secreting splenocytes in PDT group, freeze/thaw group, normal saline group and control group were 448.8 +/- 34.2, 211.2 +/- 47.9, 43.3 +/- 11.1, 16.1 +/- 2.4 respectively, which were significant differences among of them (P < 0.05). Stimulated by freeze/thaw tumor cell lysates, the number of tumor specific IFN-gamma secreting splenocytes in four groups were 151.7 +/- 22.6, 188.7 +/- 53.0, 18.2 +/- 12.2, 8.8 +/- 7.7 respectively, which were not significant differences among of them (P > 0.05). Cytotoxicity of splenocytes of PDT group increased significantly than that in other three groups (P < 0.05). Except rats in control group were all alive until the experiment ended, the mean survival time of other rats were 234 d in PDT group, 171 d in freeze/thaw group and 168 d in normal saline group, which in PDT group was significantly higher than those in freeze/thaw group and normal saline group (P < 0.05).

Rats treated by PDT tumor cell lysates could produce antitumor effects in vivo, which shown that induce tumor-specific immune response and prolong the life span.
