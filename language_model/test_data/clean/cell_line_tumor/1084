Cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cis-DDP) is one of the most successful antineoplastic drugs. However, besides effectiveness it gives many side effects. Therefore, current studies are concentrated on searching for new analogs equally effective in chemotherapy but less toxic. Comparison of genotoxic properties of cis-Pt(II) complex of 3-aminoflavone and cis-DDP in a comet assay with and without H2O2 application was performed in A549 cell line. The higher tail moment values were noticed for the former compound contrary to the latter one in both variants. It suggests mainly DNA breaks (besides cross-links) appearance after cis-Pt(II) complex of 3-aminoflavone application and might indicate DNA degradation in comparison with cis-DDP.
