The Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activates various signaling pathways including nuclear factor kappaB that mediate proliferation, transformation, and apoptosis resistance in Bcr-Abl(+) myeloid leukemia cells. Here we report that protein kinase (PK) D2, a serine threonine kinase of the PKD family, is a novel substrate of Bcr-Abl. PKD2 was found to be the major isoform of the PKD family expressed in chronic myeloid leukemia cells and is tyrosine phosphorylated by Bcr-Abl in its pleckstrin homology domain. A mutant that mimicks tyrosine phosphorylation of PKD2 in the pleckstrin homology domain activates nuclear factor kappaB independently of its catalytic activity. Furthermore, our data show that Bcr-Abl-induced activation of the nuclear factor kappaB cascade in LAMA84 cells is largely mediated by tyrosine-phosphorylated PKD2. These data present a novel mechanism of Bcr-Abl-induced nuclear factor kappaB activation in myeloid leukemia. Targeting PKD2 tyrosine phosphorylation, not its kinase activity, could be a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of Bcr-Abl(+) myeloid leukemia.
