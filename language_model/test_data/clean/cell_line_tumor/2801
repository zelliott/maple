A water-soluble polysaccharide, isolated from fruiting bodies of Lagenaria siceraria, is composed of methyl-alpha-d-galacturonate, 3-O-acetyl methyl-alpha-d-galacturonate, and beta-d-galactose in a ratio of nearly 1:1:1. Compositional analysis, methylation analysis, periodate oxidation, and NMR studies ((1)H, (13)C, 2D-COSY, TOCSY, NOESY, HMQC, and HMBC) revealed the presence of the following repeating unit in the polysaccharide: [carbohydrate structure: see text] This polysaccharide showed cytotoxic activity in vitro against human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7).
