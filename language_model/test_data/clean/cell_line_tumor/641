Rebaudioside A (Reb A) is a steviol glycoside isolated from the leaves of the Stevia rebaudiana plant. This non-nutritive, natural sweetener is reported to be 250-450 times sweeter than sucrose and has potential for wide use in the US diet, and is used in Japan and South America today. The safety of Reb A has been investigated in several recently published studies and information on genotoxicity is described herein. Reb A was investigated for its potential to induce genotoxicity in three in vitro and two in vivo assays (conducted according to OECD guidelines). Reb A was non-mutagenic in an Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, in a chromosomal aberration test using Chinese Hamster V79 cells and in a mouse lymphoma assay using L5178Y+/- cells, all studies were conducted at concentrations up to 5000 microg/ml, with and without metabolic activation. Also, Reb A was non-genotoxic in a bone marrow micronucleus test in mice at doses up 750 mg/kg bw and in an unscheduled DNA synthesis test in rats at 2000 mg/kg bw. These studies provide additional evidence that Reb A is not genotoxic at the doses tested and further support the generally recognized as safe determination of Reb A.
