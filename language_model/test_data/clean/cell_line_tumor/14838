Improvements in transfection efficiency are required in order to make the goal of cellular gene delivery by non-viral vectors realizable. Novel derivatives of gemini surfactants having dissymmetric tail groups have been designed specifically as a means to improve DNA transfection; the micelle and interfacial properties are reported herein. The effect of these substitutions on the aggregation properties of the gemini surfactants is discussed in the context of results for the m-3-m gemini series, previously reported in the literature. Phytanyl substitution results in lower cmc and higher micelle ionization. In addition, the phytanyl substituted gemini surfactants form vesicles at room temperature. Preliminary in vitro transfection assays showed the phytanyl substituted gemini surfactants to be more efficient transfection vectors as compared to symmetric gemini surfactants.
