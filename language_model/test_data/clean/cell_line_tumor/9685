Upon searching for glucocorticoid-regulated cDNA sequences associated with the transformed to normal phenotypic reversion of C6/ST1 rat glioma cells, we identified Nrp/b (nuclear restrict protein in brain) as a novel rat gene. Here we report on the identification and functional characterization of the complete sequence encoding the rat NRP/B protein. The cloned cDNA presented a 1767 nucleotides open-reading frame encoding a 589 amino acids residues sequence containing a BTB/POZ (broad complex Tramtrack bric-a-brac/Pox virus and zinc finger) domain in its N-terminal region and kelch motifs in its C-terminal region. Sequence analysis indicates that the rat Nrp/b displays a high level of identity with the equivalent gene orthologs from other organisms. Among rat tissues, Nrp/b expression is more pronounced in brain tissue. We show that overexpression of the Nrp/b cDNA in C6/ST1 cells suppresses anchorage independence in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo, altering their malignant nature towards a more benign phenotype. Therefore, Nrp/b may be postulated as a novel tumor suppressor gene, with possible relevance for glioblastoma therapy.
