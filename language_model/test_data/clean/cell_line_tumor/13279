It has been reported that overexpression of Mad2 in transgenic mice leads             to a wide variety of tumors, and Mad2 overexpression causes lung tumor relapse             after oncogene withdrawal. In a previous study we demonstrated that Mad2 is abnormally             upregulated in human osteosarcoma, however, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown.             In this study, we found that transient Mad2 overexpression is sufficient to cause             early dyscrasia and decreased survival in a xenotransplantation osteosarcoma mouse             model, and Mad2 overexpression is associated with increased invasiveness and pulmonary             metastasis. We also found that upregulation of Mad2 was accompanied by enhanced             capability to self-renew. Our data validate the correlation between upregulation             of Mad2 and osteosarcoma advancement, and that the underlying mechanisms involve             the increase of invasiveness and cancer stem cell properties.
