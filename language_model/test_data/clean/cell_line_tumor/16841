The overexpression of tissue factor (TF) observed in numerous cancer cells and clinical samples of human cancers makes TF an ideal target for cancer therapy. The purpose of this study is to develop a TF-targeting energized fusion protein hlFVII-LDP-AE, which is composed of a human Factor VII light chain (hlFVII) as the targeting domain conjugated to the cytotoxic antibiotic lidamycin (LDM, LDP-AE) as the effector domain. The potential efficacy of hlFVII-LDP-AE for cancer therapy was tested in vitro by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and colony formation assays and in vivo with a BALB/c nude mouse xenograft model of human liver cancer line HepG2. The inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) value of hlFVII-LDP-AE varied from 0.15 to 0.64 nM for the various human tumor lines. hlFVII-LDP-AE showed a tumor growth inhibition rate of 90.6% at the dose of 0.6 mg/kg in in vivo animal experiments. The mechanism through which hlFVII-LDP-AE inhibits tumor growth also was determined by Hoechst 33342 staining and Tdt-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. hlFVII-LDP-AE causes tumor cell death through inducing chromatin condensation and cleavage of genomic DNA. These findings suggest that the hlFVII-LDP-AE protocol is efficacious and tolerated in the mouse model of human liver cancer HepG2 and has clinical applicability for treating cancer patients.
