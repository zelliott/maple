To investigate the anti-tumor effect of celecoxib on human prostate cancer cell line PC-3 in vitroby observing its effects on the proliferation and apoptosis of PC-3 cells.

The effects of Celecoxib on the proliferation of PC-3 cells were observed by MTT assay, erosion trace test and Transwell-chamber chemotaxis assay, and their apoptosis detected by Annexin V/FITC fluorescent staining and flow cytometry.

With the increasing concentration and exposure time, Celecoxib exhibited an increased rate of inhibition on PC-3 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner (P < 0.05). Compared with the controls, the migration distance of the PC-3 cells and the number of the PC-3 cells that invaded the inferior chamber were significantly decreased in the 100 gm/L Celecoxib group (P < 0.05). Celecoxib induced the apoptosis of PC-3 cells and, at 100 microm/L, significantly increased the percentage of PC-3 cells in the G0/G1 phase but decreased it in the S phase as compared with the control group (P < 0.05).

Celecoxib inhibits the proliferation and induces the apoptosis of PC-3 cells in vitro, which, as a new therapeutic for prostate cancer, well deserves further investigation.
