Herein, we report that dihydrolipoic acid and lipoic acid (LA) plus lipoamide dehydrogenase and NADH denitrosate S-nitrosocaspase 3 (CASP-SNO). In HepG2 cells, S-nitroso-L-cysteine ethyl ester (SNCEE) impeded the activity of caspase 3 (CASP-SH), while a subsequent incubation of the cells in SNCEE-free medium resulted in endogenous denitrosation and reactivation of CASP-SH. The latter process was inhibited in thioredoxin reductase-deficient HepG2 cells, in which, however, LA markedly reactivated CASP-SH. The data obtained are discussed with focus on low molecular mass dithiols that mimic the activity of thioredoxin in reactions of protein S-denitrosation.
