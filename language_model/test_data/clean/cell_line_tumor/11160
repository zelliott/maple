A series of alkylphosphocholine and alkylphosphohomocholine derivatives of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, cetylpyridinium bromide, benzalkonium bromide (C16) and benzethonium chloride have been synthesized. Their physicochemical properties were also investigated. The critical micelle concentration (cmc), the surface tension value at the cmc (Î³cmc), and the surface area at the surface saturation per head group (Acmc) were determined by means of surface tension measurements. The prepared compounds exhibit significant cytotoxic, antifungal and antiprotozoal activities. Alkylphosphocholines and alkylphosphohomocholines possess higher antifungal activity against Candida albicans in comparison with quaternary ammonium compounds in general. However, quaternary ammonium compounds exhibit significantly higher activity against human tumor cells and pathogenic free-living amoebae Acanthamoeba lugdunensis and Acanthamoeba quina compared to alkylphosphocholines. The relationship between structure, physicochemical properties and biological activity of the tested compounds is discussed.
