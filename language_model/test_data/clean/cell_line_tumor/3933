There is accumulating evidence that galanin receptors (GALRs) may be tumor suppressors in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Promoter methylation status and gene expression were assessed in a large panel of head and neck primary tumors, based on the hypothesis that cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) hypermethylation might silence the galanin receptor 2 (GALR2) gene.

GALR2 expression was examined in a panel of cell lines by using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The methylation status of the GALR2 promoter was studied using quantitative methylation-specific PCR (Q-MSP). UM-SCC-1 was stably transfected to express GALR2.

GALR2 expression was suppressed in UM-SCC cell lines, whereas nonmalignant cell lines exhibited stable expression. GALR2 methylation found in 31 of 100 (31.0%) tumor specimens was significantly correlated with the methylation status of both GALR1 and Galanin. The observed GALR2 promoter hypermethylation was statistically correlated with a decrease in disease-free survival (log-rank test, P=.045). A multivariate logistic-regression analysis revealed a high odds ratio for recurring methylation of GALR2 and the gene pair GALR2 and Galanin, 8.95 (95% confidence interval, 2.29-35.03; P=.024) and 9.05 (95% confidence interval, 1.76-46.50; P=.008), respectively. In addition, exogenous expression of GALR2 suppressed cell proliferation in UM-SCC-1 cells with hypermethylated Galanin and GALR2-proficient cell lines.

Frequent promoter hypermethylation in association with prognosis, and growth suppression after re-expression, supports the hypothesis that GALR2 may act to suppress tumor activity. GALR2 is a potentially significant therapeutic target and prognostic factor for this cancer type.
