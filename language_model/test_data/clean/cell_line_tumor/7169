The p16INK4a protein was detected by means of monoclonal antibodies to this protein in the cells of some carcinomas: that of the lungs (17 samples), urinary bladder (6 samples) and mammary gland (4 samples) as well as in the cells of three cell lines from of human uterine cervix carcinoma: SiHa (containing high risk HPV genome), C33A and HT3 (both HPV-negative but have RB mutations in RB gene). Lung carcinoma samples were very heterogenous by the part of cells expressing p16INK4a. High content of this protein was found in all 6 samples of transient cell urinary bladder carcinoma and in 1 sample of mammary gland ductal carcinoma. Cells of all three cell lines also contained p16INK4a. Thus, hyperexpression of this protein is not specific for only HPV-positive cancer of the uterine cervix. The protein presence in cancer cells seems to be an indicator of gene RB mutation or other disturbances of RB pathway.
