As a ubiquitous enzyme overexpressed on the epithelium of the tumor, aminopeptidase N (APN) plays important roles in the angiogenesis and metastasis of the tumor. Bestatin as an effective inhibitor against APN is used in the ancillary treatment of various cancers. In this study, we modified the structure of a bestatin derivative LYP reported in our former study to provide a new bestatin derivative LYP2 with enhanced stability. We also tested the inhibitive activity of LYP2, which retained good efficacy in vitro and in vivo towards APN.
