Chemotherapy-induced apoptosis by DNA-damaging drugs is thought to be generally dependent on the release of cytochrome c and the subsequent activation of caspase-9 and -3. However, the molecular mechanism of how damaged DNA triggers the apoptotic process is not clear. To better understand the mechanisms underlying this process, we examined drug-induced apoptosis in cultured H-460 cells. Using cell fractionation, western blotting, and immunofluorescence assays, we show that the activation of nuclear caspases-7 and -3, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, are early events in camptothecin-induced apoptosis. Moreover, we demonstrate that these events precede the release of cytochrome c and apoptotic inducing factor, and the activation of caspases 2, 8, 9 and 12. Together our results suggest that drugs acting at the DNA level can initiate apoptosis via nuclear caspase activation.
