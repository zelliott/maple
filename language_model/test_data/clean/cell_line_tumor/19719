Breast cancers commonly spread to lymph nodes (LNs). If the primary tumors are estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) positive, then the likelihood that LN metastases express receptors exceeds 80%. However, due to lack of ER+ models, little is known about the role of hormones in breast cancer spread or the effects of the LN microenvironment on hormone responsiveness. We have developed metastasis models using ZsGreen labeled MCF-7 and T47D human breast cancer cells. Tumors are tracked in living mice by whole-body imaging, and macrometastases or micrometastases are detected by intravital imaging or fluorescence microscopy. Tumor growth is estrogen dependent and required for intratumoral lymphangiogenesis. Seventy-five percent of all tumors and >95% of larger tumors generate LN metastases. Occasionally more distant metastases are also observed. "Triads" of primary tumors, tumor-filled draining lymphatic vessels, and tumor-filled LNs from the same mouse show that (a) proliferation, as measured by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine uptake, is higher in the LN than in the primary tumor. (b) High ER levels are extensively down-regulated by estradiol in primary tumors. However, there is partial failure of ER down-regulation in LNs associated with (c) reduced PR expression. This suggests that ER are dysfunctional in the LN microenvironment and perhaps hormone resistant. (d) CD44 is sparsely expressed in primary tumor cells but homogeneously overexpressed in cells transiting the lymphatics and populating LNs. We hypothesize that CD44 expression targets tumor cells for transport to, and uptake in, LNs. If so, the CD44 pathway could be targeted therapeutically to slow or prevent LN metastases.
