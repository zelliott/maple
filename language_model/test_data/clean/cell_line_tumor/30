JOTO1007 (ethyl 2-[N-p-chlorobenzyl-(2'-methyl)] anilino-4-oxo-4,5-dihydrofuran -3-carboxylate) has anticancer effects in human cervical cancer Ca Ski cells. However, its mechanism of action on the cell migration and invasion of human cervical cancer Ca Ski cells is not fully understood. In this study, firstly, the effects of JOTO1007 on the migration and invasion of Ca Ski cells were examined by using matrigel counting. The results showed that JOTO1007 suppressed the migration and invasion of the Ca Ski cells. Secondly, the effect of JOTO1007 on the levels of proteins associated with cell metastasis was examined using Western blotting. The results indicated that JOTO1007 inhibited the levels of son of sevenless homolog 1 (SOS-1), growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2), Ras homolog gene family, member A (RhoA), Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK-1), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), phosphorylated-c-jun (p-c-jun), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) p65, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-7 and MMP-9 but promoted the levels of protein kinase C (PKC), phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K), MAP kinase kinase kinase 3 (MEKK3), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7 (MKK7), c-jun and inducible nitric oxide synthases (iNOS), while not affecting Ras, phosphorylated-ERK (p-ERK), p38 and c-jun N-terminal kinase 1/2 (JNK1/2), which finally led to the inhibition of migration and invasion of the Ca Ski cells in vitro. Overall, JOTO1007 inhibited NF-kappaB which then led to the inhibition of the MMP-2, -7 and -9 expression followed by the inhibition of migration and invasion in the Ca Ski cells.
