To investigate the inhibitory effect of dendritic cells (DCs) on the growth of the implanted tongue squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumors in nude mice.

Being induced from human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) with rhGM-CSF, rhIL-4 and rhTNF-alpha, DCs were pulsed by Tca8113 cells lysates. Those DCs and T lymphocytes were co-cultured to induce specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Immunotherapy was then performed after those DCs and CTLs were implanted into the tumor-bearing nude mice.

DCs were induced from PBMCs with multiple cytokines. Compared with the control groups, the growth of tumors was significantly inhibited in the group that had been implanted with DCs and CTLs, and tumor doubling time also increased markedly (P < 0.05).

DCs function normally after being induced from human PBMCs with multiple cytokines; DCs pulsed with tumor cell lysates and CTLs co-cultured with those DCs have a significant anti-tumor immune activity in nude mice.
