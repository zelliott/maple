The total synthesis of kibdelone A has been accomplished via In(III)-catalyzed arylation of a heterocyclic quinone monoketal and iodine-mediated oxidative photochemical electrocyclization for construction of the ABCD ring moiety. Enzymatic dihydroxylation of methyl 2-halobenzoate substrates was employed for synthesis of activated 2-halo-cyclohexene F-ring fragments. A one pot oxa-Michael/Friedel-Crafts process allowed access to the first simplified DEF ring analogues of the kibdelones.
