The aim of this study was to demonstrate the potential of electrogene therapy with the bacterial purine nucleoside phosphorylase gene (ePNP), on pancreatic carcinoma (PC) large tumors. The in vivo electroporation (EP) conditions and efficacy were investigated on both subcutaneous xenografts of human PC cells in immunocompromised mice and orthotopic intrapancreatic grafts of rat PC cells in syngenic rats. After intratumoral injection of naked plasmid DNA, EP was performed using a two-needle array with 25-msec pulses and either a 300 V/cm field strength for subcutaneous or a 500 V/cm field strength for orthotopic PC, parameters providing the best electrotransfer as reflected by the measurements of both luciferase activity and ePNP mRNA. As expected, tumors developed sensitivity to prodrug treatment (6-methylpurine deoxyribose or fludarabine phosphate). We observed both significant inhibition of tumor growth and extended survival of treated mice. In fact, after prodrug treatment, PC growth in the subcutaneous model was delayed by 50-70% for ePNP-expressing tumors. In an orthotopic pancreatic tumor model, the animal survival was significantly prolonged after ePNP electrogene transfer followed by fludarabine treatment, with one animal out of 10 being tumor-free 6 months thereafter. The current study demonstrates for the first time on PC the in vivo feasibility of electrogene transfer and its therapeutic efficiency using the suicide gene/prodrug system, ePNP/fludarabine. These findings suggest that electrogene therapy strategy must be considered for pancreatic cancer treatment, particularly at advanced stages of the disease.
