Glycoprotein (GP)VI is a key receptor for collagen on the platelet surface. It is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is uniquely expressed on the surface of platelets, where it is assembled with the immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif subunit, FcR-gamma. We have previously reported the generation of a murine model of GPVI deficiency that revealed profound defects in collagen-induced platelet aggregation and in platelet activation following adhesion to collagen. Beyond the hemostasis/thrombosis paradigm, platelet receptors are emerging as significant participants in tumorigenesis and inflammation.

In the current study, we have evaluated a role for platelet GPVI in primary tumor growth and experimental metastasis.

Primary tumor induction and experimental metastasis assays were performed using syngenic immunocompetent animals and tumor cells derived from the C57BL/6J mouse strain in wild-type (C57BL/6J) and N10 C57BL/6J congenic GPVI-deficient mice.

Using either a Lewis lung carcinoma (D121) or melanoma (B16F10.1) cell line, we observed an approximately 50% reduction in the number of visible tumor foci in GPVI-deficient mice as compared with control C57BL/6J mice. Additional studies were performed to compare the size of subcutaneously implanted tumor cells, that is, primary tumor growth. Here, we observed no noticeable size difference when comparing the presence or absence of platelet GPVI.

The results demonstrate that the presence of platelet GPVI facilitates experimental tumor metastasis but does not contribute to the growth of primary tumors.
