Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is involved in tumorigenesis by facilitating tumor proliferation and evasion of apoptosis; however, its role in tumor immunity is unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of MIF on the progression of the syngenic, CT26 colon carcinoma and the generation of tumor regulatory T cells (Tregs). The results showed that the tumor growth rate was significantly lower in MIF knockout (MIF(-/-)) mice than in wild-type (MIF(+/+)) mice. Flow cytometric analysis of both spleen and tumor cells revealed that MIF(-/-) mice had significantly lower levels of tumor-associated CD4(+)Tregs than MIF(+/+) mice. The splenic cells of MIF(-/-) mice also showed a decrease in CD8(+)Tregs, which was accompanied by an increase in CD8-induced tumor cytotoxicity. Interestingly, the inducible Treg response in spleen cells to anti-CD3/CD28 plus IL-2 plus TGF-β was greater in MIF(-/-) mice than in MIF(+/+) mice. Spleen cells of MIF(-/-) mice, stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28, produced lower levels of IL-2, but not TGF-β, than those of MIF(+/+) mice, which was recovered by the addition of recombinant MIF. Conversely, a neutralizing anti-MIF Ab blocked anti-CD3-induced IL-2 production by splenocytes of MIF(+/+) mice and suppressed the inducible Treg generation. Moreover, the administration of IL-2 into tumor-bearing MIF(-/-) mice restored the generation of Tregs and tumor growth. Taken together, our data suggest that MIF promotes tumor growth by increasing Treg generation through the modulation of IL-2 production. Thus, anti-MIF treatment might be useful in enhancing the adaptive immune response to colon cancers.
