A new phenolic amide 8, together with the nine known phenolic compounds 1-7, 9 and 10 were isolated from the MeOH extract of the roots of Paris verticillata. The structure of the new compound 8 was determined to be 1-N-feruloylaminobutyl-4-rho-hydroxybenzamide by spectroscopic methods. The isolated compounds were tested for cytotoxicity against four human tumor cell lines using the SRB assay.
