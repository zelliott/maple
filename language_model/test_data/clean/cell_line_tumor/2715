In order to explore the anticancer effect associated with the thiazolidinone framework, several 2-(5-((5-(4-chlorophenyl)furan-2-yl)methylene)-4-oxo-2-thioxothiazolidin-3-yl)acetic acid derivatives 5(a-l) were synthesized. Variation in the functional group at C-terminal of the thiazolidinone led to set of compounds bearing amide moiety. Their chemical structures were confirmed by (1)H NMR, IR and Mass Spectra analysis. These thiazolidinone compounds containing furan moiety exhibits moderate to strong antiproliferative activity in a cell cycle stage-dependent and dose dependent manner in two different human leukemia cell lines. The importance of the electron donating groups on thiazolidinone moiety was confirmed by MTT and Trypan blue assays and it was concluded that the 4th position of the substituted aryl ring plays a dominant role for its anticancer property. Among the synthesized compounds, 5e and 5f have shown potent anticancer activity on both the cell lines tested. To rationalize the role of electron donating group in the induction of cytotoxicity we have chosen two molecules (5e and 5k) having different electron donating group at different positions. LDH assay, Flow cytometric analysis and DNA fragmentation suggest that 5e is more cytotoxic and able to induce the apoptosis.
