A new nor-cardenolide, named toxicarioside H (1), was isolated from the latex of Antiaris toxicaria (Pers.) Lesch (Moraceae). Its structure was elucidated on the basis of HRFAB-MS and spectroscopic techniques (IR, UV, 1D and 2D NMR). Compound 1 showed significant cytotoxicity against K562, SGC-7901, SMMC-7721, and HeLa cell lines in vitro by MTT method.
