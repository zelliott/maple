To more clearly understand the molecular mechanisms involved in synergistic enhancement of cancer preventive activity with the green tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), we examined the effects of cotreatment with EGCG plus celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor. We specifically looked for induction of apoptosis and expression of apoptosis related genes, with emphasis on growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 153 (GADD153) gene, in human lung cancer cell line PC-9: Cotreatment with EGCG plus celecoxib strongly induced the expression of both GADD153 mRNA level and protein in PC-9 cells, while neither EGCG nor celecoxib alone did. However, cotreatment did not induce expression of other apoptosis related genes, p21(WAF1) and GADD45. Judging by upregulation of GADD153, only cotreatment with EGCG plus celecoxib synergistically induced apoptosis of PC-9 cells. Synergistic effects with the combination were also observed in 2 other lung cancer cell lines, A549 and ChaGo K-1. Furthermore, EGCG did not enhance GADD153 gene expression or apoptosis induction in PC-9 cells in combination with N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide or with aspirin. Thus, upregulation of GADD153 is closely correlated with synergistic enhancement of apoptosis with EGCG. Cotreatment also activated the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), such as ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK: Preteatment with PD98059 (ERK1/2 inhibitor) and UO126 (selective MEK inhibitor) abrogated both upregulation of GADD153 and synergistic induction of apoptosis of PC-9 cells, while SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) did not do so, indicating that GADD153 expression was mediated through the ERK signaling pathway. These findings indicate that high upregulation of GADD153 is a key requirement for cancer prevention in combination with EGCG.
