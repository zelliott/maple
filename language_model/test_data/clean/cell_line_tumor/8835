The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling regulates tissue development, and its aberrant activation is a leading cause of malignancies, including medulloblastoma (Mb). Hh-dependent tumorigenesis often occurs in synergy with other mechanisms, such as loss of p53, the master regulator of the DNA damage response. To date, little is known about mechanisms connecting DNA-damaging events to morphogen-dependent processes. Here, we show that genotoxic stress triggers a cascade of signals, culminating with inhibition of the activity of Gli1, the final transcriptional effector of Hh signaling. This inhibition is dependent on the p53-mediated elevation of the acetyltransferase p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF). Notably, we identify PCAF as a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase of Gli1. Indeed PCAF, but not a mutant with a deletion of its ubiquitination domain, represses Hh signaling in response to DNA damage by promoting Gli1 ubiquitination and its proteasome-dependent degradation. Restoring Gli1 levels rescues the growth arrest and apoptosis effect triggered by genotoxic drugs. Consistently, DNA-damaging agents fail to inhibit Gli1 activity in the absence of either p53 or PCAF. Finally, Mb samples from p53-null mice display low levels of PCAF and upregulation of Gli1 in vivo, suggesting PCAF as potential therapeutic target in Hh-dependent tumors. Together, our data define a mechanism of inactivation of a morphogenic signaling in response to genotoxic stress and unveil a p53/PCAF/Gli1 circuitry centered on PCAF that limits Gli1-enhanced mitogenic and prosurvival response.
