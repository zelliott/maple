Legionella pneumophila uses the Icm/Dot type 4B secretion system (T4BSS) to deliver translocated protein substrates to the host cell, promoting replication vacuole formation. The conformational state of the translocated substrates within the bacterial cell is unknown, so we sought to determine if folded substrates could be translocated via this system. Fusions of L. pneumophila Icm/Dot-translocated substrates (IDTS) to dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) or ubiquitin (Ub), small proteins known to fold rapidly, resulted in proteins with low translocation efficiencies. The folded moieties did not cause increased aggregation of the IDTS and did not impede interaction with the adaptor protein complex IcmS/IcmW, which is thought to form a soluble complex that promotes translocation. The translocation defect was alleviated with a Ub moiety harboring mutations known to destabilize its structure, indicating that unfolded proteins are preferred substrates. Real-time analysis of translocation, following movement during the first 30 min after bacterial contact with host cells, revealed that the folded moiety caused a kinetic defect in IDTS translocation. Expression of an IDTS fused to a folded moiety interfered with the translocation of other IDTS, consistent with it causing a blockage of the translocation channel. Furthermore, the folded protein fusions also interfered with intracellular growth, consistent with inefficient or impaired translocation of proteins critical for L. pneumophila intracellular growth. These studies indicate that substrates of the Icm/Dot T4SS are translocated to the host cytosol in an unfolded conformation and that folded proteins are stalled within the translocation channel, impairing the function of the secretion system.
