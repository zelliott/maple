The novel fluoro-substituted camptothecin analog, BMS-286309, and its prodrug, BMS-422461, were evaluated for their pharmacologic, toxicologic, metabolic and pharmacokinetic developmental potential.

In vitro and in vivo assays were used to assess the compounds for topoisomerase I activity, antitumor activity, gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, and pharmacokinetic parameters.

BMS-286309-induced topoisomerase I-mediated DNA breaks in vitro and was similar in potency to camptothecin. Both BMS-286309 and -422461 were comparable to irinotecan regarding preclinical antitumor activity assessed in mice bearing distal site murine and human tumors. BMS-422461 was also found to be orally active. Both analogs were >100-fold more potent in vivo than irinotecan and both were superior to irinotecan with respect to toxicological assessment of GI injury in mice. The generation of parent compound from BMS-422461 was qualitatively similar in mouse, rat and human blood and liver S9 fractions. The percentage of BMS-286309 remaining as the active lactone form at equilibrium was comparable in mouse and human plasma. The pharmacokinetic profile in rat blood demonstrated that BMS-422461 was rapidly cleaved to BMS-286309.

The favorable in vivo metabolic activation of BMS-422461, and the pharmacokinetic characteristics of BMS-286309, suggest that the good efficacy of BMS-422461 is derived from robust in vivo release of BMS-286309 in rodents and the likelihood that this biotransformation will be preserved in humans. The comparable antitumor activity of BMS-422461 to irinotecan, as well as reduced preclinical GI toxicity, make this novel camptothecin analog attractive for clinical development.
