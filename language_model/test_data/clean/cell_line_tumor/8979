Resistance to paclitaxel is common for treatment of breast cancer. Programmed cell death 5 (PDCD5) accelerates apoptosis in different cell types in response to various stimuli; moreover PDCD5 has been shown to be down-regulated in many tumors. In this study, protein levels of PDCD5 were found to be up-regulated in paclitaxel-treated MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. MTT, CCK-8, and clonogenic assays have shown that recombinant human PDCD5 (rhPDCD5) alone could not produce an obvious growth inhibition. However, upon paclitaxel triggering apoptosis, rhPDCD5 protein potentiated chemotherapeutic drugs-induced growth arrest in MDA-MB-231, SK-BR-3, and ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells. In vivo, we use a human breast cancer xenograft model to study. We found that rhPDCD5 dramatically improves the antitumor effects of paclitaxel treatment by intraperitoneal administration. These data suggest that rhPDCD5 has the potential to use as a therapeutic agent to enhance the paclitaxel sensitivity of breast cancer cells.
