The wide surgical tumour resection is the only effective treatment in chondrosarcoma. However, a major problem remains the high rate of local recurrences and metastases due to the lack of adjuvant therapies. In this study the cytotoxic effect of the bisphosphonate clodronate (0.1-1000 μM) and zoledronate (0.1-1000 μM) in different concentrations on two chondrosarcoma cell lines (HTB-94 and CAL-78) has been investigated. After an incubation period of 48, 72 and 96 hours the chondrosarcoma cell viability was measured as the MTT-proliferation rate. In concentrations of >1 μm zoledronate the cell activity was reduced by up to 95% for the CAL-78 cells. Further, zoledronate has been more effective in lower concentrations than clodronate in the reduction of cell viability for both cell lines. However, clodronate showed significant cytotoxic effects in high concentrations and after longer incubation periods. Further research is necessary, but in the light of these results bisphosphonates may also play a role in the treatment of chondrosarcomas.
