The effect of NPC-14686, a potential anti-inflammatory drug, on cytosolic free Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+]i) and growth in PC3 human prostate cancer cells was examined by using fura-2 as a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator and WST-1 as a fluorescent growth dye. NPC-14686 at concentrations above 10 microM increased [Ca2+]i in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 value of 100 microM. NPC-14686-induced Ca2+ influx was confirmed by Mn2+ quench of fura-2 fluorescence. The Ca2+ signal was also reduced by removing extracellular Ca2+. Pretreatment with 1 microM thapsigargin (an endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump inhibitor) to deplete the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ nearly abolished 200 microM NPC-14686-induced Ca2+ release; and conversely pretreatment with NPC-14686 completely inhibited thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ release. The Ca2+ release induced by 200 microM NPC-14686 was not affected by inhibiting phospholipase C with 2 microM U73122. Overnight treatment with 1-500 microM NPC-14686 decreased cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner. These findings suggest that in human PC3 prostate cancer cells, NPC-14686 increases [Ca2+]i by evoking extracellular Ca2+ influx and releasing intracellular Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum via a phospholiase C-independent manner. NPC-14686 may be cytotoxic to prostate cancer cells.
