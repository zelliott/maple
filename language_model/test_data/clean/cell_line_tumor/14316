Three new sesquiterpenes (1-3), together with four known sesquiterpene lactones, were isolated from the flowers of Inula britannica var. chinensis. Structures were established on the basis of high-field 1D and 2D NMR methods supported by HRMS. All sesquiterpene lactones were tested for cytotoxicity as well as apoptotic ratio in human COLO 205, HT 29, HL-60, and AGS cancer cells. Compounds 3 and 4, two alpha-methylene gamma-lactone-bearing sesquiterpenes, were modestly active in these assays.
