We report a series of potent imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazine-based Aurora kinase inhibitors. Optimization of the solvent accessible 8-position led to improvements in both oral bioavailability and off-target kinase inhibition. Compound 25 demonstrates anti-tumor activity in an A2780 ovarian tumor xenograft model.
