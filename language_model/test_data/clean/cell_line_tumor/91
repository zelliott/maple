[6]-Gingerol, a natural component of ginger, exhibits anti-inflammatory and antitumorigenic activities. Despite its potential efficacy in cancer, the mechanism by which [6]-gingerol exerts its chemopreventive effects remains elusive. The leukotriene A(4) hydrolase (LTA(4)H) protein is regarded as a relevant target for cancer therapy. Our in silico prediction using a reverse-docking approach revealed that LTA(4)H might be a potential target of [6]-gingerol. We supported our prediction by showing that [6]-gingerol suppresses anchorage-independent cancer cell growth by inhibiting LTA(4)H activity in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. We showed that [6]-gingerol effectively suppressed tumor growth in vivo in nude mice, an effect that was mediated by inhibition of LTA(4)H activity. Collectively, these findings indicate a crucial role of LTA(4)H in cancer and also support the anticancer efficacy of [6]-gingerol targeting of LTA(4)H for the prevention of colorectal cancer.
