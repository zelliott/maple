Posttransplant bone disease is one of the complications of cyclosporine (CsA), which is widely used as an immunosuppressive agent in the field of kidney transplantation. Cyclosporine treatment causes osteopenia as a result of altered bone turnover, but the pathogenic mechanisms of this process remain unclear. This study examined the ability of CsA to induce apoptosis in a rat osteoblast cell line.

We induced apoptosis in rat osteoblastic ROS 17/2.8 cells by exposure to CsA. MTT assay showed that CsA exhibited significant cytotoxic effects on ROS 17/2.8 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot analysis showed enhanced processing of caspase-8, Bax, and p53 after CsA treatment. Expression of cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was elevated by CsA treatment. Pro-caspase-3 and Bcl-2 proteins were decreased by CsA.

These results suggested that CsA induced apoptosis of osteoblasts.
