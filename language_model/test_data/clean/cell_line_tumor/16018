Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are proteolytic enzymes involved in degradation of extracellular matrix, a process that initiates uncontrolled spread of proliferating cancer cells and therefore plays a crucial role in cancer invasion and metastasis. Compounds able to modulate MMP activity may become important tools in cancer research. In the present study we examined the effect of two Î¼-selective opioids, morphine and endomorphin-2 (EM-2) on the production of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in MCF-7 cells. We report that both opioids time- and concentration-dependently inhibited the expression and secretion of these MMPs. The observed effect was not reversed by naloxone (Nal). Further experiments showed that morphine and EM-2 decreased endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA level and nitric oxide (NO) secretion in MCF-7 cells. These findings indicate that attenuation of MMP secretion by opioids was not mediated by opioid receptors but was under the control of nitric oxide system.
