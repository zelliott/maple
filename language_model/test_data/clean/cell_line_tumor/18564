Two new isoprenylated flavones, artoindonesianins U (1) and V (2), have been isolated from the heartwood of Artocarpus champeden together with three known isoprenylated flavonoids, 5'-hydroxycudraflavone A, cyclocommunin and artonin B. The structures of the new flavones were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic evidence. Both compounds 1 and 2 showed strong cytotoxic activity against P-388 cell lines.
