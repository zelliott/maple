Hyaluronic acid-ceramide (HA-CE)-based self-assembled nanoparticles were developed for intravenous docetaxel (DCT) delivery. In this study, physicochemical properties, cellular uptake efficiency, and in vivo targeting capability of the nanoparticles developed were investigated. DCT-loaded nanoparticles composed of HA-CE and Pluronic 85 (P85) with a mean diameter of 110-140 nm were prepared and their morphological shapes were assessed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). DCT release from nanoparticle was enhanced with increasing P85 concentrations in our in vitro model. Blank nanoparticles exhibited low cytotoxicity in U87-MG, MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR cell lines. From cellular uptake studies, the nanoparticles developed enhanced the intracellular DCT uptake in the CD44-overexpressing cell line (MCF-7). The nanoparticles were shown to be taken up by the HA-CD44 interaction according to DCT and coumarin 6 (C6) cellular uptake studies. The multidrug resistance (MDR)-overcoming effects of DCT-loaded HA-CE/P85-based nanoparticles were also observed in cytotoxicity tests in MCF-7/ADR cells. Following the intravenous injection of DCT-loaded cyanine 5.5 (Cy5.5)-conjugated nanoparticles in MCF-7/ADR tumor-bearing mice, its in vivo targeting for CD44-overexpressing tumors was identified by non-invasive near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging. These results indicate that the HA-CE-based nanoparticles prepared may be a promising anti-cancer drug delivery system through passive and active tumor targeting.
