As a prelude to efforts to identify schweinfurthin binding proteins, an ester conjugate and an amide conjugate of schweinfurthin F and biotin have been prepared by chemical synthesis. These compounds maintain activity in SF-295 cells comparable to the parent system, and display the lower potency in A549 cells that is a characteristic of the schweinfurthin pattern of activity.
