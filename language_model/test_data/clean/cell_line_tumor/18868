Anion exchangers (AEs) of the Cl(-)/HCO3(-) exchanger family contribute to the regulation of intracellular acid-base balance. Recently, we found that anion exchanger 2 (AE2) was significantly expressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and in poorly-differentiated human HCC HA22T/VGH cells. In the present study, we further explored the pharmacological function of AE in four human HCC cell lines (SK-Hep-1, HA22T/VGH, HepG2, and Hep3B) following the treatment of 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS), an AEs specific inhibitor. After administrations with 400-1000 microM of DIDS, cell proliferation was greatly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner from 47.5 to 65.0% in higher malignant HA22T/VGH cells, but not in other cell lines. The results of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, DNA fragmentation and flow cytometric analysis further revealed that cell apoptosis induced by DIDS was also observed in HA22T/VGH cells. Therefore, these findings suggested that AE may be involved, in part, in the proliferation and survival of HA22T cells and could be a new potential therapeutic target against specific human HCC.
