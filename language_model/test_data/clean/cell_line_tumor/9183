To establish an orthotopic transplantation model of human osteosarcoma in nude mice.

The cell suspensions of serial passage of MG-63 cell line with high tumor formation rate were implanted into the distal femur of nude mice. The tumor tissue were treated with routine pathologic HE stain and observed under microscope, and made to the x-ray inspection.

In two weeks, the neoplasm was found to grow at local tissue of nude mice, and also found in x-ray film when it was after implant operated for 4 weeks. The typical characteristics of osteosarcoma of tumor tissue were found under microscope. The tumor formation rate of tumor tissue transplantation was 100% and the tumor formation rate of MG-63 cell suspension was 70%.

The orthotopic transplantation model of osteosarcoma in nude mice is well established and provides a more similar human internal milieu for researches of osteosarcoma.
