Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) is an important regulator of osteoblast differentiation. However, the regulation of osteoblast apoptosis by BMP signaling remains poorly understood. Here we examined the role of type I BMP receptor (BMP-RI) in osteoblast apoptosis promoted by BMP-2. Despite undetectable BMP-RIB expression in OHS4 cells, BMP-2 or BMP-2 overexpression increased osteoblast differentiation similarly as in SaOS2 cells which express BMP-RIB, as shown by alkaline phosphatase and CBFA1/RUNX2 expression. In contrast to SaOS2 cells, however, BMP-2 or BMP-2 overexpression did not increase caspase-9 and caspases-3, -6, and -7 activity and DNA fragmentation in OHS4 cells. Consistently, BMP-2 increased protein kinase C (PKC) activity, and PKC inhibition suppressed BMP-2-induced caspase activity in SaOS2 but not in OHS4 cells that lack BMP-RIB. A dominant negative BMP-RIB inhibited BMP-2-induced caspase activity, whereas wild-type BMP-RIB promoted caspase activity induced by BMP-2 in SaOS2 and MC3T3-E1 cells. Wild-type BMP-RIB rescued the apoptotic response to BMP-2, and a constitutively active BMP-RIB restored the apoptotic signal in OHS4 cells, supporting an essential role for BMP-RIB in osteoblast apoptosis. We also assessed whether BMP-2-induced apoptosis occurred independently of osteoblast differentiation. General inhibition of caspases did not abolish BMP-2-induced alkaline phosphatase and CBFA1/RUNX2 expression in SaOS2 cells. Furthermore, broad caspases inhibition increased matrix mineralization but did not reverse the BMP-2 effect on mineralization in MC3T3-E1 cells. These results indicate that BMP-2-induced apoptosis was mediated by BMP-RIB in osteoblasts and occurred independently of BMP-2-induced osteoblast differentiation, which provides additional insights into the dual mechanism of BMP-2 action on osteoblast fate.
