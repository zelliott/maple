The transcription factor ATF2 is overexpressed in various tumors, but its role in breast cancer is still not understood.

In a study of mammary carcinomas, the expression of ATF2 and its phosphorylated active forms was analyzed by Western blot analysis (WB; pThr69/pThr71-ATF2, n=134) and immunohistochemistry (IHC; p-ATF2-Thr6, n=110). Results were correlated with histological and clinical data, survival data, expression of ERK1/2 and two matrix metalloproteinases.

Patients with high ATF2 expression as detected by WB had a significantly shorter overall survival (p = 0.038). This tendency was corroborated by IHC. In contrast, high p-ATF2 expression as found by WB correlated significantly with a well-differentiated phenotype, but not with prognosis. Immunohistochemically detected p-ATF2 overexpression was even associated with prolonged survival (p = 0.047).

Although high ATF2 expression is associated with a poor prognosis, our data do not point to an oncogenic role of active p-ATF2 in mammary carcinomas.
