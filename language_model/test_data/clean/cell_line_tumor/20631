Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) has a 5-year survival rate of 90%. The 15-year survival rate drops to 10% due to recurrence and invasion. ACC has three subtypes: cribriform, tubular, and solid. The cribriform subtype has the best prognosis and the solid subtype has the worst prognosis. By immunohistochemistry of tissue sections, we showed that the solid form expresses αvβ6 integrin and tenascin-C, which are known promoters of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We also defined two ACC cell lines with the characteristics of the cribriform and solid subtype. The SACC83 cells grow in basaloid-like clusters and express high levels of E-cadherin. In contrast, the ACCh cells are more myoepithelial-like and express high levels of vimentin and of αvβ6 integrin. The ACCh cells are highly invasive and this behavior is dependent upon the αvβ6 integrin function. Our results suggest that the transition from the cribriform to solid form may occur through EMT.
