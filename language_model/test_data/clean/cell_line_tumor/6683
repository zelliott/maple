The new (20R)-22E-cholesta-4,22-diene-3,6-dione (1), along with three known 3-keto steroids were isolated from the deep-water Mediterranean scleractinian coral Dendrophyllia cornigera (2-4). Moreover, four known related 3-keto steroids were isolated from the sea grass Cymodocea nodosa (5-8). The structure elucidation of steroid 1 and the full NMR resonance assignments of all isolated metabolites were based on interpretation of their spectral data. All compounds are reported for the first time as metabolites of the investigated organisms. Compounds 2 and 3 showed significant cytotoxicity against lung cancer NSCLC-N6 cell line.
