Nickel ferrite nanoparticles with or without oleic acid surface coating were mixed with poly(D,L-lactide) (PLA) by double emulsion method. If the nanoparticles were prepared without oleic acid coating, they adsorbed on the PLA surface. If the nanoparticles were coated with oleic acid, they could be readily encapsulated within the PLA microspheres. A slight depression in glass transition temperature was found in all composites and it could be related to the interfacial energies between nanoparticles and PLA. Optimum mixed composite was achieved by reducing interfacial energy. However, loading capacity was limited in this composite. Increasing the amount of nickel ferrite nanoparticles was not useful to increase loading capacity. Cytotoxicity of the composite decreased significantly when nickel ferrite nanoparticles were effectively encapsulated in PLA microspheres.
