Of the many heat shock proteins (HSPs), hsp70 appears to correlate best with heat resistance, either permanent or transient. We have investigated various approaches to quantify the concentration of hsp70, and examined the relationship between hsp70 and cells' thermal sensitivity during the development and decay of thermotolerance in model systems. Specifically, experiments were performed to determine the possibility of using the rate of synthesis of hsp70 after a second test heat shock to predict the kinetics of thermotolerance in tumor cells in vitro and in animal tumor models. We found that the cells' ability to re-initiate hsp70 synthesis in response to the test heat shock inversely correlated with retained thermotolerance. These data suggest the level of hsp70 in thermotolerant cells regulates the rate of synthesis of additional hsp70 in response to the subsequent heat challenge. Furthermore, the results showed that the rate of re-induction of hsp70 synthesis after a test heat shock can be used as a rapid measure of retained thermotolerance. This study suggests an approach for quantifying the level of retained thermotolerance during fractionated hyperthermia.
