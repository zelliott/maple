Cancer therapy has moved beyond conventional chemotherapeutics to more mechanism-based targeted approaches. Studies demonstrate that histone deacetylase (HDAC) is a promising target for anticancer agents. Numerous, structurally diverse, hydroxamic acid derivative, HDAC inhibitors have been reported and have been shown to induce growth arrest, differentiation, autophagy, and/or apoptotic cell death by inhibiting multiple signaling pathways in cancer cells. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) has emerged as an effective anticancer therapeutic agent and was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. In our previous study, we reported the development of the novel, potent, selenium-containing HDAC inhibitors (SelSA-1 and SelSA-2). In this study, the effects of SelSA-1 and SelSA-2 on signaling pathways and cytotoxicity were compared with the known HDAC inhibitor, SAHA, in lung cancer cell lines. After 24 h of treatment, SelSA-1 and SelSA-2 inhibited lung cancer cell growth to a greater extent than SAHA in a dose-dependent manner with IC(50) values at low micromolar concentrations. SelSA-1 and SelSA-2 inhibited ERK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways while simultaneously increasing in autophagy in A549 cells in a time dependent manner. This preliminary study demonstrates the effectiveness of the selenium-containing analogs of SAHA, SelSA-1, and SelSA-2, as HDAC inhibitors and provides insight into the improvement and/or development of these analogs as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of lung cancer.
