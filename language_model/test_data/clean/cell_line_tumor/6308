A series of new quinolone-3-carboxylic acids featuring a hydroxyl group at C-5 position were synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro activity against HIV in C8166 cell culture. All the compounds showed anti-HIV-1 activity with low micromolar to submicromolar EC(50) values. The most active compound 2k exhibited activity against wild-type HIV-1 with an EC(50) value of 0.13 μΜ. Preliminary structure-activity relationship of the newly synthesized quinolone analogues was also investigated. Further docking study revealed that the anti-HIV activity of these compounds might involve a two-metal chelating mechanism.
