Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) plays a critical role in cancer metastasis. Andrographolide (AP) is a diterpene lactone in the leaves and stem of Andrographis paniculata (Burm. f) Ness that has been reported to possess anticancer activity. In this study, we investigated the effect of AP on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced MMP-9 expression and invasion in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and the possible mechanisms involved. The results showed that AP dose-dependently inhibited TPA-induced MMP-9 protein expression, enzyme activity, migration and invasion. In addition, AP significantly induced heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression. Transfection with HO-1 small interfering RNA knocked down the HO-1 expression and reversed the inhibition of MMP-9 expression by AP. HO-1 end products, such as carbon monoxide, free iron and bilirubin, suppressed the TPA-induced MMP-9 mRNA and protein expression, enzyme activity, migration and invasion in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, TPA-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and Akt phosphorylation and the DNA binding activity of activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) were attenuated by pretreatment with AP and HO-1 end products. In conclusion, these results suggest that AP inhibits TPA-induced cell migration and invasion by reducing MMP-9 activation, which is mediated mainly by inhibition of the ERK1/2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathways and subsequent AP-1 and NF-κB transactivation. Additionally, induction of HO-1 expression is at least partially involved in the inhibition of TPA-induced MMP-9 activation and cell migration in MCF-7 cells by AP.
