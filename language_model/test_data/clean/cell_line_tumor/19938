Cytoskeletal components play an important role in maintaining cellular architecture and internal organization, with clear involvement of defining cell shape, in cell division and other cellular processes, such as neurite extension and maintenance. Alterations of cytoskeleton in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells after exposure to different concentrations of tri-ocresyl phosphate (TOCP) for 12 hr were investigated. TOCP decreased the cell viability in a dose-dependent manner; the viability of SK-N-SH was reduced to approximately 50% of baseline after a 12-hour exposure to TOCP at high concentration (5 mM). Biochemical characterization by western blotting revealed that 1 and 5 mM concentrations of TOCP significantly inhibited the expression of neurofilament high molecular weight protein (NF-H), and that 5 mM TOCP inhibited expression of microtubule-associated protein 2c and tau protein, but not beta-actin. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis revealed that higher concentrations of TOCP decreased the length of neuritis and changed the structure of microfilaments, which are associated with NF-H. In addition, activities of neuropathy target esterase and acetylcholinesterase were significantly reduced after exposure to 5 mM TOCP for 12 hr. Together, these results suggested that the loss of cytoskeletal components is the early event during the process of TOCP toxicity towards human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells.
