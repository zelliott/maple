Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A. actinomycetemcomitans) is believed to be associated with aggressive periodontitis characterized by a rapid bone loss. A. actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has a similar structure to Escherichia coli LPS, and they are Toll-like receptor 4 agonists. Bone sialoprotein (BSP) is an early marker of osteoblast differentiation. To investigate the effects of A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS on bone formation, we targeted BSP as a marker for osteogenic differentiation and bone formation. BSP mRNA levels were decreased by 0.1 µg/ml and increased by 0.01 µg/ml A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS at 6 h in osteoblast-like ROS17/2.8 cells. In transient transfection analyses, 0.1 µg/ml decreased and 0.01 µg/ml A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS increased luciferase activities of the construct (-116 to +60). Introduction of 2 bp mutations to the constructs showed that the effects of A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS were mediated by a cAMP response element (CRE), a FGF2 response element (FRE), and a homeodomain protein-binding site (HOX). Tyrosine kinase, ERK1/2, and PI3-kinase/Akt participated in the effects of both 0.1 and 0.01 µg/ml A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS. The results of gel shift showed that 0.1 µg/ml decreased while 0.01 µg/ml A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS increased CRE-, FRE-, and HOX-binding protein complexes formation at 6 h, and revealed that 0.01 µg/ml A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS induced BSP transcription through CREB1, JunD, Fra2, c-Fos, Runx2, Dlx5, and Smad1 targeting those response elements. These studies therefore indicated that 0.1 µg/ml suppressed and 0.01 µg/ml A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS increased BSP gene transcription mediated through CRE, FRE, and HOX elements in the rat BSP gene promoter.
