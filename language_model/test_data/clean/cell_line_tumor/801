This study examines differences between cultures of normal human oral epithelial cells and two squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (SCC15 and SCC25) in the expression of structural proteins, adhesion molecules, plasma membrane lipid composition, and intercellular junctions. Based on immunocytochemistry, most normal cell cultures appeared to express more E-cadherin, integrin beta-1, cytokeratin (CK) 14, CK19, and involucrin than SCC cultures. By Western blot analysis, normal cultures expressing high levels of E-cadherin also expressed high levels of involucrin and low levels of CK19. Both SCC cultures demonstrated lower expression of E-cadherin and involucrin, whereas only SCC15 cells showed high levels of CK19. Expression of beta-catenin, an E-cadherin associated protein with potential oncogene function, did not vary among normal and SCC cells. Proportions of saturated fatty acids quantified by thin layer chromatography were higher in the normal cell cultures, than in both SCC cell lines. No morphological differences were evident by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) between normal and SCC cell-cell intercellular junctions. Although no quantitation was attempted, observation suggested that normal cells form more intercellular junctions (TEM observation) and larger intercellular bridges (SEM observation) compared to both SCC cell lines. Of the factors examined, main variations between cultures of normal oral epithelium and the two SCC cell lines examined include the expression of structural and adhesion proteins, lipid composition, and intercellular junctions. The extent of the differences varies according to the stage of terminal differentiation demonstrated by the normal cell cultures.
