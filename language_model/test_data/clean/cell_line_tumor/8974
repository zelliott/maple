To investigate the effects of solanum lyratum Thunberg alkaloid (STA) on induction of apoptosis and the expression of NF-kappaB signaling pathway related genes in A549 cells.

A549 cells was treated with STA in vitro. The proliferation inhibitory effect was evaluated by MTT assay. Induction of cell apoptotic rate was determined by flow cytometry method (FCM) after Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining. The expression of NF-kappaB/p65 in nuclei, Survivin, IkappaBalpha and p-1kaapaBalpha in cytosol were detected by western blot.

STA exhibited strong proliferation inhibitory effect in a dose-and -time-dependent manner against A549 cells. After treated with STA for 24 h, the apoptotic rate was increased significantly. The expression of IkappaBalpha protein was increased markedly,while those of NF-kappaB/p65, Survivin and p-IkappaBalpha proteins were decreased markedly.

STA can induce apoptosis of lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, its mechanisms may be related to inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling pathway.
