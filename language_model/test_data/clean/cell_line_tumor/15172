Metal directed supra molecular assemblies with interesting topologies have been widely used as models for metallo-enzymes and in development of metallo-pharmaceuticals. Two novel tin(II)-oxydiacetate complexes with α-diimine (1,10-phenanthroline or 2,2'-bipyridine) as auxiliary ligand were synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR, (1)H-, (13)C- and (119)Sn-NMR and single crystal X-ray crystallography. The spectral investigations and X-ray data show that {Sn} is hepta coordinated with pentagonal bipyramidal (pbp) geometry of the complexes. The in vitro binding and cleavage studies using CT DNA by UV-visible, fluorescence and agarose gel electrophoresis techniques revealed that both complexes bind DNA via intercalation. The observed magnitudes of Kb for complexes (1) and (2) are 2.517×10(4) and 5.35×10(3), respectively, which suggest that (1) has strong binding affinity for CT DNA as compared to (2). The complexes were tested for antitumor properties and found highly active at 10(-4)M concentration against P388, HL-60 and A-549 cell lines.
