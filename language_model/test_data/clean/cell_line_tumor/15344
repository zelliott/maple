Verrucarin A (VA), a protein synthesis inhibitor, derived from the pathogen fungus Myrothecium verrucaria, inhibits growth of leukemia cell lines and activates caspases and apoptosis and inflammatory signaling in macrophages. We have investigated VA-induced growth inhibition in breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and T47D and, particularly, the mechanism of VA-induced apoptosis. VA treatment brought about apoptotic cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner which was associated with chromatin condensation, cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation and intracellular ROS production. Mitochondrial membrane depolarization, activation of caspase-3, down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression and up-regulation of Bax and p53 expression were observed. VA thus affects the viability of both the breast cancer cells by triggering ROS-mediated intrinsic mechanism of apoptosis.
