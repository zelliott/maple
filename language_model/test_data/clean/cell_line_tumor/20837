This paper reports the synthesis of a number of aminoalkyl derivatives of 8,11-dimethyl-3,5-dioxo-4-azatricyclo[5.2.2.0(2,6)]undec-8-en-1-yl acetate and 1,11 -dimethyl-4-azatricyclo [5.2.2.0(2,6)]undecan-3,5,8-tri-one. Fourteen compounds were prepared and the in vitro cytotoxic activities were evaluated against human cancer cell lines originating from solid tumors in the National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.
