The sensitivity of a large number of antibiotic-resistant and nonresistant Helicobacter pylori isolates to the antiadhesion effect of a high-molecular-mass, nondialysable constituent of cranberry juice was tested. Confluent monolayers of gastric cell line in microtiter plate wells were exposed to bacterial suspensions prepared from 83 H. pylori isolates from antibiotic-treated and untreated patients in the presence and absence of the cranberry constituent. Urease assay was used to calculate the percentage of adhesion inhibition. In two thirds of the isolates, adhesion to the gastric cells was inhibited by 0.2 mg/mL of the nondialysable material. There was no relationship between the antiadhesion effect of the cranberry material and metronidazole resistance in isolates from either treated or untreated patients (N=35). Only 13 isolates (16%) were resistant to both the nondialysable material and metronidazole, and 30 (36%) were resistant to the nondialysable material alone. There was no cross-resistance to the nondialysable material and metronidazole. These data suggest that a combination of antibiotics and a cranberry preparation may improve H. pylori eradication.
