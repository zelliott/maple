Histidine-hyaluronic acid (His-HA) conjugates were synthesized using hyaluronic acid (HA) as a hydrophilic segment and histidine (His) as hydrophobic segment by 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) mediated coupling reactions. The structural characteristics of the His-HA conjugates were investigated using (1)H NMR. His-HA nanoparticles (HH-NPs) were prepared based on His-HA conjugates, and the characteristics of HH-NPs were investigated using dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and fluorescence spectroscopy. The particles were between 342 and 732 nm in size, depending on the degree of substitution (DS) of the His. TEM and SEM images indicated that the morphology of HH-NPs was spherical in shape. The critical aggregation concentrations of HH-NPs ranged from 0.034 to 0.125 mg/ml, which decreased with an increase in the DS of the His. Images of fluorescence microscopy indicate that HH-NPs were taken up by the cancer cell line (MCF-7), and significantly decreased by competition inhibition of free HA. From the cytotoxicity test, it was found that DOX-loaded HH-NPs exhibited similar dose and time-dependent cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cells with free DOX.
