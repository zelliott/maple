The biocompatibility and body distribution of PEGylated polyamine nanogels composed of chemically cross-linked poly(2-N,N-(diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PEAMA) gel cores surrounded by poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains were investigated to evaluate their feasibility as drug nanocarriers for systemic administration. PEGylated nanogels with different cross-linking densities (1, 2, and 5mol.%) were prepared to evaluate their biocompatibilities by in vitro cytotoxicity assay, hemolysis assay, and in vivo acute toxicity assay. The toxic effect of the PEGylated nanogels derived from polyamine gel cores was significantly reduced when the cross-linking density was increased, and those with a cross-linking density of 5mol.% showed a remarkably high median lethal dose (LD(50)) value >200mgkg(-1),despite the abundance of amino groups in the core. One hour after intravenous injection the PEGylated nanogels were found to have been eliminated from the systemic circulation, and less than 1% of the injected dose (ID) remained in the bloodstream. To improve the blood circulation time by increasing the surface PEG density of the PEGylated nanogels post-PEGylation of the PEGylated nanogels (via the Menschutkin reaction between tertiary amines of the PEAMA gel core and bromobenzyl-terminated short PEG) was carried out. A biodistribution study of these post-PEGylated nanogels revealed that the blood circulation time of the nanogels was definitely prolonged as the PEG content was increased. Therefore, the precise design of PEGylated nanogels with increased cross-linking densities in their polyamine gel cores and increased surface PEG densities seems promising for systemic applications.
