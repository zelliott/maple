Hundreds of genes can be regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) under hypoxia. Here we demonstrated a HIF1-mediated induction of protein phosphatase 1, regulatory subunit 3C gene (PPP1R3C) in human MCF7 cells under hypoxia. By mutation analysis we confirmed the presence of a functional hypoxia response element that is located 229bp upstream from the PPP1R3C gene. PPP1R3C induction correlates with a significant glycogen accumulation in MCF7 cells under hypoxia. Knockdown of either HIF1α or PPP1R3C attenuated hypoxia-induced glycogen accumulation significantly. Knockdown of HIF2α reduced hypoxia-induced glycogen accumulation slightly (but not significantly). Our results demonstrated that HIF1 promotes glycogen accumulation through regulating PPP1R3C expression under hypoxia, which revealed a novel metabolic adaptation of cells to hypoxia.
