New series of 3-arylquinoxaline-carbonitrile derivatives have been synthesized from various 5-substituted or 5,6-disubstituted benzofuroxanes and tested for their in vitro and in vivo activity against the erythrocytic development of Plasmodium falciparum strain with different chloroquine-resistance status. Quinoxaline 1,4-dioxide derivatives showed superior antimalarial activity in respect to reduced quinoxaline analogues. The best activity was observed with nonsubstituted quinoxaline 1,4-dioxides in positions 6 and 7 of the aromatic ring and with a hydrogen or chloro substituent in para position of the phenyl group.
