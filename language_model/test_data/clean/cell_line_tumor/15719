In this study, we investigated the mechanism(s) of altered expression of protooncogene SKP2 in metastatic melanoma and its clinical relevance in patients with metastatic melanoma. The genomic status of SKP2 was assessed in cell lines by sequencing, single nucleotide polymorphism array, and genomic PCR. Copy number status was then evaluated for concordance with SKP2 mRNA and protein expression. SKP2 protein was further evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 93 human metastatic tissues. No mutations were identified in SKP2. Increased copy number at the SKP2 locus was observed in 6/14 (43%) metastatic cell lines and in 9/22 (41%) human metastatic tissues which was associated with overexpression of SKP2 protein. Overexpression of SKP2 protein in human tissues was associated with worse survival in a multivariate model controlling for the site of metastasis. Copy number gain is a major contributing mechanism of SKP2 overexpression in metastatic melanoma. Results may have implications for the development of therapeutics that target SKP2.
