Two series of dioscin derivatives (4a-o and 5a-o) with selected modifications at the 6' and 4''' positions of the chacotriosyl residue, respectively, were synthesized. All the 6'-N-acyl-dioscin derivatives did not show considerable inhibitory activities at 10 microM, while most of the 4'''-O-(2-N-acyl)ethyl-dioscin derivatives behaved as potent as dioscin, against the growth of tumor cells.
