To investigate the effect of TFDP3 on prostate cancer cell line LNCaP by transgenic method, and to explore the effect of TFDP3 on regulating the autophay and apoptosis by co-regulation with E2F1.

LNCaP cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-TFDP3, pCMV-E2F1-HA or pcDNA3.1 empty vector.The expression of TFDP3, E2F1 and LC3B were detected by real-time PCR after transfection for 24 h. Western blotting was used to monitor the changes in autophagy-associated protein LC3B, Apoptosis of transfected cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.

The results showed that activation of TFDP3 upregulates the expression of autophagy genes-microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain-3B (LC3B), and E2F1 antagonizes TFDP3-induced autophagy, and TFDP3 can inhibit E2F1-induced apoptosis.

TFDP3 upregulates the expression of autophagy gene LC3B and inhibits E2F1-induced apoptosis, and may play an important role in prostate cancer.
