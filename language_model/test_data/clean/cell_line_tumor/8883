G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) is widely expressed in human breast cancers correlating with increased tumor size and malignancy. Although estrogen signaling via GPER1 was extensively studied in recent years, the underlying molecular mechanism of GPER1-associated metastasis of breast cancer still remains unclear. In this study, the main aims were focused on the potential role of GPER1 in regulating migration and invasion of nuclear estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer cells upon 17β-estradiol (E2) stimulation and the involved signaling pathway. Key events in estrogen signaling were chosen for our studies, such as the activation of ERK and AKT, nuclear translocation of NF-κB and secretion of Interleukin-8 (IL-8). The migration and invasion activities upon E2 stimulation were also examined in ER-negative SKBR3 and BT-20 breast cancer cells. Compared with ER-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells, both SKBR3 and BT-20 cells had very similar expression of GPER1, but relatively high expression of CXC receptor-1 (CXCR1), which is considered as an active regulator for cancer metastasis upon binding IL-8. Results showed that E2 facilitated the activation of ERK, AKT and NF-κB, which could be significantly attenuated by GPER1 blockage or knock-down in both SKBR3 and BT-20 cells. Moreover, increased secretion of IL-8 induced by E2 was also inhibited either by specific inhibitors for GPER1, ERK, AKT, and NF-κB, or by knock-down for GPER1. Furthermore, E2 could activate the migration and invasion of both SKBR3 and BT-20 cells, which in turn could also be inhibited by blocking GPER1, ERK, AKT, NF-κB, and CXCR1, respectively, or knock-down for GPER1 and CXCR1. In conclusion, we demonstrated that estrogen signaling via GPER1 associated with the metastasis of breast cancer, which might be through GPER1/ERK&AKT/NF-κB/IL-8/CXCR1 cascade. The cross-talk between GPER1 and CXCR1 could be another potential target for the therapy of metastatic breast cancer.
