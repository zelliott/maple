Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cell lines are difficult to generate; only nine lines have been described so far and few of them have been thoroughly characterized.

We established MAVER-1, a new MCL cell line, obtained from a leukemic MCL harboring both a t(11;14) translocation and a MYC rearrangement, and used immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, molecular biology and cytogenetic techniques in order to characterize the cell line precisely.

By immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry MAVER-1 displayed a classical MCL phenotype (IgM+, l+, CD5+, CD10-, CD19+, CD20+, CD23-, CD79a+, cyclin D1+) and genetic analysis showed a typical V/D/J rearrangement with na√Øve mutational status. According to both classic cytogenetic analysis and spectral karyotyping, MAVER-1 harbored the t(11;14) translocation associated with a complex karyotype. Molecular analysis by polymerase chain reactions showed that the t(11;14) breakpoint is within the major translocation cluster. Other important abnormalities of MAVER-1 include TP53 gene inactivation by a combined mutation of exon 8 and chromosome 17p13 deletion, ATM deletion, 8q24 (MYC) rearrangement and 8p22 deletion.

The new cell line will be useful for in vitro studies regarding MCL pathogenesis and drug sensitivity, as well as a diagnostic control material.
