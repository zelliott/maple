To investigate whether the heat shock protein (HSP) 70 antisense oligomers can enhance the sensitivity of bladder cancer cell EJ to mitomycin C.

The HSP70 mRNA of EJ cells was blocked by the 10 micromol/L HSP70 antisense oligomers, while its effect on cell growth was evaluated by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) and colony forming ability test.

The HSP70 expressions in HSP70 antisense treated group were lower than the corresponding sense and nonsense treated groups (P < 0.01). While, the increased sensitivity of EJ to mitomycin C was found in antisense treated group, compared with the corresponding sense and nonsense treated groups (P < 0.01).

The sensitivity of bladder cancer cell EJ to mitomycin C was enhanced by the blockage of the HSP70 expression.
