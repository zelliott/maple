SMC1A is a member of cohesin complex which has essential functions in cell cycle progression and DNA repair. Therefore, we choose SMC1A as a target gene therapy of glioblastoma. It is well known that glioblastoma has very low survival rate because of ineffectiveness of conventional treatments. This study was designed to explore the possibilities of small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated SMC1A silencing as alternative method of treatment. We found that the lentivirus-mediated RNAi system efficiently decreased the expression level of SMC1A. Inhibiting SMC1A expression efficiently (P < 0.001) resulted in inhibiting the proliferation and colony formation of U251 and U87MG cells. Moreover, we found that SMC1A silencing led to S cell-cycle arresting. Collectively, these results demonstrated the possibility of siRNA-mediated silencing of SMC1A as a therapeutic tool for the treatment of glioblastoma.
