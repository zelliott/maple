5-HMF is widely presented in foods and produced through the degradation of hexoses and Maillard reaction during heat treatment of foods containing reducing sugars and amino acids in an acid environment. However, controversial conclusions on the biological effects of 5-HMF have been drawn in previous studies. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to investigate the antioxidant and antiproliferative activities of 5-HMF. The 2,2'-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazolin-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) assay, the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, and the hemolysis assay induced by 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) were performed to evaluate the antioxidant capacity of 5-HMF. The results showed that 5-HMF exhibited novel antioxidant activity by scavenging the ABTS and DPPH free radicals and inhibited the AAPH-induced hemolysis in a dose-dependent manner. In the hemolysis assay, the reduction of ROS and MDA contents and the increase in enzyme activities of SOD, CAT, and GPx were found in erythrocytes pretreated with 5-HMF, which demonstrated that 5-HMF could prevent the peroxidation from the source to protect the erythrocytes. The morphological changes of erythrocytes was also verified by observation using atomic force microscopy. The inhibitory effect of 5-HMF on human cancer cell proliferation was investigated by MTT assay, flow cytometric analysis, and the TUNEL and DAPI costaining assay. The results showed that 5-HMF displayed higher antiproliferative activity on human melanoma A375 cells than other cell lines. Further investigation on the action mechanisms revealed that 5-HMF could induce A375 cell apoptosis and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. The A375 cell apoptosis that 5-HMF induced was characterized by a TUNEL and DAPI costaining assay. These findings suggest that 5-HMF could be developed as a novel natural antioxidant with potential applications in cancer chemoprevention.
