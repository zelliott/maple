Chemotherapy is one of the therapeutic strategies that has been used for the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation in several types of cancer, including prostate cancer. Although monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, phytoestrogen and antioxidants used in chemotherapy have been systematically studied, their effects on cancer cell growth remain to be fully understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the MAO inhibitors, pargyline and tranylcypromine on cell survival in human prostate carcinoma (LNCaP-LN3) cells. After treating LNCaP-LN3 cells with pargyline or tranylcypromine, we examined cell proliferation, cell cycle pattern, apoptosis and the expression levels of apoptosis-related genes. The proliferation of cells exposed to pargyline decreased in a dose- and time-dependent manner, while tranylcypromine-treated cells showed the opposite results. Treatment with pargyline significantly induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase compared to the control and tranylcypromine-treated cells. In addition, pargyline induced an increase in the cell death rate by promoting apoptosis; however, tranylcypromine had no effect on LNCaP-LN3 cells. Based on our results, we suggest that pargyline is more powerful than tranylcypromine for the treatment of human prostate cancer.
