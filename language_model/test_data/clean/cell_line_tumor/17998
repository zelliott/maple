p53, one of the most commonly mutated genes in human cancers, is thought to be associated with cancer development. Hence, screening and identifying natural or synthetic compounds with anti-cancer activity via p53-independent pathway is one of the most challenging tasks for scientists in this field. Compound JKA97 (methoxy-1-styryl-9H-pyrid-[3,4-b]-indole) is a small molecule synthetic anti-cancer agent, with unknown mechanism(s). In this study we have demonstrated that the anti-cancer activity of JKA97 is associated with apoptotic induction via p53-independent mechanisms. We found that co-incubation of human colon cancer HCT116 cells with JKA97 inhibited HCT116 cell anchorage-independent growth in vitro and tumorigenicity in nude mice and also induced a cell apoptotic response, both in the cell culture model and in a tumorigenesis nude mouse model. Further studies showed that JKA97-induced apoptosis was dramatically impaired in Bax knock-out (Bax(-/-)) HCT116 cells, whereas the knock-out of p53 or PUMA did not show any inhibitory effects. The p53-independent apoptotic induction by JKA97 was confirmed in other colon cancer and hepatocarcinoma cell lines. In addition, our results showed an induction of Bax translocation and cytochrome c release from the mitochondria to the cytosol in HCT116 cells, demonstrating that the compound induces apoptosis through a Bax-initiated mitochondria-dependent pathway. These studies provide a molecular basis for the therapeutic application of JKA97 against human cancers with p53 mutations.
