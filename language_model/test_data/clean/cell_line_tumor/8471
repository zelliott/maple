A series of mono- and multimeric 4-amino-7-chloroquinoline and ferrocenyl thioureas have been prepared by the reaction of a 7-chloroquinoline methyl ester and a ferrocenylimine methyl ester with various amines. These compounds were characterized using standard spectroscopic and analytical techniques. The compounds were evaluated against the NF54 (CQ-sensitive) and Dd2 (CQ-resistant) strains of Plasmodium falciparum. The quinoline compounds show enhanced activity compared to the ferrocene compounds against this parasite. Compound 5 displays the most promising activity against the NF54 strain. Compounds 5 and 6 are effective at inhibiting β-hematin formation perhaps due to an increased number of quinoline moieties. The trimeric (12) and tetrameric (13) ferrocenyl compounds also inhibit β-hematin formation, albeit to a lesser degree compared to the quinoline thioureas. The compounds were also screened against the G3 strain of Trichomonas vaginalis and here the ferrocene-containing compounds show a slightly higher parasite growth inhibition compared to the quinoline thioureas. The quinoline compounds were also found to be more cytotoxic compared to the ferrocenyl compounds. Compound 6 displays good cytotoxicity against WHCO1 oesophageal cancer cells.
