Accumulation of intra- and/or extracellular misfolded proteins as amyloid fibrils is a key hallmark in more than 20 amyloid-related diseases. In that respect, blocking or reversing amyloid aggregation via the use of small compounds is considered as two useful approaches in hampering the development of these diseases. In this research, we have studied the ability of different manganese-salen derivatives to inhibit amyloid self-assembly as well as to dissolve amyloid aggregates of hen egg-white lysozyme, as an in vitro model system, with the aim of investigating their structure-activity relationships. By coupling several techniques such as thioflavin T and anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid fluorescence, congo red absorbance, far-UV circular dichroism, and transmission electron microscopy, we demonstrated that all compounds possessed anti-amyloidogenic activities and were capable of dispersing the fibrillar aggregates. In addition, MTT assay of the treated SK-N-MC cells with the preformed fibrils formed in the presence of compounds at a drug-to-protein molar ratio of 5:1, indicated a significant increase in the viability of cells, compared to the fibrils formed in the absence of each of the compounds. Our spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and cellular studies indicated that EUK-15, with a methoxy group at the para position (group R(5)), had higher activity to either inhibit or disrupt the Î²-sheet structures relative to other compounds. On the basis of these results, it can be concluded that in addition to aromatic rings of each of the derivatives, the type and position of the side group(s) contribute to lower lysozyme fibril accumulation.
