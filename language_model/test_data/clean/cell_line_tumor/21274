The poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer and poor sensitivity to current therapeutics, associated with resistance to apoptosis, urge the search for new drugs. We previously described the induction of caspase-independent mithochondrial death in leukemia cells by Bobel-24 (AM-24) and derivatives. Here, we explored whether these compounds induce a similar cytotoxicity in human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines (NP18, NP9, NP31, and NP29). Bobel-24 or Bobel-16 induced cytotoxicity and DNA synthesis inhibition in all cell lines and apoptosis in all lines, except for NP9. Caspase and/or poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activity inhibition experiments showed that cytotoxicity was mainly induced through apoptosis in NP18 and through a caspase-independent process in NP9. Moreover, in NP29 or NP31 cell lines, both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent cell death mechanisms coexisted. Cell death was associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial depolarization, cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) release, AIF nuclear translocation, and lysosomal cathepsin release. Inhibition of ROS production, mitochondrial pore permeability, PARP-1, or phospholipase A2 partially prevented cell death. Moreover, cathepsin B inhibition or down-regulation by small interfering RNA partially blocked cell death. In conclusion, Bobel-24 and derivatives trigger caspase-independent lysosomal and mitochondrial death in all tested human pancreatic cancer lines, irrespective of their degree of apoptotic sensitivity, becoming the only active cytotoxic mechanism in the apoptosis-resistant NP9 line. This mechanism may overcome the resistance to apoptosis observed in pancreatic carcinoma when treated with current genotoxic drugs.
