PGE2 is involved in initiation and progression of labor in many species. Biosynthesis of PGE2 is mediated by cyclooxygenases (COX) and prostaglandin E synthases (PGES). mPGES-1 and COX-2 form an inducible pathway for PGE2 production in many cell systems. In this study we investigated whether mPGES-1 is involved in cytokine induced PGE2 biosynthesis in human trophoblast cells. We have evaluated the cellular and intracellular co-localization of mPGES-1 and COX-2, as well as cPGES and COX-1 in human trophoblast cells by dual immunofluorescent staining. The effect of IL-1beta on mPGES-1 and COX-2 co-localization, such as would occur with infection, and the regulatory effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha on transcriptional activity of mPGES-1 and COX-2 in these cells were also studied. We found that in cultured unstimulated trophoblasts, some cells expressed predominantly either mPGES-1 or COX-2, though there were cells co-expressing both enzymes. With IL-1beta treatment, mPGES-1 and COX-2 became more consistently co-localized. mPGES-1 was not transcriptionally co-induced with COX-2 by the cytokine treatment. We conclude that mPGES-1 is not involved in the inducible COX-2 mediated pathway for PGE2 biosynthesis at the transcriptional level, however, the treatment with IL-1beta results in a higher degree of co-ordination of the mPGES-1 and COX-2 protein immunolocalization, eliciting PGE2 synthesis.
