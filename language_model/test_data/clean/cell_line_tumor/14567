PI3 kinase (PI3K), Akt and MAP kinase (MAPK) pathways are central to many classical signaling cascades and are often de-regulated in many cancers. Due to this, inhibitors for a number of key signaling molecules in these pathways such as PI3K, Akt, mTOR, Raf and ERK are currently in clinical trials. In the current study, we investigated the effects of specific inhibition of these signaling molecules, alone or in combinations, on prostate cancer cells. Our study showed that integration of Akt-mTOR and MAPK signaling by PI3K was essential for the EGF-stimulated TRAMP cell migration, proliferation, survival and invasion as well as PC3 and LNCaP C4-2 (C4-2) colony/foci formation. Adenovirus-mediated expression of constitutively active Akt (Ad-myrAkt) in PC3 cells resulted in significant increase in number of foci. Even though PI3K inhibition significantly reduced foci formed by C4-2 cells, none of the Akt, ERK or mTOR inhibitors showed any significant inhibition. This indicated that functional redundancies and/or feed back loops between Akt-mTOR and MAPK signaling exist in prostate cancer. Further studies on cotargeting these signaling molecules revealed that combined inhibition of Akt (or mTOR) and ERK, but not Akt and mTOR, resulted in significant reduction in number of foci formed by the C4-2 cells. Overall, our study demonstrated that the effects of PI3K-mediated prostate cancer growth necessitates a synergism between the Akt and MAPK pathways and suggests cotargeting Akt (or mTOR) and MAPK as an effective method for prostate cancer therapeutic interventions.
