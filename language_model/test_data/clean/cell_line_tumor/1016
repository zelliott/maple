Cdt1 is a licensing factor for DNA replication, the function of which is tightly controlled to maintain genome integrity. Previous studies have indicated that the cell cycle-dependent degradation of Cdt1 is triggered at S phase to prevent re-replication. In this study, we found that Cdt1 is degraded upon DNA damage induced by either UV treatment or gamma-irradiation (IR). Although the IR-triggered degradation of Cdt1 was caffeine-insensitive, the UV-triggered degradation of Cdt1 was caffeine-sensitive. This indicates that the cells treated with UV utilize the checkpoint pathway, which differs from that triggered by IR. A recent study has suggested that Cdt1 is phosphorylated, ubiquitylated, and degraded at the G(1)/S boundary in the normal cell cycle. Treatment with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, inhibited the degradation of Cdt1 and resulted in the accumulation of the phosphorylated form of Cdt1 after UV treatment. In the case of UV treatment, phosphorylation of Cdt1 induced the recruitment of Cdt1 to a SCF(Skp2) complex. Moreover, ectopic overexpression of Cdt1 after UV treatment interfered the inhibition of DNA synthesis. These results indicate that Cdt1 is a target molecule of the cell cycle checkpoint in UV-induced DNA damage.
