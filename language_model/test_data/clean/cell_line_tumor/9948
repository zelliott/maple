The present work deals with the anticancer effect of benzimidazole derivatives associated with the pyridine framework. By varying the functional group at N-terminal of the benzimidazole by different L-amino acids, several 2-(4-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)-3-methylpyridin-2-ylthio)-1Hbenzo[d]imidazole derivatives 9(a-j) were synthesized. Their chemical structures were confirmed by (1)H NMR, IR and mass spectroscopic techniques. The synthesized compounds were examined for their antiproliferative effects against human leukemia cell lines, K562 and CEM. The preliminary results showed most of the derivatives had moderate antitumor activity. Compound 9j containing cysteine residue exhibited good inhibition compared to other amino acid resides. In addition DNA fragmentation results suggest that 9j is more cytotoxic and able to induce apoptosis.
