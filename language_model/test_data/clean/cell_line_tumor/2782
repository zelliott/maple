Although a loss-of-function type mutation was identified in familial Parkinson's disease PARK7, the wild-type of DJ-1 is known to act as an oxidative stress sensor in neuronal cells. Recently, we found a DJ-1 modulator UCP0054278 by in silico virtual screening. In this study, we determined the neuroprotective effects of UCP0054278 against focal ischemia-induced neurodegeneration in rats. Hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death and the production of reactive oxygen species were significantly inhibited by UCP0054278 in normal SH-SY5Y cells, but not in DJ-1-knockdown cells. These results suggest that UCP0054278 interacts with endogenous DJ-1 and then exhibits antioxidant and neuroprotective responses.
