Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is an undifferentiated, aggressive malignancy, for which there are no effective therapies. Though ATCs only make up less than 2% of all thyroid cancer cases, they represent over half of the thyroid cancer-related deaths. Chrysin, a natural flavonoid, has recently been reported as a potential anti-cancer agent. However, the effect of this compound on ATC cells is not known. Thus, in this study, we evaluated the antiproliferative nature of chrysin in ATC cells.

HTH7 and KAT18 cells, derived from patients with ATC, were treated with chrysin (25-50 Î¼M) for up to 6 d. Cell proliferation was measured every 2 d using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). Western blot analysis for molecular makers of apoptosis was carried out to investigate the effect and mechanism of Chrysin on ATC.

Chrysin inhibited proliferation of HTH7 and KAT18 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. HTH7 and KAT18 cells with Chrysin treatment showed a significant increase in cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PolyADP Ribose Polymerase (PARP), along with a decrease in cyclin D1, Mcl-1, and XIAP. Furthermore, the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 expression in ATC cells revealed an increase after the treatment.

Chrysin inhibits growth in ATC cells via apoptosis in vitro. Therefore, the natural flavonoid chrysin warrants further clinical investigation as a new potential drug for the treatment for ATC.
