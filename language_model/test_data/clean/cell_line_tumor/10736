Ya-Ba, a combination of the two potent psychostimulants methamphetamine (METH) and caffeine (CAF), is commonly used by drug abusers in Thailand and neighboring countries. While the neurotoxic effects of METH are well documented, the toxicity of this combination is mostly unknown. This study aimed to elucidate the effects of this particular drug combination using both in vitro and in vivo models. We found that combined treatment of METH and CAF at individually non-toxic concentrations significantly decreased viability of human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. The reduction in cell survival was accompanied by an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. In vivo data showed that combined administration of METH and CAF increased the mortality rate of rats, with an increase in the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), the indicator of oxidative stress, in striatal tissues. The results indicate that caffeine potentiates the toxic effects of methamphetamine, possibly via a mechanism involving an increase in dopamine release and excess ROS generation.
