MiR-206 was involved in a series of cellular activities, such as the growth and development of skeletal muscle and the tumorigenesis. MiR-206 was characterized previously as a differentially expressed gene in sodium arsenite (SA)-induced neural tube defects (NTDs) in chick embryos via miRNA microarray analysis. However, the role of miR-206 in the pathological process of nerve cells remained elusive. In this study we found differential expression of miR-206 in SA-treated chick embryos by Northern blot analysis. Ectopic expression of miR-206 inhibited cell proliferation, and promoted cell apoptosis in U343 and SK-N-SH cell by using MTT, Edu Apollo assay and Flow cytometry analysis. Further investigation revealed that miR-206 can interact with 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of Otx2. MiR-206 mimics down-regulated the endogeneous Otx2 expression, whereas the miR-206 inhibitor obviously up-regulated the expression of Otx2. These findings indicate that overexpression of miR-206 promotes cell apoptosis and low expression of miR-206 inhibits cell apoptosis. Otx2 may play an important role in the process of miR-206-mediated cell apoptosis.
