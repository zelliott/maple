Oxovanadium (IV) complexes of the alpha-hydroxycarboxylic ligands D-gluconic and D-saccharic acids of stoichiometry Na(2)[VO(gluconate)(2)].H(2)O, K(2)[VO(saccharate)(2)].4H(2)O, Na(4)[VO(gluconate)(2)].2H(2)O and K(5)[VO(saccharate)(2)].4H(2)O were obtained in aqueous solutions; the first two in acid, the other two in alkaline media. They were characterized by infrared and UV-Vis spectroscopies, thermoanalytical (thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis) data and magnetic susceptibility measurements. The complexes were found to be mononuclear, possessing the VO(2+) moiety, and the thorough analysis of the spectral data allowed the determination of the characteristics of the metal-to-ligand interactions. The biological activities of these complexes on the proliferation, differentiation and glucose consumption were tested on osteoblast-like cells in culture. Comparisons of these effects and those of the oxovanadium (IV) cation and the free ligands were performed. Different behaviors could be observed for the complexes obtained at acidic or alkaline pH-values, as well as for the different cellular types. The free ligands did not show any biological effect.
