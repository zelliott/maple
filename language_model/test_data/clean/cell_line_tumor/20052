Osteosarcoma is a malignant bone tumor which is found most commonly in adolescents             and young adults. Local perfusion thermochemotherapy has long been proposed as             an alternative strategy for the treatment of osteosarcoma. As a standard anticancer             drug, paclitaxel plays a significant role in the treatment of a number of tumors;             however, little is known concerning its ability to promote thermochemotherapy.             The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of a combination of             paclitaxel and etoposide on an osteosarcoma cell line in the presence of hyperthermia             and to investigate the related mechanism. Our study indicated that 1 h after the             application of a combination of 10 µg/ml paclitaxel and 5 µg/ml etoposide to OS732             cells at 43˚C, the survival rate of the cells was 14.52% which was significantly             lower than when either 10 µg/ml paclitaxel (45.83%) or 5 µg/ml etoposide (43.31%)             was applied alone ( p<0.01). Moreover, changes in cellular morphology and apoptotic             rates indicated that the apoptosis-inducing effect of the combination was much             stronger than that of either drug applied individually. Fas expression levels             in the OS732 cells were increased by the combination of paclitaxel and etoposide             in the presence of hyperthermia. Therefore, paclitaxel enhances the thermochemotherapy             of the osteosarcoma cell line and this is primarily accomplished by the upregulation             of Fas expression and the induction of apoptosis.
