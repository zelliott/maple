Insulin is a potent inducer of global mRNA translation and protein synthesis, yet it negatively regulates apolipoprotein B (apoB) mRNA translation, via an unknown mechanism. ApoB mRNA has a long half-life of 16 h, suggesting intracellular storage as mRNPs likely in the form of RNA granules. The availability of apoB mRNA for translation may be regulated by the rate of release from translationally silenced mRNPs within cytoplasmic foci called processing bodies (P bodies). In this report, we directly imaged intracellular apoB mRNA traffic and determined whether insulin silences apoB mRNA translation by entering cytoplasmic P bodies. We assessed the colocalization of apoB mRNA and β-globin mRNA (as a control) with P body (PB) markers using a strong interaction between the bacteriophage capsid protein MS2 and a sequence specific RNA stem-loop structure. We observed statistically significant increases in the localization of apoB mRNA into P bodies 4-16 h after insulin treatment (by 72-89%). The movement of apoB mRNA into cytoplasmic P bodies correlated with reduced translational efficiency as assessed by polysomal profiling and measurement of apoB mRNA abundance. PB localization of β-globin mRNA was insensitive to insulin treatment, suggesting selective regulation of apoB mRNA by insulin. Overall, our data suggest that insulin may specifically silence apoB mRNA translation by reprogramming its mRNA into P bodies and reducing the size of translationally competent mRNA pools. Translational control via traffic into cytoplasmic RNA granules may be an important mechanism for controlling the rate of apoB synthesis and hepatic lipoprotein production.
