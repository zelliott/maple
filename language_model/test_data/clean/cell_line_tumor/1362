We have recently reported that Ras acts as an intermediate coactivator in IL-1β-mediated hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) activation in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Since HIF-1α plays a crucial role in linking inflammatory and oncogenic pathways, we investigated whether this IL1β-Ras-HIF-1α signaling axis observed in GBM also exists in other tumors of diverse origin under normoxia. Treatment with IL-1β induced Ras in non-GBM cell lines A549 (lung), HeLa (cervical), and HepG2 (liver), and inhibition of Ras activity attenuated HIF-1α activity. Our findings suggest that Ras links IL-1β and HIF-1α in tumors of diverse origin. As we have previously reported that the farnesyltransferase inhibitor manumycin decreases Ras activity in glioma cells, we investigated whether manumycin could regulate IL-1β-mediated HIF-1α activation. Manumycin abrogated IL-1β-induced HIF-1α activation in both glioma and non-glioma tumor cells. In addition, manumycin also decreased IL-1β induced pro-inflammatory responses in tumor cells.
