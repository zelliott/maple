In advanced breast cancer, bone metastases occur in 70 % of patients. Managing the devastating pain associated with the disease is difficult. Rapamycin is an immunomodulatory drug that targets the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. Rapamycin has been shown to decrease osteolysis associated with metastatic breast cancer in pre-clinical models and to reduce pain in inflammatory and neuropathic models. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of rapamycin in reducing pain associated with experimental osteolytic metastases. Bone cancer was induced by intra-tibial injections of murine mammary carcinoma cells (4T1) in immunocompetent BALB/c mice and treated intraperitoneally for up to 5 weeks with vehicle, rapamycin or pamidronate (a bisphosphonate currently used to reduce bone loss in bone cancer patients). The control group received intra-tibial injection with saline (sham) and was treated with vehicle intraperitoneally. Cancer-induced osteolysis was observed histologically and radiographically 2-3 weeks following cancer inoculation and gradually increased with time. Measures of evoked nociceptive behaviors including sensitivity to mechanical, thermal, and cold stimuli and spontaneous nociceptive behaviors (limping, guarding) were evaluated. Significant hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli developed in cancer-bearing mice compared to sham 3 weeks following inoculation. Rapamycin decreased or delayed the development of cancer-induced mechanical, heat, and cold hypersensitivity, while pamidronate reduced heat and cold hypersensitivity. Both rapamycin and pamidronate had a partial protective effect on the spontaneous nociceptive behaviors, limping and guarding. Our data suggest that rapamycin may have efficacy in the management of pain associated with metastatic breast cancer.
