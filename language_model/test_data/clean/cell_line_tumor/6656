In recent years, genistein has received considerable attention because epidemiologic studies showed that consumption of soybean-containing diets was associated with a lower incidence of certain human cancers in Asian populations. In vitro studies further showed that such chemopreventive and antineoplastic effects were associated with the antioxidant activity of genistein and inhibitor activities on cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Genistein was shown to arrest the growth of malignant melanoma in vitro and to inhibit ultraviolet (UV) light-induced oxidative DNA damage. Recently, it has been demonstrated that genistin, as other flavonoid glycosides, is partly absorbed without previous cleavage and does not have to be hydrolyzed to be biologically active. Therefore, not only isoflavone aglycons, but also glycosides can be of physiological relevance. In the present study, we evaluated in cell-free systems the effect of genistin and daidzin on pBR322 DNA cleavage induced by hydroxyl radicals, generated from UV photolysis of hydrogen peroxide, and their superoxide anion scavenging capacity. In addition, we investigated the growth inhibitory activity of these isoflavones against human melanoma cell line (M14). Under our experimental conditions, genistin and daidzin showed a protective effect on DNA damage and exhibited a superoxide dismutase-like effect, but only genistin was able to reduce significantly the vitality of M14 cells, confirming the importance of the 5,7-dihydroxy structure in the A ring. These results suggest that also genistin, due to its antioxidant and anticarcinogenic properties, contributes to the overall biological activity of soy and could have promising applications in the field of dermatology.
