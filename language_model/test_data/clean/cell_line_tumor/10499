The nonviral vector with iodine-nuclear localization sequence (namely, NLS-I) targeting breast cancer cells was fabricated. Ternary complexes were formed via charge interactions among NLS-I peptides, PEI 1800, and DNA, and we investigated their cellular internalization, nuclear accumulation as well as transfection efficiency. All the experiments were assessed by employing MCF-7 cells that express sodium/iodide symporter and HeLa cells that lack the expression of the symporter. In MCF-7 cells, cell internalization and nuclear accumulation of NLS-I was markedly increased compared to that in NLS. In addition, compared to that of the PEI1800/DNA complex, PEI1800/DNA/NLS-I complexes exhibited much enhanced luciferase reporter gene expression by up to 130-fold. By contrast, in HeLa cells, the evident improvements of cellular internalization, nuclear accumulation, and transfection efficiency by NLS-I were not observed. This study demonstrates an alternative method to construct a nonviral delivery system for targeted gene transfer into breast cancer cells.
