Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by various factors such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), dysfunction of mitochondria, and aggregation of misfolded proteins, thereby leading to loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) of the brain. Frataxin (FXN) is associated with iron homeostasis and biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters in the electron transport chain complex. In this study, we investigated the potential of Tat-FXN to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and protect DA neurons against oxidative stress in a mouse model of PD. Tat-FXN was effectively transduced into SH-SY5Y cells and blocked production of ROS and cleavage of DNA, significantly improving cell survival against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium induced toxicity. In addition, Tat-FXN efficiently penetrated the BBB and exhibited a clear neuroprotective effect on tyrosine hydroxylase-specific DA neurons in the SN in a mice model of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetra-hydropyridine-induced PD. Therefore, these results suggest that Tat-FXN may provide neuroprotective therapy for ROS related diseases including PD.
