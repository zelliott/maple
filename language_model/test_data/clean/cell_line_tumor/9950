Cimiside E was isolated from the Cimicifuga heracleifolia Komarov extract, which has been previously demonstrated to possess apoptotic action on gastric cancer cells. The IC(50) value of cimiside E on gastric cancer cells for 24 h was 14.58 microM. The mechanism of apoptosis was further elucidated through western blot, RT-PCR, morphology, Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and cell cycle analysis. Cell cycle arrest was induced by cimiside E in S phase at a lower concentration (30 microM) and G2/M phase at higher concentrations (60 and 90 microM). Cimiside E mediated apoptosis through the induction of the caspase cascade for both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. These findings suggest that cimiside E may be an effective chemopreventive agent against cancer.
