After isolating NT-S100A8 from pancreatic cancer (PC) tissue of diabetic patients, we verified whether this peptide alters PC cell growth and invasion and/or insulin release and [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations of insulin secreting cells and/or insulin signaling. BxPC3, Capan1, MiaPaCa2, Panc1 (PC cell lines) cell growth, and invasion were assessed in the absence or presence of 50, 200, and 500 nM NT-S100A8. In NT-S100A8 stimulated β-TC6 (insulinoma cell line) culture medium, insulin and [Ca(2+)] were measured at 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 min, and [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations were monitored (epifluorescence) for 3 min. Five hundred nanomolars NT-S100A8 stimulated BxPC3 cell growth only and dose dependently reduced MiaPaCa2 and Panc1 invasion. Five hundred nanomolars NT-S100A8 induced a rapid insulin release and enhanced β-TC6 [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations after both one (F = 6.05, p < 0.01) and 2 min (F = 7.42, p < 0.01). In the presence of NT-S100A8, [Ca(2+)] in β-TC6 culture medium significantly decreased with respect to control cells (F = 6.3, p < 0.01). NT-S100A8 did not counteract insulin induced phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, Akt and IκB-α, but it independently activated Akt and NF-κB signaling in PC cells. In conclusion, NT-S100A8 exerts a mild effect on PC cell growth, while it reduces PC cell invasion, possibly by Akt and NF-κB signaling, NT-S100A8 enhances [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations and insulin release, probably by inducing Ca(2+) influx from the extracellular space, but it does not interfere with insulin signaling.
