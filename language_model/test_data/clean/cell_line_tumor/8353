Doxorubicin was chemically conjugated to acrylated chitosan in order to obtain sustained-release profiles of doxorubicin from thermo-responsive and photo-crosslinkable hydrogels. Chitooligosaccharide was acrylated with glycidyl methacrylate and subsequently conjugated to doxorubicin via an amide linkage. A mixture of doxorubicin-chitosan conjugates, acrylated Pluronic, and doxorubicin formed physical gels at 37 degrees C. Photo-irradiation was subsequently performed to chemically crosslink the physical hydrogel at 37 degrees C. Chitooligosaccharide-doxorubicin conjugates in the doxorubicin hydrogels significantly reduced burst release of free doxorubicin from doxorubicin hydrogels compared hydrogels without the conjugates. Upon incubating doxorubicin hydrogels at 37 degrees C, chitosan-doxorubicin conjugates were confirmed to be degraded into more hydrophilic oligomers by reversed-phase chromatography. In vitro cytotoxicity assay using released media from doxorubicin hydrogels showed that degraded chitosan-doxorubicin had cytotoxicity comparable to free doxorubicin. Athymic nude mice bearing human lung adenocarcinoma were subjected to intra-tumoral injections of physical hydrogels. After photo-crosslinking injected hydrogels using surgical catheters, tumor sizes, body weights, and survivals were measured for 1 month. Released media from doxorubicin hydrogels exerted similar cytotoxicities to free doxorubicin, and the tumor volume was significantly reduced for 1 month compared to other samples. Thus, doxorubicin hydrogels containing doxorubicin conjugates can be employed as a novel injectable anti-cancer drug aiming to achieve sustained release of doxorubicin for several weeks against solid tumors.
