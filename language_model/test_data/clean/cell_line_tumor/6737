Isoxazolidinyl polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (isoxazolidinyl-PAHs) have been synthesized in good yields by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition methodology promoted by microwave irradiation. The structures of the obtained cycloadducts have been determined by NOE experiments and supported by computational studies at the AM1 level. The cytotoxicity and antiviral activity of the synthesized compounds have been investigated. In particular, compounds 7c and 7e show high levels of cytotoxicity on MOLT-3 leukemia cells; 7e exerts a remarkable enhancing activity on apoptosis caused by anti-fas antibody addition. Furthermore, compounds 7b and 8b exhibit specific antiviral effects against the Punta Toro virus.
