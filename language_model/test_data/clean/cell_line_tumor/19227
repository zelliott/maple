Recent studies have demonstrated that aldo-keto reductase family 1 B10 (AKR1B10), a novel protein overexpressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma and non-small cell lung carcinoma, may facilitate cancer cell growth by detoxifying intracellular reactive carbonyls. This study presents a novel function of AKR1B10 in tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells (RAO-3), regulating fatty acid synthesis. In RAO-3 cells, Sephacryl-S 300 gel filtration and DEAE-Sepharose ion exchange chromatography demonstrated that AKR1B10 exists in two distinct forms, monomers (approximately 40 kDa) bound to DEAE-Sepharose column and protein complexes (approximately 300 kDa) remaining in flow-through. Co-immunoprecipitation with AKR1B10 antibody and protein mass spectrometry analysis identified that AKR1B10 associates with acetyl-CoA carboxylase-alpha (ACCA), a rate-limiting enzyme of de novo fatty acid synthesis. This association between AKR1B10 and ACCA proteins was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation with ACCA antibody and pulldown assays with recombinant AKR1B10 protein. Intracellular fluorescent studies showed that AKR1B10 and ACCA proteins co-localize in the cytoplasm of RAO-3 cells. More interestingly, small interfering RNA-mediated AKR1B10 knock down increased ACCA degradation through ubiquitination-proteasome pathway and resulted in >50% decrease of fatty acid synthesis in RAO-3 cells. These data suggest that AKR1B10 is a novel regulator of the biosynthesis of fatty acid, an essential component of the cell membrane, in breast cancer cells.
