Chromosomal translocation t (8;21)(q22;22) is one of the most frequent cytogenetic abnormalities found in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). It generates the AML1/ETO fusion gene, which itself supports human haematopoietic stem cell self-renewal. However, the mechanism guiding transcription of this chimeric gene remains unclear. In our work, we attempted to shed light on this essential issue. We investigated the promoter from which transcription of the AML1/ETO gene is initiated and defined the three-dimensional structure of the whole rearranged locus.
