Two new flavone derivatives (1 and 2) were isolated from the aerial parts of Macrothelypteris torresiana, along with four known flavonoids: protoapigenin, apigenin, kaempferol and quercetin. The structures were determined on the basis of spectroscopic data. Compound 1 showed weak cytotoxic activity against human tumour cell lines HepG₂ , MCF₇ and K562.
