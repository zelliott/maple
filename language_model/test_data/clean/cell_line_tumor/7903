Chemical investigation of field-collected fruit bodies of the myxomycete Cribraria meylanii resulted in the isolation of a naphthoquinone pigment, cribrarione C, and its structure was elucidated by spectral data as 2,5,6,7-tetrahydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (1). This compound (1) had been synthesized previously, while it was isolated here for the first time as a natural product, and its NMR and MS data are described in this study.
