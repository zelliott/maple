A 15-membered macrolide, iriomoteolide-3a (1), with an allyl epoxide has been isolated from a marine benthic dinoflagellate Amphidinium sp. (strain HYA024), and the structure was assigned by detailed analyses of 2D NMR data. Relative and absolute configurations were elucidated on the basis of conformational studies of 1 and its acetonide (2) and modified Mosher's method of 1, respectively. Iriomoteolide-3a (1) and the acetonide (2) exhibited potently cytotoxic activity against antitumor cells.
