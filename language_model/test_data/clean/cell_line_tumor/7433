Different mechanisms of drug resistance, including ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, are responsible for treatment failure of tumors. We developed a low-density DNA microarray which contains 38 genes of the ABC transporter gene family. This tool has been validated with three different multidrug-resistant sublines (CEM/ADR5000, HL60/AR, and MCF7/CH1000) known to overexpress either the ABCB1 (MDR1), ABCC1 (MRP1), or ABCG2 (MXR and BCRP) genes. When compared with their drug-sensitive parental lines, we observed not only the overexpression of these genes in the multidrug-resistant cell lines but also of other ABC transporter genes pointing to their possible role in multidrug resistance. These results were corroborated by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. As the microarray allows the determination of the expression profile of many ABC transporters in a single hybridization experiment, it may be useful as a diagnostic tool to detect drug resistance in clinical samples.
