In recent years the anticancer properties of vanadium compounds have been noticed, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In the present work, we found that vanadyl bisacetylacetonate ([VO(acac)(2)]) blocked cell cycle progression permanently at G1 phase in a dose- and time-dependent manner in HepG2 cells. This was further evidenced by the growth regulatory signals during the G1 stage. After the treatment with [VO(acac)(2)], the level of phosphorylation of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRb) and the expressions of cyclin D1, cyclin E and cyclin A were reduced, while the expression of a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 was increased dose-dependently. In the meantime, neither O(2)(*-) nor H(2)O(2) level was observed to increase. Interestingly, the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) and Akt were highly activated. After 1-h pretreatment with a lower concentration of MEK inhibitor U0126, the level of phosphorylated pRb was restored, indicating a release of cell cycle arrest. Taken together, we suggested that [VO(acac)(2)]-induced proliferation inhibition was caused by G1/S cell cycle arrest, which resulted from the decreased level of phosphorylated pRb in its active hypophosphorylated form via a highly activated ERK signal in HepG2 cells. The results presented here provided new insight into the development of vanadium compounds as potential anticancer agents.
