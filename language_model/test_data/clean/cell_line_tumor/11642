4-Anilinoquinazolines as an important class of protein kinase inhibitor are widely investigated for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase or epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) inhibition. A series of novel 6-salicyl-4-anilinoquinazoline derivatives 9-27 were prepared and evaluated for their EGFR/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity as well as their antiproliferative properties on three variant cancer cell lines (A431, MCF-7, and A549). The bioassay results showed most of the designed compounds exhibited moderate to potent in vitro inhibitory activity in the enzymatic and cellular assays, of which compound 21 revealed the most potent dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitory activity, with IC50 values of 0.12 µM and 0.096 µM, respectively, comparable to the control compounds Erlotinib and Lapatinib. Furthermore, the kinase selectivity profile of 21 was accessed and demonstrated its good selectivity over the majority of the close kinase targets. Docking simulation was performed to position compound 21 into the EGFR/HER2 active site to determine the probable binding pose. These new findings along with molecular docking observations could provide an important basis for further development of compound 21 as a potent EGFR/HER2 dual kinase inhibitor.
