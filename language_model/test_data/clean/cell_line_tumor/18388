Vaccination with autologous tumor-derived heat shock proteins (Hsp), such as Hsp70, Hsp90 and gp96, has been demonstrated to elicit specific immune responses against the tumor from which the Hsps were isolated. The effect of Hsp immunization is wholly dependent on the presence of functional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the immunized host, and Hsp receptors on APCs have recently been identified. Here we show that bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) are able to internalize HSP-peptide complex and that peptides are re-presented by DCs via the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I presentation pathway. In addition, immunization with tumor-derived HSP-pulsed DCs induces strong cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses against multiple antigenic peptides in a transporter-associated antigen processing (TAP)-dependent manner. The results of the present study provide strong evidence of an efficient cross-priming activity of Hsp70, which could be exploited in the development of new and more effective immunotherapeutic strategies for cancer patients.
