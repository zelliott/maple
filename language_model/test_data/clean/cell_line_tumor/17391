Activation of Wnt signaling is an early event in colorectal tumorigenesis, while aberrant activation of non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Src occurs during tumor progression. Here, we show that v-Src and receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 activate beta-catenin-TCF-mediated transcription. The effect of v-Src was abrogated by a dominant-negative mutant of TCF and the tumor suppressor APC. Furthermore, the effect of v-Src was partially abrogated by a dominant-negative mutant of MAP kinase, suggesting that v-Src exerts its effect at least in part via the MAP kinase pathway. Our finding raises the possibility that aberrantly activated c-Src may enhance Wnt signaling and this may contribute to tumor progression.
