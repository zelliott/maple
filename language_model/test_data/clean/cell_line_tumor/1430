Sox factors function as either activators or repressors of β-catenin/TCF transcription depending on the cellular context and associated interacting proteins. Our previous study provided evidence that alteration in β-catenin signaling is an essential event during transdifferentiation toward the morular phenotype of endometrial carcinomas (Em Cas). Here, we focused on related functional roles of Sox factors. Of eight Sox factors investigated, Sox4 could enhance β-catenin/TCF4 transcription, through upregulation of TCF4 at the transcription level, without any direct β-catenin association. Cells stably overexpressing Sox4 showed significant decreases in proliferation rate, along with increases in expression of p21(WAF1), as well as TCF4, in contrast to increased cell growth observed with knockdown. Of these factors, only Sox7 could transcriptionally upregulate Sox4 expression, but it also resulted in not only inhibition of Sox4-meditated activation of β-catenin/TCF4-driven transcription, but also repression of its own promoter activity, indicating the existence of very complex feedback loop for Sox-mediated signal cascades. Finally, Sox4 immunoreactivity was frequently pronounced in morular lesions of Em Cas, the expression being positively correlated with status of β-catenin, TCF4, and Sox7, and inversely with cell proliferation. These data therefore suggest that Sox4 may serve as a positive regulator of β-catenin signaling through alteration in TCF4 expression during morular differentiation of Em Ca cells, leading to inhibition of cell proliferation. In addition, Sox7 may also participate in the process, having complex roles in modulation of signaling.
