The purpose of this study was to develop an efficient way to synthesize (99m)Tc-O-[3-(1,4,8,11-tetraazabicyclohexadecane)-propyl]-tyrosine ((99m)Tc-N4-Tyrosine), a novel amino acid-based radiotracer, and evaluate its potential in breast cancer gamma imaging. Precursor N4-Tyrosine was synthesized using a 5-step procedure, and its total synthesis yield was 38%. It was successfully labeled with (99m)Tc with high radiochemical purity (>95%). Cellular uptake of (99m)Tc-N4-Tyrosine was much higher than that of (99m)Tc-N4 and the clinical gold standard (18)F-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-glucose ((18)F-FDG) in rat breast tumor cells in vitro. Tissue uptake and dosimetry estimation in normal rats revealed that (99m)Tc-N4-Tyrosine could be safely administered to humans. Evaluation in breast tumor-bearing rats showed that although (99m)Tc-N4-Tyrosine appeared to be inferior to (18)F-FDG in distinguishing breast tumor tissue from chemical-induced inflammatory tissue, it had high tumor-to-muscle uptake ratios and could detect breast tumors clearly by planar scintigraphic imaging. (99m)Tc-N4-Tyrosine could thus be a useful radiotracer for use in breast tumor diagnostic imaging.
