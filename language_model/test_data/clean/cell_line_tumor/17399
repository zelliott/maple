It has previously been suggested that volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) and store-operated channels (SOCs) interact with each other according to their expected colocalization in the plasma membrane of LNCaP cells. In order to study interactions between these two channels, we used 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) as a regular SOC inhibitor. Surprisingly 2-APB reduced VRAC activity in a dose-dependent manner (IC(50)=122.8 microM), but not 2,2-diphenyltetrahydrofuran (a structural analog of 2-APB). This effect was also present in keratinocytes. We conclude that 2-APB is an inhibitor of the VRAC family, and is also a potent tool to study the SOC-VRAC interaction in LNCaP cells.
