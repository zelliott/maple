To observe the effect of elemene on cell cycle of rat C6 glioblastoma cells.

Cell cycle analysis and expression of p38 in C6 glioblastoma cells under elemene treatment were measured by flow cytometry and Western blot. Flow cytometry and MTT assay were used to examine cell cycle and cell proliferation while C6 glioblastoma cells were pretreated with p38 inhibitor and DN-p38 plasmids.

The fraction of C6 in the G0/G1 phase increased 11%, 6.95%, 19.57% respectively in the presence of 40, 60 and 80 microg/ml elemene. The level of phosphorylated p38 MAPK was greatly increased in a dose and time-dependent manner. Inhibition of p38 MAPK activation with SB203580 and DN-p38 blocked elemene-induced anti-proliferation effect.

Elemene could induce G0/G1 cell cycle phase arrest of C6 glioblastoma cells through up-regulation of phosphorylated p38.
