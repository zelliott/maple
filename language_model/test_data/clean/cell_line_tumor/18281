Investigation of the non-polar fraction of Boesenbergia pandurata of Myanmar led to the identification of six novel secondary metabolites, panduratins D-I (1-6), together with known diastereomers, panduratins B1 (7) and B2 (8). Their structures were determined based on extensive spectroscopic analysis. The in vitro preferential cytotoxicity of all isolates was examined against human pancreatic PANC-1 cancer cells under nutrient-deprived conditions. All exhibited a mild activity.
