Cancer-related inflammation profoundly affects tumor progression. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are known regulators of that inflammation, but the factors that initiate cancer-related inflammation are poorly understood. Tumor invasiveness and poor clinical outcome are linked to increased expression of cell surface-associated vacuolar adenosine triphosphatases. The a2 isoform vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase is found on the surface on many solid tumors, and we have identified a peptide cleaved from a2 isoform vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase called a2NTD. a2NTD has properties necessary to induce monocytes into a pro-oncogenic TAM phenotype. The peptide upregulated both pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. These included IL-1β and IL-10, which are important in promoting inflammation and immune escape by tumor cells. The secretion of inflammatory cytokine IL-1β was dependent on ATP, K(+) efflux, and reactive oxygen species, all mediators that activate the inflammasome. These findings describe a mechanism by which tumor cells affect the maturation of TAMs via a nontraditional cytokine-like signal, the a2NTD peptide.
