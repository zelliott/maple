An animal model of cancer pain induced by injection of Walker 256 carcinoma cells into the plantar surface of rat hind paw is described. Tumor growth and the occurrence of metastasis were investigated by histopathological analysis. Tumor cell growth was also analyzed plethysmographically by the increase in paw volume. For characterization of pain symptoms, hyperalgesia, allodynia, and spontaneous pain were evaluated 5 to 8 days after cell injection. The volume of the inoculated paw started to increase on day 2 after inoculation, being 40% higher on day 5 after injection. At this time, there was a marked proliferation of tumor cells, with the presence of anaplastic and pleomorphic cells, nucleoli, and atypical mitotic features. On days 7 and 8 after injection, histopathological analysis of popliteal lymph nodes showed the presence of tumor cells. The intraplantar injection of Walker 256 cells caused hyperalgesia at day 5 after cell inoculation. Low-threshold mechanical allodynia was significant 2 days after cell injection, being increased on day 5. In addition, inoculation of tumor cells induced gross behavior, characterized by a significant increase in licking and lifting of the injected paw 5 days after injection. The pain-enhancing effect caused by cell inoculation was partially inhibited by indomethacin on day 2 after cell injection, whereas morphine blocked allodynia on days 2 and 5. These results indicate that intraplantar injection of Walker 256 cells cause pain symptoms characteristic of cancer pain. This experimental model can then be used to investigate new analgesic or anti-tumor drugs.

This article presents a new animal model for studying cancer pain and metastasis. This model could help in understanding the mechanisms involved in cancer pain symptoms and may be used for the investigation of new analgesic or anti-tumor drugs.
