Synthesis and in vitro cytotoxicity assays of new anthranilamide MDR modulators have been performed to assess their inhibition potency on the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter. Previous studies showed that the replacement of the aromatic spacer group between nitrogen atoms (N(1) and N(2)) in the P-gp inhibitor XR9576 with ethyl or propyl chain is optimal for P-gp inhibition potency. To confirm that observation, the ethyl or the propyl linker arm was replaced with a pyrrolidine or an alicyclic group such as cyclohexyl. In addition, an arylpiperazinyl group and two methoxyl groups onto the anthranilic part were introduced to assess their effect on the anti P-gp activity. Five molecules were prepared and evaluated on CEM/VLB500. All new anthranilamides were more potent than verapamil, most of them exhibited a lower cytotoxicity than XR9576. Compound 5 was the most potent and its inhibition activity was similar to XR9576. Interestingly, in vitro biotransformation studies of compounds 4 and 5 using human CYP-450 isoforms revealed, that conversely to XR9576, compounds 4 and 5 inhibited CYP3A4, an enzyme that colocalizes with P-gp in the intestine and contributes to tumor cell chemoresistance by enhancing the biodisposition of numerous drugs, notably paclitaxel. In that context, 5 might be suitable for further drug development.
