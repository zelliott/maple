To investigate the effect of a new photosensitizer, M007 mediated photodynamic therapy on proliferation of human osteosarcoma MG63 cells in vitro.

Human osteosarcoma MG63 cells were prepared as 1 x 10(6) /mL single-cell suspension, and 1 mL cells were transferred into 60 mL culture dish, then treated with 5 different gradient dosages (0, 2, 4, 8, 16 micromol/L) of M007 followed by photodynamic therapy or dark reaction for 10 min. The survival rate of the cells and the mode of cell death were detected by flow cytometry with the stain of Annexin V-FITC/PI. The effect on proliferation of survival cells was observed by MTT assay and colony-forming assay.

M007 mediated photodynamic therapy induced the inactivation of MG63 human osteosarcoma cells in the way of late apoptosis/necrosis or becoming naked nucleus predominately. More than 90% MG63 cells in M007-PDT group were dead under the treatment of 2-16 micromol/L M007. The survival rates of 4-16 micromol/L M007-PDT group were steadily less than 1%. The optical densities did not increase with extension of culture time in 2-8 micromol/L M007-PDT group (P > 0.05). There were 16 survival alive cells found occasionally in 2 micromol/L M007-PDT group, but no colonies found in other groups.

M007 mediated photodynamic therapy totally inactivated human osteosarcoma MG63 cells in vitro with the dosage more than 4 micromol/L.
