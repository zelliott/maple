To explore biological aspects of Tiam1 gene expression in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells.

Tiam1/C1199HA expression plasmids were transfected into nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells of C666-1 and CNE1 by lipofectamine2000. RT-PCR, real-time PCR and Western blot Analyses were performed to evaluate the expression of Tiam1 mRNA and protein levels, respectively. In vitro cell adhesion, wound healing and matrigel invasion assays were used to study the biological impact of Tiam1 on cell adhesion, mobility and invasion.

Tiam1 over expression significantly increased the abilities of adhesion, migratory and invasion of C666-1 and CNE1 cells, comparing with that of the control untransfected cells (P < 0.05).

Tiam1 expression correlates with the invasion and metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells.
