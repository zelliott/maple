To investigate the effect of over-expressed monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) on apoptosis, cell cycle, migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.

Eukaryotic expression plasmid pcDNA3.1/MCT and empty plasmid pcDNA3.1 were respectively transfected into MDA-MB-231 cells. The expression of MCT gene was tested by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. After stained respectively by annexin V-FITC/PI and PI, the apoptosis and cell cycle in the MDA-MB-231 cells over-expressing MCT were detected by flow cytometry. The abilities of invasion and migration in the MDA-MB-231 cells with over-expressed MCT were respectively determined by Transwell(TM); and scratch wound healing assays.

In mRNA and protein levels, the expression of MCT was higher in pcDNA3.1/MCT transfected group than in negative control group and untreated group. Over-expression of MCT in the MDA-MB-231 cells enhanced cell apoptosis, reduced the cell number of G2 phase and increased the cell number of S phase. The abilities of invasion and migration in the MDA-MB-231 cells were inhibited significantly.

Over-expression of MCT in the MDA-MB-231 cells promotes apoptosis, regulates G2/M checkpoint and inhibits the abilities of invasion and migration.
