Kolaviron (KV), a natural biflavonoid obtained from the seeds of Garcinia kola, has been documented for its wide pharmacological window, including anti-apoptotic activities. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood at the cellular level. This study investigates the anti-apoptotic activity of KV in PC12 cells, a rat pheochromocytoma, exposed to endocrine disruptor-atrazine (ATZ). KV (60 μM) treatment for 24 h shows significant anti-apoptotic responses in PC12 cells exposed to ATZ (232 μM) for 24 h. KV treatment recovers the ATZ-induced levels of malondialdehyde, reactive oxygen species (ROS), caspase-3 activity and depleted levels of glutathione and catalase activity. However, KV was found to be ineffective to restore the ATZ-induced expression (mRNA) and activity of glutathione-peroxidase (GSH-Px) and glutathione reductase (GR). KV treatment also demonstrates significant restoration in ATZ-induced alterations in the expression of apoptosis markers viz., p53, Bax, Bcl2, caspase-3, caspase-9, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), c-Jun and c-fos. Flow cytometric analysis confirms the involvement of ROS in the mediation of ATZ-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells. Together, these data suggest that KV has the therapeutic potential against chemical-induced apoptotic cell death in the neuronal system.
