This paper proposes a new cytotoxicity assay in a microfluidic device with microwells and a distributive microfluidic channel network for the formation of cancer cell spheroids. The assay can generate rapid and uniform cell clusters in microwells and test in situ cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs including sequential drug treatments, long term culture of spheroids and cell viability assays. Inlet ports are connected to the microwells by a hydraulic resistance network. This uniform distribution of cell suspensions results in regular spheroid dimensions. Injected cancer cells were trapped in microwells, and aggregated into tumor spheroids within 3 days. A cytotoxicity test of the spheroids in microwells was subsequently processed in the same device without the extraction of cells. The in situ cytotoxicity assay of tumor spheroids in microwells was comparable with the MTT assay on hanging drop spheroids using a conventional 96-well plate. It was observed that the inhibition rate of the spheroids was less than that in the 2D culture dish and the effect on tumor spheroids was different depending on the anticancer drug. This device could provide a convenient in situ assay tool to assess the cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs on tumor spheroids, offering more information than the conventional 2D culture plate.
