The synthesis of an unnatural polyprenylated acylphloroglucinol (PPAP), regioisomeric with nemorosone and clusianone, has been accomplished. The separated enantiomers of this new PPAP, along with those of nemorosone and clusianone, have been screened for activity against HeLa (cervix carcinoma), MIA-PaCa-2 (pancreatic carcinoma), and MCF7 (mamma carcinoma) cancer cell lines. All of the isomers examined gave surprisingly similar results in the screens.
