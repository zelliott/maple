Reporter genes may serve as endogenous contrast agents in the field of photoacoustic (PA) molecular imaging (PMI), enabling greater characterization of detailed cellular processes and disease progression. To demonstrate the feasibility of using ferritin as a reporter gene, human melanoma SK-24 (SK-MEL-24) cells were co-transfected with plasmid expressing human heavy chain ferritin (H-FT) and plasmid expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (pEGFP-C1) using lipofectamineâ„¢ 2000. Nontransfected SK-MEL-24 cells served as a negative control. Fluorescent imaging of GFP confirmed transfection and transgene expression in co-transfected cells. To detect iron accumulation due to ferritin overexpression in SK-MEL-24 cells, a focused high-frequency ultrasonic transducer (60 MHz, f/1.5), synchronized to a pulsed laser (fluence < 5 mJ/cm(2)) was used to scan the PA signal at a wide range NIR wavelengths (850-950 nm). PA signal intensity from H-FT transfected SK-MEL-24 cells was about 5-9 dB higher than nontransfected SK-MEL-24 cells at 850-950 nm. Immunofluorescence and RT-PCR analysis both indicate high levels of ferritin expression in H-FT transfected SK-MEL24 cells, with little ferritin expression in nontransfected SK-MEL-24 cells. In this study, the feasibility of using ferritin as a reporter gene for PMI has been demonstrated in vitro. The use of ferritin as a reporter gene represents a novel concept for PMI using an endogenous contrast agent and may provide various opportunities for molecular imaging and basic science research.
