To investigate the cell cycle changes of hepatoma cells and the effect of antisense oligonucleotide targeting bFGF on apoptosis in the hepatoma cells.

The oligodeoxynucleotides were transfected with Lipofectin into hepatoma HepG2 cells. Inhibition of bFGF protein expression was assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy and Western blot under the best condition of transfection of antisense oligonucleotide targeting bFGF, and the apoptosis in those cells was determined by flow cytometry. HepG2 cells were cultured in 24-well culture dish. The cultured cells were divided into 3 groups: group 1, the normal control group without any treatment; group 2, transfected with antisense oligonucleotide targeting bFGF; group 3, transfected with scrambled sequence targeting bFGF.

The results from confocal microscopy and Western blot showed an inhibition of expression of bFGF at different levels under the best condition of transfection with antisense oligonucleotide targeting bFGF. The treatment with antisense oligonucleotide of bFGF not only reduced the expression of bFGF revealed by confocal microscopy and Western blotting, but also increased the apoptosis in HepG 2 cells (P < 0. 01).

Treatment with antisense oligonucleotide of bFGF inhibits expression of bFGF protein and increase apoptosis. bFGF may take part in apoptosis regulation of hepatoma cells and may be used as a target in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
