The ability to prevent methylene blue (MB), a photosensitizer, from being reduced by plasma reductases will greatly improve its efficacy in photodynamic therapy (PDT) applications. We have developed a delivery approach for PDT by encapsulating MB using nanoparticle platforms (NPs). The 30-nm polyacrylamide-based NPs provide protection for the embedded MB against reduction by diaphorase enzymes. Furthermore, our data shows the matrix-protected MB efficiently induces photodynamic damage to tumor cells. The unprecedented results demonstrate the significant in vitro photodynamic effectiveness of MB when encapsulated within NPs, which promises to open new opportunities for MB in its in vivo and clinical studies.
