Aberrant HLA-G expression is associated with tumor invasiveness and poor clinical prognosis; however, there is a lack of preclinical animal model to address whether HLA-G plays a causal role in the unfavorable prognosis of malignancies. In the current study, ovarian carcinoma cell lines (HO-8910 and Ovcar-3) were transfected with HLA-G gene. HLA-G expression was analyzed with western blot and flow cytometry. Transwell experiment was performed to analyze the cell migration and invasion capability and/or multicellular spheroid formation was investigated with the 3D culture assay in vitro. The effects of HLA-G expression for tumor cell organ metastasis and for mouse survival was analyzed with the Balb/c nu/nu mouse model. Our data showed that HO-8910-G and Ovcar-3-G cells are of higher invasion potential compared with the parental HO-8910 and Ovcar-3 cells. Multicellular spheroid formation exists only in HO-8910-G cells in a 3D culture assay. In Balb/c nu/nu mouse model, widespread metastasis was observed in mice xenografted with HO-8910-G cells, but not in the group with parental cells. Mouse survival was dramatically decreased in HO-8910-G and Ovcar-3-G xenografted mice than that with HO-8910 and Ovcar-3 cells, respectively. In summary, our study provided the first evidence that HLA-G expression is associated with tumor metastasis and with poor survival in an animal model with ovarian cancer.
