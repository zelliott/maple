Cellular inactivation through killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) may allow neoplastic cells to evade host natural killer (NK) cell-mediated immunity. Recently, alloreactive NK cells were shown to mediate antileukemic effects against acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) after mismatched transplantation, when KIR ligand incompatibility existed in the direction of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Therefore, we investigated whether solid tumor cells would have similar enhanced susceptibility to allogeneic KIR-incompatible NK cells compared with their KIR-matched autologous or allogeneic counterparts. NK populations enriched and cloned from the blood of cancer patients or healthy donors homozygous for HLA-C alleles in group 1 (C-G1) or group 2 (C-G2) were tested in vitro for cytotoxicity against Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastic cell lines (EBV-LCLs), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and melanoma (MEL) cells with or without a matching KIR-inhibitory HLA-C ligand. Allogeneic NK cells were more cytotoxic to tumor targets mismatched for KIR ligands than their KIR ligand-matched counterparts. Bulk NK populations (CD3(-)/CD2(+)/CD56(+)) expanded 10(4)-fold from patients homozygous for C-G1 or C-G2 had enhanced cytotoxicity against KIR ligand-mismatched tumor cells but only minimal cytotoxicity against KIR ligand-matched targets. Further, NK cell lines from C-G1 or C-G2 homozygous cancer patients or healthy donors expanded but failed to kill autologous or KIR-matched MEL and RCC cells yet had significant cytotoxicity (more than 50% lysis at 20:1 effector-target [E/T] ratio) against allogeneic KIR-mismatched tumor lines. These data suggest immunotherapeutic strategies that use KIR-incompatible allogeneic NK cells might have superior antineoplastic effects against solid tumors compared with approaches using autologous NK cells.
