Dopamine Î²-hydroxylase (DBH) and norepinephrine (NE) transporter (NET) are the noradrenergic phenotypes for their functional importance to noradrenergic neurons. It is known that in vivo N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP4) treatment induces degeneration of noradrenergic terminals by interacting with NET and depleting intracellular NE. However, DSP4's precise mechanism of action remains unclear. In this study various biochemical approaches were employed to test the hypothesis that DSP4 down-regulates the expression of DBH and NET, and to determine molecular mechanisms that may be involved. The results showed that treatment of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with DSP4 significantly decreased mRNA and protein levels of DBH and NET. DSP4-induced reduction of DBH mRNA and proteins, as well as NET proteins showed a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that DSP4-treated cells were arrested predominantly in the S-phase, which was reversible. The arrest was confirmed by several DNA damage response markers (phosphorylation of H2AX and p53), suggesting that DSP4 causes replication stress which triggers cell cycle arrest via the S-phase checkpoints. Moreover, the comet assay verified that DSP4 induced single-strand DNA breaks. In summary, the present study demonstrated that DSP4 down-regulates the noradrenergic phenotypes, which may be mediated by its actions on DNA replication, leading to replication stress and cell cycle arrest. These action mechanisms of DSP4 may account for its degenerative consequence after systematic administration for animal models.
