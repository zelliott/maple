The regioselectivity of coupling phenyl isocyanate to 3-(2-acylhydrazino)-3-aminopropenenitriles and ethyl 3-(2-acylhydrazino)-3-aminopropenoates as simple access to aminopyrazole derivatives, endowed with potential antitumoral activity, is reported. 3-(2-Acylhydrazino)-3-aminopropenenitriles react with phenyl isocyanate to afford 3-amino-3-(2-acylhydrazino)-2-phenylaminocarbonyl-2-propenenitriles. These key intermediates were cyclized into 3,5-diaminopyrazole-4-carboxamide derivatives. Preliminary results of poor antiproliferative activities of these compounds are also reported.
