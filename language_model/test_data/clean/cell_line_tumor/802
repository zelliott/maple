Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is the principal pro-inflammatory cytokine participating in the initiation of acute phase response. Human hepatoma HepG2 cells were exposed to 15 ng/ml of IL-1beta for times ranging from 1 to 24 h and the total RNA was isolated. Then cDNA was obtained and used for differential display with 10 arbitrary primers and 9 oligo(dT) primers designed by Clontech. Validation of observed changes of differentially expressed known genes was carried out by RT-PCR or Northern blot analysis. Out of 90 cDNA strands modulated by IL-1, 46 have been successfully reamplified and their sequencing indicates that they represent 36 different cDNA templates. By GenBank search, 26 cDNA clones were identified as already known genes while 10 showed no homology to any known gene. The identified transcripts modulated by IL-1 in HepG2 cells code for intracellular proteins of various function: trafficking/motor proteins (3 genes), proteins participating in the translation machinery or posttranscriptional/posttranslational modifications (7 genes), proteases (1 gene), proteins involved in metabolism (6 genes), activity modulators (3 genes), proteins of the cell cycle machinery (2 genes) and those functionally unclassified (4 genes). Majority of genes responded to IL-1 within 1 to 6 h (early genes), while two were late response genes (12-24 h) and four showed prolonged response over the whole 24-h period. Most of the observed changes of expression were in the range of two- to threefold increase in comparison to control untreated cells. Among identified genes, no typical secretory acute phase protein was found. The obtained results suggest that IL-1 affects the expression of several genes in HepG2 cells, especially those engaged in the synthesis and modifications of proteins.
