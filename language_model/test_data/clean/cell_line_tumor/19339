The herbicide paraquat is a suspected etiologic factor in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). Paraquat was therefore used to reproduce Parkinsonian syndromes in lab animals, in which it produces dopaminergic pathogenesis. However, the factors or mechanisms by which paraquat kills dopaminergic neurons are not fully understood. Based on reported evidence that paraquat increases p53 protein levels and inhibits mitochondrial function, it was hypothesized that paraquat induces cell death in dopaminergic neurons through a mechanism in which p53 and mitochondrial apoptotic pathway are linked. To explore this possibility, dopaminergic SY5Y cells were treated with paraquat for 48 h and p53 responses were investigated, as well as biomarkers of the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Paraquat significantly increased protein levels of p53 and one of its target genes, Bax. By 24 h, paraquat decreased mitochondrial complex I activity and mitochondrial transmembrane potential and induced the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. In addition, paraquat increased the activities of caspases 9 and 3. Finally, nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation occurred 48 h after treatment. The decrease of mitochondrial functions, the release of cytochrome c, the increase of caspase 9 and 3 activities, and DNA damage that were produced by paraquat were inhibited by a specific p53 inhibitor, pifithrin-alpha. These findings support the conclusion that paraquat produced apoptosis in SY5Y cells through the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway associated with p53.
