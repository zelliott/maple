Mononuclear complex of Zn(II) with a new bis-Schiff base ligand derived from 2,3-butanedione and thiosemicarbazide, [Zn(II)L.H2O].2DMF [L = (2E,2'E)-2,2'-(butane-2,3-diylidene)bis(hydrazinecarbothioamide)], and other transition metal ions [Cu(II), Mn(II), Co(II), Ni(II)] complexes have been prepared. The Zn(II) complex has been structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography. Among the five complexes, the Cu(II) complex has the novel highest antitumor activity.
