Extracellular nucleotides (e.g adenosine 5'-triphosphate, ATP) influence biological processes via purinergic receptors. We characterised the P2-purinoreceptors in human hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) cells (PC-3 cells).

1. Immunofluorescent staining demonstrated P2X3 P2X, P2X5 P2X7 and P2Y2 receptors. 2. ATP inhibited cell growth by up to 91% over 72h. Pharmacological characterisation indicated a P2X-purinoreceptor-mediated response. 3. Comparable maximum growth inhibition was seen after either a single addition of 1mM or daily addition of 100mM ATP. ATP concentrations ([ATP]) returned to baseline levels within 24h if the initial [ATP] was < or =100 HM, while [ATP] remained high for 72h if a single concentration of 1 mM was used. 4. ATP 1 mM significantly ( p<0.001) increased the proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis from 0.27% (+/- 0.04%) to 5.28% (+/- 0.77%).

Threshold concentrations of ATP inhibited HRPC cell growth in vitro via the activation of P2X-purinoreceptors. The role of nucleotides in the treatment of HRPC requires further investigation.
