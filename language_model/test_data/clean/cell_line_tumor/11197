CD16 (FcÎ³RIIIa), the low-affinity receptor for IgG, expressed by the majority of human NK cells, is a potent activating receptor that facilitates Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). ADCC dysfunction has been linked to cancer progression and poor prognosis for chronic infections, such as HIV; thus, understanding how CD16 expression is regulated by NK cells has clinical relevance. Importantly, CD16 cell-surface expression is downmodulated following NK cell activation and, in particular, exposure to stimulatory cytokines (IL-2 or IL-15), likely owing to the action of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In this article, we identify membrane-type 6 (MT6) MMP (also known as MMP25) as a proteinase responsible for CD16 downmodulation. IL-2-induced upregulation of MT6/MMP25 cell-surface expression correlates with CD16 downmodulation. MT6/MMP25, sequestered in intracellular compartments in unstimulated NK cells, translocates to the cell surface after stimulation; moreover, it polarizes to the effector-target cell interface of the CD16-mediated immunological synapse. siRNA-mediated disruption of MT6/MMP25 expression enhances the ADCC capacity of NK cells, emphasizing the important functional role of MT6/MMP25 in the regulation of ADCC activity. Thus, this study uncovers a previously unknown role of MT6/MMP25 in human NK cells, and suggests that inhibition of MT6/MMP25 activity could improve ADCC efficacy of therapeutically administered NK cells that require IL-2 for culture and expansion.
