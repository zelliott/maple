Although cyclin G1 has been implicated in certain p53-related biological phenomena, other aspects of its function remain unclear. Here we report hitherto unknown mechanism by which cyclin G1 increases radiation sensitivity by regulating the level of cyclin B1. Overexpression of cyclin G1 was observable in lung carcinoma tissues. Irradiation of human lung cells with cyclin G1 overexpression resulted in increased cell death and gamma-H2AX foci suggesting that cyclin G1 rendered the cells more susceptible to DNA damage. Enhanced radiosensitivity by cyclin G1 was correlated with increased cyclin B1, CDC2/cyclin B1 complex, and MPM2. Cell cycle synchronization clearly showed coexpression of cyclin G1 and cyclin B1 in G2/M phase. Depletion of cyclin G1 by interference RNA revealed that cyclin G1 regulated transcription of cyclin B1 in a p53-independent manner, and confirmed that the increased mitotic cells and cell death by cyclin G1 were dependent upon cyclin B1. Therefore, our data suggest that cyclin G1 enhanced radiation sensitivity by overriding radiation-induced G2 arrest through transcriptional upregulation of cyclin B1.
