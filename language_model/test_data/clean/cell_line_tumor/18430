The c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) subgroup of mitogen-activated protein kinases has been implicated largely in stress responses, but an increasing body of evidence has suggested that JNK also plays a role in cell proliferation and survival. We examined the effect of JNK inhibition, using either SP600125 or specific antisense oligonucleotides, on cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. SP600125 was selective for JNK in vitro and in vivo versus other kinases tested including ERK, p38, cyclin-dependent protein kinase 1 (CDK1), and CDK2. SP600125 inhibited JNK activity and KB-3 cell proliferation with the same dose dependence, suggesting that inhibition of proliferation was a direct consequence of JNK inhibition. Inhibition of proliferation by SP600125 was associated with an increase in the G(2)-M and apoptotic fractions of cells but was not associated with p53 or p21 induction. Antisense oligonucleotides to JNK2 but not JNK1 caused highly significant inhibition of cell proliferation. Wild-type mouse fibroblasts responded similarly with proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction, whereas c-jun(-/-) fibroblasts were refractory to the effects of SP600125, suggesting that JNK signaling to c-Jun is required for cell proliferation. Studies in synchronized KB-3 cells indicated that SP600125 delayed transit time through S and G(2)-M phases. Correspondingly, JNK activity increased in late S phase and peaked in late G(2) phase. During synchronous mitotic progression, cyclin B levels increased concomitant with phosphorylation of c-Jun, H1 histone, and Bcl-2. In the presence of SP600125, mitotic progression was prolonged, and c-Jun phosphorylation was inhibited, but neither H1 nor Bcl-2 phosphorylation was inhibited. However, the CDK inhibitor roscovitine inhibited mitotic Bcl-2 phosphorylation. These results indicate that JNK, and more specifically the JNK2 isoform, plays a key role in cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. In addition, conclusive evidence is presented that a kinase other than JNK, most likely CDK1 or a CDK1-regulated kinase, is responsible for mitotic Bcl-2 phosphorylation.
