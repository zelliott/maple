We have evaluated and provided evidence that the ryanodine receptor 3 gene (RYR3), which encodes a large protein that forms a calcium channel, is important for the growth, morphology, and migration of breast cancer cells. A putative binding site for microRNA-367 (miR-367) exists in the 3'UTR of RYR3, and a genetic variant, rs1044129 Aâ†’G, is present in this binding region. We confirmed that miR-367 regulates the expression of a reporter gene driven by the RYR3 3'UTR and that the regulation was affected by the RYR3 genotype. A thermodynamic model based on base pairing and the secondary structure of the RYR3 mRNA and miR-367 miRNA showed that miR-367 had a higher binding affinity for the A genotype than for the G genotype. The rs1044129 SNP was genotyped in 1,532 breast cancer cases and 1,600 healthy Chinese women. The results showed that compared with the AA genotype, G was a risk genotype for breast cancer development and was also associated with breast cancer calcification and poor survival. Thus, rs1044129 is a unique SNP that resides in a miRNA-gene regulatory loop that affects breast cancer risk, calcification, and survival.
