The crucial role of the microtubule in cell division has identified tubulin as a target for the development of therapeutics for cancer; in particular, tubulin is a target for antineoplastic agents that act by interfering with the dynamic stability of microtubules. A molecular modeling study was carried out to accurately represent the complex structure and the binding mode of a new class of stilbene-based tubulin inhibitors that bind at the alphabeta-tubulin colchicine site. Computational docking along with HINT (Hydropathic INTeractions) score analysis fitted these inhibitors into the colchicine site and revealed detailed structure-activity information useful for inhibitor design. Quantitative analysis of the results was in good agreement with the in vitro antiproliferative activity of these derivatives (ranging from 3 nM to 100 muM) such that calculated and measured free energies of binding correlate with an r(2) of 0.89 (standard error +/- 0.85 kcal mol(-1)). This correlation suggests that the activity of unknown compounds may be predicted.
