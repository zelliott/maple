Growing evidence supports the critical role of lipid peroxidation products in the control of cell proliferation. In previous studies we demonstrated the efficient restriction of the proliferation rate in several cell lines resulting from the in vitro treatment with endogenous lipid polar components of cell membranes. Among these, 9-hydroxystearic acid (9-HSA), a primary intermediate of lipid peroxidation, induced a significant arrest in G0/G1 in HT29 colon cancer cells. In response to 9-HSA treatment of HT29 we observed cell growth arrest and increase in p21(WAF1) expression both at the transcriptional and the translational levels. Growth of p21(WAF1)-deleted HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells was not inhibited by 9-HSA. We present evidence that p21(WAF1) is required for 9-HSA mediated growth arrest in human colon carcinoma cells.
