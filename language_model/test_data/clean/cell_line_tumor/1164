Multidrug resistance (MDR) has been studied extensively because it is one of major problems in cancer chemotherapy. The MDR phenotype is often due to overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), that acting as an energy-dependent drug efflux pump exports various anticancer drugs out of cells. The major goal of our investigation is to establish whether bovine serum amine oxidase (BSAO), which generates the products H(2)O(2) and aldehyde(s), from the polyamine spermine, is able to overcome MDR of human cancer cells. The cytotoxicity of the products was evaluated in both drug-sensitive (LoVo WT) and drug-resistant (LoVo DX) colon adenocarcinoma cells. A clonogenic cell survival assay demonstrated that LoVo DX cells were more sensitive than LoVo WT cells. Exogenous catalase protected cells against cytotoxicity mainly due to the formation of H(2)O(2). However, spermine-derived aldehyde(s) still induced some cytotoxicity. The cytotoxic effect was totally inhibited in the presence of both enzymes, catalase and NAD-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Transmission electron microscopy investigations showed that BSAO and spermine induced evident mitochondria alterations, more pronounced in MDR than in LoVo WT cells. The mitochondrial activity was checked by flow cytometry studies, labelling cells with the probe JC1, that displayed a basal hyperpolarized status of the mitochondria in multidrug-resistant cells. After treatment with amine oxidase in the presence of polyamine-spermine, the cells showed a marked increase in mitochondrial membrane depolarization higher in LoVo DX than in LoVo WT cells. Our findings suggest that toxic oxidation products formed from spermine and BSAO could be a powerful tool in the development of new anticancer treatments, mainly against MDR tumor cells.
