Though Melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE) family genes have received lots of attention as cancer-related genes and targets for immunotherapy, MAGE-D4 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not yet been evaluated.

MAGE-D4 mRNA expression was assayed in nine HCC cell lines and 94 HCC surgical specimens obtained from Japanese patients by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and the correlations between MAGE-D4 mRNA expression and clinicopathological factors were evaluated. The expression and distribution of MAGE-D4b protein were evaluated immunohistochemically.

MAGE-D4 mRNA was overexpressed in five of nine HCC cell lines and 34 of 94 primary HCCs (36.2%). Median overall survival (14.8 vs. 118 months, p < 0.001) and relapse-free survival (2.7 vs. 18.3 months, p < 0.001) were significantly shorter in patients with high than with low-moderate MAGE-D4 expression. Multivariate analysis for overall survival showed that MAGE-D4 overexpression was independently prognostic for survival (hazard ratio 2.88, P = 0.009) and significantly associated with high alpha-fetoprotein concentration (p < 0.001), poor tumor differentiation (P = 0.003) and vascular invasion (P = 0.021). MAGE-D4b protein expression patterns were consistent with those of MAGE-D4 mRNA.

Overexpression of MAGE-D4 may be a predictive marker of early recurrence and mortality in patients with HCC.
