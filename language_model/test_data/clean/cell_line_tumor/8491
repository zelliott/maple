A novel family of cisplatin-type complexes tethered to dibenzo[c,h][1,6]naphthyridin-6-one topoisomerase inhibitor via a polymethylene chain and their nonplatinated counterparts were prepared. Their potential cytotoxicity was assessed in three human colorectal cancer cell lines HCT 116, SW480 and HT-29 and compared to the reference molecules cisplatin and oxaliplatin. Platinated compounds were poorly active whilst nonplatinated dibenzo[c,h][1,6]naphthyridin-6-one moieties exhibited higher cytotoxic properties than cisplatin and oxaliplatin whatever the length of the polymethylene chain; molecules containing the tri- and hexamethylene chain length were the most cytotoxic.
