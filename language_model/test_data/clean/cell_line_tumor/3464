To elucidate the mechanisms underlining alpha3(V) collagen chain expression, we performed an initial analysis of the structure and function of the core promoter of the human COL5A3 gene. The core promoter, which lacks a typical TATA motif and has a high GC content, was defined within the -129 bp immediately upstream from the major transcription start site by transient transfection experiments. In this region, we identified four DNA-protein complexes, named A, B, C, and D, by a combination of DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using mutant oligonucleotide revealed that the complexes A, B, C, and D bind to -122 to -117, the -101 to -96, the -83 to -78, and the -68 to -57 bp, respectively. The competition assays using consensus oligonucleotides and supershift assays with specific antibodies showed that complex A consists of CBF/NF-Y. In a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, CBF/NF-Y protein directly bound to this region, in vivo. Functional analysis showed that CBF/NF-Y activated the gene, whereas the proteins of complexes B and C repressed its activity. Furthermore, overexpression of a mutant form of the CBF-B/NF-YA subunit, which forms CBF/NF-Y with CBF-A/NF-YB and CBF-C/NF-YC subunits, inhibited promoter activity.
