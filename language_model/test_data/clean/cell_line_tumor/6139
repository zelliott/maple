A series of 2-substituted-1,4-bis(dimethylamino)-9,10-anthraquinone derivatives were synthesized and their in vitro antiproliferative activities against p388 mouse leukemic tumor cells were evaluated. In addition, the effect of substituents on the phenyl ring was investigated. Among the derivatives tested, seven showed a high antiproliferative effect and three showed a moderate effect. In addition, introduction of a series of substituted phenyl groups into 1,4-bis(dimethylamino)-9,10-anthraquinone at 2-position were shown to enhance its antiproliferative activity. The antiproliferative activity also increased upon substitution of the benzene ring by an electron donating group such as an amine or methoxyl group.
