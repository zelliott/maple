Interleukin-5 (IL-5) plays an important role in the growth and differentiation             of human B cells and eosinophils. However, little is known about the effect of             IL-5 on cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms             involved in the IL-5-induced migration of HT1376 bladder cancer cells. Our results             indicated that IL-5 significantly enhanced migration and MMP-9 expression in HT1376             cells. We also found that IL-5 induces transcriptional activation of the binding             of NF-κB and AP-1, which are two important nuclear transcription factors that             are linked to MMP-9 expression in HT1376 cells. In subsequent experiments, we             found activation of ERK1/2 in IL-5-treated HT1376 cells. To examine the involvement             of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway on IL-5-induced cell responses, we pretreated             HT1376 cells with the ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 followed by IL-5 treatment. The results             showed that U0126 treatment inhibited migration of IL-5-treated HT1376 cells.             Moreover, IL-5-stimulated MMP-9 expression was suppressed by the addition of U0126.             Inhibition of ERK1/2 function consistently rescued transcriptional activity of             NF-κB, without altering AP-1 activation, in IL-5-treated cells. Finally, inhibition             of the IL-5-specific receptor IL-5Rα by small interfering RNA (siRNA) suppressed             migration, ERK1/2 activation, MMP-9 expression and binding activation of NF-κB             in IL-5-treated HT1376 cells. The results of the present study indicate that the             IL-28A/IL-28AR1 dyad induces cell migration through ERK1/2-mediated expression             of MMP-9 by binding activation of NF-κB in bladder cancer cells. In conclusion,             these novel findings indicate that binding of IL-5 to IL-5Rα plays a critical             role in MMP-9 expression, which may be involved in the migration of bladder cancer.
