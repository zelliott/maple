Cancer stem cells reportedly participate in the tumorigenesis of some neoplasms. Scirrhous hepatocellular carcinoma is a variant of hepatocellular carcinoma with abundant fibrous stroma. Herein, we clinicopathologically examined scirrhous (29 cases) and conventional (50 cases) hepatocellular carcinoma with reference to cancer stem cells. Scirrhous hepatocellular carcinoma was classifiable into 3 types based on small neoplastic cells at the periphery of tumor cell nests. Of 29 cases of scirrhous hepatocellular carcinoma, 21 contained small neoplastic cells. Immunohistochemically, those cells were positive for cytokeratin 7 and ATP-binding cassette transporter G2. In 11 cases, those small tumor cells were also positive for cytokeratin 19, neural cell adhesion molecule, and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (type 1), whereas 10 cases did not show such additional expression (type 2). The remaining 8 tumors did not contain small tumor cells with stem cell features (type 3). In the central parts of tumor nests, carcinoma cells got hepatocellular markers and lost expression of neural cell adhesion molecule, and epithelial cell adhesion molecule, suggesting hepatocellular maturation. Transforming growth factor beta1, a fibrogenic cytokine, was also detected in those small tumor cells. Culture cells extracted as "side population" from hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HuH7 and PLC5) expressed more intensely cytokeratins 7 and 19, neural cell adhesion molecule, epithelial cell adhesion molecule, and transforming growth factor beta1 than did non-side population cells. Small tumor cells with stem cell features in scirrhous hepatocellular carcinoma may correspond to side population of culture cells and might be involved in fibrogenesis of scirrhous hepatocellular carcinoma.
