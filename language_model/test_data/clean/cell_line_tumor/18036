Apoptin, a protein of the chicken anemia virus (CAV), consists of 121 amino acids (aa) and represents a novel, potentially tumor-specific therapeutic and diagnostic agent. The C-terminal part of Apoptin (aa 81-121) is believed to contain a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) (NLS1: aa 82-88 and NLS2: aa 111-121), which is only active in tumor cells after phosphorylation of threonine(108) by tumor-specific cytoplasmic phosphokinases. Furthermore, a nuclear export signal (NES) (aa 97-105) seems to enable nuclear export of Apoptin only in healthy cells. The specificity for tumor cell nuclei also applies to the truncated C-terminal part of Apoptin (aa 81-121), which therefore represents a highly attractive peptide sequence for peptide synthesis. Here we describe for the first time the synthesis of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)- and Dansyl-labelled conjugates containing this C-terminal part of Apoptin, with either phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated threonine(108). The phosphorylated conjugates were synthesized in an attempt to achieve nuclear accumulation in healthy cells, which lack cytoplasmic tumor-specific phosphokinases. Surprisingly, all the conjugates accumulated rapidly within the cell nuclei of both tumor and non-tumor cells from the bladder, brain and prostate and led to cell death. By coupling Apoptin(81-121) to FITC and DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) at either the C- or N-terminus we could exlude that the coupling site is decisive for tumor cell-specific nuclear localization. The labels FITC, DOTA and Dansyl were not responsible for cell death in healthy cells because cell death was not prevented by using an unlabelled Apoptin(81-121) peptide. Cellular and nuclear uptake of the FITC-labelled Apoptin(81-121) peptide was almost completely abolished after altering the NLS2 (replacement of five arginines with serines).
