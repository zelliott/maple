In order to find candidate proteins that are potentially associated with the thermoresistant phenotype in combination with drug resistance, we analyzed the differential protein expression in vitro in the human pancreatic cancer cell line EPP85-181-P and classical and atypical multidrug-resistant variants and their thermoresistant counterparts using proteomics. This study identifies sets of proteins that may lead to the development of thermoresistance. These results provide a fundamental basis to elucidate the molecular mechanism of thermoresistance and chemoresistance phenomena that may assist the therapy of inoperable cancers.
