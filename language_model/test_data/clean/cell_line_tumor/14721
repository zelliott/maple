Immunomodulatory function of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells in cancer has recently been investigated. But the resident mesenchymal stem cells as whole in cancer and in the breast cancer tissue have not been studied well. In the present work we isolated adipose derived stem cells (ASCs) from breast cancer and normal breast tissues to investigate the expressions of IL-4, IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 in ASCs and to see if ASCs isolated from patients can modulate the regulatory molecules on peripheral blood lymphocytes. Our results showed that IL-10 and TGF-β1 have significantly higher mRNA expressions in ASCs isolated from breast cancer patients than those from normal individuals (P value <0.05). The culture supernatant of ASCs isolated from breast cancer patients with pathological stage III induced upregulation of the mRNA expression levels of IL-4, TGF-β1, IL-10, CCR4 and CD25 in PBLs. In addition, the percentage of CD4+CD25(high)Foxp3(+) T regulatory cells was increased in vitro. When the same culture supernatant was added to ASCs isolated from normal subjects augmentation of the mRNA expressions of IL-4, IL-10, IL-8, MMP2, VEGF and SDF-1 in normal ASCs was also observed. These data collectively conclude that resident ASCs in breast cancer tissue may have crucial roles in breast tumor growth and progression by inducing regulatory molecules and promoting anti-inflammatory reaction within the tumor microenvironment. Further investigation is required to see if the immune suppression induced by ASCs is an independent property from tumor cells or ASCs gain their immunosuppressive potential from malignant cells.
