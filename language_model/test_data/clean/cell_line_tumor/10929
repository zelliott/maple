In this study, the inhibitory activity of the methyl esters and derivatives extracted from Euphorbia kansui (Euphorbiaceae) and their effect on apoptosis and cell cycle distribution in the human gastric cancer cell line (SGC-7901) were evaluated.

The inhibitory activity of the methyl esters and derivatives was evaluated by using trypan-blue, MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethyl thiazol-2yl) - 2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide), and FCM (flow cytometry) assays. 5-fluorouracile (5-FU) was used for a positive control.

Six new methyl esters and derivatives were extracted from the root of E. kansui. Subjecting the SGC-7901 cell line to the extract indicated that methyl ester derivatives could initiate growth inhibition and induce apoptosis in these tumor cells. The inhibitory rates as measured from trypan-blue and MTT assays were significantly increased and are comparable to those of the common antitumor agent 5-FU. In addition, the methyl ester extract effectively inhibited the proliferation of SGC-7901 cells by interfering with the progression of the cells through the G1 phase of the cell cycle.

The current study indicates that methyl esters might be a promising chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agent for treating various forms of cancer by causing apoptosis and proliferation inhibition.
