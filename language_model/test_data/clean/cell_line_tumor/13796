This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms behind the stimulation effects of microcystin-LR (a well-known cyanobacterial toxin produced in eutrophic lakes or reservoirs) on cancer cell invasion and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) expression. Boyden chamber assay showed that microcystin-LR exposure (>12.5 nM) evidently enhanced the invasion ability of the melanoma cells (MDA-MB-435). Tumor Metastasis PCR Array demonstrated that 24 h microcystin-LR treatment (25 nM) caused overexpression of eight genes involved in tumor metastasis, including MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-13. Quantitative real-time PCR, Western blotting and gelatin zymography consistently demonstrated that mRNA and protein levels of MMP-2/-9 were increased in the cells after microcystin-LR exposure (P < 0.05 each). Immunofluorescence assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that microcystin-LR could activate nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) by accelerating NF-κB translocation into the nucleus and enhancing NF-κB binding ability. Furthermore, addition of NF-κB inhibitor in culture medium could suppress the invasiveness enhancement and MMP-2/-9 overexpression. This study indicates that microcystin-LR can act as a NF-κB activator to promote MMP-2/-9 expression and melanoma cell invasion, which deserves more environmental health concerns.
