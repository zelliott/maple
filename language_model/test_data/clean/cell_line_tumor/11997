Synthetic investigations of ustiloxin natural products are described. The first total synthesis of ustiloxin F was completed in 15 steps via ethynyl aziridine ring-opening by a phenol derivative. The results of biological tests of synthetic ustiloxins D and F, and two analogs, O-Me-ustiloxin D and 6-Ile-ustiloxin, demonstrated that the free hydroxyl group ortho to the ether linkage is critical for activity and variations at the Val/Ala site produce changes in the biological activity suggesting the need for further perturbations at this site to more extensively study the tubulin binding.
