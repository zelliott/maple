To investigate the expression of p62 in various prostatic tissues, and to demonstrate different immunohistochemical patterns of p62 expression in distinct pathological entities of the prostate. The p62 sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) gene product is a multifunctional protein with ubiquitous expression in normal adult tissue.

Overexpression of p62 was detected in prostate cancer cell lines and tissues by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemical staining for p62 was performed on 73 cases of paraffin-embedded prostatic tissue. p62 was negative or weakly positive only in the nucleus (pattern N) of prostatic gland epithelium in nine normal and hyperplastic prostate specimens, whilst most cancerous tissue showed intense, uniform staining for p62 in the cytoplasm (pattern C). Of the prostate cancer specimens, 91% showed positive pattern C immunoreactivity. Of the cases with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) around cancer, 77% showed pattern C. However, in specimens from the patients without prostate cancer PIN displayed pattern C in only 32% of cases. Western blot analysis showed that all cancer cell lines expressed p62 in the cytoplasm but there was little nuclear expression.

Cytosolic overexpression of p62 is a novel immunohistochemical characteristic in prostatic adenocarcinoma and high-grade PIN, suggesting that p62 might be a novel marker for prostatic malignancy.
