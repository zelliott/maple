B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) and PR domain containing 1 (PRDM1) are considered as master regulators for germinal center (GC) formation and terminal B-cell differentiation. Dysregulation of BCL6 and PRDM1 has been associated with lymphomagenesis. Here, we show for the first time that direct cell-cell contact between follicular dendritic cells (FDC) and B-lymphocytes, by influencing the expression of a set of microRNAs (miRNAs), regulates the expression of BCL6 and PRDM1. We identify that, on cell adhesion to FDC, FDC induces upregulation of PRDM1 expression through downregulation of miR-9 and let-7 families and induces downregulation of BCL-6 through upregulation of miR-30 family in B-lymphocytes and lymphoma cells. We further demonstrate that the miR-30 family directly controls BCL-6 expression and miR-9-1 and let-7a directly control PRDM-1 expression through targeting their 3'UTR, mediating the FDC effect. Our studies define a novel regulatory mechanism in which the FDC, through induction of miRNAs in B-lymphocytes, orchestrates the regulation of transcription factors, promotes germinal center B-cell survival and differentiation. Dysregulation of miRNAs may interfere with B-cell survival and maturation, thus representing a novel molecular mechanism, as well as a potential therapeutic target in B-cell lymphomas.
