Multidrug resistance (MDR) to anticancer drugs is a major obstacle to successful chemotherapy of tumors. Understanding the molecular basis to chemoresistance is likely to provide better treatment. Cell lines resistant to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (CNE2/cDDP) were established from human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell lines CNE2. Comparative proteomics involving 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and ESI-Q-TOF-MS were performed on protein extracted from CNE2 and CNE2/cDDP cell lines to screen drug resistance-related proteins. Keratin 1 (KRT1), cathepsin D (CTSD) and annexin a5 (ANXA5) were identified as three proteins showing higher expression in CNE2/cDDP compared to CNE2. Furthermore, suppression of KRT1 expression by siRNA resulted in decreased MDR in siRNA-CNE2/cDDP cells. And upregulation of KRT1 could result in increased of drug resistance in NPC cell lines. Taken together, KRT1 protein and its activity levels were higher in cDDP-resistant NPC cell lines compared to their parental cell lines. These data clearly linked KRT1 and cDDP resistance mechanisms. KRT1 could serve as a biomarker for chemotherapy sensitivity of NPC.
