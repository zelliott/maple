Bioactivity-guided fractionation of cranberries was used to determine the chemical identity of bioactive constituents. Twenty compounds were isolated using gradient solvent fractionation, silica gel and ODS columns, and preparative RP-HPLC. Their chemical structures were identified using HR-MS, 1D and 2D NMR, and X-ray diffraction analysis. Antiproliferative activities of isolated compounds against HepG2 human liver cancer and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were evaluated. Among the compounds isolated, ursolic acid, quercetin, and 3,5,7,3',4'-pentahydroxyflavonol-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside showed potent antiproliferative activities against HepG2 cell growth, with EC50 values of 87.4 +/- 2.7, 40.9 +/- 1.1, and 49.2 +/- 4.9 microM, respectively. Ursolic acid, quercetin, and 3,5,7,3',4'-pentahydroxyflavonol-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside showed potent inhibitory activity toward the proliferation of MCF-7 cells, with EC50 values of 11.7 +/- 0.1, 137.5 +/- 2.6, and 23.9 +/- 3.9 microM, respectively. Quercetin, 3,5,7,3',4'-pentahydroxyflavonol-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, 3,5,7,3',4'-pentahydroxyflavonol-3-O-beta-D-galactopyranoside, and 3,5,7,3',4'-pentahydroxyflavonol-3-O-alpha-l-arabinofuranoside showed potent antioxidant activities, with EC50 values of approximately 10 microM. These results showed cranberry phytochemical extracts have potent antioxidant and antiproliferative activities.
