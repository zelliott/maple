Developing proteomic biomarkers is valuable for evaluating therapeutic effects of drugs and generating better treatment strategies. However, conventional protein analysis is often challenging due to inadequate sample size of clinical specimens, lack of assay reproducibility, accuracy, and sensitivity. A novel capillary isoelectricfocusing (IEF) immunoassay system (NanoPro) was used to study the dynamic phosphorylation status of signaling molecules in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase and MEK inhibitors. NanoPro showed the same dynamic ERK phosphorylation as Western blotting with good assay reproducibility using 1,000 times less protein. The IEF separation in NanoPro system enables multiple protein phosphorylation isoforms to be resolved and detected simultaneously. With NanoPro, we identified a specific on-target mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) response pattern to MEK inhibitor PD325901, which was not detectable by Western blot analysis. We also revealed a MEK2 signal that may be associated with NSCLC cell sensitivity to the EGF receptor inhibitor erlotinib, and distinguished erlotinib-sensitive cells from intrinsic as well as acquired resistant cells to erlotinib. Moreover, NanoPro could differentiate human ERK1 isoforms from the mouse isoforms based on their isoelectric point differences and showed that erlotinib effectively inhibited ERK phosphorylation in targeted human xenograft cancer cells but not in surrounding mouse stromal cells. With 8 Î¼g of tumor aspirates, we precisely quantified the response of 18 signaling molecules to erlotinib and MEK1 inhibitor treatments in an NSCLC patient. NanoPro's higher sensitivity, better resolution of protein phosphorylation status, and reduced tissue requirement warrant NanoPro's investigation for future drug development and evaluation of drug effects of targeted therapies.
