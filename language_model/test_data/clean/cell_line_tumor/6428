A new class of zinc oxide quantum dots (ZnO QDs) was investigated as nanoprobes for targeting cancer cells in vitro. ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized using conventional sol-gel method and encapsulated using trimethoxy aminopropyl silane. Transferrin, the ligand targeting the cancer cells, was conjugated to the ZnO QDs. In vitro imaging studies using MDA-MB-231 showed the biocompatible ZnO nanoprobe selectively binding to the cell surface receptor and internalizing through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Time-lapsed photobleaching studies indicate the ZnO QDs to be resistant to photobleaching, making them suitable for long term imaging purpose. Investigation of the ZnO nanoprobe as a platform for sensitive bioassays indicates that it can be used as an alternative fluoroprobe for cancer cell targeting and sensing applications.
