Shikonin, the main active ingredient of Lithospermum, and its derivatives have been proved to have antitumor effects, and the anti-tumor mechanisms involve multiple targets. Based on recent literatures, this review focuses on the antitumor effects and its mechanisms. More emphases are given on the aspects of induction of apoptosis, induction of necrosis, acting on matrix metalloproteinase, acting on the protein tyrosine kinase and antiangiogenesis. The current status and problems of shikonin derivatives in antitumor effects are simply summarized and lookout for the development of antitumor drugs with shikonin as leading compounds.
