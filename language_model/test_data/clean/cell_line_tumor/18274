Previous studies have firmly demonstrated that wogonin, a naturally occurring monoflavonoid extracted from the root of the Chinese herb medicine Scutellaria baicalensis, could effectively inhibit the proliferation of several cancer cell lines. However, little is known about the effect of wogonin on differentiation induction of leukemic cells. Here we investigate the potential role of wogonin in the proliferation and differentiation of NB4, a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line derived from a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Our results indicated that wogonin significantly suppressed the proliferation and efficiently induced the differentiation of NB4 cells. NB4 cell growth was inhibited by 55-60% after treatment with 50 microM wogonin for a period of 5 days. The results of the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction test (with 67.13% positive cells by 50 microM wogonin for 5 days), Giemsa staining (with 67.24% positive cells by 50 microM wogonin for 5 days), and the expression of mature-related cell-surface differentiation antigens CD11b and CD14 (with 70.94% CD11b(+) and 5.82% CD14(+) cells by 50 microM wogonin for 5 days) demonstrated an increase in the differentiation-inducing action of wogonin on the NB4 cells, which was accompanied by an increase in mRNA and protein expression of phospholipids scramblase 1 (PLSCR1). Meanwhile, the level of phosphorylated PKC delta (Ser643) was dramatically increased in wogonin treated NB4 cells. Interestingly, wogonin treatment displayed little effect on the apoptosis of NB4 cells. Taken together, the results reported here demonstrated that wogonin could promote the granulocytic differentiation of NB4 cells by up-regulating the expression of PLSCR1 gene.
