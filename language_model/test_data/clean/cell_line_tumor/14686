We have generated cell lines with significantly reduced expression of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), Min-p38 MAPK cells, and used these cells to investigate p38 MAPK's role in tumorigenesis of breast cancer cells. MCF-7 cells were stably transfected with a plasmid producing small interfering RNA that inhibited the expression of p38 MAPK. Control cells were stably transfected with the same plasmid producing non-interfering RNA. The reduction in the p38 MAPK activity caused a significant increase in the expressions of estrogen receptor-α (ERα) and the progesterone receptor, but eliminated the expression of ERβ. Min-p38 MAPK cells showed an enhanced overall growth response to 17β-estradiol (E₂), whereas GH plus epidermal growth factor were largely ineffective growth stimulators in these cells compared to controls. Although the long-term net growth rate of the Min-p38 MAPK cells was increased in response to E₂, their proliferation rate was lower compared to controls in short-term cultures. However, the Min-p38 MAPK cells did show a significant decreased rate of apoptosis after E₂ treatment and a reduction in the basal phosphorylation of p53 tumor suppressor protein compared to controls. When the Min-p38 MAPK cells were xenografted into E₂-treated athymic nude mice, their tumorigenicity was enhanced compared to control cells. Increased tumorigenicity of Min-p38 MAPK cells was caused mainly by a decrease in the apoptosis rate indicating that the lack of the p38 MAPK caused an imbalance to increase the ERα:ERβ ratio and a reduction in the activity of the p53 tumor suppressor protein.
