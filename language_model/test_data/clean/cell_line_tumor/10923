To observe the pharmacodynamic and side effects of Wulong Kangai, a new drug of Chinese traditional herbal medicine, on 4 strains of mice transplantable tumors.

Mice transplantable tumors S180, H22, P388 and Lewis were used in the pharmacodynamic test on the granules of Wulong Kangai. The test on each tumor strain was repeated three times. In each test, 50 mice were used and divided into 5 groups. They were negative control group treated by physiological saline, cyclophosphamide control group and 3 test groups treated respectively with Wulong Kangai at deferent dosages of 10, 25, 40 g x kg(-1) x d(-1) in the treatment of Lewis and P388 and 15, 30, 50 g x kg(-1) x d(-1) in the treatment of S180 and H22.

The tumor weight were inhibited at the rates of 90.1%, 30.8%, 49.8% and 52. 3% in the mice with tumors of Lewis, P388, S180, and H22 by high dosage of Wulong Kangai as compared with negative control group. The inhibitory rates in cyclophosphamide groups were 90.6%, 77.2%, 79.6% and 60.3% respectively. The mice body weights grew slower in high dose groups treated by Wulong Kangai granule.

Wulong Kangai was effective in treating mice transplantable tumors of Lewis, P388, S180 and H22 with a dose-dependent manner. The Lewis was the most sensitive strain to the drug among the 4 kinds of tested tumors. Side effects appeared during 9-11 days of uninterrupted treatment with high dose Wulong Kangai.
