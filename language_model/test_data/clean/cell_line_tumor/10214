The antisense promoter of human LINE-1 (L1) retroelements can direct transcription of adjacent unique genomic sequences generating chimeric RNAs, which can perturb transcription of neighbouring genes. As L1 elements constitute 17% of the human genome, chimeric transcription is potentially widespread, but the extent to which this occurs is largely unknown. Using a genome-wide screen we have isolated novel chimeric transcripts that are unique to breast cancer cell lines, primary tumours and colon cancer cells. Expression of the cancer-specific chimeric transcripts can be induced in non-malignant breast epithelial cells by the demethylating drug 5-azacytidine. These findings indicate that loss of L1 methylation in cancer cells is linked to the expression of L1-chimeric transcripts which may therefore constitute a useful set of markers of malignancy.
