Patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma have a doom prognosis these tumors were previously proved to express high level of CD24. The current study was aimed to demonstrate that the treatment with monoclonal antibodies to CD24 is effective, in vitro, in pancreatic cancer cells, similar to what we had previously shown in the setting of colorectal cancer. Three human pancreatic cancer cell lines, Colo357, Panc1 and MIA-PaCa, were analyzed for their expression levels of CD24 by Western blot analysis. The correlation for the protein available on the cytoplasmic membrane was assessed by ELISA assay to plates coated with fixed cells using anti-CD24 Ab as the first binder. Human cancer cell lines were tested for their response to two different anti-CD24 monoclonal antibodies and a control antibody (mouse anti-GFP). Human pancreatic adenocarcinomas cell lines that express CD24 (Colo357 and Panc1 cells) showed growth inhibition in dose and time dependent manners. These results were repetitive for the two different antibodies. Growth rate was not affected in MIA-PaCa cells that do not express CD24, or when cells were treated with a control antibody. CD24 may play an important role in the carcinogenesis process of pancreatic cancer. It may serve as a useful target in the therapy of pancreatic cancer.
