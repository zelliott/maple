To investigate the inhibitory effect of a recombinant adenoviral vector carrying antisense matrix metalloproteinase-2(MMP2) on the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) in vivo.

The recombinant adenoviral vector carrying antisense MMP2(Ad-MMP2(AS))which had been constructed by us in readiness was used to infect the human HCC cell line (Bel-7402). Then the invasiveness of the Bel-7402 cells was assayed in Matrigel, and the production of MMP2 in the Bel-7402 cells was detected with Western blot analysis and Gelatin zymography. After the Ad-MMP2(AS)-infected Bel-7402 cells being subcutaneously inoculated in nude mice, the production of tumors was under observation, and then Ad-MMP2(AS) was injected intratumorally into the pre-existing tumors.

Compared with PBS or Ad-CMV-infected cells, infection of Bel-7402 cells with Ad-MMP2(AS) significantly reduced MMP2 enzyme activity, the invasiveness resulted in 52% reduction in Matrigel assays, and the tumor volume displayed a 4.3-fold reduction in nude mice. In addition, direct intratumoral injection of Ad-MMP2(AS) into pre-existing tumors significantly impaired the further expansion of the tumor mass and resulted in a 63% reduction in tumor cell growth.

The recombinant adenovirus with antisense MMP2 can effectively inhibit the invasiveness and growth of Bel-7402 cells in vitro and in vivo, and has a therapeutic potential for HCC.
