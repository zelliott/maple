Extracts of Withania adpressa Coss. (Solanaceae), a medicinal plant endemic to Moroccan Sahara, were tested for their cytotoxicity towards a panel of cancer cell lines (Hep2, HT29, RD, Vero and MDCK), using the (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) [MTT assay, Sigma-Aldrich]. The bioassay-guided fractionation of this plant extracts results a novel withanolide 14alpha,15alpha,17beta ,20beta-tetrahydroxy-1-oxo-(22R)-witha-2,5,24-trienolide and the already identified withanolides F and J extract, semi-purified fractions and pure compounds exhibits potent cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines tested, in dose-dependent manner. Morphological features of treated Hep2 cells with the novel withanolide and characteristic DNA fragmentation revealed that the cytotoxicity was due to induction of apoptosis. Taken together, the results suggest that withanolides from W. adpressa Coss. hold potential as antiproliferative agents.
