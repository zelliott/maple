A baculoviral mammalian-cell vector was constructed to express Rta, a protein of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) responsible for the transition from latent infection to lytic replication. EBV lytic replication and cell-growth inhibition was observed in infected D98/HR1 cells. The baculovirus caused little cytotoxicity in the non-targeted HeLa cells, compared to an adenovirus vector. It is concluded that recombinant baculovirus might have the potential as a vector for the therapy of EBV-related cancer.
