DNA damage induces the canonical p53 pathway including elevation of p21 (waf1)  resulting in arrest of cell cycle progression. This can protect cells from subsequent Chk1 inhibition. Some p53 wild-type cancer cells such as HCT116 and U2OS exhibit attenuated p21 (waf1)  induction upon DNA damage due to translational inhibition, and are incapable of maintaining arrest upon Chk1 inhibition. The purpose of this study was to determine whether this attenuated p21 (waf1)  induction also occurred with the non-DNA damaging agent Nutlin-3 which induces p53 by disrupting binding to its negative regulator MDM2. We find that Nutlin-3 circumvented the attenuated induction of p21 (waf1)  protein by increasing its half-life which led to G 1 and G 2 arrest in both cell lines. Interestingly, the p21 (waf1)  protein half-life remained short on Nutlin-3 in p53 wild-type MCF10A cells; these cells achieve high p21 (waf1)  levels through transcriptional upregulation. Consequently, all three p53 wild-type cells but not p53 mutant MDA-MB-231 cancer cells were protected from subsequent incubation with a combination of DNA damage plus a checkpoint inhibitor.
