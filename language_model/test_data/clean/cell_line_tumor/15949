The biological properties and possible pharmacological applications of benzo[kl]xanthene lignans, rare among natural products and synthetic compounds, are almost unexplored. In the present contribution, the possible interaction of six synthetic benzo[kl]xanthene lignans and the natural metabolite rufescidride with DNA has been investigated through a combined STD-NMR and molecular docking approach, paralleled by in vitro biological assays on their antiproliferative activity towards two different cancer cell lines: SW 480 and HepG2. Our data suggest that the benzo[kl]xanthene lignans are suitable lead compounds for the design of DNA selective ligands with potential antitumour properties.
