The transcription factor GLI2 has an important role in the transduction of Hedgehog signaling and thereby regulates tumorigenesis in a wide variety of human tumors. However, the mechanisms controlling GLI2 protein expression and stabilization are incompletely understood. In this study, we show that the mitogen-activated protein kinase MEK1 modulates GLI2 both at the mRNA and protein level. Constitutively activated MEK1 prolonged the half-life of GLI2 and increased its nuclear translocation, accompanied by attenuated ubiquitination of GLI2 protein. RSK2, a protein kinase lying downstream of MEK-ERK cascade, mimicked the effect of MEK on GLI2 stabilization. MEK1 and RSK2 failed to augment the half-life of GLI2 lacking GSK-3β phosphorylation sites, indicating that MEK-RSK stabilizes GLI2 by controlling targeting GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation and ubiquitination of GLI2. The significance of MEK-RSK stabilization was demonstrated in experiments showing that activation of MEK-RSK paralleled higher protein level of GLI2 in several multiple myelomas (MM) cells relative to normal B cells. Moreover, combined treatment with RSK and GLI inhibitors led to an enhanced apoptosis of MM cells. Thus, our results indicate that MEK-RSK cascade positively regulates GLI2 stabilization and represses its degradation via inhibiting GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation and ubiquitination of GLI2.
