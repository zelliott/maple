Three-component coupling of aldehyde, 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole has been achieved using a catalytic amount of sulfamic acid under solvent free conditions to produce a novel series of 6-aryl-benzo[h][1,2,4]-triazolo[5,1-b]quinazoline-7,8-dione derivatives in good yields and with high regioselectivity. These compounds are found to exhibit potent antitumoral properties.
