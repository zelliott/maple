The poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been associated with recurrence and metastasis. Recently, we established a pair of HCC cell lines from a primary (H2-P) and its matched metastatic (H2-M) HCC tumors. A high density of cDNA microarray with 9184 human cDNA was used to identify the differentially expressed genes between H2-P and H2-M. Comparing with H2-P, eight upregulated and six downregulated genes were detected in H2-M. One interesting finding is the overexpression of Vimentin (VIM), a well-defined intermediate filament, which has been linked to a more aggressive status in various tumors. The correlation of overexpression of VIM and HCC metastasis was studied by immunohistochemistry using a tissue microarray with 200 primary HCCs and 60 pairs of primary and matched metastatic HCC samples. Tissue microarray demonstrated that the overexpression of VIM was significantly associated with HCC metastasis ( p<0.01). This finding strongly suggests that the overexpression of VIM may play an important role in the metastasis of HCC.
