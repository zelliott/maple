(6,7-Disubstituted-quinolin-4-yloxy-phenyl)(4-substituted-phenyl)amine derivatives were synthesized and evaluated by a cellular autophosphorylation assay for FGF-R2 in the human scirrhous gastric carcinoma cell line, OCUM-2MD3. We also performed metabolic stability studies showing that substitutions at the 7-position of quinoline affect its biological stability. In this study, we achieved a remarkable improvement in the solubility and metabolic stability of the diphenylamine derivative. The most promising compound 15e showed a significant decrease in tumor volume when orally administered.
