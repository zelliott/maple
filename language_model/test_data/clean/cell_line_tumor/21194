The aim of the present study was to evaluate for the first time the in vitro cytotoxic activity of fractions and isolated flavonols from Salsola oppositifolia Desf. (Amaranthaceae). The n-hexane fraction demonstrated an effective cytotoxic activity on the large lung carcinoma and amelanotic melanoma cell lines with IC50 values of 19.1 microg/ml and 24.4 microg/ml, respectively. Also the dichloromethane fraction exhibited cytotoxic activity against COR-L23 (IC50 30.4 microg/ml) and C32 (IC50 33.2 microg/ml) cells, while the EtOAc fraction demonstrated a selective cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 cells (IC50 67.9 microg/ml). The major active constituents of this fraction were isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside (1) and isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside (2), which showed an interesting activity against the cell line MCF-7 with IC50 values of 18.2 and 25.2 microg/ml, respectively. Compound 2 exhibited a strong activity against the hormone-dependent prostate carcinoma LNCaP cell line with an IC50 of 20.5 microg/ml. Constituents of S. oppositifolia were identified by GC-MS and NMR analyses.
