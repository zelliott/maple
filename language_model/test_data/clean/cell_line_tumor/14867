We investigated the effectiveness of ultrasound-mediated destruction of bubble liposome (UBL) for siRNA transfer by observing reduction in the luciferase activity of human bladder tumor RT-112 cells transfected with the luciferase gene (RT-112Luc) following luciferase siRNA transfer into the cells.

siRNA was transferred to 26% of RT-112Luc cells by UBL and the luciferase activity of RT-112Luc cells was significantly suppressed by UBL using the luciferase siRNA, compared with that using nonspecific siRNA in vitro (p = 0.036). The luciferase activity of RT-112Luc tumor was suppressed by UBL using luciferase siRNA compared with that using nonspecific siRNA 2 days after the in vivo treatment.

This study showed that UBL is suitable for siRNA transfer to mammalian cells.
