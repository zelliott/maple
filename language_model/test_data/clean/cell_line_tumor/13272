Evidence suggests that mistletoe extract has the potential to be used as             an anticancer agent. Abnobaviscum F® is a European mistletoe extract from the             host tree Fraxinus. We investigated the effect of Abnobaviscum F on the growth             and survival of different leukemia cell lines. Abnobaviscum F treatment strongly             reduced survival and induced apoptosis of K562 (human myeloid leukemia), RPMI-8226             (human plasmacytoma) and L1210 (murine lymphocytic leukemia) cells in culture.             Using K562 cells to further investigate the mechanism of action of Abnobaviscum F,             we showed that Abnobaviscum F-induced cell death was associated with the activation             of caspase-9, JNK-1/2 and p38 MAPK, as well as with the downregulation of Mcl-1,             and inhibition of ERK-1/2 and PKB phosphorylation. Moreover, Abnobaviscum F treatment             led to both a reduction of cellular glutathione (GSH) and the induction of ER             stress (GRP78 and CHOP induction and eIF-2α phosphorylation). By contrast, Abnobaviscum F             did not impact the expression of the DR4 and DR5 death receptors. The Abnobaviscum F-induced             apoptosis of K562 cells was blocked by pretreatment with either GSH, z-VAD-fmk             or SP600125. Our results, therefore, show that Abnobaviscum F induces apoptosis             of K562 cells through the activation of the intrinsic caspase pathway, the phosphorylation             of JNK-1, the reduction of cellular GSH, and the induction of ER stress.
