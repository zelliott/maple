In the present study, it was investigated whether 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N'N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA-AM), an intracellular Ca(2+) chelator, possesses protective effect against caffeine-induced apoptosis in the central nervous system. Through morphological and biochemical analyses, cells treated with caffeine exhibited several apoptotic features. On the other hand, cells treated with caffeine and BAPTA-AM, showed decreased occurrence of apoptotic features. In addition, it was shown that BAPTA-AM treatment inhibits caffeine-induced increase of caspase-3 enzyme activity. These results show that caffeine induces apoptotic death in human SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells and BAPTA-AM prevents apoptosis by attenuating caffeine-induced caspase-3 activation.
