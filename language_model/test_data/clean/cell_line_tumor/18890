Cancers are a heterogeneous mix of cells, some of which exhibit cancer stem cell-like characteristics including ATP-dependent drug efflux and elevated tumorigenic potential. To determine whether aerodigestive squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) contain a subpopulation of cancer stem cell-like cells, we performed Hoechst dye efflux assays using four independent cell lines. Results revealed the presence of a rare, drug effluxing stem cell-like side population (SP) of cells within all cell lines tested (SCC-SP cells). These cells resembled previously characterised epithelial stem cells, and SCC-SP cell abundance was positively correlated with overall cellular density and individual cell quiescence. Serial SCC-SP fractionation and passaging increased their relative abundance within the total cell population. Purified SCC-SP cells also exhibited increased clonogenic potential in secondary cultures and enhanced tumorigenicity in vivo. Despite this, SCC-SP cells remained chemotherapeutically sensitive upon ATP-dependent transporter inhibition. Overall, these findings suggest that the existence of ATP transporter-dependent cancer stem-like cells may be relatively common, particularly within established tumours. Future chemotherapeutic strategies should therefore consider coupling identification and targeting of this potential stem cell-like population with standard treatment methodologies.
