Combined epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) with chemotherapy is believed to be more effective in treating non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with sensitizing-EGFR mutation (SEM). This hypothesis failed to be realized clinically and needs to be examined in vitro.

Using the tetrazolium colorimetric assay and classical isobole method, we investigated the combination effects of 6 gefitinib-chemotherapeutic doublets (gefitinib/cisplatin, gemcitabine, pemetrexed, paclitaxel, docetaxel, or vinorelbine) in a panel of 15 NSCLC cell lines.

Upon treatment with the 6 gefitinib-chemotherapeutic doublets, the 12 cell lines that did not harbor SEM displayed a broad spectrum of group results, from obvious synergism to robust antagonism. The values of group mean combination index (mCIs) ranged from 0.769 to 1.201. In contrast, the 3 cell lines with SEM showed a tendency toward consistent antagonism to the tested doublets, impressively, with a narrow range of higher group mCIs (0.993-1.141). In the presence of gefitinib, the SEM or gefitinib-sensitive group was more chemo-refractory than the non-SEM (index of chemo-refractoriness (RI): 69.33 versus 42.67; P = 0.036) or gefitinib-resistant group (68.25 versus 40.64, P = 0.0108), respectively. The results of using the gefitinib/drug combinations with the gefitinib-sensitive non-SEM cell line H322 and the gefitinib-resistant EGFR mutant H820 shared patterns similar to those with the SEM and non-SEM cell lines, respectively.

Gefitinib-treated EGFR-TKI-sensitive NSCLC cells showed a wide spectrum of chemo-refractoriness, suggesting that concomitantly combined EGFR-TKI-chemotherapy might not be a good treatment strategy for NSCLC harboring SEM.
