To determine pathways cooperating with p53 in cellular senescence when the retinoblastoma protein (pRb)/p16INK4a pathway is defunct, we stably transfected the p16INK4a-negative C6 rat glioma cell line with a temperature-sensitive mutant p53. Activation of p53(Val-135) induces a switch in pocket protein expression from pRb and p107 to p130(Rb2) and stalls the cells in late G1, early S-phase at high levels of cyclin E. Maintenance of the arrest depends on the functions of p130(Rb2) repressing cyclin A. Inactivation of p53 in senescent cultures restores the pocket proteins to initial levels and initiates progression into S-phase, but the cells fail to resume proliferation, likely due to DNA damage becoming apparent in the arrest and activating apoptosis subsequent to the release from p53-dependent growth suppression. The data indicate that p53 can cooperate selectively with p130(Rb2) to induce cellular senescence, a pathway that may be relevant when the pRb/p16INK4a pathway is defunct.
