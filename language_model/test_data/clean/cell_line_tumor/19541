To explore the mechanisms of the effects of Runing Recipe in anti-invasion and anti-recurrence of breast cancer by experimental research in vitro.

SD female rats were randomly divided into Runing Recipe-treated group and its decomposed formulas Kidney-Warming Recipe and Liver-Soothing Recipe-treated groups, tamoxifen (TAM) -treated group, cyclophosphamide (CTX) -treated group, and normal control group to make medicated serums. Methods of matrigel basement membrane and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were employed to investigate the gene expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) after MDA-MB-435 cells were treated with the medicated serums.

The gene expression of VEGF was dropped in CTX-treated, TAM-treated and Liver-Smoothing Recipe-treated groups. The gene expression of TIMP-1 was up-regulated in CTX-treated, Runing Recipe-treated and Kidney-Warming Recipe-treated groups; while MMP-9 was down-regulated in these groups.

The mechanisms of Runing Recipe in inhibiting the cancer cell invasion may be related to down-regulating the gene expressions of VEGF and MMP-9, and up-regulating the gene expression of TIMP-1.
