Novel bisbenzimidazoles (4-6), characterized by 3,4-ethylenedioxy-extension of thiophene core, revealed pronounced affinity and strong thermal stabilization effect toward ds-DNA. They interact within ds-DNA grooves as dimmers or even oligomers and agglomerate along ds-RNA. Compounds 4-6 have shown moderate to strong antiproliferative effect toward panel of eight carcinoma cell lines. Compound 5 displayed the best inhibitory potential and in equitoxic concentration (IC(50)=1 x 10(-6)M) induced accumulation of cells in G2/M phase after 48 h of incubation. Fluorescence microscopy showed that 5 entered into live HeLa cells within 30 min, but did not accumulate in nuclei even after 2.5h. Compound 5 inhibited the growth of Trypanosome cruzi epimastigotes (IC(50)=4.3 x 10(-6)M).
