Fluorescent ligands for the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) were synthesized containing either fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), 4-nitrobenzo[1,2,5]oxadiazole (NBD) or the red shifted dye sulforhodamine 101 (Texas Red) conjugated to PU-H71. Two of the compounds, PU-H71-FITC2 (9) and PU-H71-NBD1 (8), were shown to be suitable for fluorescence-activated flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Thus these molecules serve as useful probes for studying Hsp90 in heterogeneous live cell populations.
