A conjugate of DHA and doxorubicin (DHA-Dox) was synthesized, and its antitumor activity was evaluated in vitro against L1210 leukemia cells and in experimental animal tumor models including L1210 leukemia and B16 melanoma. DHA-Dox showed a greatly improved antitumor efficacy compared to free doxorubicin.
