To evaluate antitumor activity of Gracilaria edulis in Swiss albino mice with Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC).

Tumors were induced in mice by intraperitoneal injection of EAC cells. Ethanol extract of Gracilaria edulis (EEGE) was administered to the experimental animals in different doses after 24 h of tumor inoculation. The antitumor effect of the EEGE was evaluated by assessing in vitro cytotoxicity, survival time, biochemical parameters and hepatic enzyme levels.

EEGE increased the life span of EAC-bearing mice compared with that of the model control mice ( p<0.05 or  p<0.01). EEGE treatment also converted the changes of biochemical parameters and hepatic enzyme levels in the EAC-bearing mice ( p<0.05 or  p<0.01). EEGE induced inhibition of tumor formation in EAC-bearing mice compared with that of the model control group ( p<0.05 or  p<0.01).

The present study scientifically proved the antitumor activity of marine algae G. edulis and the effect can be correlated with doses.
