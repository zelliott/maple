In this study, silver-doped silica- and phosphate-based nanobioactive glass compositions (58SiO2-(33- x)CaO-9P2O5-xAg2O) (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 mol%) were synthesised by a simple and cost-effective sol-gel method. The prepared samples were characterised by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer studies. All the compositions of the glass samples revealed amorphous phase with spherical morphology and a particle size less than 100 nm. The prepared glass samples reveal the specific surface area in the range of 55.31-90.69 m2 g(-1). The bioactivity of glass samples was confirmed through the formation of the hydroxyapatite layer on glass surfaces during in vitro studies in which silver doped glasses (2 and 3 mol%) showed better bioactivity. A better biocompatibility was achieved in human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line in case of silver-free glass sample while comparing the biological behaviour of Ag2O-doped glasses. Further, the Ag2O-doped nanobioactive glasses revealed significant antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Ag2O substitutions showed better in vitro bioactivity and remained slightly toxic to human cells at a concentration of 100 microg mL(-1). Silver-doped nanobioactive glass shows good antimicrobial property as well as no significant toxic for implant applications.
