Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a series of molecular changes allowing epithelial cancer cells to acquire properties of mesenchymal cells: increased motility, invasion, and protection from apoptosis. Transcriptional regulators such as Slug mediate EMT, working in part to repress E-cadherin transcription. We report a novel, noninvasive in vivo rectal cancer model to explore the role of Slug in colorectal cancer (CRC) tumor development.

For the generation of DLD-1 cells overexpressing Slug (Slug DLD-1), a Slug or empty (Empty DLD-1) pCMV-3Tag-1 (kanamycin-resistant) vector was used for transfection. Cells were evaluated for Slug and E-cadherin expression, and cell migration and invasion. For the in vivo study, colon cancer cells (parental DLD-1, Slug DLD-1, empty DLD-1, and HCT-116) were submucosally injected into the posterior rectum of nude mice using endoscopic guidance. After 28 d, tumors were harvested and tissue was analyzed.

Slug expression in our panel of colon cancer cell lines was inversely correlated with E-cadherin expression and enhanced migration/invasion. Slug DLD-1 cells demonstrated a 21-fold increased Slug and 19-fold decreased E-cadherin expression compared with empty DLD-1. Similarly, the Slug DLD-1 cells had significantly enhanced cellular migration and invasion. In the orthotopic rectal cancer model, Slug DLD-1 cells formed rectal tumors in 9/10 (90%) of the mice (mean volume = 458 mm(3)) compared with only 1/10 (10%) with empty DLD-1 cells.

Slug mediates EMT with enhanced in vivo rectal tumor formation. Our noninvasive in vivo model enables researchers to explore the molecular consequences of altered genes in a clinically relevant rectal cancer in an effort to develop novel therapeutic approaches for patients with rectal cancer.
