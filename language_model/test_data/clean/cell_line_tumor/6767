The purpose of this study was to establish whether a pulsed dose rate (PDR) treatment of 1.5 Gy given every 3 h in combination with 41 degrees C mild hyperthermia or a continuous low dose rate (LDR) treatment with mild hyperthermia could radiosensitize two isogenic human breast carcinoma cell lines in comparison to pulsed dose rate or low dose rate irradiation alone. The radiation resistant cell line was derived from the parental cell line and was transfected to over-express DNA polymerase beta. The end-points assessed were the survival of the cells using the clonogenic assay, the amount of residual DSB(s) using the comet assay and gene expression of polymerase beta using RT-PCR. Results showed that the PDR and LDR treatments combined with mild hyperthermia caused significant radiosensitization when compared to PDR and LDR irradiation alone in terms of the clonogenic and comet assays with both cell lines. RT-PCR results showed that polymerase beta levels of expression were not elevated in response to these treatments, implying that this polymerase may not be involved in sub-lethal damage repair or thermal radiosensitization. These results suggest a potential clinical advantage when combining LDR or PDR with hyperthermia, since they indicate that hyperthermia is an effective radiosensitizer.
