GTPases act as important switches in many signaling events in cells. Although small and heterotrimeric G proteins are subjects of intensive studies, little is known about the large IFN-inducible GTPases. In this article, we show that the IFN-γ-inducible guanylate binding protein 1 (GBP-1) is a regulator of T cell activation. Silencing of GBP-1 leads to enhanced activation of early T cell Ag receptor/CD3 signaling molecules, including Lck, that is translated to higher IL-2 production. Mass spectrometry analyses showed that regulatory cytoskeletal proteins, like plastin-2 that bundles actin fibers and spectrin β-chain, brain 1 that links the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton, are binding partners of GBP-1. The spectrin cytoskeleton influences cell spreading and surface expression of TCR/CD3 and the leukocyte phosphatase CD45. We found higher cell spreading and enhanced surface expression of TCR/CD3 and CD45 in GBP-1 silenced T cells that explain their enhanced TCR/CD3 signaling. We conclude that GBP-1 is a downstream processor of IFN-γ via which T cells regulate cytoskeleton-dependent cell functions.
