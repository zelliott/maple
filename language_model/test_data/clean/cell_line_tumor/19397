In order to obtain new compounds with antitumoural action the N-(meta-acylaminobenzoyl)-alpha-acylaminobenzoyl)-alpha-aminoacids 4-9 were prepared. These compounds were subsequently converted into the corresponding Delta(2)-oxazolin-5-ones 10-15, which in turn were submitted to a ring opening reaction with di-(beta-chloroethyl)amine to afford the peptide supported N-mustards 16-21, which showed low toxicity and cytostatic activity similar to that of sarcolisine against the Ehrlich ascite and Walker 253 carcinosarcoma.
