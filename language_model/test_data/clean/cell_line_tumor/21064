To observe the effects of the anti-liver cancer pharmacodynamic action of the Rougan Jiedu formula through the experiments of inhibiting cell proliferation of the tumour cell in vitro.

The pharmaceutic serum of Rougan Jiedu formula was prepared and the influence of the pharmaceutic serum of Rougan Jiedu formula to the cell proliferation of hepatoma carcinoma cell HepG2, SMMC-7721 was observed.

Rougan Jiedu formula blood-serum could remarkably inhibit the proliferation of the cell line of HepG2, SMMC-7721, the maximum inhibition ratio to the HepG2 was 69.73%, the maximum inhibition ratio to the SMMC-7721 was 69.73%. Compared to the blank group and PBS group, the difference was significant (P < 0.01); the effects of high dose, compared to the 5-FU group, the difference had no significance (P > 0.05). The inhibition ratio of Chinese medicine groups followed the increase of the doses.

The Rougan Jiedu formula has good effects on inhibiting the proliferation of the tumour cell in vitro.
