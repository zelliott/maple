We report a dual-ligand nanoparticle array approach for discerning cells that have different surface receptor profiles surrounding a common primary receptor expressed at high or low levels. The achieved differentiation provides nanoparticles the ability for potential applications in treatment of patients at a personalized medicine level for drug delivery and radiation therapy with a much better safety profile.
