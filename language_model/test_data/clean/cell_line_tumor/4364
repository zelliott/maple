A simple and "green" strategy has been reported for the first time to fabricate upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) by utilizing nucleotides as bio-templates. The influence of the functionalities present on the nucleotide on the production of nanoparticles was investigated in detail. Through the effects of nucleotides, the obtained nanoparticles possessed a porous structure. The use of the as-prepared UCNPs for cell imaging, drug delivery and versatile therapy applications were demonstrated. In view of the bright up-conversion luminescence as well as the excellent biocompatibility, and the good colloidal stability of the as-prepared UCNPs, we envision that our synthesis protocol might advance both the fields of UCNPs and biomolecule-based nanotechnology for future studies.
