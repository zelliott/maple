Helicobacter pylori vacuolating cytotoxin, VacA, which causes vacuolation of gastric epithelial cells and other types of cultured cells, is known to stimulate apoptosis via a mitochondria-dependent pathway. In the present study, we examined the mechanisms of VacA-induced mitochondrial damage. Intracellular VacA localization was monitored by immunostaining and confocal microscopy; in AZ-521 cells in which cytochrome c release was stimulated, most of VacA was localized to vacuoles rather than mitochondria. VacA reduced the membrane potential of isolated mitochondria without inducing cytochrome c release, suggesting that it did not act directly to induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria and that in intact cells, VacA-induced cytochrome c release involved apoptosis-related factor(s), such as a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein. In agreement, flow cyto-metric analyses using antibodies specific for activated Bax revealed that intracellular Bax was activated by VacA in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Using active form-specific antibodies, we also observed that the Bcl-2 family protein, Bak, was activated. By confocal microscopy, Bax and Bak were activated in AZ-521 cells in which cyto-chrome c release was induced by VacA. In addition, small interfering RNA-induced silencing of the bax gene resulted in reduction of VacA-stimulated cytochrome c release, consistent with a contribution of VacA-induced Bax activation to cytochrome c release. NH4Cl enhanced both VacA-induced vacuolation and Bax activation, whereas Bax activation was not inhibited by bafilomycin A1, which inhibited vacuolation caused by VacA. These results suggest that VacA acts through different signaling pathways to induce apoptosis via Bax activation, independent of vacuolation.
