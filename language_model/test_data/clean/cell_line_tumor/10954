The microwave-assisted synthesis of a family of 2,8-substituted thiazoloquinazolinones is described. The preliminary evaluation of the antiproliferative activity and the capacity of these molecules to inhibit CDKs and GSK-3 are reported. A lead compound was identified, constituting a scaffold from which more potent inhibitors could be designed.
