Copper(II) complexes with substituted terpyridine ligands, namely [Cu(itpy)(dmp)](NO3)2 (1) and [Cu(ptpy)(dmp)](NO3)2 (2) have been synthesized and characterized. The interaction of the complexes with CT-DNA has been explored using spectroscopic techniques and viscosity. Complexes 1 and 2 bind in the grooves of DNA, interestingly 1 in the minor and 2 in the major groove. Both the complexes have been found to promote DNA cleavage; complex 1 through hydrolytic and 2 oxidative. Complexes 1 and 2 have been found to be cytotoxic and bring about apoptosis of human lung cancer cell line A549.
