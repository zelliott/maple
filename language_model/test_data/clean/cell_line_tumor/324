GnRH receptors (GnRH-R) have been found in various malignancies, including prostate cancer (PCa). They mediate the direct antitumor effects of GnRH analogs. Nevertheless, few reports concern drug-induced modulation of GnRH-R levels. In this study, we investigated GnRH-R expression in androgen-sensitive (LNCaP) and -insensitive (PC-3) PCa cells treated for 4 and 6 days with a GnRH agonist (Leuprorelin acetate, LA, 10(-11) or 10(-6) M), Dihydrotestosterone (DHT, 10(-9) M), Cyproterone acetate (CA, 10(-7) M), and Epidermal growth factor (EGF, 10 ng/ml), either alone or combined. The RT-PCR analysis showed no variation in GnRH-R mRNA levels of both treated LNCaP and PC-3 cells. On the contrary, immunoblotting indicated that in LNCaP and PC-3 cells, LA upregulated membrane GnRH-R expression (up to 92%). In androgen-sensitive cells, DHT induced a GnRH-R increase (up to 119%) always comparable to that occurring in the presence of CA. GnRH-R upregulation by LA/DHT or CA/DHT association was similar to that promoted by the single agents. In PC-3 cells, EGF upregulated GnRH-R (up to 110%). A prolonged treatment (for 12 days) determined a greater EGF-induced increase in GnRH-R levels (142%). Lower (or no) receptor enhancement occurred when LA and EGF were associated. Our findings indicate that LA post-transcriptionally upregulates its own membrane receptor in androgen-sensitive and -insensitive PCa cells, counteracting the receptor enhancement produced by DHT and EGF. The effects, obtained with a relatively long and continuous treatment, may have implications in the choice of therapy modality with GnRH analogs and may render the receptor a novel therapeutic target, particularly in hormone-refractory PCa.
