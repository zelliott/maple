A new trinuclear platinum compound [{trans-PtCl(NH(3))(2)}(2){trans-Pt(thiazole) (2)}{H(2)N(CH(2))(6)NH(2)}(2)]Cl(3) (NO(3)) has been synthesized and characterized. The activity of the compound against three human ovarian cancer cell lines A2780, A2780(cisR) and A2780(ZD0473R), its cell uptake and level of binding with DNA have been determined. JH5 is found to be less active than cisplatin against parent A2780 cell line but more active than cisplatin against the A2780(cisR) and A2780(ZD0473R) resistant cell lines indicated by the lower resistance factors. The results indicate that at the level of its activity JH5 has been better able to overcome mechanisms of resistance operating in A2780(cisR) and A2780(ZD0473R) cell lines. JH5 has higher cellular accumulation of platinum than cisplatin in the A2780(cisR) and A2780(ZD0473R) resistant cell lines but lower than cisplatin in the parents A2780 cell line. Cisplatin binds with DNA forming mainly bifunctional intrastrand 1,2-Pt(GG) and 1,2-Pt(AG) adducts that cause local bending of DNA strand. In contrast, JH5 is expected to bind with DNA to form mainly interstrand long-range G-Pt..Pt..Pt(G) adducts that would induce more of a global change in DNA conformation.
