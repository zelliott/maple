Paraoxonase-1 (PON1), an enzyme that metabolizes organophosphate insecticides, is secreted by the liver and transported in the blood complexed to HDL. In humans and mice, low plasma levels of PON1 have also been linked to the development of atherosclerosis. We previously reported that hepatic Pon1 expression was decreased when C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet supplemented with cholic acid (CA). In the current study, we used wild-type and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) null mice to demonstrate that this repression is dependent upon CA and FXR. PON1 mRNA levels were also repressed when HepG2 cells, derived from a human hepatoma, were incubated with natural or highly specific synthetic FXR agonists. In contrast, fibroblast growth factor-19 (FGF-19) mRNA levels were greatly induced by these same FXR agonists. Furthermore, treatment of HepG2 cells with recombinant human FGF-19 significantly decreased PON1 mRNA levels. Finally, deletion studies revealed that the proximal -230 to -96 bp region of the PON1 promoter contains regulatory element(s) necessary for promoter activity and bile acid repression. These data demonstrate that human PON1 expression is repressed by bile acids through the actions of FXR and FGF-19.
