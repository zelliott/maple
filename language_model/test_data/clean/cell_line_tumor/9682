Boerhaavia diffusa L. (Nyctinaceae) is a plant of tropical region used in Indian traditional medicine for the treatment of human ailments including abdominal tumor, jaundice, dyspepsia, menstrual disorders, etc. This plant also has antilymphoproliferative, antimetastatic and immunomodulatory effects.

This study aimed to assess the antiproliferative and antiestrogenic properties of methanol extract of Boerhaavia diffusa (BME) in MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines.

The effective concentration range of BME on cell viability was analyzed using MTT assay. Hydroxylapatite assay (HAP) was carried out to confirm the competitive binding of BME to the estrogen receptor (ER). The effect of BME on the expression of a selected estrogen responsive gene pS2 was analyzed by RT-PCR. The ability of BME to alter the cell cycle phases and distributions were studied using FACS analysis.

Treatment with varying concentrations of BME (20-320 microg/mL) resulted in moderate to very strong growth inhibition in MCF-7 cell lines. BME competed with [(3)H]-estradiol for binding to ER with IC(50) value of 320 +/- 25 microg/mL. RT-PCR analysis revealed that BME reduced the mRNA expression of pS2 indicating the antiestrogenic action of BME. BME treatment for 48 h resulted in a remarkable increase in the number of MCF-7 cells in the G0-G1 fraction from 69.1% to 75.8%, with a reciprocal decrease of cells in all other phases indicating cell cycle arrest at G0-G1 phase.

The results demonstrate that Boerhaavia diffusa possess antiproliferative and antiestrogenic properties and suggest that it may have therapeutic potential in estrogen dependent breast cancers.
