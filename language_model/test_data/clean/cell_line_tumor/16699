Several typical characteristics of prostate tissue have been identified             including the ability to accumulate zinc(II). However, this feature of prostate             cells is lost during carcinogenesis and, thus, prostate cells are unable to accumulate             zinc(II) ions in high levels. Therefore, we can expect that zinc(II) ions can             significantly contribute to the progression of tumour disease and to the ability             of prostate cell lines to metastasize. In this study, we aimed our attention on             determining the expression of Bcl-2, c-Fos, c-Jun, Ki-67, NF-ÎºB and p53 genes             in two prostate cell lines, as the 22Rv1 cell line, a model of aggressive partially             androgen-sensitive prostate cancer and the PNT1A cell line, a normal prostate             cell line model. Moreover, we were interested in the mechanisms through which             exposure of these cell lines to zinc(II) ions could influence expression of the             above-mentioned genes. We found that zinc(II) ions caused elevated expression             of Ki-67, a marker of proliferation, extremely low expression of p53, high expression             of Bcl-2 and no changes in the expression of p53. Our experimental data show different             effect of zinc(II) ions on expression of the above-mentioned regulatory genes,             which may give us more information on their impact on cancer development and progression             with possible using for cancer therapy.
