Effects of the tyrphostin adaphostin and bortezomib were examined in Bcr/Abl+ leukemia cell resistant to imatinib mesylate secondary to Bcr/Abl point mutations. Adaphostin was equally effective in inducing mitochondrial damage, caspase activation, JNK activation, and Raf-1, phospho-Stat3 and -Stat5 inactivation in mutant and wild-type cells, but differentially down-regulated phospho-Bcr/Abl. Adaphostin and bortezomib synergistically induced apoptosis in wild-type and mutant cells, including T315I mutants. Notably, adaphostin+/-bortezomib potently induced ROS and lethality in mutant cells, effects attenuated by the antioxidant NAC. These findings indicate that adaphostin+/-bortezomib circumvent imatinib resistance due to Bcr/Abl point mutations most likely through ROS generation.
