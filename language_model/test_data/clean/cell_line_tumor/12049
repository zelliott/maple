An acute myeloid leukemic HB-1 cell line was cloned and established from the spleen cells of irradiated CBA/N mice. Acute myeloma leukemia-like syndrome would be induced in normal CBA/N mice after intravenous injection of HB-1 cells, and the death of mouse happened within about two weeks. In general, leukemic cells transplanted into the mice would infiltrate into the hematopoietic organs, lungs, kidneys and liver. An interesting observation in our study was that HB-1 cells were present not only in the lung, kidney, and liver but also in the cerebrum and cerebellum. It was beyond our expectation that the leukemic cells could go through the blood-brain barrier in most circumstances. On the basis of the observation, we expect that HB-1 cells could be used as a very useful model to elucidate the mechanism of infiltrating the blood-brain barrier for certain type of cells.
