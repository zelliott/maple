Vinorelbine is a chemotherapeutic vinca alkaloid clinically prescribed for non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer. Here we studied the mechanism for vinorelbine-induced apoptosis in a human T-cell lymphoma. Although vinorelbine induces DNA fragmentation that is inhibited by specific peptide inhibitors for caspases-9 and -3 in Jurkat cells, caspase-8 deficiency retards vinorelbine-induced apoptosis. Activation of caspase-8 is also observed in vinorelbine-treated cells, and the activity is diminished when the caspase-3 activity is blocked by a specific peptide inhibitor, Ac-DNLC-CHO. Blocking of the Fas receptor with an antagonistic anti-Fas antibody does not affect vinorelbine-induced DNA fragmentation. These results suggest that vinorelbine-induced apoptosis is enhanced by the activation of caspase-8 via caspase-9-mediated activation of caspase-3, but not through a Fas-triggered signal. Western blotting suggests that vinorelbine cleaves caspase-3, -9 and -8 and reduces the amount of mitochondrial cytochrome c. Caspase-8 deficiency suppresses all of these events. A downstream substrate for caspase-8, Bid, is also cleaved in vinorelbine-treated cells, but the Bid truncation is also observed in caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells. Importantly, recombinant caspases-3 and -9, as well as caspase-8, directly cleaves recombinant Bid in vitro. These results suggest that caspases-3 and -9 participate in Bid truncation, indicating a new mechanism for vinorelbine-induces apoptosis.
