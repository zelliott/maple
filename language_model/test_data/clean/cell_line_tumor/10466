Mucinous ovarian carcinomas have a distinct clinical pattern compared with other subtypes of ovarian carcinoma. Here, we evaluated (i) stage-specific clinical significance of mucinous ovarian carcinomas in a large cohort and (ii) the functional role of Src kinase in preclinical models of mucinous ovarian carcinoma.

A total of 1,302 ovarian cancer patients including 122 (9.4%) cases of mucinous carcinoma were evaluated for survival analyses. Biological effects of Src kinase inhibition were tested using dasatinib-based therapy in a novel orthotopic mucinous ovarian cancer model (RMUG-S-ip2).

Patients with advanced-stage mucinous ovarian cancer had significantly worse survival than those with serous histology: median overall survival, 1.67 versus 3.41 years, P = 0.002; median survival time after recurrence of 0.53 versus 1.66 years, P < 0.0001. Among multiple ovarian cancer cell lines, RMUG-S-ip2 mucinous ovarian cancer cells showed the highest Src kinase activity. Moreover, oxaliplatin treatment induced phosphorylation of Src kinase. This induced activity by oxaliplatin therapy was inhibited by concurrent administration of dasatinib. Targeting Src with dasatinib in vivo showed significant antitumor effects in the RMUG-S-ip2 model but not in the serous ovarian carcinoma (SKOV3-TR) model. Combination therapy of oxaliplatin with dasatinib further showed significant effects on reducing cell viability, increasing apoptosis, and in vivo antitumor effects in the RMUG-S-ip2 model.

Our results suggest that poor survival of women with mucinous ovarian carcinoma is associated with resistance to cytotoxic therapy. Targeting Src kinase with a combination of dasatinib and oxaliplatin may be an attractive approach for this disease.
