A series of new 6-arylpyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-ones and 6-alkylpyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-ones were synthesized. Some of the newly synthesized compounds were tested in vitro on human colon tumor cell line (HCT116). Most of the test compounds exploited potent antitumor activity, especially compound 10a which displayed the highest activity among the test compounds with IC(50) equal to 0.47 Î¼g/mL.
