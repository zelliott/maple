To investigate the effect of andrographolide (AD) on proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis of human gastric cells line BGC-823.

MTT assay, flow cytometry and Annexin-V/PI double-staining flow cytometry assay were used to evaluate the effect of AD on proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis of BGC-823 cells respectively. Optical microscope and transmission electron microscopy were used to observe the cell morphological changes.

A time- and concentration-dependent proliferative inhibition effect of AD was demonstrated in BGC-823 cells. AD concentration lower than 7.5 mg/L possessed weak inhibitory effect,while concentration between 15.0-60.0 mg/L possessed higher inhibitory effect. The concentration higher than 60.0 mg/L had no significant increase of inhibitory effect. IC50 of AD at 24, 48 and 72 h was (35.3±4.3), (25.5±3.5) and (18.2±2.7) mg/L respectively. Compared with the negative control group, the number of G0/G1 phase cells increased significantly ( p<0.05), while the number of S and G2/M phase cells decreased after incubation with AD for 48 h, and the alteration was in a concentration-dependent manner. AD arrested BGC-823 cells at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. After incubation with 7.5, 10.0 and 15.0 mg/L AD for 24 h, the early apoptotic rates of BGC-823 cells were (19.3±4.7)%, (29.4±4.1)% and (52.7±6.7)% respectively, and the late apoptotic rates were (10.8±1.8)%, (10.9±4.7)% and (14.7±4.8)% respectively. Both the early apoptotic rates and the late apoptotic rates increased significantly compared to the control group (all  p<0.05),and the alteration was in a concentration-dependent manner.

Andrographolide can inhibit BGC-823 cells proliferation, arrest BGC-823 cells in G0/G1 phase and induce apoptosis, and may be a potential traditional Chinese medicine with anti-cancer effect.
