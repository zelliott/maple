[F-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is a non-invasive imaging technique which has recently been validated for the assessment of therapy response in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Our objective was to determine its value for the evaluation of immunotherapy efficacy in immunocompetent Balb/c mice injected with the A20 syngeneic B lymphoma cell line. The high level of in vitro FDG uptake by A20 cells validated the model for further imaging studies. When injected intravenously, the tumour developed as nodular lesions mostly in liver and spleen, thus mimicking the natural course of an aggressive human lymphoma. FDG-PET provided three-dimensional images of tumour extension including non-palpable lesions, in good correlation with ex vivo macroscopic examination. When mice were pre-immunized with an A20 cell lysate in adjuvant before tumour challenge, their significantly longer survival, compared to control mice, were associated with a lower incidence of lymphoma visualized by PET at different time points. Estimation of tumour growth and metabolism using the calculated tumour volumes and maximum standardized uptake values, respectively, also demonstrated delayed lymphoma development and lower activity in the vaccinated mice. Thus, FDG-PET is a sensitive tool relevant for early detection and follow-up of internal tumours, allowing discrimination between treated and non-treated small animal cohorts without invasive intervention.
