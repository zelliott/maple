To develop an effective long-acting antidiabetic, the GLP-1 analogue of exendin-4 was modified with three different bile acids (BAs; cholic, deoxycholic, or lithocholic acid), at its two lysine residues. The biological, pharmaceutical, and physicochemical characteristics of these exendin-4 analogues were carefully investigated. Biological activity tests demonstrated that the monobile acid substitutions of exendin-4 showed well preserved receptor binding efficacy without noticeable insulinotropic or antidiabetic activity loss. However, physicochemical and pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the albumin-binding properties and in vivo elimination half-lives of BAM1-Ex4s (Lys(27)-BA-Ex4s) were significantly enhanced by increasing the hydrophobicities of the conjugated BAs. Furthermore, the protracted antidiabetic effects of the BAM1-Ex4s were also verified by the prolonged restoration of normoglycemia in type 2 diabetic mice. Accordingly, the present study suggests that the derivatization of exendin-4 with BAs offers a means of producing long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists for type 2 diabetic therapy.
