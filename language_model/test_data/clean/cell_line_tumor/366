Doxorubicin is a classic anticancer agent. Recently, numerous strategies have been used to enhance efficacy of drug delivery for cancer treatment. For example, by modifying poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) microspheres, a nanocarrier, makes it more effective. Conjugation with folic acid increases specific targeted drug delivery towards folate receptor-bearing cancer cells to improve anticancer effectiveness by increasing the tissue's local concentration of drugs. In the current studies, we synthesized folate-bearing, doxorubicin-loaded, magnetic, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) microspheres (FDMPM) to treat breast cancer cells (human SKBR-3). We found efficiency of drug encapsulation very high (95%) at pH above 7.4. Reverse transcription-PCR showed that cancer cells highly expressed folate receptors. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry revealed internalization of the carrier by SKBR-3 in treatments with FDMPM, which was not the case with any other combination for drug delivery (MPM, FMPM, and DMPM). Similarly, SKBR-3 cell growth was inhibited more (assessed by methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide and trypan blue exclusion assays) when treated with FDMPM than with any other combinations. Current results confirm our predication and demonstrate that FDMPM has potential as a new targeting strategy in cancer therapy.
