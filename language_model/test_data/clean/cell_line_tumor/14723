IL-10 transcripts were expressed in 14/15 primary breast adenocarcinomas and in 5/8 established breast tumor lines. Immunohistochemistry and immunoprecipitation from lysates and supernatants revealed that established breast tumor lines produced IL-10 protein. Immunohistochemistry revealed that IL-10 is localized to tumor cells of primary breast adenocarcinomas and to occasional infiltrating MNC. Established breast tumor cell lines expressed IL-12p40 transcripts (6/8) and protein (4/7) and IL-12p35 transcripts (6/7). Using two sandwich ELISAs, specific, respectively, for IL-12p40 and IL-12p70 proteins, we demonstrated that established breast tumor cell lines produce IL-12p40 monomer/homodimer, but not IL-12p70. Positive staining for IL-12p70 in primary breast adenocarcinomas was found only in MNC infiltrating the tumor while tumor cells were negative. IL-12p40 homodimer/monomer inhibit as antagonists IL-12 or IL-23, although they may also act as agonists and positive regulators. Also, primary breast adenocarcinomas (15/15) and established breast tumor cell lines (6/8) expressed TGF-β1 transcripts. IL-10, IL-12p40 and TGF-β1 may inhibit substantially the anti-tumor immune response.
