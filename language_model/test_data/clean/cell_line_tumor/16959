Cytokine-induced antiapoptotic molecule (CIAPIN1), a newly identified apoptosis inhibitor, has been found to participate in the process of proliferation and tumorigenicity for several cancers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of CIAPIN1 in pancreatic cancer and to probe its function in pancreatic carcinogenesis. We found that CIAPIN1 protein was absent or reduced in pancreatic cancer cell lines. There was also a loss or decrease in CIAPIN1 expression in 118 cases of pancreatic cancer tissues as compared with that in 82 cases of normal pancreatic tissues. In a Cox proportional hazards model, CIAPIN1 expression independently predicted better survival ( p<0.0001). Adenoviral-mediated restoration of CIAPIN1 expression greatly repressed the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cell in vitro and suppressed the tumorigenicity of pancreatic cancer cell in Balb/c nude mice. Our data also revealed that inhibition of pancreatic cancer cells proliferation by enforcing CIAPIN1 expression at least partly through delaying cell cycle progression and inducing cell apoptosis. In summary, our work revealed a novel function of CIAPIN1, which might possibly be used as an independent prognostic factor and a potential therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer.
