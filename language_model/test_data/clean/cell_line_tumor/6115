MED19 is a subunit of Mediator that is an essential component of RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription machinery. High expression levels of MED19 were examined in human lung adenocarcinoma tissues by immunohistochemical assay. MED19-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expressing lentivirus was constructed and infected lung cancer cell line A549. MED19 mRNA and protein expression levels were downregulated in A549 cells as evidenced by real-time PCR and western blot assays. Importantly, MED19 inhibition resulted in impaired proliferation and colony formation, and induced accumulation of G1-phase cells and mitigated invasiveness of cells. More importantly, downregulation of MED19 expression reduced the tumorigenicity of A549 cells in vivo. It was suggested that MED19 is a novel proliferation regulator that promotes growth of lung cancer cells, thereby indicating that MED19 may serve as a new molecular target for lung cancer therapy.
