Five macrocyclic paclitaxel bis-lactones and their corresponding open chain taxoids were synthesized as models of the tubulin-binding conformation of paclitaxel. Macrocyclic lactones with a 19-21-membered ring underwent isomerization to form smaller rings. The lactones were evaluated for cytotoxicity and tubulin-polymerization ability. All five macrocyclic paclitaxel lactones were active, but less so than paclitaxel, while the rearranged macrocyclic lactones and the corresponding open-chain taxoids were much less active or inactive.
