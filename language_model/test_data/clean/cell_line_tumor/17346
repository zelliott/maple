The established or potentially toxic agents implicated in the nigral cell death in Parkinson's disease, dopamine, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)), iron, and manganese, were examined as to their effects on the viability of cells overexpressing alpha-synuclein. SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells stably expressing the human dopamine transporter were transfected with human alpha-synuclein and cell clones with and without alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity were obtained. Cells were exposed for 24-72 h to 1-10 microM dopamine, 0.1-3 microM MPP(+), 0.1-1 mM FeCl(2) or 30-300 microM MnCl(2) added to the culture medium. There was no difference between cells expressing alpha-synuclein and control cells after exposure to dopamine, MPP(+) or FeCl(2). However, MnCl(2) resulted in a significantly stronger decreased viability of cells overexpressing alpha-synuclein after 72 h. These findings suggest that manganese may co-operate with alpha-synuclein in triggering neuronal cell death such as seen in manganese parkinsonism. The relevance of our observations for the pathoetiology of Parkinson's disease proper remains to be determined.
