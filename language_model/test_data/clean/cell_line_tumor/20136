Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a rare primary malignant liver             tumor with an extremely poor prognosis. Recently its incidence has increased,             however, little attention has been directed to factors related to its molecular             carcinogenesis, including oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes and cell cycle-related             proteins. ICC is generally characterized by strong proliferation, invasion and             early metastasis. These biological behaviors of ICC, with respect to the genetic             and molecular aspects, remain to be clarified. In this study, we performed a proteomic             analysis to identify the proteomic alterations associated with carcinogenesis             of ICC. Protein expression profiles of sixteen cases of ICC were compared with             those of adjacent non-involved bile duct tissue. Among the 151 protein spots that             showed a statistically significant expression difference ( p<0.05), there were             50 spots with significantly increased intensity (3-fold increase) and 17 spots             with decreased intensity (3-fold decrease) in cancerous tissues. Of these, increased             expression of fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5) was further confirmed by western             blot analysis and immunohistochemical analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis of             FABP5 expression in tumor specimens obtained from 43 patients with mass-forming             (MF) type ICC showed a positive correlation of FABP5 immunoreactivity with tumor             size (P=0.047), lymph node metastasis (P=0.013), angioinvasion (P=0.032) and staging             (P=0.007). In addition, silencing FABP5 with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) suppressed             cell proliferation and invasiveness in HuCCT1 cells, and conversely, overexpression             of FABP5 in FABP5-negative Hep3B cells increased cell proliferation and invasiveness.             Our study shows that FABP5 is significantly overexpressed in ICC combined lymph             node metastasis and is involved in cell proliferation and invasion inÂ vitro. Our             data suggest that FABP5 may be associated with tumor progression in ICC.
