Four novel cyclopentenone derivatives (1-4), characterising a cyclopentenone ring conjugated with a 1,8-dioxadecalin, were isolated from rare actinobacterial strain Actinoalloteichus nanshanensis sp. nov. NEAU 119. The structures of these compounds were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analysis. Bioassays indicated that compounds 1-4 showed low cytotoxicities against human leukaemia cell line K562 and human renal carcinoma cell line ACHN. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of isolation of C11 cyclopentenones from actinomycetes.
