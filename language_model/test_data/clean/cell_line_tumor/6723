Striatal degeneration occurs through unknown mechanisms in certain neurodegenerative disorders characterized by increased and sustained synaptic levels of dopamine. In the present studies, we examined the effects of treatment of SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells with dopamine to understand the participation of dopamine D(1) receptor in postsynaptic cytotoxicity. Treatment of SK-N-MC cells either with dopamine or the D(1) receptor agonist SKF R-38393 resulted in a significant increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (by approximately 2.75-fold) and cell death ( approximately 50%), while antagonism of the D(1) receptor with SCH 23390 significantly reversed (to approximately 75% of control level) these effects. Accumulation of cAMP in dopamine treated cells (t(1/2)=1.5h) preceded changes in ionic gradient (t(1/2)=6.5h), as measured by intracellular potassium concentration and leakage of cytochrome c into the cytosol (t(1/2)=13 h), suggesting a possible staging of toxic events as a result of activation of D(1) receptor by dopamine. Examination of cellular metabolic properties with (13)C NMR spectroscopy showed an inhibitory effect on tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism via D(1)-mediated receptors after treatment with dopamine, suggesting a direct role for D(1) receptor in dopamine-induced postsynaptic cell death. The present studies provide novel insight into a possible patho-physiological staging of cytotoxic events that are mediated by activation of D(1) receptor.
