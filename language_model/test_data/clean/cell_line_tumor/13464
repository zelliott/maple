Strained ruthenium (Ru) complexes have been synthesized and characterized as novel agents for photodynamic therapy (PDT). The complexes are inert until triggered by visible light, which induces ligand loss and covalent modification of DNA. An increase in cytotoxicity of 2 orders of magnitude is observed with light activation in cancer cells, and the compounds display potencies superior to cisplatin against 3D tumor spheroids. The use of intramolecular strain may be applied as a general paradigm to develop light-activated ruthenium complexes for PDT applications.
