Tumor hypoxia has been reported to be a negative prognostic factor in a number of tumor sites. Both clinical and experimental studies have suggested a positive correlation between tumor hypoxia and increased metastatic efficiency; however, the mechanisms are not understood. In this study, the mechanisms of hypoxia-enhanced metastasis have been investigated in murine KHT fibrosarcoma and SCC VII cells. We have observed that hypoxia-pretreated KHT-C cells have a higher survival rate than control KHT-C cells after being arrested in mouse lungs. cDNA microarray analysis revealed many hypoxia-regulated genes, most of which have been reported to be involved in cell survival and growth. Among these genes, we have confirmed the up-regulation of Mdm2 by hypoxia and have demonstrated that this up-regulation is p53 independent. The up-regulation of Mdm2 by hypoxia is associated with decreased p53 protein and inhibition of the transactivation of p53 downstream proapoptotic genes. Overexpression of Mdm2 or suppression of p53 by transient transfection increased metastatic efficiency in KHT-C cells. These data suggest that hypoxia can increase tumor cell metastatic efficiency by rendering the tumor cells less sensitive to stress-induced cell death, e.g., through modifying the levels of Mdm2 and p53.
