This study investigated the role of doxorubicin (DOX) accumulation in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production detected in individually electrophoresed organelles, including mitochondria, acidic organelles, and peroxisomes. While bulk measurements of ROS production in cells and organelles are not capable of discriminating between the effects of preparative procedures on measured ROS production, capillary electrophoresis with dual laser-induced detection of individual organelles demonstrated a difference in the measured ROS production as a result of various preparative procedures. Using this technique, the three different types of detected organelles (i) produce ROS and do not have detectable levels of DOX, (ii) contain detectable DOX but do not produce ROS, or (iii) produce ROS and accumulate DOX. The third type displays two subpopulations of organelles, one of which demonstrated a direct relationship between DOX uptake and subsequent ROS production, corresponding most likely to mitochondria, and a second one with low DOX uptake but large variation in ROS production, corresponding most likely to acidic organelles.
