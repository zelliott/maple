To develop a hepatocyte targeting pH-sensitive liposome for drug delivery based on active targeting technology mediated by asialoglycoprotein receptors.

Four types of targeting molecules with galactose residue were synthesized and mixed with pH-sensitive lipids DC-chol/DOPE to prepare liposome with integrated property of hepatocyte specificity and pH sensitivity. Liposome 18-gal was selected with the best transfection activity through cellular uptake experiment. Property analysis was made through experiments of competitive inhibition of receptors, red blood cell hemolysis, in vitro cytotoxicity test by MTS assay and mediation of inhibitory effects of antisense phosphorothioate ODN on gene expression, etc.

Liposome 18-gal had the desired properties of hepatocyte specificity, pH sensitivity, low cytotoxicity, and high transfection efficiency.

Liposome 18-gal can be further developed as a potential hepatocyte- targeting delivery system.
