The effect of TNF-alpha on liver Na(+)-K(+) ATPase was studied in Sprague-Dawley rats and in HepG2 cells. TNF-alpha was injected intraperitoneally to rats and 4h later the liver was isolated and the activity and protein expression of hepatic Na(+)-K(+) ATPase studied. The cytokine caused a significant down-regulation of the ATPase and a decrease in its activity. This effect disappeared in presence of indomethacin, an inhibitor of COX enzymes, and PGE2 injected to the animals imitated the effect of TNF-alpha. The observed in vivo effects of TNF and PGE2 on the pump appeared again when HepG2 cells were treated with the cytokine or the prostaglandin. The application of different agonist and antagonist to EP receptors showed that the effect of PGE2 is mediated via EP2 receptors. It was concluded that TNF-alpha induces in hepatocytes, PGE2 production which in turn reduces the activity and protein expression of the Na(+)-K(+) ATPase by activating EP2 receptors.
