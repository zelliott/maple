Epidermal nerves lie in close proximity to Langerhans cells (LC) and are capable of releasing peptides that modulate LC function, including calcitonin gene-related peptide and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide. The neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) has also been found in cutaneous nerves and mRNA, for the VIP receptor vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor type 1, and vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor type 2 have been found in murine LC and the LC-like cell line XS106. We examined the effects of VIP on LC function and cutaneous immunity. VIP inhibited elicitation of a delayed-type hypersensitivity response in previously immunized mice by epidermal cells enriched for LC content pulsed with Ag in vitro. VIP also inhibited the ability of unseparated epidermal cells to present Ag to a T cell clone and hybridoma and the ability of highly enriched LCs to present to the T cell clone. Inhibition of presentation to the hybridoma was observed with an antigenic peptide that does not require processing, suggesting that VIP is active at a step independent of Ag processing. To elucidate the mechanism(s) by which VIP may mediate these effects, we determined the effects of VIP on LC cytokine production using the XS106 cell line as a surrogate for LC. VIP augmented the production of the IL-10 in LPS-stimulated XS106 cells while down-regulating IL-12 and IL-1beta production. Thus, VIP, like pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide and calcitonin gene-related peptide, down-regulates LC function and the associated immune response.
