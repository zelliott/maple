To assess the influence of 14-3-3-beta in modulating the migration and invasion of human glioma cells.

To profile the genes associated with malignant glioma cell motility, differential display-polymerase chain reaction was performed and the findings  were validated by Northern blotting in the U343MG-A, U87MG, and U87MG-10' human glioma cell lines. Antisense 14-3-3-beta cDNA plasmid was transfected into U87MG ('U87-YA-3'). To follow motility changes after transfection, simple scratch test and matrigel assay were performed.  Morphological and cytoskeletal changes were documented by light and confocal microscopy. In addition, doubling times of the transfectant and endogenous 14-3-3-beta levels were determined in various glioma cell lines with different motilities.

14-3-3-beta was highly expressed  in U87MG cells. U87-YA-3 cells became small and flat, and actin was depolarized. Furthermore, U87-YA-3 cell motility was inhibited markedly versus parental U87MG cells. The doubling times of transfected and parent cells were 32 and 37 hours, respectively. Endogenous 14-3-3-beta expression  in the human glioma cell lines was proportional to their migratory and invasive abilities.

14-3-3-beta modulates the migration and invasion in U87MG cells, which may be useful in developing therapeutic approaches for the treatment of glioma.
