Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), a protein induced in cells exposed to sublethal heat shock, is present in all living cells and has been highly conserved during evolution. The aim of the current study was to determine the role of heat shock proteins in the resistance of prostate carcinoma cell line spheroids to hyperthermia. In vitro, the expression of Hsp70 by the DU 145 cell line, when cultured as monolayer or multicellular spheroids, was studied using Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods. The level of Hsp70 in spheroid cultures for up to 26 days at 37 degrees C remained similar to monolayer cultures. However, in samples treated with hyperthermia at 43 degrees C for 120 min, the spheroid cultures expressed a higher level of Hsp70 as compared to monolayer culture. Under similar conditions of heat treatment, the spheroids showed more heat resistance than monolayer cultures as judged by the number of colonies that they formed in suspension cultures. The results suggest that cells cultured in multicellular spheroids showed more heat resistance as compared to monolayer cultures by producing higher levels of Hsp70.
