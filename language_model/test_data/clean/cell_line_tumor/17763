Mucus hypersecretion occurs as a consequence of the Th2 immune response in epithelia, yet it was not previously known whether the degree of O-glycosylation was modulated under such conditions. A colonic carcinoma cell line LS174T was used to assess the effect of interleukin (IL)-4 on the mRNA levels of eight pp-GalNAc-Ts. A three- to four-fold increase in pp-GalNAc-T1, T4, and T7 levels was observed. Lysates of untreated or IL-4-treated cells were examined for their ability to transfer GalNAc residues onto a peptide corresponding to the tandem repeat portion of human MUC2. The number of incorporated GalNAc residues was greater after incubation with lysates of IL-4-treated cells than with lysates of untreated cells. Mucin-like large glycoproteins secreted by IL-4-treated cells had higher binding capacity to PNA and VVA-B(4) than those secreted by untreated cells. The results indicated that IL-4-treated LS174T cells are able to produce mucins with a higher degree of O-glycosylation than untreated counterparts.
