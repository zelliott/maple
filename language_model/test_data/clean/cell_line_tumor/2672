To investigate the effects of curcumin on the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptordelta (PPARdelta) and related genes in HT-29 cells.

HT-29 cells were treated with curcumin (0-80 micromol/L) for 24 h. The effects of curcumin on the morphology of HT-29 cells were studied by Hoechst 33342 staining. The activity of caspase-3 was determined using DEVD-pNA as substrate. The levels of peroxisome PPARdelta, 14-3-3epsilon and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in HT-29 cells were determined by Western blotting analysis and their mRNA expression was determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR.

Treatment with 10-80 micromol/L curcumin induced typical features of apoptosis and activated the caspase-3 in HT-29 cells. The expression of PPARdelta, 14-3-3epsilon and VEGF was reduced and the activity of beta-catenin/Tcf-4 signaling was inhibited by curcumin treatment.

Curcumin can induce apoptosis of HT-29 cells and down-regulate the expression of PPARdelta, 14-3-3epsilon and VEGF in HT-29.
