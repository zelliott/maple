To investigate the function of the KIAA0008 gene, one of the leading genes in the signature associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastasis selected by cDNA microarray, and especially its possible roles in invasion and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Expression levels of KIAA0008 in 27 primary tumors and 23 matched non-tumor liver tissues from HCC patients, and four HCC cell lines with different metastatic potentials were detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR. Recombinant expression plasmid vectors of the KIAA0008 gene were constructed and transfected into HCC cells. The subcellular localization of the KIAA0008 gene product and in vitro effects of KIAA0008 overexpression on proliferation and invasion of HCC cell line were also investigated.

Expression levels of KIAA0008 in HCC tissues were statistically higher than those of paired non-tumorous liver tissues (P < 0.001, paired Wilcoxon test), and in HCCs with high invasiveness these were statistically higher than those with low invasiveness (P = 0.002, Mann-Whitney test). In the four HCC cell lines with an identical genetic background and stepwise higher invasiveness potentials, its expression was consistent with their invasiveness potential. The KIAA0008 gene product was concentrated on the nucleus and cell membrane of HCC cells, without any distribution in the cytoplasm. Overexpression of KIAA0008 in the MHCC97L cell line resulted in increased cell proliferation, colony formation, and invasion.

KIAA0008 expression is associated with invasiveness of HCC; overexpression of KIAA0008 leads to a more invasive phenotype of HCC cell lines.
