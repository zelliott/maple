The poliovirus receptor CD155, is essential for poliovirus to infect and             induce death in neural cells. Recently, CD155 has been shown to be selectively             expressed on certain types of tumor cells originating from the neural crest, including             malignant glioma and neuroblastoma. However, the expression pattern of CD155 in             soft tissue sarcoma has not been examined. Therefore, we first examined CD155             expression in sarcoma cell lines, and found the expression of both CD155 mRNA             and protein in 12 soft and bone tissue sarcoma cell lines. Furthermore, we examined             the effect of live attenuated poliovirus (LAPV) on 6 bone and soft tissue sarcoma             cell lines in vitro, and found that LAPV induced apoptosis by activating caspases 7             and 3 in all of these cell lines. Furthermore, in BALB/c nu/nu mice xenotransplanted             with HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, administration of live attenuated poliovirus caused             growth suppression of the tumors. These results suggest that oncolytic therapy             using a LAPV may represent a new option for the treatment of bone and soft tissue             sarcomas.
