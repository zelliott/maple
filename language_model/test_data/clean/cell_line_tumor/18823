Substrate degradation and cell migration are key steps in cancer metastasis. Membrane-type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) has been linked with these processes. Using the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled fibronectin degradation assay combined with the phagokinetic cell migration assay, structure-function relationships of MT1-MMP were studied. Our data indicate that MT1-MMP initiates substrate degradation and enhances cell migration; cell migration occurs as a concurrent but independent event. Using recombinant DNA approaches, we demonstrated that the hemopexin-like domain and a nonenzymatic component of the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP are essential for MT1-MMP-mediated cell migration. Because the cytoplasmic domain of MT1-MMP was not required for MT1-MMP-mediated fibronectin degradation and cell migration, it is proposed that cross-talk between the hemopexin domain of MT1-MMP and adjacent cell surface molecules is responsible for outside-in signaling. Employing cDNAs encoding dominant negative mutations, we demonstrated that Rac1 participates in the MT1-MMP signal transduction pathway. These data demonstrated that each domain of MT1-MMP plays a distinct role in substrate degradation and cell migration.
