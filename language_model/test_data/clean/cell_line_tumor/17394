The enzymatic transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD to histone H(1) [defined as trans(oligo-ADP-ribosylation)] or to PARP-1 [defined as auto(poly-ADP-ribosylation)] requires binding of coenzymic DNA. The preceding paper [Kun, E., et al. (2004) Biochemistry 43, 210-216] shows that oligonucleotides of dsDNA can serve as coenzymic DNA for PARP-1 trans- or auto-modification activity. Results of DNA-protein binding (EMSA) experiments reported here demonstrate that short DNA oligonucleotides containing the 5'-TGTTG-3' nucleotide sequence motif preferentially bind to cloned PARP-1 in vitro. The same nucleotide sequence motif is responsible for striated myocyte-selective transcription of a contractile protein gene encoding cardiac troponin T (cTnT). Results of experiments reported here demonstrate that mutation of this motif also abolishes the differentiation-dependent activation of the transfected cTnT promoter in myoblasts cultured in vitro, indicating that nucleotide sequence-dependent binding of PARP-1 to promoter DNA of the cTnT gene is also necessary for differentiation-dependent activation. Thus, PARP-1 has two types of dsDNA binding activity: (1) nucleotide sequence-dependent binding, analyzed here with EMSA experiments, and (2) coenzymic binding, measured catalytically, which does not depend on the nucleotide sequence of the dsDNA. We hypothesize that the well-known association of PARP-1 with chromatin can be attributed to its stable binding to chromosomal dsDNA, some portion of which is likely to be nucleotide sequence-dependent binding. According to this hypothesis, the distribution of this protein-modifying enzyme in chromatin may be targeted to specific genomic loci and vary according to cell type and developmental stage.
