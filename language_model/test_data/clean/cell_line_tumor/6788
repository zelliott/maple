Four water-insoluble (1-->3)-alpha-D-glucans, coded L-II1, L-II2, L-II3 and L-II4, with different molecular weights were isolated from four kinds of fruiting bodies of Lentinus Edodes. The four alpha-D-glucans were O-sulfonated to obtain derivatives (SL-II) having degrees of substitution (DS) from 0.9 to 2.1 respectively. The structure of the samples was analyzed by infrared spectra, elemental analysis, and 13C NMR. The weight-average molecular weight (Mw), radii of gyration (<s2>z1/2) and intrinsic viscosity ([eta]) of the native alpha-D-glucans and O-sulfonated derivatives were measured by size-exclusion chromatography combined with laser light scattering (SEC-LLS), LLS, and viscometry in 0.2 M aqueous NaCl and in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) containing 0.25 M LiCl at 25 degrees C respectively. The Mw values of the O-sulfonated derivatives were much lower than those of the native alpha-D-glucans. The experimental results indicate that the O-sulfonated derivatives are water-soluble and exist as an expanded flexible chain in aqueous solution owing to intramolecular hydrogen bonding or interaction between charge groups. The in vivo and in vitro antitumor activities of the native alpha-D-glucans and their O-sulfonated derivatives against solid tumor Sarcoma 180 cells were evaluated and compared. Interestingly, all of the O-sulfonated derivatives exhibited higher antitumor activities than those of the native glucans. The results reveal that the effect of O-sulfonation of the alpha-D-glucan on the improvement of their antitumor activities was considerable.
