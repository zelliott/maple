Molecular design and chemical synthesis of several palmerolide A analogues allowed the first structure activity relationships (SARs) of this newly discovered marine antitumor agent. From several analogues synthesized and tested (ent- 1, 5- 14, 21- 26, 50, 51), compounds 25 (with a phenyl substituent on the side chain) and 51 (lacking the C-7 hydroxyl group) were the most interesting, exhibiting approximately a 10-fold increase in potency and equipotency, respectively, to the natural product. These findings point the way to more focused structure activity relationship studies.
