Previous studies showed it was possible to employ sonographic contrast agent for identification of the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). This study is to investigate the usefulness of SonoVue (a sonographic contrast agent) and gray-scale contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) for detecting the SLNs in a metastatic breast cancer model.

CEUS was performed in 12 female rabbits with breast VX2 tumor after subcutaneous administration of SonoVue. The site, number, and pattern of enhancement of the SLNs were observed and recorded. After CEUS, 0.5 mL of blue dye was injected into the same location as SonoVue and the SLNs were detected by surgical dissection. The findings of CEUS were compared with those of blue dye.

Of the 12 tumors assessed, a total of 17 enhanced SLNs were detected by CEUS. Among them, a single SLN was detected in eight tumors, two SLNs in three tumors, and three SLNs in one tumor. All the SLNs showed partial enhancement on CEUS. Nineteen SLNs were identified by blue dye with surgical dissection. There were no false-positive CEUS findings in terms of SLN detection. The overall sensitivity of CEUS for detecting SLNs was 89.5% (17/19). Among the 17 SLNs detected by CEUS, tumor metastases were identified histopathologically in 4 SLNs, whereas proliferation of lymphatic tissue was identified in the other 13 SLNs.

CEUS combined with SonoVue is useful for detecting SLNs, although it may not be helpful for detecting metastases in SLNs.
