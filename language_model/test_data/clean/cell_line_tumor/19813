Concise syntheses of orlistat (Xenical), a two-carbon transposed orlistat derivative, and valilactone are described that employ the tandem Mukaiyama aldol-lactonization (TMAL) process as a key step. This process allows facile modification of the alpha-side chain. Versatile strategies for modifying the delta-side chain are described, involving cuprate addition and olefin metathesis. Comparative antagonistic activity of these derivatives toward a recombinant form of the thioesterase domain of fatty acid synthase is reported along with comparative activity-based profiling.
