By using neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor type 1 (VEGFR1) and VEGFR2, we have shown that acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells with specific chromosome abnormalities are dependent on VEGF/VEGFR system. AML with t(8;21) is the most dependent subtype on VEGF with both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. t(15;17)AML cells depend on VEGF with VEGFR1. AML cells with 11q23 abnormalities showed variable dependence on VEGF. The growth of t(11;19)AML cells are most extensively inhibited by anti-VEGFR1 antibody. Then, the growth of Kasumi-1, a t(8;21) cell line was suppressed by either anti-VEGFR1 antibody (p=0.0022) or anti-VEGFR2 antibody (p=0.0029) in a dose-dependent manner. The growth of NB4, a t(15;17) cell line was more potently suppressed by anti-VEGFR1 antibody (p=0.0111) than by anti-VEGFR2 antibody (p=0.0477). These results are quite concordant with the results of clinical samples with t(8;21) or t(15;17). In addition, anti-VEGFR2 monoclonal antibody significantly potentiated the growth inhibitory effect of idarubicin for Kasumi-1. As for downstream signals, we have shown that VEGFR2 transduce growth and survival signals through phosphorylation of Akt and MEK in leukemia cells (Kasumi-1). However, VEGFR1 transduce growth and survival signals through pathways other than MEK and Akt (NB4), although Akt phosphorylation may account for some of the VEGFR1 signals (Kasumi-1). Finally, our data suggested that autocrine pathway of VEGF and VEGFRs observed in AML cells with specific chromosomal translocations have contributed to leukemogenesis as activated signaling of receptor tyrosine kinase.
