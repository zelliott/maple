When purified from a tumor, certain heat shock protein 70 (HSP70)-peptide             complexes (PCs) can function as effective vaccines against the tumor from which             the complexes were isolated. The immunogenic mechanisms of HSP70 preparations             imply that tumor-derived HSP70-PCs exhibit antigens associated with antigen-presenting             cells such as dendritic cells (DCs), inducing antigen-specific cytotoxic CD8+             T cells. However, some important membrane-resident tumor-associated peptides,             such as the HER-2/neu (c-erbB2) oncogenic protein, cannot be purified from HSP70             by traditional methods. In the present study, a new approach for the purification             of HSP70-PCs from HER-2-overexpressing breast cancer cells was established. The             detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) was             used to obtain more effectual tumor peptides. The new purified product was named             HSP70-HER-2-PC, and its immunological activities were determined. Traditionally             purified HSP70-PCs (without CHAPS) and recombinant human HSP70-HER-2 protein complexes             (recombined inÂ vitro) were used as controls. These three HSP70-associated tumor             antigenic complex pulsed dendritic cells (DCs) were used to stimulate an antitumor             response. The mature DCs pulsed with HSP70-HER-2-PCs stimulated autologous T cells             to secrete higher levels of type I cytokine compared to the two control groups.             Moreover, DCs pulsed with HSP70-HER-2-PCs induced the most specific CD8+ T cells             that specifically killed the same tumor cells. These findings provide a basis             for new approaches in enhancing HSP70-based immunotherapy for HER-2-associated             or other membrane antigenic peptide-related cancers.
