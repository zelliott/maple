Hypermethylation in the promoter region of tumor suppressor genes is a common mechanism of gene silencing, which tends to occur in cancer. The effects of 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR), a specific DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, on the cell proliferation of human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and on the expression of Apaf-1 gene were investigated. Human MCF-7 cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of 5-Aza-CdR for 12 to 120 h. The growth inhibition rates of MCF-7 cells were detected by MTT assay. Changes of cell cycle distribution and apoptotic rates of MCF-7 cells were determined by flow cytometry. The expressions of DNA methyltransferase 3b mRNA and Apaf-1 mRNA were measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Meanwhile, the expression of Apaf-1 protein was detected by Western blotting. The results showed that 5-Aza-CdR significantly inhibited the growth of MCF-7 cells and the growth inhibition rate of MCF-7 cells was significantly enhanced with the concentration of 5-Aza-CdR and the action time. Flow cytometry indicated that 5-Aza-CdR could significantly induce G(1)/S cell cycle arrest and increase the apoptosis rate of MCF-7 cells. The mRNA and protein expressions of Apaf-1 were up-regulated in MCF-7 cells treated with 5-Aza-CdR, which was accompanied by down-regulation of DNA methyltransferase 3b mRNA. It is concluded that 5-Aza-CdR might retard the growth of tumor cells and promote the apoptosis of MCF-7 breast cancer cells by inhibiting the expression of DNA methyltransferase 3b and re-activating the Apaf-1 gene expression.
