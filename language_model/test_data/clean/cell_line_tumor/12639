The new heterobimetallic Ni(II)-Sn(2)(IV) (1), Cu(II)-Sn(2)(IV) (2) and Zn(II)-Sn(2)(IV) (3) complexes, containing D-glucosamine, 1,8-diamino-3,6-diazaoctane and imidazole were isolated and characterized by spectral and analytical methods. The proposed geometry of Ni(II) and Cu(II) in 1 and 2 was square pyramidal, Zn(II) in 3 exhibited tetrahedral while Sn(IV) exhibits hexacoordinate environment, respectively. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) confirmed the amorphous nature of all the complexes. The interaction studies of 2 and 3 with CT DNA were carried out by various biophysical techniques to show the mode of binding. The interaction of 2 and 3 with nucleotides viz 5'-GMP and 5'-TMP, respectively were further confirmed by (1)H, (31)P and (119)Sn NMR spectroscopy. The complex 2 exhibited effective cleavage activity with pBR322 DNA. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of 2 was examined on a panel of human tumor cell lines of different histological origins and showed good activity against Colo205 and A2780 (GI50 < 10 Î¼g/ml).
