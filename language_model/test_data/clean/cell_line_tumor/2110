The most important clinical biomarker for breast cancer management is oestrogen receptor alpha (ERα). Tumours that express ER are candidates for endocrine therapy and are biologically less aggressive, while ER-negative tumours are largely treated with conventional chemotherapy and have a poor prognosis. Despite its significance, the mechanisms regulating ER expression are poorly understood. We hypothesised that the inflammatory cytokine oncostatin M (OSM) can downregulate ER expression in breast cancer. Recombinant OSM potently suppressed ER protein and mRNA expression in vitro in a dose- and time-dependent manner in two human ER+ breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and T47D. This was dependent on the expression of OSM receptor beta (OSMRβ) and could be blocked by inhibition of the MEKK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinases. ER loss was also necessary for maximal OSM-induced signal transduction and migratory activity. In vivo, high expression of OSM and OSMR mRNA (determined by RT-PCR) was associated with reduced ER ( p<0.01) and progesterone receptor ( p<0.05) protein levels in a cohort of 70 invasive breast cancers. High OSM and OSMR mRNA expression was also associated with low expression of ESR1 (ER,  p<0.0001) and ER-regulated genes in a previously published breast cancer gene expression dataset (n=321 cases). In the latter cohort, high OSMR expression was associated with shorter recurrence-free and overall survival in univariate ( p<0.0001) and multivariate (P=0.022) analyses. OSM signalling may be a novel factor causing suppression of ER and disease progression in breast cancer.
