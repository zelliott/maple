To study siRNA inhibited the expression of mRNA and protein of NF-kappaBp65 in the Hep -2 cell line.

Hep-2 were transfected with p65SiRNA. Western blotting was used to examine the protein levels of NF-kappaBp65. RT-PCR method was adopted to determine the mRNA expression of NF-kappaBp65. MTT method was adopted to investigate the proliferation of the Hep-2 cells after the transfection of p65siRNA.

The western blotting result showed that the level of NF-kappaBp65 protein was gradually declined after transfection of p65siRNA. The RT-PCR result showed that transfection with p65siRNA caused special degradation of the p65mRNA in Hep-2 cells at 24, 48 and 72 h. After transfection with p65siRNA.

p65siRNA has significant inhibition effects on the proliferation of the Hep-2 cells and expression of purpose gene mRNA and protein. The inhibition effects are time depended.
