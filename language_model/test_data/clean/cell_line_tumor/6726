The vascular development of orthotopically grown human renal cell carcinoma (Caki-1) was examined using a silicon based casting technique in nude mice. Images taken of these vascular casts showed Caki-1 tumors to be highly vascularized and invasive. The spread of the tumor within the cortex of the kidney revealed that Caki-1 recruits the kidney's own vasculature, destroying the functional glomeruli in the process. The loss of these glomeruli was further highlighted by the presence of enlarged glomeruli resulting from the development of super nephrons. Vessel size and density measurements were then made in this model. This was done using both computer-based and manual measurement methods. In the vessel size studies the computer-based method tended to overestimate the number of larger diameter vessels whereas the vessels density assessment showed good agreement between the two techniques. Nevertheless, both methods showed that Caki-1 tumors possessed a higher proportion of larger diameter vessels and a lower vessel density than normal kidney cortex. In summary, silicon based vascular casting proved to be a simple and effective tool for the study of tumor vasculature. In particular this technique could readily be used to examine the invasion of tumor into normal tissue. The computer-based technique for evaluating vessel number and vascular density was found to have merit in both normal and tumor tissues, particularly in the vascular density studies. However, in both settings this technique did tend to overestimate the number of larger diameter vessels.
