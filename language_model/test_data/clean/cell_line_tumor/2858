To investigate the alteration of nuclear matrix proteins (NMPs) during the differentiation of neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells induced by retinoic acid (RA), differentiation markers were detected by immunocytochemistry and NMPs were selectively extracted and subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis. Immunocytochemical observation demonstrated that the expression of neuronal markers was up-regulated in SK-N-SH cells following RA treatment. Meanwhile, 52 NMPs (41 of which were identified) changed significantly during SK-N-SH differentiation; four of these NMPs were further confirmed by immunoblotting. This study suggests that the differentiation of neuroblastoma cells was accompanied by the altered expression of neuronal markers and NMPs. The presence of some differentially expressed NMPs was related to the proliferation and differentiation of neuroblastomas. Our results may help to reveal the relationship between NMPs and neuroblastoma carcinogenesis and reversion, as well as elucidate the regulatory principals driving neural cell proliferation and differentiation.
