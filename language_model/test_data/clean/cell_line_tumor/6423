To establish the craniopharyngioma cell line with primary culture which might provide experiment background and evidence for future eternal tumor cell line establishment.

Thirty six surgical specimens were collected from patients with craniopharyngiomas definited by iconography and pathology examinations in West China Hospital, Sichuan University, including twenty one adamantine epitheliomas and fifteen squamous papillary tumors. The tumor cell was treated through primary cukture, purification, passage, freezing, resuscitation, and identified by keratin 7 staining through SP method. The growth curve and double time were detected through trypan blue dye cell count and MTT assay. The growth of the tumor cells treated with growth hormone (GH) and Tamoxifen was also observed.

Thirty six primary cultures were done, 29 of which were successful and subculture was achieved in 80.6% of all primary cultures. These cell lines were from squamous epithelium by keratin 7 antibody identification, with three days of double time. Proloferative effect of GH was most prevalent at 100 ng/mL, while tamoxifen suppressed cell growth.

The finite craniopharyngioma cell lines were obtained through primary culture.
