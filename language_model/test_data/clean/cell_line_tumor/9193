Although the immune system is capable of mounting a response against many cancers, that response is insufficient for tumor eradication in most patients due to factors in the tumor microenvironment that defeat tumor immunity. We previously identified the immune-suppressive molecule CD200 as up-regulated on primary B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells and demonstrated negative immune regulation by B-CLL and other tumor cells overexpressing CD200 in vitro. In this study we developed a novel animal model that incorporates human immune cells and human tumor cells to address the effects of CD200 overexpression on tumor cells in vivo and to assess the effect of targeting Abs in the presence of human immune cells. Although human mononuclear cells prevented tumor growth when tumor cells did not express CD200, tumor-expressed CD200 inhibited the ability of lymphocytes to eradicate tumor cells. Anti-CD200 Ab administration to mice bearing CD200-expressing tumors resulted in nearly complete tumor growth inhibition even in the context of established receptor-ligand interactions. Evaluation of an anti-CD200 Ab with abrogated effector function provided evidence that blocking of the receptor-ligand interaction was sufficient for control of CD200-mediated immune modulation and tumor growth inhibition in this model. Our data indicate that CD200 expression by tumor cells suppresses antitumor responses and suggest that anti-CD200 treatment might be therapeutically beneficial for treating CD200-expressing cancers.
