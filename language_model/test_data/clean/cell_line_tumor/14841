Triptolide showed excellent antitumor activity against several solid tumors. However, its mechanism has not been fully understood. To further elucidate it, the effects of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) on the activity of triptolide towards prostate cancer cell lines were investigated in the present study using both LNCaP (p53 positive and androgen-dependent) and PC-3 (p53 deficient and androgen-independent) cells. Our results showed that triptolide exerted potent growth inhibitory and apoptotic effects on both cell lines, and the effects were independent of the expression of p53. Although upregulation of ERK and JNK phosphorylation was observed after the triptolide treatment, the results with inhibitors showed that these MAPKs were not involved in the mechanism of triptolide activity in human prostate cancer cell lines with different p53 status.
