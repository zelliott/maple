This study aimed to investigate the pathophysiology and therapy of multi-drug resistant model of minimal residual leukemia in mice. The multi-drug resistant model of minimal residual leukemia was established by using P388/VCR-G cell line expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and DBA mice. The results showed that P388/VCR-G were inoculated in the abdominal cavities of DBA mice, the incidence of leukemia was 100%. Any of these mice with leukemia could not obtain remission spontaneously. The model of leukemia was sensitive to cyclophosphamide (Cy) and the time of survival was related to the dose of Cy received. The logarithm of cells inoculated in mice correlated regressionally with the dose of Cy. So this model was ideal for research on minimal residual leukemia. The distribution of residual leukemia cells in complete remission was not uniform in different organs including liver, spleen, thymus and bone marrow. Minimal residual leukemia cells could be found by fluorescent microscopy in freezing tissue slice. It is concluded that the multi-drug resistant model of minimal residual leukemia expressing EGFP can be established by using P388/VCR-G cell line and DBA mice. The minimal residual leukemia cells can be observed by fluorescence microscopy in complete remission stage.
