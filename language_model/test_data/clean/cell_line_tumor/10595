Neural electrode devices hold great promise to help people with the restoration of lost functions. However, research is lacking in the biomaterial design of a stable, long-term device. Glial scarring is initiated when a device is inserted into brain tissue and an inflammatory response ensues. Astrocytes become hypertrophic, hyperplastic, and upregulate glial-fibrillary acidic protein. This study was designed to investigate the astrocyte proliferation, viability, morphology, and gene expression to assess the reactive state of the cells on different material surfaces. Although platinum and silicon have been extensively characterized both in vivo and in vitro for their biocompatibility with neuronal cells, this study used the novel usage of PMMA and SU-8 in neural electrodes by comparative analysis of materials' biocompatibility. This study has shown evidence of noncytotoxicity of SU-8. We have also confirmed the biocompatibility of PMMA with astrocytes. Moreover, we have established sound guidelines of which neural implant materials should meet to be depicted biocompatible.
