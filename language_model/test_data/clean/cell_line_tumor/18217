The nuclear receptor hepatic nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF 4 alpha) is a master regulatory protein and an essential player in the control of a wide range of metabolic processes. Dysfunction of HNF 4 alpha is associated with metabolic disorders including diabetes. We were particularly interested in investigating molecular causes associated with diabetic nephropathy.

Novel disease candidate genes were identified by the chromatin immunoprecipitation-cloning assay and by sequencing of immunoprecipitated DNA. Expression of candidate genes was analyzed in kidney and liver of Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) and of streptozotocin (STZ)-administered rats and after siRNA-mediated silencing of HNF 4 alpha.

We identified the calcium-permeable nonselective transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily C, member 1 (TRPC1) as a novel HNF 4 alpha gene target. Strikingly, TRPC1 is localized on human chromosome 3q22-24, i.e., a region considered to be a hotspot for diabetic nephropathy. We observed a significant reduction of TRPC1 gene expression in kidney and liver of diabetic ZDF and of STZ-administered rats as a result of HNF 4 alpha dysfunction. We found HNF 4 alpha and TRPC1 protein expression to be repressed in kidneys of diabetic patients diagnosed with nodular glomerulosceloris as evidenced by immunohistochemistry. Finally, siRNA-mediated functional knock down of HNF 4 alpha repressed TRPC1 gene expression in cell culture experiments.

Taken collectively, results obtained from animal studies could be translated to human diabetic nephropathy; there is evidence for a common regulation of HNF 4 alpha and TRPC1 in human and rat kidney pathologies. We propose dysregulation of HNF 4 alpha and TRPC1 as a possible molecular rationale in diabetic nephropathy.
