Recent studies have implicated a possible role for NK cells in regulating dendritic cells (DC) in vitro. In the present study, we demonstrate that immature DC are rapidly eliminated by NK cells in vivo via a pathway dependent on the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Elimination of NK cells and/or neutralization of TRAIL function during immunization with immature DC loaded with nonself or tumor Ags significantly enhanced T cell responses to these Ags and Ag-specific tumor immunity. These data suggested that NK cell TRAIL might regulate responses to vaccination by controlling the survival of Ag-loaded DC.
