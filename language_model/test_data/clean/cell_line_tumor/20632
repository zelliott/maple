Previous studies suggested chalcones as antineoplastic drug candidates. We synthesized a new chalcone derivative (E)-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-methyl-1-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)prop-2-en-1-one, (CHO27) with an up to 1000-fold increased cytotoxic potency relative to its parent compound in cell culture assays. CHO27 at low nanomolar levels, inhibited prostate cancer (PCa) cell growth through cell cycle arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis. Activation of p53 accounted for, at least in part, the growth inhibition by CHO27 in vitro. Furthermore, i.p. administration of CHO27 suppressed the growth of established PCa 22Rv1 xenograft tumors accompanied with p53 and p21(Cip1) induction. CHO27 may be a lead for development of new therapeutic agents for PCa.
