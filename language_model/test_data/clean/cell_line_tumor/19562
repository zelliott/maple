We designed and synthesized pyrrole (Py)-imidazole (Im) hairpin polyamide 1-(chloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-1,2-dihydro-3H-benz[e]indole (seco-CBI) conjugates 1 and 2, which target both strands of the double-stranded region of the human telomere repeat sequences, 5'-d(TTAGGG)(n)-3'/5'-d(CCCTAA)(n)-3'. High-resolution denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that conjugates 1 and 2 alkylated DNA at the 3' A of 5'-ACCCTA-3' and 5'-AGGGTTA-3', respectively. Cytotoxicities of conjugates 1 and 2 were evaluated using 39 human cancer cell lines; averages of log IC(50) values for conjugates 1 and 2 were -6.96 (110 nM) and -7.24 (57.5 nM), respectively. Conjugates 1 and 2 have potential as antitumor drugs capable of targeting telomere repeat sequence.
