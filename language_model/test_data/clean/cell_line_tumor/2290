Toll-like receptors (TLR) signaling has dual effect of promoting tumor progression and anti-cancer property. This study was designed to determine the effect of polyinosinic-polycytidilic acid (poly I:C), a TLR3 agonist, on the proliferation of oral cancer cells.

Human oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, YD-10B and YD-8, were used. TLRs expression was examined by RT-PCR and IL-8 production by poly I:C was examined by ELISA. Cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay. Flow cytometry and Western blot analysis were performed to determine the molecular mechanism of poly I:C-induced cell death.

TLR3 was functionally expressed in YD-10B and YD-8 cells. Treatment of poly I:C inhibited the cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometry and Western blot analysis revealed that poly I:C induced apoptosis via a mitochondria-dependent pathway. In addition, combination treatment with poly I:C and paclitaxel more significantly inhibited cell proliferation compared with poly I:C or paclitaxel alone.

Poly I:C effectively inhibits oral cancer cell proliferation and can be considered as a candidate to improve the inhibitory effect of anti-cancer drugs.
