The P2Y2 nucleotide receptor (P2Y2R) interacts with alpha v integrins to activate G(o) and induce chemotaxis in human 1321N1 astrocytoma cells. In this study, it was determined that the P2Y2R also requires interaction with alpha v integrins to activate G12 and associated signaling pathways that control chemotaxis in 1321N1 cells. Mutation of the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) integrin-binding sequence in the first extracellular loop of the human P2Y2R to Arg-Gly-Glu (RGE), which prevents integrin interaction, did not inhibit G(q) or ERK1/2 signaling by the P2Y2R agonist UTP but completely inhibited activation of G12 and G12-mediated events, including Rho activation, cofilin and myosin light chain-2 phosphorylation, stress fiber formation and chemotaxis towards UTP. The involvement of G12 in all these events was verified by using a dominant negative G alpha12 construct. G12 activation by the P2Y2R also was inhibited by anti-alpha v beta5 integrin antibodies and alpha v integrin antisense oligonucleotides, suggesting that alpha v integrin activity and expression are required for the P2Y2R to activate G12. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that G alpha12 protein associates with the wild-type P2Y2R and with alpha v integrins but not with the RGE mutant P2Y2R or with alpha3 integrins. Collectively, these results suggest that alpha v integrin complexes provide the P2Y2R with access to G12, thereby allowing activation of this heterotrimeric G protein that controls actin cytoskeletal rearrangements required for chemotaxis.
