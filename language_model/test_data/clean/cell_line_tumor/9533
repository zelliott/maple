To investigate the effects of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) on apoptosis and proliferation of hepatoma cell lines.

Human hepatoma cell lines HepG2 and BEL 7402 were cultured in medium supplemented with different concentrations of UDCA, normal human hepatic line L-02 was used as control. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and gene expression were detected using methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay, flow cytometry, Western blot, DNA ladder assay, electron microscopy, and immunocytochemistry.

Ursodeoxycholic acid inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 and BEL7402 cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Ursodeoxycholic acid can change cell cycle distribution of HepG2 and BEL7402, the proportion of cells in G0-G1 phase increased whereas the proportion of S phase cells and G2-M phase cells decreased. Ursodeoxycholic acid arrested the cell cycle in G0-G1 phase by down-regulating the cell cycle related proteins cyclin D1, D3 and retinoblastoma protein (p(Rb)). The apoptotic rates of HepG2 and BEL7402 treated with UDCA (1.0 mmol/L) were significantly higher than those of control. In the HepG2 and BEL7402 treated with UDCA, expression of bcl-2 decreased whereas expression of Bax increased, the nuclear fragmentation and chromosomal condensed, cells shrank and lost attachment, apoptotic bodies and DNA ladders appeared. UDCA had no effect in inducing apoptosis on L-02 cell lines.

UDCA can selectively inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of HepG2 and BEL7402 cell lines by blocking cell cycle and regulating the expression of Bax/bcl-2 genes.
