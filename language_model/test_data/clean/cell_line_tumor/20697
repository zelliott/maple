To investigate the mechanisms for inhibition effects of PESV on proliferation of non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549.

MTT was used to observe cell growth and proliferation of A549 at different concentrations of PESV. Flow cytometry (FCM) was applied to analyze cell cycle distribution. Immunocytochemistry and western blot assay was recruited to detect the expression of VEGF, HIF-1alpha, PTEN after the intervention of PESV.

A549 cells may be arrested mainly in G0/G1 phase and cell proliferation was significantly inhibited (P < 0.01) after PESV intervention in a certain range of concentration. PESV can significantly reduce the expression of HIF-1alpha,VEGF and increase the expression of PTEN.

PESV can block cell cycle and inhibit angiogenesis directly to inhibit cell proliferation of non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 mainly through reducing the expression of HIF-1alpha, VEGF and increasing the expression of PTEN.
