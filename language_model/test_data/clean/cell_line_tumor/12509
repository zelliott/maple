The human kallikrein-related peptidases (KLK) are considered important prognostic biomarkers in cancer. The aim of the current study is to demonstrate gene expression of KLK7 in colorectal cancer (CRC) and to correlate the relative KLK7 expression level with clinicopathological factors of CRC.

KLK7 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was examined in nine CRC cancer cell lines by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The expression levels of KLK7 mRNA in cancerous tissues (n = 136) and paired normal tissues (n = 136) of CRC patients were also examined.

Six of the nine cell lines expressed the KLK7 gene. KLK7 mRNA expression levels in cancer tissues were significantly higher than those in normal tissues. Multivariate analysis revealed that the KLK7 mRNA expression level in cancer was an independent prognostic factor, especially in liver metastasis.

We provide evidence suggesting that KLK7 mRNA expression is correlated with prognosis in CRC patients, especially in liver metastasis.
