Although adenovirus vectors (Ad) provide high-level transduction efficacy to many cell types, extremely high doses of Ad are required for sufficient gene transduction into several tumors, including melanoma. Here, we demonstrated that the expression of coxsackie-adenovirus receptor, a primitive Ad-receptor, was very low in murine and human melanoma cells. We also found that fiber-mutant Ad containing the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence in the fiber knob remarkably augmented gene transduction efficacy in melanoma cells by targeting alpha(v)-integrins. In addition, intratumoral injection of RGD fiber-mutant Ad containing the tumor necrosis factor alpha gene (Ad-RGD-TNFalpha) revealed dramatic anti-tumor efficacy through hemolytic necrosis in an established murine B16 BL6 melanoma model. Ad-RGD-TNFalpha required one-tenth the dosage of Ad-TNFalpha to induce an equal therapeutic effect. These results suggest that alpha(v)-integrin-targeted Ad will be a very powerful tool for the advancement of melanoma gene therapy.
