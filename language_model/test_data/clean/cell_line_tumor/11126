To investigate the effects of Taohong Siwu decoction II on B16 melanoma in mice and the underlying mechanism.

C57BL/6J mice bearing B16 melanoma were used in this study. The experimental groups were treated respectively with Taohong Siwu decoction II at doses of 2.5, 5 and 10 g x kg(-1) and cyclophosphamide at 0.05 g x kg(-1), Taohong Siwu decoction II at 10 g x kg(-1) plus cyclophosphamide at 0.025 mg x kg(-1). The tumor volume and weight, the expression of VEGF and KDR/FLK-1 and the amount of MVD were measured.

The tumor volume and weight, the expression of VEGF and KDR/FLK-1 and the amount of MVD were reduced significantly after treatment with Taohong Siwu decoction II at the doses of 5 and 10 g x kg(-1) and Taohong Siwu decoction II combined with cyclophosphamide as compared with normal saline-treated group (P < 0.01).

Taohong Siwu decoction II can inhibit the growth of B16 melanoma in mice and attenuate the expressions of VEGF and KDR/FLK-1, suggesting that Taohong Siwu decoction II produces the antitumor effect via a possible antiagiogenisis mechanism.
