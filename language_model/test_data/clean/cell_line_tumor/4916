The synthesis and biological evaluation of potent and selective inhibitors of the erbB2 kinase is presented. Based on the 4-anilinoquinazoline chemotype, the syntheses of several new series of erbB2 inhibitors are described with quinazoline and pyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidine cores. The vast majority of these compounds are found to be >100x selective over the closely related EGFR kinase. Two lead compounds are further shown to have low clearance and moderate bioavailability in rat.
