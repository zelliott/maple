Two new compounds named fischeacid and fischexanthone, together with eight known compounds, were obtained from the culture of a marine-derived fungus Neosartorya fischeri strain 1008F‚ÇÅ. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated based on the spectroscopic data. Bioassays indicated that AGI-B4 and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid showed potent inhibitory effect on the replication of tobacco mosaic virus, and AGI-B4 also possessed an inhibition of the cell proliferation of human gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901 and hepatic cancer cells BEL-7404.
