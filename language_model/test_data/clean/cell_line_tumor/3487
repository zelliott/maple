There are a large number of stable pancreatic ductal carcinoma cell lines (PDCL) that are used by researchers worldwide. Detailed data about their differentiation status and genetic alterations are present in the literature, but a systematic correlation with cell biological behavior is often lacking. PDCL ( n=12) were clustered by source of tumor cell (ascites, primary tumor, metastasis), and the data of functional cell biology were correlated with the reported structural and genetic profiles. Major histocompatibility complex expression, chemosensitivity and aneuploidia appeared to be related to the source of PDCL, and proliferative capacity appeared to be related to the grade of differentiation. No correlation between genetic/structural features of PDCL and biological behavior was found. All the cell lines appeared generally insensitive to in vitro treatment with 5-fluorouracil and showed variable degrees of susceptibility to gemcitabine, raltitrexed and oxaliplatin. All the PDCL showed resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis but were significantly sensitive to the pro-apoptotic effect of inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha and interferon gamma]. PDCL were characterized for the secretion of several factors relevant to the tumor-immune cross talk. Vascular endothelial growth factor, CCL2, CCL5 and transforming growth factor beta were the factors most frequently released; less frequent was the secretion of CXCL8, CCL22, IL-6 and sporadically CXCL12, IL-10 and hepatocyte growth factor. The cytokines IL-1beta and TNFalpha were always undetectable. In conclusion, a clear correlation between structural/genetic features and function could not be detected, suggesting the weakness of a "morphological" classification for the in vitro studies of pancreatic cancer.
