Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a cancer with its highest prevalence among the southern Chinese and is rare elsewhere in the world. The main treatment modalities include chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, tumor chemoresistance often limits the efficacy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma treatment and reduces survival rates. Thus, identifying new selective chemotherapeutic drugs for nasopharyngeal carcinoma treatment is needed. In this current study, the antitumor efficacy of a polo-like kinase inhibitor, Ro5203280, was investigated. Ro5203280 induces tumor suppression both in vitro and in vivo. An inhibitory effect was observed with the highly proliferating cancer cell lines tested, but not with the nontumorigenic cell line. Real-time cell proliferation and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, together with immunohistochemical (IHC), immunofluorescence, and Annexin V staining assays, were used to evaluate the impact of drug treatment on cell cycle and apoptosis. Ro5203280 induces G2-M cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Western blotting shows it inhibits PLK1 phosphorylation and downregulates the downstream signaling molecule, Cdc25c, and upregulates two important mitosis regulators, Wee1 and Securin, as well as the DNA damage-related factor Chk2 in vitro and in vivo. In vivo tumorigenicity assays with Ro5203280 intravenous injection showed its potent ability to inhibit tumor growth in mice, with no observable signs of toxicity. These findings suggest the potential usefulness of Ro5203280 as a chemotherapeutic targeting drug for nasopharyngeal carcinoma treatment.
