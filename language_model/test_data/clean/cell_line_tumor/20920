To investigate the effect of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting c-myc gene in Hep-2 cells.

siRNA targeting c-myc mRNA was designed and synthesized. In vitro cultured Hep-2 cells were transfected with lipofectamine 2000 and the inhibitory effect was detected by MTT, morphology, real time PCR assay.

1) The MTT result showed the c-myc siRNA to be able effectively to suppress the Hep-2 cell multiplication; 2) The real time PCR result showed c-myc at mRNA level inhibition ratio at 94% in group S3; 3) The morphology result showed the c-myc siRNA to be able effectively to suppress the Hep-2 cell multiplication, the cell heteromorphism was diminished.

siRNA targeting c-myc can remarkably suppress the Hep-2 cell growth and multiplication.
