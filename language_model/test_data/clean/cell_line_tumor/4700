Phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) is one of the glycolytic enzymes and is a multifunctional enzyme that functions in glucose metabolism inside the cell while acting as a cytokine outside the cell, with properties that include autocrine motility factor (AMF) regulating tumor cell motility. Although there are many studies indicating that PGI/AMF has been implicated in progression of metastasis, no direct studies of the significance of exogenous PGI/AMF on tumor progression have been reported. Here, we report on the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), which is the reverse phenomenon of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition that is associated with loss of cell polarity, loss of epithelia markers, and enhancement of cell motility essential for tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Mesenchymal human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells, which have naturally high levels of endogenous and exogenous PGI/AMF, were stably transfected with PGI/AMF small interfering RNA (siRNA). The siRNA targeting human PGI/AMF down-regulated the endogenous PGI/AMF expression and completely extinguished the secretion of PGI/AMF in a human fibrosarcoma HT1080, whereas the control siRNA showed no effects. The PGI/AMF siRNA caused cells to change shape dramatically and inhibited cell motility and invasion markedly. Suppression of PGI/AMF led to a contact-dependent inhibition of cell growth. Those PGI/AMF siRNA-transfected cells showed epithelial phenotype. Furthermore, tumor cells with PGI/AMF deficiency lost their abilities to form tumor mass. This study identifies that MET in HT1080 human lung fibrosarcoma cells was initiated by down-regulation of the housekeeping gene product/cytokine PGI/AMF, and the results depicted here suggest a novel therapeutic target/modality for mesenchymal cancers.
