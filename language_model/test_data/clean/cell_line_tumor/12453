Ordered gelation under spin-coating conditions, as reported here, is a suitable method to order cells in biogels. Cell ordering is of great importance for functional repair of central nervous system (CNS) injuries, because therapies must include strategies to bridge chystic gaps and facilitate axon growth towards its target. Organized biocompatible and biodegradable substrates may be used for this purpose, to supply trophic support and provide directional cues for neuronal process outgrowth. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and low temperature scanning electron microscopy (LTSEM), confirmed that fibrils in kappa-carrageenan/chitosan and fibrin hydrogels prepared under spin-coating conditions, were longitudinally arranged. The cell model was conveniently tested using rat C6 glioma cells. C6 cells were distributed regularly in fibrin gels formed under centrifugal force. The ability of ordered fibrin scaffolds to promote uniform distribution of transplanted cells, was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy.
