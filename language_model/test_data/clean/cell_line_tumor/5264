Mouse Hepa1-6 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells were transduced with the membrane form of macrophage colony stimulating factor (mM-CSF). When mM-CSF transduced Hepa1-6 cells were injected subcutaneously into mice, these cells did not form tumors. The spleens of these immunized mice contained cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTL) that killed the unmodified Hepa1-6 cells. We show that the alternative form of macrophage colony stimulating factor (altM-CSF) induced CTL-mediated immunity against Hepa1-6 cells. AltM-CSF is restricted to the H-2D(b) allele. CTLs killed RMA-S cells loaded with exogenous altM-CSF peptide. Vaccination of mice with dendritic cells pulsed with the altM-CSF peptide stimulated anti-Hepa1-6 CTLs. Hyper-immunization of mice with mM-CSF Hepa1-6 cells showed inflammation of the liver and kidneys. Although altM-CSF was expressed within liver and kidney cells, its intensity was lower than Hepa1-6 cells. AltM-CSF was detected within the human HepG2 cell line. These studies suggest that altM-CSF may be a tumor antigen for HCC.
