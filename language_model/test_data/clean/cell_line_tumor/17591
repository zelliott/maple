Glucocorticoids (GC) induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in lymphoblastic leukemia cells. To investigate cell cycle effects of GC in the absence of obscuring apoptotic events, we used human CCRF-CEM leukemia cells protected from cell death by transgenic bcl-2. GC treatment arrested these cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle due to repression of cyclin D3 and c-myc. Cyclin E and Cdk2 protein levels remained high, but the kinase complex was inactive due to increased levels of bound p27(Kip1). Conditional expression of cyclin D3 and/or c-myc was sufficient to prevent GC-induced G1 arrest and p27(Kip1) accumulation but, importantly, did not interfere with the induction of apoptosis. The combined data suggest that repression of both, c-myc and cyclin D3, is necessary to arrest human leukemia cells in the G1 phase of the cell division cycle, but that neither one is required for GC-induced apoptosis.
