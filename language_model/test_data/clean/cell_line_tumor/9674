Loss of CDKN2A/p16(INK4A) in hematopoietic stem cells is associated with enhanced self-renewal capacity and might facilitate progression of damaged stem cells into pre-cancerous cells that give rise to leukemia. This is also reflected by the frequent loss of the INK4A locus in acute lymphoblastic T-cell leukemia. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells designed to conditionally express p16(INK4A) arrest in the G(0)/G(1) phase of the cell cycle and show increased sensitivity to glucocorticoid- and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 6-induced apoptosis. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanism for increased death sensitivity, we interfered with specific steps of apoptosis signaling by expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. We found that alterations in cell death susceptibility resulted from changes in the composition of pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL2 proteins, i.e. repression of MCL1, BCL2, and PMAIP1/Noxa and the induction of pro-apoptotic BBC3/Puma. Interference with Puma induction by short hairpin RNA technology or retroviral expression of MCL1 or BCL2 significantly reduced both glucocorticoid- and FAS-induced cell death in p16(INK4A)-reconstituted leukemia cells. These results suggest that Puma, in concert with MCL1 and BCL2 repression, critically mediates p16(INK4A)-induced death sensitization and that in human T-cell leukemia the deletion of p16(INK4A) confers apoptosis resistance by shifting the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL2 proteins toward apoptosis protection.
