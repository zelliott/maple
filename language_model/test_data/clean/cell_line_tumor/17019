The design, modeling, synthesis, biological evaluation of a novel series of photoreactive benzamide probes for class I HDAC isoforms is reported. The probes are potent and selective for HDAC1 and 2 and are efficient in crosslinking to HDAC2 as demonstrated by photolabeling experiments. The probes exhibit a time-dependent inhibition of class I HDACs. The inhibitory activities of the probes were influenced by the positioning of the aryl and alkyl azido groups necessary for photocrosslinking and attachment of the biotin tag. The probes inhibited the deacetylation of H4 in MDA-MB-231 cell line, indicating that they are cell permeable and target the nuclear HDACs.
