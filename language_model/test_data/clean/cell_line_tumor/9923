Several studies recognize cancer-stromal fibroblasts' role in cancer-cell invasion and metastasis. Through paracrine signaling molecules, TGF-beta and IL-1beta, cancer cells activate stromal fibroblasts and induce the expression of fibroblast activation protein (FAP). FAP, in turn, affects the proliferation, invasion and migration of the cancer cells. We report that TGF-beta and IL-1beta are important factors in inducing differentiation of myofibroblasts and expression of functional markers, notably alpha-SMA. We discover that TGF-beta is the dominant factor in promoting FAPalpha protein expression. This study also examines FAP's function in vitro by assaying the proliferation, migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cell line HO-8910PM.
