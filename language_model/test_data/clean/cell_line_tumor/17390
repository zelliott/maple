In the mast cell signaling pathways, the binding of immunoglobulin E (IgE) to FcepsilonRI, its high-affinity receptor, is generally thought to be a passive step. In this study, we examined the effect of IgE alone, that is, without antigen stimulation, on the degranulation in mast cells. Monomeric IgE (500-5,000 ng/ml) alone increased cytosolic Ca2+ level ([Ca2+]i) and induced degranulation in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 mast cells. Monomeric IgE (5,000 ng/ml) alone also increased [Ca2+]i and induced degranulation in bone marrow-derived mast cells. Interestingly, monomeric IgE (5-50 ng/ml) alone, in concentrations too low to induce degranulation, increased filamentous actin content in RBL-2H3 mast cells. We next examined whether actin dynamics affect the IgE alone-induced RBL-2H3 mast cell activation pathways. Cytochalasin D inhibited the ability of IgE alone (50 ng/ml) to induce de novo actin assembly. In cytochalasin D-treated cells, IgE (50 ng/ml) alone increased [Ca2+]i and induced degranulation. We have summarized the current findings into two points. First, IgE alone increases [Ca2+]i and induces degranulation in mast cells. Second, IgE, at concentrations too low to increase either [Ca2+]i or degranulation, significantly induces actin assembly, which serves as a negative feedback control in the mast cell Ca2+ signaling and degranulation.
