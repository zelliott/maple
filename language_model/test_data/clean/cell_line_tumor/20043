Clusterin (CLU) is a glycoprotein that is over-expressed in a number of             malignant tumors and has been proven to correlate closely with the chemoresistance             of several cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents. However, the effect of CLU             expression on the chemoresistance of bladder cancer to epirubicin remains unknown.             In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the role of CLU in the chemoresistance             of bladder cancer cells to epirubicin. Lentivirus-mediated RNA interference was             applied to knock down CLU in EJ bladder cancer cells. The efficiency was examined             by RT-PCR and western blot analysis. After stable CLU silencing, an EJ cell line             was established and cells were treated with or without epirubicin. Cell viability,             migration, invasiveness, clone formation and cell cycle progression were assessed             by MTT assay, wound healing assay, Matrigel invasion assay, plate clone formation             assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The results indicated that lentivirus-mediated             RNA interference effectively silenced CLU at the RNA and protein levels. CLU knockdown             increased the cytotoxicity of epirubicin to EJ bladder cancer cells. Combined             treatment with lentivirus-mediated shRNA targeting CLU and epirubicin had maximum             effects in bladder cancer cells on cell viability, migration, invasiveness and             clone-forming ability. Furthermore, cell cycle analysis indicated that CLU knockdown             reinforced the efficacy of epirubicin on G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Taken together,             our results suggest that CLU silencing enhances chemosensitivity of EJ bladder             cancer cells to epirubicin. Lentivirus-mediated shRNA targeting CLU may be an             alternative approach in the treatment of bladder cancer.
