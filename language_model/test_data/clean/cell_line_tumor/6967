The type II alpha isoform of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase has recently been shown to function in the recruitment of adaptor protein-1 complexes to the trans-Golgi network. Here we show that phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIalpha is also a component of highly dynamic membranes of the endosomal system where it colocalises with protein markers of the late endosome and with endocytosed epidermal growth factor. When phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIalpha activity was inhibited in vivo using the monoclonal antibody 4C5G or by depression of endogenous phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIalpha protein levels using RNA interference, ligand-bound epidermal growth factor receptor failed to traffic to late endosomes and instead accumulated in vesicles in a sub-plasma membrane compartment. Furthermore, lysosomal degradation of activated epidermal growth factor receptor was dramatically impaired in small inhibitory RNA-treated cells. We demonstrate that phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIalpha is necessary for the correct endocytic traffic and downregulation of activated epidermal growth factor receptor.
