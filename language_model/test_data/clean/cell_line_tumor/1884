Cellular responses toward cytotoxic drugs are influenced by crosstalk between             oncogenic signals and resistance mechanisms. Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway             is effective in sensitizing cancer cells of various organs, although the mechanisms             largely remain to be elucidated. Breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)/ABCG2,             a drug efflux pump, confers resistance to multiple anticancer agents such as SN-38             and topotecan. Previous studies reported that inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway,             by gene knockout or PI3K inhibitors, modulated BCRP-mediated drug transport via             BCRP translocation in hematopoietic stem cells, renal polarized cells and glioma             stem-like cells of mammals. In this study, we assessed the effects of PI3K inhibitors,             LY294002 and wortmannin, on BCRP-mediated anticancer drug resistance of human             cancer MCF-7 and A431 cells. LY294002, but not wortmannin, reversed the BCRP-mediated             SN-38 and topotecan resistance. LY294002 treatment did not affect total or cell             surface BCRP levels as determined by western blotting and flow cytometry but blocked             BCRP-mediated topotecan efflux in a dose-dependent manner. Immunohistochemical             analyses also demonstrated unchanged cellular BCRP distribution. BCRP overexpression             in MCF-7 and A431 cells did not confer LY294002 resistance, suggesting that LY294002             is not a transported substrate of BCRP. LY294002 is a derivative of quercetin,             a member of flavonoids. Taken together, these results suggest that LY294002 inhibits             BCRP-mediated drug transport not by BCRP translocation through the PI3K/Akt signal             but putatively as a competitive inhibitor in a major subset of cancer cells. Due             to its dual effects, LY294002 could be a lead compound for developing more effective             and tolerable reagents for cancer treatment.
