To observe the changes of CA916798 gene expression in human lung adenocarcinoma cell A549 and the multidrug-resistant cell line A549/CDDP after blocking the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.

Human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines A549 and A549/CDDP were treated with rapamycin and LY294002, and the cell growth changes in response to subsequent cisplatin treatment was observed; RT-PCR was performed to detect CA916798 mRNA expression in the treated cells.

Blocking PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway with rapamycin and LY294002 significantly reduced drug resistance of both A549 and A549/CDDP cells to cisplatin and obviously decreased the expression of CA916798 gene mRNA ( p<0.05).

CA9167981 gene is located downstream of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which might be one of the mechanisms of CA916798 to cause cisplatin resistance in the tumor cells.
