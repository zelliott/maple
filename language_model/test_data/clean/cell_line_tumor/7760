There is currently no successful therapy for androgen-independent prostate cancer. Ursolic acid (UA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid compound, has been shown to have an anti-proliferative effect on various tumors. We investigated the effect of UA on cell viability in the human hormone-refractory prostate cancer cell line DU145, as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying its growth inhibiting effect. We demonstrated that UA induces apoptosis and the activation of caspase-3 in DU145 cells. UA also causes the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but has no effect on extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK1/2) and p38 MAP kinases (p38). UA-induced JNK activation could result in Bcl-2 phosphorylation (Ser70) and degradation in DU145 cells, which may be one of the molecular mechanisms by which it induces apoptosis. Although further evaluation, such as in vivo testing, is clearly needed, the present results suggest the potential utility of UA as a novel therapeutic agent in advanced prostate cancer.
