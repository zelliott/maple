Aberrant reactivation of Gli signaling has been described in a wide variety of human cancers and rapamycin can down-regulate Gli pathway in some solid tumors. In this study, we attempt to define the cytotoxic effect of Gli inhibitor on AML cells. And the regulation action of rapamycin on Gli in AML cells also has been assessed. Gli inhibitor GANT61 caused growth arrest and apoptosis in AML cells. Rapamycin decreased not only the Gli protein and mRNA expressions but also expression of the Gli-luciferase reporter in AML cells. Synergism effect between GANT61 and rapamycin was found in Kasumi-1, HL-60 and U937 cell lines. The results suggest that aberrant Gli activation is a feature of some myeloid leukemic cells and Gli activiation can be down-regulated by rapamycin.
