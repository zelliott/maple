Since clinical application of conventional cancer therapies is usually limited by drug resistance and toxic side effects, combination of chemotherapeutic agents with gene therapy appears as an attractive therapeutic strategy to overcome these issues. Being selectively expressed in tumor tissues, survivin is a promising target for the development of anticancer strategies aimed at eliminating tumor cells while sparing normal tissues. In this work, we achieved substantial protein knockdown in a number of human cell lines, namely, A549, HeLa and MCF-7 cells which overexpress survivin, after treatment with anti-survivin siRNAs, which was associated with a significant reduction of cell viability, when compared to treatment with control siRNAs. Interestingly, when the survivin-silencing approach was combined with a chemotherapeutic agent, an enhancement of the therapeutic effect was achieved. Treatment with anti-survivin siRNAs resulted in high levels of caspase 3/7 activation, and an enhancement of this effect was observed when survivin silencing was combined with vinblastine. In addition, we showed that for A549 and HeLa cells survivin silencing contributes to the reversion of cell resistance to doxorubicin. Overall, we demonstrate that the combination of a survivin-directed silencing strategy with chemotherapeutic agents constitutes a valuable approach for cancer treatment.
