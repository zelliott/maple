Pancreatic cancer is characterized by a poor prognosis and an unsatisfactory response to conventional therapy. Appropriate experimental animal models that mimic the disease are essential to establish new therapies. The aim of this study was to compare homologous orthotopic cell implantation (OCI) and orthotopic tissue implantation (OTI) methods in the nitrosamine-derived HaP-T1 Syrian golden hamster pancreatic cancer model.

Pancreatic tumors were induced in 32 Syrian hamsters by the OCI (n = 16) and OTI (n = 16) techniques. OTI and OCI subgroups (n = 4) were killed at 1, 2, 5, and 8 weeks post-implantation. Tumor uptake and growth and the rates of local invasion and metastases were compared at autopsy.

Tumor uptake was 100% by OCI and 88% by OTI. Induced pancreatic tumors were significantly larger in the OCI group (mean weight, 1.7 g vs. 0.26 g, P < 0.01.) The incidence of local invasion and rates of lymph node, liver, and peritoneal metastases were all significantly higher in the OCI group.

The OCI method is more effective than OTI in terms of tumor uptake. Tumor growth and the rates of local invasion and spontaneous metastases are higher with OCI than OTI. The OCI method is better than OTI and can contribute to the development of therapeutic strategies in pancreatic cancer research.
