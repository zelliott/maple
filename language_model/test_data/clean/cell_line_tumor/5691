Two new triterpenoid saponins, ardipusillosides IV and V (1 and 2, resp.), together with one known saponin, ardisiacrispin B(3), were isolated from the whole plants of Ardisia pusilla A. DC. Their structures were deduced by extensive spectral analysis and chemical evidences. Compound 1 contains a glycosylated glycerol residue which is a very rare structural feature among triterpenoid glycosides and has been so far found only in the genus Ardisia. All the saponins exhibited significant cytotoxicity against human glioblastoma U251MG cells, but did not affect the growth of primary cultured human astrocytes.
