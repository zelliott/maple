To investigate the effect of osteopontin (OPN) on the invasion and metastasis of human hapatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

HCC cell lines (HCC-LM3) were transfected with the chemically synthesized small interfering RNA (siRNA). Real-time PCR and Western blot were used to quantify the mRNA and OPN protein levels. The malignant phenotypes including cellular growth, colony formation and invasion capability of the HCC cells were analyzed.

The OPN mRNA and proteins levels were decreased by 75% and 80% in OPN siRNA treated cells. Colony formation and migratory capability were reduced in OPN siRNA treated cells (P < 0.05).

The specific siRNA is able to reduce the OPN expression at both the mRNA and protein levels and significantly inhibits the invasiveness of HCC cells.
