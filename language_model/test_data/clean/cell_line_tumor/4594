We performed a 2-DE analysis of proteins of the newly established spontaneously immortalized clonal cell line EM-G3 derived from a primary lesion of infiltrating ductal breast carcinoma. EM-G3 cells may represent progenitors of the mammary epithelial cells spontaneously immortalized in early phase of cancerogenesis. We compared the protein profile of EM-G3 line with proteins from populations of normal mammary epithelial cells (NME), and determined the phenotype of both types of cells. NME cells are a mixture of both main cell types in breast epithelia, myoepithelial and luminal cells. The EM-G3 breast cancer cell line has a unique basal-like phenotype. We identified proteins that are differently expressed in these cells. Cytokeratin 16, cytokeratin 19, squamous cell carcinoma antigen 1, caphepsin B and caspase 14 were predominantly expressed by NME cells. Cytokeratin 13, isoelectric variant of annexin 5, isoelectric variant of chloride intracellular channel protein 1, glyoxalase 1 and glutamine synthetase were predominantly expressed by EM-G3 cells. The proteins up-regulated in EM-G3 cells may represent potential protein markers of mammary epithelial cells progenitors and may be important in early phase of carcinogenesis.
