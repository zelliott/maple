Aminoadamantanes are commonly used in the treatment of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. While these drugs are shown to antagonise ionotropic glutamate receptors on neuronal cells, additional mechanisms could contribute to their neuroprotective properties. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of aminoadamantanes on the production of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in glial cells. For this purpose, we measured the modulation of GDNF release in C6 glioma cell cultures treated for 24 h with amantadine and memantine. Both drugs dose-dependently increased GDNF level in the culture medium with similar potency (submicromolar range) and efficacy (three to four-fold induction). RT-PCR studies revealed that both compounds also increased GDNF mRNA levels and their influence on the GDNF gene transcription was further evidenced using a rat GDNF promoter luciferase reporter assay. Together, these results demonstrate that the neuroprotective effect of amantadine and memantine could involve the regulation of GDNF production by glial cells.
