A series of 5-alkyl-2-(alkylthio)-6-(1-(2,6-difluorophenyl)propyl)-3,4-dihydropyrimidin-4(3H)-one derivatives (3a-h) belonging to the F(2)-DABOs class of non-nucleoside HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are endowed with a strong antiproliferative effect and induce cytodifferentiation in A375 melanoma cells. Among tested compounds, the most potent is 3g (SPV122), which also induces apoptosis in a cell-density-dependent manner and antagonizes tumor growth in animal models. All these effects are similar or even more pronounced than those previously reported for other nucleoside or non-nucleoside inhibitors of reverse transcriptase or by functional knockout of the reverse-transcriptase-encoding long interspersed element 1 by RNA interference (RNAi). Taken together with our previously reported results, these data further confirm our idea that cellular alterations induced by NNRTIs are a consequence of the inhibition of the endogenous reverse transcriptase in A375 cells and support the potential of NNRTIs as valuable agents in cancer therapy.
