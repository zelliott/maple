In a panel of 18 colon cancer cell lines we found that the thymidylate synthase (TS) genotype was related to TS enzyme activity, but not to TS protein and mRNA levels. In addition, no relation with drug sensitivity was observed. TS genotyping of different tissues from 78 colorectal cancer patients revealed a high level of homology in polymorphic status between normal and malignant tissues and the heterozygous genotype to be the most frequent.
