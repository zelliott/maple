The aim of this work was to investigate the putative modulation of glucose uptake in trophoblast cells by several dietary compounds and by drugs of abuse. For this, the acute (26 min) and chronic (48 h) effect of these substances on the apical uptake of 3H-2-deoxy-D-glucose (3H-DG) by a human choriocarcinoma cell line (BeWo) was determined. 3H-DG apical uptake by BeWo cells was time dependent, displayed saturable kinetics (Vmax=1210+/-29 nmol mg protein(-1) 6 min(-1) and Km=13.4+/-0.5 mM) and was insulin-insensitive and cytochalasin B-sensitive (by up to 60%). Acutely, acetaldehyde (30-100 mM), resveratrol, xanthohumol, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (100 microM), chrysin and quercetin (10-100 microM) decreased 3H-DG apical uptake, whereas rutin, catechin (10-100 microM), epicatechin (100 microM) and ethanol (10 mM) increased it. Quercetin and xanthohumol seem to be non-competitive inhibitors of 3H-DG apical uptake, whereas both epigallocatechin-3-gallate and acetaldehyde decreased both the Km and Vmax values. Chronically, rutin and myricetin increased the apical uptake of 3H-DG both isolated (0.1-1 microM) and in combination (both at 1 microM), whereas theophylline (0.1-1 microM) and amphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (0.25-1 microM) and Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (1 nM) decreased it. In conclusion, 3H-DG apical uptake by BeWo cells is differentially modulated by different compounds present in drinks and by drugs of abuse.
