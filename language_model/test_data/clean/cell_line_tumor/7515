This paper aimed to investigate the preparation of doxorubicin-loaded bovine serum albumin nanoparticles (DOX/BSANP) and their effect on killing liver cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. DOX/BSANP was prepared using a desolvation-chemical crosslinking method. Their morphology and particle size were observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The envelopment, drug-loading rates and slow-release characteristics were determined spectrophotometrically. Their ability to kill liver cancer cells in vitro was determined using the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay and flow cytometry (FCM). The tumor-suppressing effect of the nanoparticles in experimental animals in vivo was also evaluated. Under TEM, DOX/BSANP appeared spherical and was distributed uniformly, with a diameter of about 120 nm and hydrated particle size of 170 nm determined by dynamic light diffraction. The envelopment rate was 82% and the drug-loading rate was 11.2%. The in vitro drug-release experiment showed that about 50% of the drug in drug-loaded nanoparticles was released continuously and slowly for 7 days. The MTT assay showed that DOX/BSANP significantly inhibited cell proliferation, while FCM showed that it induced tumor cell apoptosis. The in vivo tumor suppression test showed that the therapeutic effect of drug-loaded nanoparticles was superior to that of DOX alone.
