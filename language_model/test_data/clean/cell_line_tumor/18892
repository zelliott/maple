We evaluated the dose requirements for sustained in vivo activity of ofatumumab, a human anti-CD20 antibody under development for the treatment of B cell-mediated diseases. In a mouse xenograft model, a single dose, resulting in an initial plasma antibody concentration of 5 microg/ml, which was expected to result in full target saturation, effectively inhibited human B-cell tumour development. Tumour growth resumed when plasma concentrations dropped below levels that are expected to result in half-maximal saturation. Notably, tumour load significantly impacted antibody pharmacokinetics. In monkeys, initial depletion of circulating and tissue residing B cells required relatively high-dose levels. Re-population of B-cell compartments, however, only became detectable when ofatumumab levels dropped below 10 microg/ml. We conclude that, once saturation of CD20 throughout the body has been reached by high initial dosing, plasma concentrations that maintain target saturation on circulating cells (5-10 microg/ml) are probably sufficient for sustained biological activity. These observations may provide a rationale for establishing dosing schedules for maintenance immunotherapy following initial depletion of CD20 positive (tumour) cells.
