Four natural pyranocoumarins clausenidin (1), nordentatin (2), clausarin (3), and xanthoxyletin (4) were isolated from the medicinal plant Clausena excavata. Recently, we found that 1 and 2 suppressed hepatitis B virus surface antigen in HepA2 cells, and in addition, 1-3 showed cytotoxic activity against four human cancer cell lines (A549, MCF7, KB, and KB-VIN). To explore the SAR of 1-4, 17 pyranocoumarin analogues (5-21) were designed and synthesized. Among these analogues, 5 and 10 were the most potent against hepatitis B virus with EC(50) values of 1.14 and 1.34microM, respectively. The most interesting result in the cytotoxicity assay was the significant activity of 1, 5, and 6 against the multi-drug resistant cell line, KB-VIN, without activity against the KB cell line. These data suggest that these three compounds could be useful hits for developing MDR-inverse drugs.
