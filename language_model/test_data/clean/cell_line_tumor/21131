Cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells (CTL/NK) induce cell death in leukemia cells by the granzyme B (grB)-dependent granule cytotoxin (GC) pathway. Resistance to GC may be involved in immune evasion of leukemia cells. The delivery of active grB into the cytoplasma is dependent on the presence of perforin (PFN) and grB complexes. We developed a rapid method for the isolation of GC to investigate GC-mediated cell death in primary leukemia cells. We isolated GC containing grB, grB complexes and PFN by detergent free hypotonic lysis of the human NK cell leukemia line YT. The GC induce grB-mediated, caspase-dependent apoptosis in live cells. The human leukemia cell lines KG-1, U937, K562 (myeloid leukemia), Jurkat, Daudi, and BV173 (lymphoblastic leukemia) treated with GC internalized grB and underwent cell death. In primary leukemia cells analyzed ex vivo, we found GC-resistant leukemia cells in three out of seven patients with acute myeloid leukemia and one out of six patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We conclude that our method is fast (approximately 1 h) and yields active GC that induce grB-dependent cell death. Furthermore, resistance to GC can be observed in acute leukemias and may be an important mechanism contributing to leukemia cell immune evasion.
