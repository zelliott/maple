The design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a simplified fluorescently labeled discodermolide analogue possessing a dimethylaminobenzoyl fluorophore has been achieved. Stereoselective Suzuki coupling and Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction comprised the key tactics for its construction. The analogue exhibited qualitatively similar activity to paclitaxel in a tubulin assembly assay, and it can thus be used as a fluorescent molecular probe to explore the local environment of the discodermolide binding site on tubulin. The results of fluorescence measurements on the tubulin-bound analogue are reported.
