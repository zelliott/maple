The current study characterizes the impact of docetaxel (DTX) distribution on efficacy following sustained intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy in murine models of ovarian cancer. A polymer-lipid biodegradable depot (PoLigel) was used to deliver DTX in a sustained manner over 21-days following IP administration. Distribution and efficacy studies were carried out in SCID mice bearing SKOV3 IP solid tumors or C57BL/6 mice with ID8 IP ascites fluid. In addition, a subcutaneous (SC) SKOV3 model was used to determine whether systemic drug levels that result from IP administration of the PoLigel influence antitumor efficacy. Immunostained IP and SC SKOV3 tumor sections were used to study cell death, intratumoral drug distribution and tumor penetration. Sustained concentrations of DTX were observed in plasma, tissue, tumor and ascites over the entire study period. Drug accumulation was several fold greater in tumors and ascites when compared to plasma levels. Sustained chemotherapy resulted in significant reduction in tumor burden and ascites volume. IP tumors showed greater cell death compared to the SC tumors as seen by higher TUNEL and caspase-3 expression. At the intratumoral level, DTX distributed more towards the core of IP tumors compared to the SC tumors. Tumor penetration of drug from nearest blood vessel was 1.5 fold greater in the IP tumors than the SC tumors. Overall, favorable drug distribution at the whole-body, peritoneal and intratumoral levels in combination with local and systemic sustained drug exposure contribute to the high efficacy observed. These results encourage the clinical use of IP sustained chemotherapy for ovarian cancer.
