To clarify the molecular basis of acquired cisplatin (CDDP) resistance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), we used cDNA microarray technology. A CDDP-resistant cell line (YES-2/CDDP), which shows a 7.5-fold increase in resistance to CDDP and a 3-fold decrease in CDDP accumulation compared with the parental YES-2 ESCC cell line, was generated from YES-2 by exposure to increased concentrations of CDDP. By cDNA microarray analysis, we identified 44 genes with significantly different expression levels between YES-2/CDDP and YES-2 cells. Interestingly, 15 of these 44 genes encoded ribosome-related proteins, almost all of which were underexpressed in YES-2/CDDP cells. Our present data suggest that many ribosome-related genes may be involved in the acquired resistance to CDDP in ESCC and that such information may allow us to better understand the mechanism of CDDP resistance.
