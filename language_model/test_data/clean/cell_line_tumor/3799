A new spiroindene pigment, phelliribsin A, was isolated from the medicinal fungus Phellinus ribis, and its structure was determined by two dimensional (2D)-NMR methods. Phelliribsin A is an unprecedented spiroindene compound, and was found to have cytotoxic activity against PC12 cells at a concentration of 30 µM.
