Endostatin is an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis and has been shown to exhibit potent inhibitory activity in certain mice tumor models. In this study, a treatment strategy of combining recombinant human endostatin (rhEndostatin) and chemotherapeutics was implemented to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of rhEndostatin against solid tumors. The antitumor effect of rhEndostatin in combination with several chemotherapeutic drugs, e.g., 5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and mitomycin C, on human QGY liver tumor and mice H22 liver tumor was compared with that of rhEndostatin treatment alone. The results showed that the combination of rhEndostatin and chemotherapeutic drugs resulted in a more potent inhibition of tumor growth. The potential advantages of rhEndostatin plus tumor chemotherapy provide a basis for further clinical trials of rhEndostatin.
