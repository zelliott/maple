Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is characterized by a high incidence of benign and malignant tumors attributed to loss of function of Nf1, which encodes neurofibromin, a tumor suppressor with Ras-GAP activity. Neurofibromin deficiency typically causes chronic activation of Ras, considered the major contributor to manifestation of NF1. Resistance to radio- and chemotherapy are typical of NF1-associated tumors, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we investigated interrelationships between neurofibromin expression, Ras activity, and sensitivity to apoptosis. Neurofibromin-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and human NF1 tumor cells were more resistant than neurofibromin-expressing cells to apoptosis. Moreover, Nf1(-/-), Nf1(+/-), and Nf1(+/+) MEFs exhibited gene-dosage-related resistance to apoptosis. Resistance of the Nf1-deficient cells was mediated by two survival pathways: a Ras-dependent pathway, and a Ras-independent pathway promoted by the lack of an NF1-GRD-independent proapoptotic action of neurofibromin. Therefore, besides its Ras-dependent growth inhibition, neurofibromin can exert tumor suppression via a proapoptotic effect.
