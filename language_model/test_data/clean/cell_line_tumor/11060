Dendritic cell (DC)-tumor fusion hybrid vaccinees that facilitate antigen presentation represent a novel powerful strategy in cancer immunotherapy. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that IL-12 promotes specific antitumor immunity mediated by T cells in several types of tumors. In the present study, we investigated the antitumor immunity derived from vaccination of fusion hybrids between DCs and engineered J558/IL-12 myeloma cells secreting Th1 cytokine IL-12.

The expression vector pcDNA-IL-12 was generated and transfected into J558 myeloma cells and then bone marrow-derived DCs were fused with engineered J558/IL-12 cells. The antitumor immunity derived from vaccination of the fusion hybrid DC/J558/IL-12 was evaluated in vitro and in vivo.

DC/J558/IL-12 cells secreted recombinant IL-12 (1.6 ng/mL), and inoculation of BALB/c mice with DC/J558/IL-12 hybrid induced a Th1 dominant immune response and resulted in tumor regression. Immunization of mice with engineered DC/J558/IL-12 hybrid elicited stronger J558 tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses in vitro as well as more potent protective immunity against J558 tumor challenge in vivo than immunization with the mixture of DCs and J558/IL-12, J558/IL-12 and J558, respectively. Furthermore, the anti-tumor immunity mediated by DC/J558/IL-12 tumor cell vaccination in vivo appeared to be dependent on CD8+ CTL.

These results demonstrate that the engineered fusion hybrid vaccines that combine Th1 cytokine gene-modified tumor cells with DCs may be an attractive strategy for cancer immunotherapy.
