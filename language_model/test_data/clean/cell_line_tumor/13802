The motility, angiogenesis and metastasis-stimulating factor Autotaxin (Atx), over expressed by human neuroblastomas (NB), is constitutively expressed by human Nmyc-amplified SK-N-BE and non-Nmyc-amplified SH-SY5Y NB cells. Here, we characterise a novel Atx transcriptional mechanism, utilised by both cell lines, that is restricted to the first 285bp of the Atx promoter and involves AP-1 and SP transcription factors, acting through a CRE/AP-1-like element at position -142 to -149 and a GAbox at position -227 to -235 relative to the Atx translational start site. This novel transcriptional mechanism can be inhibited by internally initiated SP-3 and the natural phenol curcumin.
