In this study, the role of the endothelin B receptor (ETBR) in oligodendroglioma cell proliferation and survival was investigated in vitro and in vivo. The overexpression and knockdown of ETBR was conducted in Hs683 human oligodendroglioma cells, and cell proliferation and activation (phosphorylation) of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were measured in vitro. An orthotopic xenograft oligodendroglioma mouse model was established. Mouse survival times and immunohistochemical Ki67 staining in the xenografts were examined. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the overexpression of ETBR significantly enhanced the proliferation of oligodendroglioma cells and the activation of ERK compared with the controls, which was eliminated by the selective ETBR inhibitor BQ788 and ERK-specific inhibitor U0126, but not selective endothelin A receptor inhibitor BQ123. By contrast, the knockdown of endogenous ETBR markedly decreased oligodendroglioma cell proliferation and the activation of ERK compared with the controls. Overexpression of ETBR significantly increased immunohistochemical Ki67 staining in the Hs683 cell orthotopic xenograft and decreased animal survival. By contrast, knockdown of ETBR significantly decreased Ki67 staining and increased mouse survival times. Intratumoral injection of BQ788, but not BQ123, significantly decreased Ki67 staining and prolonged mouse survival times. In conclusion, ETBR was demonstrated to mediate the proliferation of oligodendroglioma cells according to an ERK-dependent mechanism. Using an orthotopic xenograft oligodendroglioma mouse model, it was demonstrated in vivo that ETBR promotes oligodendroglioma proliferation and that the selective ETBR antagonist effectively inhibits the proliferation of oligodendroglioma cells and prolongs survival times. This study provides a novel insight into the role of ETBR in oligodendroglioma proliferation and survival, and provides the first in vivo evidence that ETBR-specific antagonists are a potential therapeutic alternative for oligodendrogliomas.
