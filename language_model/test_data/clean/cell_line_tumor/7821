Three new Cd(II) complexes with the Schiff base ligand derived from the condensation 1+2 of 2,6-diacetylpyridine and 5,6-diamino-1,3-dimethyluracil have been "in template" synthesized. The molecular structures of complexes were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The metal center shows a very distorted mer-bis-tridentate CdN(6) octahedral geometry as consequence of the reduced bite angles of the ligand and the existence of long-distanced interactions with donor atoms in the neighbourhood. The luminescent properties of complexes in CH(3)CN solution were investigated showing the emission energies depend on the uracil part of the ligand. The evaluation of their biological properties against C6 glioma cell line indicates that cadmium(II) complexes could be an interesting tools to treat drug-resistant brain tumors.
