Over 6 million people die annually in the world because of cancer. Several groups are focused on studying cancer chemoprevention approaches. Resveratrol, a polyphenol, at high dosages, has been reported as antitumor and chemopreventive. However, it has a dose-dependent effect on cell death, even on some cancer cells.

Our aim was to investigate this dose-dependent effect on human bladder carcinoma ECV304 cells during oxidative stress condition.

For this purpose, ECV304 cells incubated with different Resveratrol concentrations were analyzed as for their metabolic rate, membrane permeability, DNA fragmentation, anti/proapoptotic protein levels and phosphatidylserine exposure after oxidative stress.

Resveratrol induced cell death at high concentrations (>20 μM), but not at low ones (0.1-20 μM). Pretreatment with 2.5 μM protected the cells from oxidative damage, whereas 50 μM intensified the cell death and significantly increased Bad/Bcl-2 ratio (proapoptotic/antiapoptotic proteins). Resveratrol was able to modulate NO and PGE(2) secretion and performed an anti-adhesion activity of neutrophils on PMA-activated ECV304 cells.

Resveratrol at high doses induces cell death of ECV304 cells whereas low doses induce protection. Modulation of Bcl-2 protein induced by Resveratrol could be mediating this effect. This information about the role of Resveratrol on cancer alerts us about its dose-dependent effects and could lead the design of future chemoprevention strategies.
