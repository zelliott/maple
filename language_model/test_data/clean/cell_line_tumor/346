The resistance to interferons (IFNs) limits their anticancer therapeutic efficacy. Here we studied the antiproliferative effect of interferon gamma in relation to SOCS3 expression in a panel of breast cancer cell lines and normal mammary epithelial cells. Compared to normal cells most breast cancer lines (7/8) were highly resistant to IFN-gamma. Using Northern blot and real time RT-PCR we investigated transcription of SOCS3 genes. All normal epithelial cells (4/4) showed SOCS3 induction (2-14 fold) while most breast cancer lines did not or weakly activated SOCS3 after the interferon gamma treatment. Among the cancer lines, the MDA-MB-468 cells showed increased sensitivity to IFN-gamma and relatively high level of SOCS3 induction (2-3 fold). Together, there was a good correlation
