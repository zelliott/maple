Particularly suitable: An N-terminal serine mutant of anti-HER2 scFv antibody was conjugated to polymer-coated magnetofluorescent nanoparticles by strain-promoted alkyne-nitrone cycloaddition. The resulting nanoparticles (see scheme) proved effective in targeting and labeling HER2-positive breast cancer cells.
