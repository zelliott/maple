Core-shell Fe(3)O(4)@NaLuF(4):Yb,Er/Tm nanostructure (MUCNP) with multifunctional properties has been developed using a step-wise synthetic method. The successful fabrication of MUCNP has been confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The MUCNP exhibits superparamagnetic property with saturation magnetization of 15 emu g(-1), and T(2)-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) effect with an r(2) value of 21.63 s(-1) mM(-1) at 0.5 T, resulting from the Fe(3)O(4) cores. Moreover, the NaLuF(4)-based MUCNP provides excellent X-ray attenuation and upconversion luminescence (UCL) emission under excitation at 980 nm. In vivo MR, computed tomography (CT) and UCL images of tumor-bearing mice show that the MUCNP can be successfully used in multimodal imaging. In vitro tests reveal that the MUCNP is non-cytotoxic. These results suggest that the developed MUCNP could be served as an MR, CT and UCL probe for tri-modality imaging.
