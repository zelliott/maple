γδ T cells play important roles in innate immunity against tumors and infections. Inhibitory effect of dihydroartemisinin on growth of cancer cells has been found in recent years. In this study, we investigated the effect of dihydroartemisinin on human γδ T cell proliferation by MTT assay and killing activity against pancreatic cancer cells SW1990, BxPC-3 and PANC-1 by LDH release assay in vitro. Intracellular molecule alterations were verified by flow cytometry. The results suggested that appropriate concentration of dihydroartemisinin favored the expansion of γδ T cells and enhanced γδ T cell mediated killing activity against pancreatic cancer cells. Up-regulation of intracellular perforin, granzyme B expression and IFN-γ production may be the important mechanism of dihydroartemisinin on increased antitumor activity of γδ T cells.
