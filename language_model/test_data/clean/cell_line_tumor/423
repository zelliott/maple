To determine the effect of arsenic trioxide combined with adriamycin(ADM) on the proliferation and apoptosis of human lymphoma cells.

Raji cells were divided into an experimental group and a control group, and the experimental group was further divided into 1 micromol/L As(2)O(3) group,2 micromol/L As(2)O(3) group, ADM group,1 micromol/L As(2)O(3) and ADM group,2 micromol/L As(2)O(3) and ADM group. Human lymphoma cells Raji were treated with As(2)O(3) combined with ADM. Wright-Giemsa dying assay was used to observe the apoptosis morphology of lymphoma cells. The proliferation of the cells treated with As(2)O(3) and adriamycin was detected by the method of 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide(MTT). Flow cytometry(FCM) was used to detect the apoptosis rate of lymphoma and the fluorescene density in the lymphocytes. Effect of arsenic trioxide and adriamycin on the mutant p53 expression in Raji cells was detected by semi-quantitive RT-PCR.

Evident apoptotic morphological changes of Raji cells were observed 24 hours after treatment with As(2)O(3) or ADM. Compared with As(2)O(3) or ADM alone, As(2)O(3) combined with ADM could increase the inhibition ratio significantly ( p<0.05), and the inhibition rate was related to the concentration and action time of As(2)O(3) ( p<0.05). Compared with As(2)O(3) or ADM alone, As(2)O(3) combined with ADM could increase the apoptosis rate of lymphoma cells with obvious difference ( p<0.05). Semi-quantitive and RT-PCR showed that the expression of mutant p53 in As(2)O(3) and ADM alone and combined groups was obviously less than that in the control ( p<0.05). After the treatment with 1 micromol/L and 2 micromol/L As(2)O(3), the fluorescene density in the Raji cells was 18.53 and 18.12, 0.056 and 0.023 times increase respectively.There was no difference (p>0.05).

As(2)O(3) and ADM alone or combined can inhibit the proliferation, induce cell apoptosis, and downregulate the expression of mutant p53 in vitro. As(2)O(3) combined with ADM has synergistic anti-lymphoma cell effect in vitro. As(2)O(3) has no significant effect on the concentration of ADM on the Raji cells, but can enhance the chemosensitivity of Raji cells, and its mechanism may be that it can downregulate the expression of mutant p53.
