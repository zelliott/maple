Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumor affecting human adults and remain a therapeutic challenge because cells of origin are still unknown. Here, we investigated the cellular origin of low-grade gliomas in a rat model based on transplacental exposure to N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU). Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging coupled to immunohistological and immunocytochemical analyses were used to further characterize low-grade rat gliomas at different stages of evolution. We showed that early low-grade gliomas have characteristics of oligodendroglioma-like tumors and exclusively contain NG2-expressing slow dividing precursor cells, which express early markers of oligodendroglial lineage. These tumor-derived precursors failed to fully differentiate into oligodendrocytes and exhibited multipotential abilities in vitro. Moreover, a few glioma NG2+ cells are resistant to radiotherapy and may be responsible for tumor recurrence, frequently observed in humans. Overall, these findings suggest that transformed multipotent NG2 glial precursor cell may be a potential cell of origin in the genesis of rat ENU-induced oligodendroglioma-like tumors. This work may open up new perspectives for understanding biology of human gliomas.
