The candidate gene for Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type IIIC has been localized to the pericentric region of the chromosome 8 by the linkage disequilibrium analysis. To validate the localization of the gene, we rescued the deficient acetyl-coenzyme A: alpha-glucosaminide-N-acetylytransferase activity in the cultured cells of MPS IIIC patients by functional complementation via microcell-mediated chromosome transfer. The introduction of the target human monochromosome completely restored the activity confirming functional localization of the candidate gene on human chromosome 8.
