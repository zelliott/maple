Cholestane glycosides, dioseptemlosides A (1) and B (2), together with six spirostane glycosides, dioseptemlosides C-H (3-8), were isolated from the rhizomes of Dioscorea septemloba. Their structures were established on the basis of physical data, spectroscopic analysis (HRESIMS, 1D and 2D NMR), and chemical methods. Spirostane aglcones containing hydroxyl group at C-7, as found in compounds 4-7, were reported in the family Dioscoreaceae for the first time. These compounds did not show considerable inhibitory anti-tumor activities at a concentration of 10 microM.
