Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) involves the administration of a tumor localizing photosensitizing agent, which upon activation with light of an appropriate wavelength leads to the destruction of the tumor cells. The aim of the present study was to determine the efficacy of erythrosine as a photosensitizer for the PDT of oral malignancies. The drug uptake kinetics of erythrosine in malignant (H357) and pre-malignant (DOK) oral epithelial cells and their susceptibility to erythrosine-based PDT was studied along with the determination of the subcellular localization of erythrosine. This was followed by initial investigations into the mechanism of cell killing induced following PDT involving both high and low concentrations of erythrosine. The results showed that at 37 °C the uptake of erythrosine by both DOK and H357 cells increased in an erythrosine dose dependent manner. However, the percentage of cell killing observed following PDT differed between the 2 cell lines; a maximum of ~80% of DOK cell killing was achieved as compared to ~60% killing for H357 cells. Both the DOK and H357 cell types exhibited predominantly mitochondrial accumulation of erythrosine, but the mitochondrial trans-membrane potential (ΔΨ(m)) studies showed that the H357 cells were far more resistant to the changes in ΔΨ(m) when compared to the DOK cells and this might be a factor in the apparent relative resistance of the H357 cells to PDT. Finally, cell death morphology and caspase activity analysis studies demonstrated the occurrence of extensive necrosis with high dose PDT in DOK cells, whereas apoptosis was observed at lower doses of PDT for both cell lines. For H357 cells, high dose PDT produced both apoptotic as well as necrotic responses. This is the first instance of erythrosine-based PDT's usage for cancer cell killing.
