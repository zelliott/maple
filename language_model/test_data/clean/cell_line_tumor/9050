(-)-Menthol ([1-alpha]-5-methyl-2-[1-methylethyl]-cyclohexanol), is a widely used flavoring ingredient in mouthwash, foods, toothpaste and cigarettes. The studies reported here revealed that (-)-menthol induced cytotoxicity against murine leukemia WEHI-3 cells in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of (-)-menthol on WEHI-3 cells in vivo (BALBIc mice) were also examined, and it was observed that the Mac-3 and CD11b markers were decreased, indicating inhibition of differentiation of the precursor of macrophage and granulocyte. The weights of liver and spleen samples from mice treated with (-)-menthol were found to be decreased compared to untreated animals.
