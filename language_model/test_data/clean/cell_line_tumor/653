Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) accounts for 5-10% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas and has the worst prognosis among all lymphomas. The hallmark of MCL is a t(11;14) translocation that results in overexpression of cyclin D1 by tumor cells of virtually all patients. In this study, we examined whether cyclin D1 could be an effective tumor-associated antigen for immunotherapy. We identified cyclin D1 peptides for HLA-A(*)0201 and generated peptide-specific CD8(+) T-cell lines from HLA-A(*)0201(+) blood donors and MCL patients. These cell lines proliferated in response to cyclin D1 peptide-pulsed stimulatory cells. Moreover, the T cells efficiently lysed peptide-pulsed but not unpulsed T2 cells and autologous dendritic cells; cyclin D1(+) and HLA-A(*)0201(+) human MCL lines MINO, SP53, Jeko-1 and Granta 519; and more importantly, HLA-A(*)0201(+) primary lymphoma cells from MCL patients. No killing was observed with HLA-A(*)0201(-) primary lymphoma cells or HLA-A(*)0201(+) normal blood cells, including B cells. These results indicate that these T cells are potent cytotoxic T cells and recognize cyclin D1 peptides naturally presented by patient lymphoma cells in the context of HLA-A(*)0201 molecules. Taken together, our work identifies cyclin D1 as a potentially important antigen for immunotherapy of MCL.
