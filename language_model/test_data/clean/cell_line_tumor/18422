To study the effects of tumor-derived monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1, CCL2) on the anti-tumor immune response we used the 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma which constitutively expresses CCL2. We generated 4T1 that do not express detectable levels of CCL2 and found that the T cell response to the tumors were altered. Lymph nodes draining the CCL2- tumor contained CD62Llo cells that produced greater levels of INF-gamma in response to the tumor than CD62Llo cells from lymph nodes draining a tumor that produced CCL2. Moreover, exposure of splenic T cells to recombinant CCL2 in vitro decreased the ability of the T cells to produce IFN-gamma. However, despite the enhanced effector function evident in the absence of CCL2, vaccination/challenge experiments failed to reveal an increase in immunogenicity of the CCL2 null cells relative to the CCL2+ cells. Collectively, these data indicate that tumor-derived CCL2 could decrease T cell effector function, yet not the overall immunogenicity of the tumor.
