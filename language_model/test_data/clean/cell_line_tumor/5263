A gastric cancer (GC) cell line, AGS, has high-level expression of CD40, a tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family member. CD40 is present on the surfaces of a large variety of cells, including B cells, endothelial cells, dendritic cells and some carcinoma cells, and delivers signals regulating diverse cellular responses, such as proliferation, differentiation, growth suppression, and cell death. In this research, we studied the effects of different forms of CD40 stimulation on AGS cells by flow cytometry, Western blotting and siRNA transfection. We found that different forms of CD40 stimulation, either recombinant soluble CD40L (sCD40L, ligation) or agonist anti-CD40 antibody (cross-linking), induced different effects in AGS gastric cancer cells, proliferation or apoptosis. We also showed that VEGF provided a significant contribution to sCD40L-induced proliferation, while agonist anti-CD40 antibody induced GADD45 upregulation and promoted apoptosis.
