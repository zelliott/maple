Galectin-3-binding protein (G3BP) is highly expressed in various types of             cancer and is thought to be involved in cancer malignancy; however, the role of             G3BP in breast cancer cells is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated             the role of NF-κB in the adhesion of breast cancer cells to a substrate by using             (-)-DHMEQ, a specific inhibitor of NF-κB. (-)-DHMEQ inhibited both TNF-α-induced             G3BP expression and cell adhesion in human breast cancer cell lines. We also found             that knockdown of G3BP suppressed the adhesion, while its overexpression increased             the adhesion. These data reveal that (-)-DHMEQ suppresses breast cancer cell adhesion             by inhibiting NF-κB-regulated G3BP expression.
