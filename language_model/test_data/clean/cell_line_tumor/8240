To study the effects of Feiyanning Decoction, a compound traditional Chinese herbal medicine, on proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 cells and their production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha).

A549 cells were incubated with rat serum containing Feiyanning Decoction at 15% for 24, 48 and 72 h respectively. The cell proliferation was examined by 2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2, 4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt assay (WST-8). The production of IL-6 and IL-8 was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay after 48-hour treatment of reagents, and the expressions of IL-6 and IL-8 mRNAs were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.

Serum containing Feiyanning Decoction had obvious inhibitive functions in A549 cell proliferation after 48- and 72-treatment. TNF-alpha (1 microg/L) strongly induced the production of IL-6 and IL-8 as compared with the control serum in A549 cells, and the induced cytokine production was significantly suppressed by 15% serum containing Feiyanning Decoction ( p<0.01). In addition, serum containing Feiyanning Decoction could inhibit the mRNA expressions of IL-6 and IL-8 ( p<0.01).

Feiyanning Decoction can inhibit IL-6 and IL-8 production induced by TNF-alpha. It is therefore expected to be a new strategy for treating lung cancer.
