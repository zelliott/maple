A series of new 3-amino-5-sulfanyl-1,2,4-triazole and 2-amino-5-sulfanyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives have been synthesized and their cytotoxicities were evaluated on a panel of human cancer cell lines (BxPC-3, H1975, SKOV-3, A875, HCT116, etc.). The best one (compound 5m) exhibited activities with IC50 values ranging from 0.04 to 23.6 µM against nine human cancer cell lines. Further biological evaluation indicated that DNA replication was blocked by treatment with compound 5m in HCT116 cells.
