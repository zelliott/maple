In an attempt to discover a potent and selective anticancer agent, gallic acid has been modified to benzylidene indanones as tubulin polymerization inhibitors. These compounds were evaluated against several human cancer cell lines and also evaluated for inhibition of tubulin polymerase in in vitro assays. Three of the analogues exhibited strong cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines IC(50)=10-880 nM and also showed tubulin polymerization inhibition (IC(50)=0.62-2.04 Î¼M). Compound 9j, the best candidate of the series was found to be non-toxic in acute oral toxicity in Swiss-albino mice up to 1000 mg/kg dose.
