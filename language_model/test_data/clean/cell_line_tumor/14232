We investigated the effect of modeled microgravity (MMG) on normal vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and neoplastic human breast cancer cells (MCF-7). In both cell types, MMG induced partial arrest in G2M and increased p14-3-3, HSP70, HSP60 and p21 expression. Cells synchronized by 24h starvation reentered the normal cycle within 24h if released in complete medium and exposed to normal gravity, but not if exposed to MMG. Similarly, MMG prevented VSMC and MCF-7 cells from overcoming growth arrest and re-synthesizing DNA. This study shows that cells adjust their metabolic rate in response to MMG.
