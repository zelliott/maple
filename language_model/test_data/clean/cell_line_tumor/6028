The adherence of Helicobacter pylori to gastric epithelial cells is required for prolonged persistence in the stomach and for induction of injury. Here, we first reported a new role of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) on the adherence of H. pylori to gastric epithelial cells, assessed by different methods and binding to immobilized RAGE. RAGE-targeted knock-down in MKN74 cell line markedly reduced not only the adhesion of H. pylori, but also the levels of IL-8 transcripts and protein released in response to infection. These data suggest that RAGE may represent a new factor on the pathogenesis of H. pylori infection.
