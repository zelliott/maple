Rhomboid domain containing 1 (RHBDD1) gene, a new member of rhomboid family of proteins is highly responsible for the regulation of apoptosis by cleaving pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein BIK. Therefore, the higher expression levels of RHBDD1 in cancer tissues may have a direct influence on cancer progression by arresting apoptosis. With this background this study was focused to find out the effect of RHBDD1 silencing on the progression of human brain glioblastoma cells, U251 and U87MG. The results indicated that both cell lines show a higher expression level of RHBDD1 and RNA interference (RNA) mediated gene silencing successfully down regulated the RHBDD1 gene expression. As a result of RHBDD1 silencing the proliferation of both cell types was reduced by over 50%, 5 days after silencing. Moreover the colony formation was completely inhibited and there were no cells present following two week RHBDD1 gene silencing. The cell proliferation was inhibited as a result of cell cycle arrest due to RHBDD1 absence. Therefore, these results clearly indicate that, RHBDD1 is essential for the progression of glioblastoma cells and silencing of it is resulting in significant inhibition of cell cycle progression and cell proliferation. Collectively, this study shows that RHBDD1 gene engineering could be used as an effective tool in malignant brain tumor therapy.
