Growth of FRM cells was inhibited by the addition of pyridoxine in a dose-dependent manner. Use of 5 mM pyridoxine caused an almost complete arrest of cell growth. Pyridoxal was as effective as pyridoxine, but pyridoxamine showed weak inhibitory action. Electron-microscopic examination of control cells revealed large nuclei and cellular membranes with villi, but, in pyridoxine-treated cells, condensed or degraded nuclei were observed. Many vacuoles and cholesterol crystals were widely distributed inside the cellular membrane of pyridoxine-treated cells. One of the vacuoles was identified as a lipid droplet. The DNA ladder was observed in the pyridoxine-treated cells. It is suggested that pyridoxine treatment of FRM cells causes cytolysis of cells by apoptosis.
