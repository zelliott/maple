Osteoprotegerin (OPG) acts as a decoy receptor for receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). OPG regulates bone remodeling and the immune response. The primary objective was to decipher, among human peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBML) that produce OPG, the subset(s) responsible for this synthesis and its regulation. To this end, normal human PBML and CD4-, 8-, 19-, 14-enriched subpopulations were studied in vitro for OPG synthesis. PBML were subjected to adherence and immunomagnetic separation, and OPG expression was analyzed by PCR, northern and western blotting, and ELISA. The antiapoptotic effects of OPG were studied on TRAIL-stimulated RPMI 8226 myeloma cells. OPG was time-dependently produced by primary CD4+ T lymphocytes exclusively. OPG secretion was upregulated by anti-CD3 antibody stimulation or incubation with interleukin (IL)-4, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, GM-CSF, and vitamin D(3). In contrast, IL-10 inhibited the basal and IL-4-induced production of OPG by T cells. Conditioned media from activated T lymphocytes decreased TRAIL-induced apoptosis of RPMI 8226 cells. This effect was reversed by addition of RANKL to the T-cell conditioned media. As human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) targets CD4+ T cells, we evaluated the effects of recombinant HIV-1 gp120 proteins on OPG synthesis. The gp120 from three different HIV-1 strains significantly reduced the basal output of OPG from T cells. Furthermore, all four protease inhibitors (PIs) used in highly active antiretroviral therapy decreased OPG synthesis by human blood T cells, nelfinavir being the most efficient PI. The simultaneous presence of an HIV-1 gp120 and a PI abrogated the basal output of OPG. In conclusion, these results highlight a new role for T lymphocytes involved in pathologies. Activated CD4+ T cells could, through OPG release, have a paracrine effect on adjacent cells and contribute to reduce the local process of bone remodeling and cellular apoptosis.
