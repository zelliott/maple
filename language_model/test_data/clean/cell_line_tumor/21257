TNF plus protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide-induced apoptosis in human myelogenous leukemia ML-1a but not in C19, respiration minus mitochondrial DNA-deficient C19 cells, derived from ML-1a. To investigate how mitochondrial DNA depletion inhibits apoptosis, we investigated AKT. Both AKT and its phosphorylated form were observed only in C19, indicating that depletion of mtDNA increased protein and the active form of AKT. Treatment of C19 with LY294002, which inhibits PI-3 kinase and inhibits AKT, significantly increased apoptosis induction by TNF plus cycloheximide and eliminated phosphorylation of AKT. These results indicate that AKT activation was induced by the depletion of mtDNA and inhibited TNF-induced apoptosis.
