The c-kit protein, also known as CD117, is a member of the type III receptor tyrosine kinase family. Kinase activity has been implicated in the pathophysiology of many tumors, including small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). Autocrine or paracrine activation of c-kit by its ligand has been postulated for lung cancer, but this receptor can also be activated by mutations of the c-kit gene. We examined c-kit expression and mutational status in SCLC to verify its putative expression and genetic alterations, as well as its eventual prognostic impact.

We studied 60 SCLC samples to determine the mutations of the coding region of the gene; the exons 9 and 11 were analyzed by PCR-single-strand conformational polymorphism and automated sequencing. Moreover, c-kit expression was evaluated in 55 samples by immunohistochemical method.

Expression of c-kit was demonstrated in about 40% of SCLC samples. Two mutations in exon 9 and three mutations in exon 11 were found. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed no prognostic significance of c-kit expression for survival.

In our series, the expression of c-kit and its mutational status failed to appear relevant or to have a significant impact on survival; this makes the therapeutic approach with an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase more difficult in SCLC until a sure demonstration of c-kit implication is obtained for this tumor.
