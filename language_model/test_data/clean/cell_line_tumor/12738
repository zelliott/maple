Recent studies have revealed that hScrib, the human homolog of Drosophila Scribble, is an apical-basal polarity determinant and an essential component of the adherens junction. In addition, hScrib has a critical role in the inhibition of cell proliferation through cell cycle progression. hScrib has been reported to be involved in the processes of many cancers, such as breast cancer, cervical cancer, colon carcinoma, etc.; however, the correlation between hScrib and endometrial cancer has not been identified. To address a possible role of hScrib in the development of endometrial cancer, we examined the localization and expression of hScrib in endometrial cancer. The present study demonstrated that decreased expression and changed localization of hScrib were associated with clinical stage, histopathological differentiation, and lymph node metastasis in endometrial cancer. hScrib might share an adherens junction with basolateral membrane partially by acting on E-cadherin in endometrial cancer. This evidence suggests that hScrib is involved in the development of endometrial cancer.
