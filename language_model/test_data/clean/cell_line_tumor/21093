We previously found that selective restriction of amino acids inhibits invasion of two androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell lines, DU145 and PC3. Here we show that the restriction of tyrosine (Tyr) and phenylalanine (Phe), methionine (Met) or glutamine (Gln) modulates the activity of G proteins and affects the balance between two actin-binding proteins, cofilin and profilin, in these two cell lines. Selective amino acid restriction differentially reduces G protein binding to GTP in DU145 cells. Tyr/Phe deprivation reduces the amount of Rho-GTP and Rac1-GTP. Met deprivation reduces the amount of Ras-GTP and Rho-GTP, and Gln deprivation decreases Ras-GTP, Rac-GTP, and Cdc42-GTP. Restriction of these amino acids increases the amount of profilin, cofilin and phosphorylation of cofilin-Ser(3). Increased PAK1 expression and phosphorylation of PAK1-Thr(423), and Ser(199/204) are consistent with the increased phosphorylation of LIMK1-Thr(508). In PC3 cells, Tyr/Phe or Gln deprivation reduces the amount of Ras-GTP, and all of the examined amino acid restrictions reduce the amount of profilin. PAK1, LIMK1 and cofilin are not significantly altered. These data reveal that specific amino acid deprivation differentially affects actin dynamics in DU145 and PC3. Modulation on Rho, Rac, PAK1, and LIMK1 likely alter the balance between cofilin and profilin in DU145 cells. In contrast, profilin is inhibited in PC3 cells. These effects modulate directionality and motility to inhibit invasion.
