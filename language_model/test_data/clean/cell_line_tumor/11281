Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) cloaked by red blood cell membrane (RBCm) confer the combined advantage of both long circulation lifetime and controlled drug release. The authors carried out studies to gain a better understanding of the drug loading, drug-release kinetics and cell-based efficacy of RBCm-cloaked NPs.

Two strategies for loading doxorubicin into the RBCm-cloaked NPs were compared: physical encapsulation and chemical conjugation. In vitro efficacy was examined using the acute myeloid leukemia cell line, Kasumi-1.

It was found that the chemical conjugation strategy resulted in a more sustained drug release profile, and that the RBCm cloak provided a barrier, retarding the outward diffusion of encapsulated drug molecules. It was also demonstrated that RBCm-cloaked NPs exhibit higher toxicity in comparison with free doxorubicin.

These results indicate that the RBCm-cloaked NPs hold great promise to become a valuable drug-delivery platform for the treatment of various diseases such as blood cancers.
