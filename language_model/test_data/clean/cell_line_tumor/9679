Shu-Gan-Liang-Xue Decoction (SGLXD), a cipher prescription of traditional Chinese medicine, has been used to ameliorate hot flushes symptom in breast cancer patients for several decades. However, estrogenic activity of SGLXD is remaining unclear.

To evaluate the estrogenic potential of SGLXD and each of the component herbs; to investigate the effect of SGLXD on cell viability of MCF-7 cells.

We evaluated the estrogenic potential of SGLXD and each of the component herbs with dual-luciferase reporter assay and bioluminescent measurements, by using transient cotransfection with estrogen dependent plasmid pERE-TK-Luc and internal control plasmid pRL-TK in MCF-7 cells. We investigated the effect of SGLXD on cell viability of MCF-7 by MTT assay.

SGLXD and each of the component herbs did not demonstrate estrogenic activity compared to negative control, even at high concentration (p > 0.05). By MTT assay, different concentrations of SGLXD significantly inhibited the growth of MCF-7 cells dose-dependently (p < 0.05).

SGLXD and single herbs do not manifest estrogenic activity, while SGLXD has weak inhibitory effects on MCF-7 cell viability.
