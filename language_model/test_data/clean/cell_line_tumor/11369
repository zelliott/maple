5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is a prodrug for topical photodynamic therapy. The effectiveness of topical ALA can be limited by its bioavailability. The aim of this study was to develop a novel ALA delivery approach using poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs).

A modified double emulsion solvent evaporation method was used to prepare ALA loaded PLGA NPs (ALA PLGA NPs). The characteristics, uptake, protoporphyrin IX fluorescence kinetics, and cytotoxicity of ALA PLGA NPs toward a human skin squamous cell carcinoma cell line were examined.

The mean particle size of spherical ALA PLGA NPs was 65.6 nm±26 nm with a polydispersity index of 0.62. The encapsulation efficiency was 65.8%±7.2% and ALA loading capacity was 0.62%±0.27%. When ALA was dispersed in PLGA NPs, it turned into an amorphous phase. ALA PLGA NPs could be taken up by squamous cell carcinoma cells and localized in the cytoplasm. The protoporphyrin IX fluorescence kinetics and 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay showed that ALA PLGA NPs were more effective than free ALA of the same concentration.

PLGA NPs provide a promising ALA delivery strategy for topical ALA-photodynamic therapy of skin squamous cell carcinoma.
