We tested the methylation status of tazarotine induced gene 1 (TI(G1) in head and neck cancer cell lines and primary tumors by the methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP). MSP showed that the TIG1 promoter was methylated in all cell lines. We then used MSP to check the methylation status of TIG1 in primary head and neck cancer (n = 50). MSP showed TIG1 methylation in 31 (62%) head and neck cancers and no methylation in any normal samples. To confirm MSP results, we directly sequenced dense CpG regions. We found that promoter regions contained methylated cytosines. We thus observed a cancer-specific pattern of TIG1 methylation in primary head and neck cancer. Our results support the notion that promoter methylation is an important mechanism of TIG1 gene inactivation and occurs frequently in head and neck cancer. TIG1 methylation represents a new molecular marker for targeting diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in these cancers.
