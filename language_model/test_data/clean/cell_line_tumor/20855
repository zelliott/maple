This article deals with an in vitro study of the effect of cisplatin and low intensity ultrasound exposure on the viability of human ovarial carcinoma cells A2780. The effect on the viability of 103 cell experimental group samples under the influence of separate and combined cisplatin and ultrasound far field exposure was studied. Viable cells in individual experimental groups were followed at time intervals of 0, 24, 48 and 72 hours following treatment. Another objective of the study was to investigate the effect of the experimental protocol on the combined effect of cisplatin and ultrasound exposure. The effect of the concurrent application of cisplatin and ultrasound exposure was compared with that in which cisplatin was added to the cell suspension after ultrasound exposure. The results of this work confirmed the cytotoxicity of cisplatin and possible stimulation of cancer cells by low intensity ultrasound. However, it was found that ultrasound exposure enhances the action of cisplatin on the viability of A2780 cells and that the effect is dependent on the experimental protocol. In this case the concurrent application of cisplatin and ultrasound was found to be more effective (P < 0.05).
