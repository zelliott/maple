CXCL12 is a chemokine essential for the organ-specific spread of a variety of cancers including small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Here, we examined the anti-metastatic efficacy of TF14016, a small peptidic inhibitor of CXCL12 receptor CXCR4, in SCLC. Treatment of mice with TF14016 significantly suppressed pulmonary metastases of CXCR4-expressing SCLC in size and number. Furthermore, histological examination revealed that the expression of vascular endothelial cell growth factor and the density of CD31-positive microvessels in metastatic foci were both significantly reduced in TF14016-treated mice. Collectively, CXCR4 could be an attractive target for anti-metastatic and anti-angiogenic therapy in SCLC.
