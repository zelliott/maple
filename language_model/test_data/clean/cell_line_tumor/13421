To investigate the effect of eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-N1-NPRL2 on the proliferation,  cell cycle,  apoptosis,  invasion and migration of human gastric carcinoma SGC-7901 cells in vitro.

The eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-N1-NPRL2 was constructed and confirmed by enzyme digestion and sequencing analysis. Then,  it was transfected into SGC-7901 cells via the liposome. The expression of NPRL2  mRNA and protein  was detected by  RT-PCR,   fluorescent microscopy  and Western blotting,   respectively. The proliferation of SGC-7901 was tested by CCK8,  the cell cycle and apoptosis rate by flow cytometry and the effects of NPRL2 on the cell invasion and migration by Transwell (Boyden  Chamber)  assay.

The eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-N1-NPRL2 was constructed successfully and transfected into SGC-7901cells. The expression of green fluorescent protein was observed using a fluorescence microscope and both mRNA and protein of NPRL2 was detectable by RT-PCR and Western blotting,  respectively. CCK8 revealed that the proliferation of SGC-7901 cells were significantly inhibited by NPRL2 ( p<0.05). Flow cytometry indicated that the cells were arrested at G0/G1 phase ( p<0.05) and cell apoptosis was evidently inhibited ( p<0.05). Transwell chamber experiments showed that the abilities of both invasion and migration of the cells decreased by NPRL2 ( p<0.05).

The NPRL2 inhibits the proliferation of human gastric carcinoma SGC-7901 cells,  arrests cell cycle at G0/G1 phase,  decreases the abilities of invasion and migration and promotes apoptosis.
