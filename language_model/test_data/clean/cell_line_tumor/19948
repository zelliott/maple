Dopaminergic human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were stably transformed to increase expression of alpha-synuclein, a Parkinson's disease-related protein. Transformed cells were more resistant to oxidative insults, showing a cytoprotective role of alpha-synuclein. The expression of redox chaperonins (DJ-1, HSP70, and 14-3-3) was evaluated by Western blotting. Expression of alpha-synuclein reduced HSP70 levels even in the presence of dopamine, with a twofold increase of DJ-1 in the absence of oxidants. DJ-1 is significantly reduced by dopamine, and even more by dopamine and Cu(II). Increased alpha-synuclein expression did not affect 14-3-3, although dopamine increased its level by 60% in wild-type cells. alpha-Synuclein not only upregulated DJ-1, but also shifted all DJ-1 forms to a single spot at pI=5.7 not observed in wild-type cells. Dopamine gradually restored the distribution of DJ-1 forms to a situation similar to wild-type cells, with the form at pI=6.1 progressively enriched under oxidative conditions.
