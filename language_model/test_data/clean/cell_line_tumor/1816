67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR) has been identified as a prognostic biomarker for a variety of human cancers. We investigated the clinical significance of 67LR expression and its functional role in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).

67LR expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 62 patients with EOC. We assessed the correlation of 67LR expression with clinical characteristics. In vitro experiment was performed for 67LR with inhibition using siRNA to evaluate its role in cell survival, apoptosis, and invasion in EOC cells.

67LR was predominantly expressed on the cell membrane in the majority of EOC samples (45/62, 73%). 67LR expression was significantly correlated with advanced stage (P=0.001). Patients with 67LR expression had shorter progression-free survival among all the patients (P=0.010) and in particular among patients with advanced stages (P=0.046). When 67LR expression was inhibited by siRNA in EOC cells (HeyA8 and A2780), there was a significant decrease of cell proliferation and invasion as well as increase of apoptosis.

These findings suggest that 67LR expression may play an important role in tumor progression into advanced stage with poor prognosis in EOC and down-regulation of 67LR on tumor cells may be a therapeutic target in those patients.
