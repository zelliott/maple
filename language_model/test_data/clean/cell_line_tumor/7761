Porous nanostructure with its unique properties is found to be able to hold promise in drug delivery. We fabricated the one-dimensional titanium dioxide whiskers (TiO2 Ws) and designed a strategy to explore their drug delivery application and anti-tumor function combined with daunorubicin (DNR). We observed good biocompatibility of TiO2 Ws and noted better photocatalytic activity. In human hepatocarcinoma cells (SMMC-7721 cells), TiO2 Ws can obviously increase the intracellular concentration of DNR and enhance its potential anti-tumor efficiency, indicating TiO2 Ws could produce an efficient drug delivery carrier effect importing DNR into target cells. Furthermore, its photocatalysis further led to the enhanced mortality of cancer cells under UV irradiation. These findings reveal that TiO2 Ws-based delivery of anticancer drugs represents a promising approach in cancer therapy.
