Sarcophine (1) is a bioactive cembranoid diterpene isolated from the Red Sea soft coral Sarcophyton glaucum. Previous semisynthesis attempts resulted in decreased or complete loss of 1's anticancer activity. Sarcophine and analogues showed antimigratory activity against breast and prostate cancer cell lines. This encouraged further semisynthestic optimizations to improve its activity and establish a preliminary structure-activity relationship. Eight new and five known semisynthetic analogues were generated. These compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit growth, proliferation, and migration of the prostate and breast metastatic cancer cell lines PC-3 and MDA-MB-231, respectively. Most analogues exhibited enhanced antimigratory activity.
