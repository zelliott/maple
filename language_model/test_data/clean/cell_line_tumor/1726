A series of 1,2,4-triazole derivatives containing thiosemicarbazone linkage was synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antiamoebic activity against HM1:IMSS strain of Entamoeba histolytica. All the compounds were capable of inhibiting the growth of E. histolytica out of which four compounds (IC(50)=0.28-1.38 μM) were found to have better efficacy than the standard drug Metronidazole (IC(50)=1.8 μM). Cytotoxicity of the active compounds was assessed by MTT assay using human breast cancer MCF-7 cell line, which revealed that all the compounds were low cytotoxic in the concentration range of 2.5-250 μM.
