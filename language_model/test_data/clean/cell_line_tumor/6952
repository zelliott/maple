Cationic solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) have recently been suggested for non-viral gene delivery, as these particles consist of well tolerated substances, can bind DNA directly via electrostatic interactions and mediate gene transfer in vitro. We here report the development of SLN complexes, which can be targeted to specific surface receptors. A formulation of SLN was prepared by the microemulsion technique comprising of stearylamine and the matrix lipid Compritol ATO 888 with a size of approximately 100 nm and a zeta-potential of +15. These SLN are able to condense DNA in complexes, which are very stable under physiological conditions, and they display low cytotoxicity in cell culture. In addition to binding of DNA, the SLN can simultaneously bind substantial amounts of streptavidin directly via electrostatic interactions. The SLN:DNA: streptavidin complexes are stable and are capable of binding biotinylated ligands, which can interact with surface receptors. This method allows for development of a fast and simple method of preparing a targeted non-viral gene therapy vector.
