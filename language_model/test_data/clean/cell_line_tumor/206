C/Si switch: Twofold sila-substitution (C/Si exchange) in the RXR-selective retinoids 4 a (SR11237) and 5 a leads to 4 b (disila-SR11237) and 5 b, respectively. Chemistry and biology of the C/Si pairs are reported.SR11237 (BMS649, 4 a) is a pan-RXR-selective retinoid agonist. Its silicon analogue, disila-SR11237 (4 b; twofold C/Si exchange), was prepared in a multistep synthesis by starting from 1,2-bis(ethynyldimethylsilyl)ethane. In addition, the related C/Si analogues 5 a and 5 b, with an indane (disila-indane) instead of a tetraline (disila-tetraline) skeleton, were synthesized. The C/Si pairs 4 a/4 b and 5 a/5 b were studied for their interaction with retinoid receptors and were demonstrated to be highly potent RXR-selective ("rexinoid") agonists. Interestingly, twofold C/Si exchange in the indane moiety of 5 a resulted in a 10-fold increase in biological activity of the corresponding silicon-containing rexinoid 5 b, possibly resulting from an increased receptor affinity or a divergent allosteric effect on co-regulator-binding surfaces. The crystal structures of the ternary complexes formed by 5 a and 5 b, respectively, with the ligand-binding domain of hRXRalpha and a peptide of the co-activator TIF2/GRIP1 revealed additional interactions of the disila analogue 5 b with the H7 and H11 residues, supporting the first option of increased binding affinity. This is the first demonstration of an increase in binding affinity of a ligand to a nuclear receptor by C/Si replacement, thereby adding this C/Si switch strategy to the repertoire of nuclear receptor ligand design.
