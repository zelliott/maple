We examined the functional role of clusterin in chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and tested whether anti-sense transfection targeted against clusterin enhances the chemosensitivity in human bladder cancer cells in vitro. Clusterin mRNA and protein expression of 253J cells, a human bladder carcinoma cell line, after treatment with cisplatin were measured by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Clusterin expression and cell growth were compared between 253J cells transfected with constructed a clusterin anti-sense plasmid vector (pCR-CLU-AS) and controls. Tumor cell viability was measured with MTT assay after cisplatin treatment. DNA fragmentation and CPP32 assay were performed. Clusterin expression was increased after treatment with cisplatin and highest at 8 h in 253J cells. Clusterin anti-sense transfectants were highly sensitive to apoptotic cell death induced by cisplatin compared with parental 253J cells or control transfectants. Collectively, our results showed that expression of clusterin was increased in the acute phase of cell death caused by cisplatin and that suppressing the expression of clusterin enhanced the susceptibility of apoptosis caused by cisplatin in human bladder cancer cells. These results suggest that lowering the expression of clusterin might increase the sensitivity of bladder cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents.
