Two new tryptamine derivatives, granulatamides A (1) and B (2), were isolated from the 2-propanol extract of the soft coral Eunicella granulata. Their structures were determined on the basis of detailed spectroscopic analysis and comparison with previously published data for similar compounds. Both compounds showed moderate in vitro cytotoxicity against a panel of 16 human tumor cell lines.
