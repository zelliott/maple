2-Deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-d-glucose ([(18)F]FDG), [(18)F]fluoroacetate ([(18)F]FAc) and [(18)F]fluoromisonidazole ([(18)F]FMISO) were all considered to be positron emission tomography (PET) probes for tumor diagnosis, though based on different rationale of tissue uptake. This study compared the biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and imaging of these three tracers in a sarcoma- and inflammation-bearing mouse model.

C3H mice were inoculated with 2x10(5) KHT sarcoma cells in the right thigh on Day 0. Turpentine oil (0.1 ml) was injected in the left thigh on Day 11 to induce inflammatory lesion. Biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and microPET imaging of [(18)F]FMISO, [(18)F]FDG and [(18)F]FAc were performed on Day 14 after tumor inoculation.

The inflammatory lesions were clearly visualized by [(18)F]FDG/microPET and autoradiography at 3 days after turpentine oil injection. The tumor-to-muscle and inflammatory lesion-to-muscle ratios derived from microPET imaging were 6.79 and 1.48 for [(18)F]FMISO, 8.12 and 4.69 for [(18)F]FDG and 3.72 and 3.19 for [(18)F]FAc at 4 h post injection, respectively. Among these, the tumor-to-inflammation ratio was the highest (4.57) for [(18)F]FMISO compared with that of [(18)F]FDG (1.73) and [(18)F]FAc (1.17), whereas [(18)F]FAc has the highest bioavailability (area under concentration of radiotracer vs. time curve, 116.2 hxpercentage of injected dose per gram of tissue).

MicroPET images and biodistribution studies showed that the accumulation of [(18)F]FMISO in the tumor is significantly higher than that in inflammatory lesion at 4 h post injection. [(18)F]FDG and [(18)F]FAc delineated both tumor and inflammatory lesions. Our results demonstrated the potential of [(18)F]FMISO/PET in distinguishing tumor from inflammatory lesion.
