Phytochemicals have been used as potential chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic agents. However, there are data suggesting a mutagenic effect of some phytochemicals. We hypothesized that safrole would have anticancer effects on human oral squamous cell carcinoma HSC-3 cells. Safrole decreased the percentage of viable HSC-3 cells via induction of apoptosis by an increased level of cytosolic Ca(2+) and a reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ(m)). Changes in the membrane potential were associated with changes in the Bax, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, and activation of downstream caspases-9 and -3, resulting in apoptotic cell death. In vivo studies also showed that safrole reduced the size and volume of an HSC-3 solid tumor on a xenograft athymic nu/nu mouse model. Western blotting and flow cytometric analysis studies confirmed that safrole-mediated apoptotic cell death of HSC-3 cells is regulated by cytosolic Ca(2+) and by mitochondria- and Fas-dependent pathways.
