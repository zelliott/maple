Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common malignant tumor of the kidney. Delayed diagnosis may result in progression and metastasis. Markers for early detection of RCC are lacking. The ATP-binding cassette transporter D1 (ABCD1) is located in the human peroxisome membrane. Its mutation causes X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), a peroxisomal disorder affecting lipid storage. The role of ABCD1 in human renal tumorigenesis was unclear. In this study, three pairs of RCC tissues were examined by cDNA microarray and data suggested that ABCD1 mRNA is downregulated. Downregulation of ABCD1 expression was confirmed by real-time PCR. ABCD1 expression was also downregulated in four renal cancer cell lines compared to immortalized benign renal tubular cells. ABCD1 mRNA and protein expression levels assessed by immunohistochemistry in the RCC tissues were similar between genders, tumor grades, and tumor stages. Immunohistochemical assays also showed that ABCD1 expression was significantly higher in normal than in cancerous tissues ( p<0.001). ABCD1 downregulation may be involved in human renal tumorigenesis.
