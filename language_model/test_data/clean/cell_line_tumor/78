A nonmotile, nonspore-forming, Gram-negative, aerobic, small rod-shaped bacterium, isolated from soil, was identified as Chryseobacterium gleum on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. It was observed to grow luxuriously at pH 9 and tolerate highly alkaline environment up to pH 12. Orange red color was a peculiar character of these cells which on purification obtained 60-80 mg/l and found to be sphingosine type of sulfonolipid "sulfobacin A" on the basis of infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectral data. Inhibition of sulfobacin A synthesis by incorporation of L: -cycloserine in culture growth medium suggested presence of serine palmitoyl transferase which is one of the important enzymes involved in its biosynthesis. Sulfobacin A from C. gleum LMG P-22264 exhibited cytotoxicity against four cell lines tested. Maximum activity against human mammary adenocarcinoma cells was indicative of its potential as an anticancer agent.
