Angiogenesis is involved in the growth and metastasis of most solid tumors. Several reports have demonstrated that angiotensin II stimulates growth and migration of certain cancer cell lines and induces angiogenesis through up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor. This study examined whether an angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonist (CV11974) inhibits osteosarcoma progression and distant metastasis.

Osteosarcoma (LM8) was transplanted into subcutaneous dorsal tissue of C3H mice. The mice were administered CV11974 daily by intraperitoneal injections at 0.1 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, or 10 mg/kg, or saline for 28 days.

Subcutaneous tumor size was smaller in the CV11974 treatment groups than in the control group. Lung and liver metastases were significantly reduced in the CV11974 treatment groups when compared with the control group.

CV11974 is widely used to treat hypertension clinically and therefore may be a novel antiangiogenic therapy for osteosarcoma through blocking AT1R-mediated signaling.
