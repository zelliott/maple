To investigate the possibility of prohibitin (PHB) inhibition by lentiviral vector-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) and its influence on cell apoptosis in the retinoic acid-resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB4-R1, a lentiviral vector encoding a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeted against PHB (pGCSIL-GFP-PHB) was constructed and transfected into the packaging cells 293T, and the viral supernatant was collected to transfect NB4-R1 cells. Quantitative real-time fluorescent PCR and western blotting were used to detect the expression levels of PHB. Flow cytometry and detection of enzymatic activity of caspase-3 by western blotting were employed to examine cell apoptosis. Our results provide evidence that the lentiviral vector pGCSIL-GFP-PHB was constructed successfully, and the PHB mRNA and the protein expression inhibitory rates were 90.3 and 95.8%, respectively. When compared to the control group, the activity of caspase-3 decreased significantly, which showed a 57.3% downregulation, and the apoptosis rate was reduced by 44.6% ( p<0.05). In conclusion, downregulation of the PHB gene may inhibit apoptosis of NB4-R1 cells, and it is speculated that this was at least partly due to the downregulation of caspase-3, and PHB may be a novel target for gene therapy for retinoic acid-resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia.
