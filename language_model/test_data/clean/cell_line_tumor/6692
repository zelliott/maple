Recently, we demonstrated that covalent grafting of an endosome-disrupting single histidine functionality in the headgroup region imparts high gene transfer properties to cationic amphiphiles (Kumar, V. V., et al. Gene Ther. 2003, 10, 1206-1215). However, whether covalent attachment of multiple histidine functionalities in the headgroup region are capable of further enhancing the gene transfer efficacies of cationic amphiphiles remains to be explored. To this end, herein, we report on the design, syntheses, physicochemical characterizations, in vitro gene transfer properties, and serum compatibilities of three novel nontoxic cationic transfection amphiphiles containing mono-, di-, and tri-histidine functionalities in their headgroup regions (lipids 1-3) in multiple cultured cells. Significantly, findings in both the reporter gene expression assay and the whole cell histochemical X-gal staining assay support the notion that there is no linear correlation between the in vitro transfection efficacies and the number of histidine functionalities in the polar headgroup regions for histidinylated cationic amphiphiles. The relative gene transfer efficiencies, as well as the serum compatibilities, of the present histidinylated cationic amphiphiles were found to be strikingly dependent on the medium of lipoplex formation. Most importantly, high serum compatibilities (up to 50% added serum) of the lipoplexes of lipids 1 and 3 make them promising nonviral transfection vectors for future systemic applications.
