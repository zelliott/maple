We report the design, synthesis, and structure-activity relationship (SAR) of a series of novel pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-one compounds as potent Abl kinase inhibitors. We evaluate their specificity profile against a panel of human recombinant kinases, as well as their biological profile toward a panel of well-characterized cancer cell lines. Our study reveals that substitutions in the 3- and 4-positions of the phenylamino moiety lead to improved potency and improved selectivity both in target-based and cell-based assays. Altogether, our results provide an insight into the SAR of pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-ones for the development of drug candidates with improved potency and selectivity for the targeted treatment of CML.
