This study dealt with the preparation and characterization of coumarin-6 loaded poly(caprolactone) grafted dextran (PGD) nanoparticles (NPs) and evaluation of cellular uptake by using human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-638), in vitro. The potential application of these PGD NPs for sustained drug delivery was evaluated by the quantification and localization of the cellular uptake of fluorescent PGD NPs. Coumarin-6 loaded PGD NPs were prepared by a modified oil/water emulsion technique and characterized by various physico-chemical methods such as, laser light scattering for particle size and size distribution, atomic force microscopy (AFM), zeta-potential and spectrofluorometry to identify the release of fluorescent molecules from the NPs. SNU-638 was used to measure the cellular uptake of fluorescent PGD NPs. Confocal laser scanning microscopic images clearly showed the internalization of NPs by the SNU-638 cells. Cell viability was assessed by treating the SNU-638 cells with PGD NPs for 48 h. The results reveal, that these biodegradable polymeric NPs holds promise in biomedical field as a carrier.
