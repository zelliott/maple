There is increasing evidence that tumor-associated macrophages promote the malignancy of some cancers. Colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) is expressed by many tumors and is a growth factor for macrophages and mediates osteoclast differentiation. Herein, we report the efficacy of a novel orally active CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) kinase inhibitor, JNJ-28312141, in proof of concept studies of solid tumor growth and tumor-induced bone erosion. H460 lung adenocarcinoma cells did not express CSF-1R and were not growth inhibited by JNJ-28312141 in vitro. Nevertheless, daily p.o. administration of JNJ-28312141 caused dose-dependent suppression of H460 tumor growth in nude mice that correlated with marked reductions in F4/80(+) tumor-associated macrophages and with increased plasma CSF-1, a possible biomarker of CSF-1R inhibition. Furthermore, the tumor microvasculature was reduced in JNJ-28312141-treated mice, consistent with a role for macrophages in tumor angiogenesis. In separate studies, JNJ-28312141 was compared with zoledronate in a model in which MRMT-1 mammary carcinoma cells inoculated into the tibias of rats led to severe cortical and trabecular bone lesions. Both agents reduced tumor growth and preserved bone. However, JNJ-28312141 reduced the number of tumor-associated osteoclasts superior to zoledronate. JNJ-28312141 exhibited additional activity against FMS-related receptor tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3). To more fully define the therapeutic potential of this new agent, JNJ-28312141 was evaluated in a FLT3-dependent acute myeloid leukemia tumor xenograft model and caused tumor regression. In summary, this novel CSF-1R/FLT3 inhibitor represents a new agent with potential therapeutic activity in acute myeloid leukemia and in settings where CSF-1-dependent macrophages and osteoclasts contribute to tumor growth and skeletal events.
