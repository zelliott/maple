We investigated the difference in survivin expression between a multidrug-resistant lung cancer cell line (H460/cDDP) and its parental counterpart (H460) and the influence of siRNA targeting survivin on the chemosensitivity of H460/cDDP. SiRNA targeting survivin was transfected into H460/cDDP cells using a liposome approach. Survivin mRNA and protein expression were significantly higher in H460/cDDP than H460 cells. The median inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) for cisplatin and paclitaxol in vitro against H460/cDDP cells were significantly lower in cells treated with survivin-specific siRNA than in control cells. Apoptosis and cleaved caspase-3 expression were analysed using annexin V and Western blotting, respectively, and showed a significant increase in apoptosis after treatment with the chemotherapeutic agents plus specific siRNA. Specific siRNA sensitized H460/cDDP cells to both cisplatin and paclitaxol. Thus, survivin appears to participate in the multidrug resistance mechanism of H460/cDDP cells and siRNA targeting survivin has the potential to increase the sensitivity of drug-resistant cancer cells to anticancer drugs.
