Human embryonic stem cell-derived dendritic cells (hESC-DCs) may potentially provide a platform to generate "off-the-shelf" therapeutic cancer vaccines. To apply hESC-DCs for cancer immunotherapy in a semiallogeneic setting, it is crucial for these cells to "jump-start" adaptive antitumor immunity before their elimination by host alloreaction. In this study, we investigated whether CD1d upregulation in hESC-DCs may exploit invariant NKT (iNKT) cell adjuvant activity and boost antitumor immunity. Using a baculoviral vector carrying the CD1d gene, we produced CD1d-overexpressing hESC-DCs and demonstrated that the upregulated CD1d was functional in presenting α-galactosylceramide for iNKT cell expansion. Pulsed with melanoma Ag recognized by T cell 1 peptide, the CD1d-overexpressing hESC-DCs displayed enhanced capability to prime CD8(+) T cells without relying on α-galactosylceramide loading. Blocking the CD1d with Ab reduced the immunogenicity, suggesting the importance of hESC-DC and iNKT cell interaction in this context. The CD1d-overexpressing hESC-DCs also induced a proinflammatory cytokine profile that may favor the T cell priming. Moreover, a similar immunostimulatory effect was observed when the CD1d upregulation strategy was applied in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Therefore, our study suggests that the upregulation of CD1d in hESC-DCs provides a novel strategy to enhance their immunogenicity. This approach holds potential for advancing the application of hESC-DCs into human cancer immunotherapy.
