2-Piperazinyl naphthoquinones (2) and 2-piperidinyl naphthoquinones (3) were designed and synthesized as new cytotoxic and apoptosis inducing agents by utilizing the anti-parasite drug atovaquone as lead compound. Several compounds displayed significantly improved cytotoxic activities against a panel of cancer cell lines than that of atovaquone. These compounds also induced apoptosis through activating pro-apoptotic caspases 9 and 3.
