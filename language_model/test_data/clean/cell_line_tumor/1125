To investigate the chromosomal radiosensitivity of lymphocytes in cancer patients the micronucleus (MN) assay is often used and performed on freshly drawn peripheral blood lymphocytes. The use of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines may have a lot of advantages (e.g. large pool of cells) compared with fresh blood samples. In this study we have investigated whether the response of EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines to irradiation in the G1/S/G2 phases of the cell cycle is the same as in concordant whole blood cultures where primary lymphocytes were irradiated in the G0 phase of the cell cycle. For this study the MN assay (2 Gy) was performed on EBV-transformed cell lines of breast cancer patients and a group of healthy women. Those breast cancer patients were selected who showed an elevated chromosomal radiosensitivity in fresh blood samples in a previous study. The results demonstrated that the enhanced chromosomal radiosensitivity observed in fresh blood cultures of breast cancer patients is not present in EBV-transformed cell lines derived from the same blood samples. Therefore, care must be taken when EBV cell lines are used to assess chromosomal radiosensitivity in breast cancer patients.
