The principles and performance are described for the ArrayPlate mRNA assay, a multiplexed mRNA assay for high-throughput and high-content screening and drug development. THP-1 monocytes grown and subjected to compound treatments in 96-well plates were subjected to a multiplexed nuclease protection assay in situ. The nuclease protection assay destroyed all cell-derived mRNA, but left intact stoichiometric amounts of 16 target-specific oligonucleotide probes. Upon transfer of processed cell lysates to a microplate that contained a 16-element oligonucleotide array at the bottom of each well, the various probe species were separated by immobilization at predefined elements of the array. Quantitative detection of array-bound probes was by enzyme-mediated chemiluminescence. A high-resolution charge-coupled device imager was used for the simultaneous readout of all 1536 array elements in a 96-well plate. For the measurement of 16 genes in samples of 25000 cells, the average standard deviation from well to well within a plate was 8.6% of signal intensity and was 10.8% from plate to plate. Assay response was linear and reproducibility was constant for all detected genes in samples ranging from 1000 to 50000 cells. When THP-1 monocytes were differentiated with phorbol ester and subsequently activated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide that contained different concentrations of dexamethasone, dose-dependent effects of dexamethasone on the mRNA levels of several genes were observed.
