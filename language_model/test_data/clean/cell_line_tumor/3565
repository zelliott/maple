Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] is an endogenous peptide hormone of the renin-angiotensin system with vasodilator and anti-proliferative properties. Human adenocarcinoma SK-LU-1 and A549 cells as well as non-small lung cancer SK-MES-1 cells were treated with serum in the presence and absence of Ang-(1-7), to determine whether Ang-(1-7) inhibits the growth of lung cancer cells. Ang-(1-7) caused a significant reduction in serum-stimulated growth in all three lung cancer cell lines. Treatment with Ang-(1-7) resulted in both a dose- and time-dependent reduction in serum-stimulated DNA synthesis in all three cell lines, with IC(50)'s in the sub-nanomolar range. The Ang-(1-7) receptor antagonist [D-Ala(7)]-Ang-(1-7) blocked the attenuation of the serum-stimulated DNA synthesis of SK-LU-1 cells by Ang-(1-7), while neither AT(1) nor AT(2) angiotensin receptor subtype antagonists prevented the response to the heptapeptide. MAS mRNA and protein, a receptor for Ang-(1-7), was detected in the three lung cancer cell lines, suggesting that the anti-proliferative effect of Ang-(1-7) in the cancer cells may be mediated by the non-AT(1), non-AT(2), AT((1-7)) receptor MAS. Other angiotensin peptides [Ang I, Ang II, Ang-(2-8), Ang-(3-8) and Ang-(3-7)] did not attenuate mitogen-stimulated DNA synthesis of SK-LU-1 cells, demonstrating that Ang-(1-7) selectively inhibits SK-LU-1 cancer cell growth. Pre-treatment of SK-LU-1 cells with 10 nM Ang-(1-7) reduced serum-stimulated phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1 and ERK2, indicating that the anti-proliferative effects may occur, at least in part, through inhibition of the ERK signal transduction pathway. The results of this study suggest that Ang-(1-7) inhibits lung cancer cell growth through the activation of an angiotensin peptide receptor and may represent a novel chemotherapeutic and chemopreventive treatment for lung cancer.
